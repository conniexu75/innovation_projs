https://openalex.org/W2752706812,"Mammals have evolved neurophysiologic reflexes, such as coughing and scratching, to expel invading pathogens and noxious environmental stimuli. It is well established that these responses are also associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis. However, the mechanisms by which inflammatory pathways promote sensations such as itch remain poorly understood. Here, we show that type 2 cytokines directly activate sensory neurons in both mice and humans. Further, we demonstrate that chronic itch is dependent on neuronal IL-4Rα and JAK1 signaling. We also observe that patients with recalcitrant chronic itch that failed other immunosuppressive therapies markedly improve when treated with JAK inhibitors. Thus, signaling mechanisms previously ascribed to the immune system may represent novel therapeutic targets within the nervous system. Collectively, this study reveals an evolutionarily conserved paradigm in which the sensory nervous system employs classical immune signaling pathways to influence mammalian behavior."

We used genetic lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and organoid culture approaches to show that Lgr5 and Lgr6, well-known markers of stem cells in epithelial tissues, are markers of mesenchymal cells in the adult lung. Lgr6+ cells comprise a subpopulation of smooth muscle cells surrounding airway epithelia and promote airway differentiation of epithelial progenitors via Wnt-Fgf10 cooperation. Genetic ablation of Lgr6+ cells impairs airway injury repair in vivo. Distinct Lgr5+ cells are located in alveolar compartments and are sufficient to promote alveolar differentiation of epithelial progenitors through Wnt activation. Modulating Wnt activity altered differentiation outcomes specified by mesenchymal cells. This identification of region- and lineage-specific crosstalk between epithelium and their neighboring mesenchymal partners provides new understanding of how different cell types are maintained in the adult lung.

This identification of region- and lineage-specific crosstalk between epithelium and their neighboring mesenchymal partners provides new understanding of how different cell types are maintained in the adult lung. Homeostasis and injury repair of the adult lung epithelium involve the active engagement of epithelial cell populations that reside in distinct anatomical locations. In the distal lung, multiple progenitor populations have been shown to participate in the repair process. The different anatomical locations of diverse epithelial progenitor cells in the lung make it likely that distinct stromal factors regulate the behavior of these cells. However, understanding the precise molecular mechanisms influencing progenitor cells is precluded by limited knowledge of stromal cell identities in the lung. Defining the identities and behavior of lung mesenchymal cells is challenging due to the lack of defined markers for these populations. During lung development, the mesenchymal progenitors undergo regionally distinct differentiation programs, giving rise to airway and vascular smooth muscle, alveolar fibroblasts, endothelium, and pericytes, among others (McCulley et al., 2015McCulley D.

However, the information on the spatial heterogeneity and behavior of mesenchymal cells that impact epithelial progenitors in lung regeneration and repair remains unclear. In the airway epithelium of the adult murine distal lungs, club cells (formerly known as Clara cells) function as progenitors that can both self-renew and produce differentiated ciliated cells at steady state (Rawlins et al., 2009Rawlins E.L. Okubo T. Xue Y. Brass D.M. Auten R.L. Hasegawa H. Wang F. Hogan B.L.

Following airway injury using naphthalene, which abolishes Cyp2f2-expressing club cells, the surviving club cells can divide and regenerate the airway epithelium (Hogan et al., 2014Hogan B.L.

Lineage-tracing approaches showed that cells expressing the club cell marker CCSP, encoded by the Scgb1a1 gene, are also capable of giving rise to alveolar lineage cells following bleomycin-induced alveolar damage (Rock et al., 2011Rock J.R.

Wnt signals function in development and regeneration of the lung (Cardoso and Lü, 2006Cardoso W.V. Lü J.

Recent studies have uncovered a small family of 7-transmembrane receptors, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor-5 (Lgr5) family, comprising Lgr4, Lgr5, and Lgr6 (Clevers et al., 2014Clevers H.

Lgr5 is specifically expressed in epithelial stem cells in multiple tissues, including the intestine, liver, and skin (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M.

Genet. 2008; 40: 1291-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Lgr6 expression has been reported in bipotent skin progenitor cells (Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. Haegebarth A. Kasper M. Jaks V. van Es J.H. Barker N. van de Wetering M. van den Born M. Begthel H. Vries R.G. et al.Lgr6 marks stem cells in the hair follicle that generate all cell lineages of the skin.Science. 2010; 327: 1385-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). More recently, Wnt-responsive cells expressing Lgr5 were reported to be highly proliferative and progressive in lung adenocarcinoma (Tammela et al., 2017Tammela T. Sanchez-Rivera F.J. Cetinbas N.M. Wu K. Joshi N.S. Helenius K. Park Y. Azimi R. Kerper N.R. Wesselhoeft R.A. et al.A Wnt-producing niche drives proliferative potential and progression in lung adenocarcinoma.Nature. 2017; 545: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), lineage tracing, and organoid cultures to characterize adult lung mesenchymal populations marked by Lgr5 and Lgr6. Lgr6-expressing cells were found surrounding bronchiolar epithelia and in the alveolar space, whereas Lgr5-expressing cells were largely alveolar. Ex vivo organoid co-culture of Scgb1a1 lineage-labeled cells with Lgr6-expressing cells revealed the Lgr6+ cells direct airway differentiation of Scgb1a1+ progenitors. In contrast, Lgr5-expressing mesenchymal cells promote alveolar differentiation via activation of Wnt pathway. These results demonstrate that region-specific crosstalk between airway stem cells and adjacent mesenchymal cells is required to maintain proper tissue integrity. To investigate the functional role of Lgr5 and Lgr6 in adult lungs, we characterized Lgr6 expression in the lung using Lgr6-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 knockin mice, in which EGFP marks cells with active expression of the Lgr6 locus (Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. Haegebarth A. Kasper M. Jaks V. van Es J.H. Barker N. van de Wetering M. van den Born M. Begthel H. Vries R.G. et al.Lgr6 marks stem cells in the hair follicle that generate all cell lineages of the skin.Science. 2010; 327: 1385-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, rather than marking epithelial cells, Lgr6-expressing cells were found throughout the lung mesenchyme surrounding the conducting airways. Immunohistochemistry showed that these cells express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (encoded by Acta2), a marker of smooth muscle cells (Figure 1A). Notably, no Lgr6 expression was observed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (arrowhead, Figure 1A). In the alveolar regions, we found scattered EGFP-positive cells (GFP+) that are negative for α-SMA (Figure 1B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that 9.12% ± 1.42% of resident mesenchymal cells (GFP+/CD31−CD45−EpCAM−) express Lgr6 in adult lungs (Figure 1C). qPCR confirmed that these populations robustly express Lgr6 and Acta2. We also detected Lgr5 expression in the Lgr6+ cells, suggesting Lgr6 may mark cell populations expressing Lgr5 (Figure 1D). We next utilized Lgr5-IRES-CreERT2 mice that were crossed to a Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-TdTomato reporter allele (hereafter, Lgr5-CreERT2;R26-Tom) to investigate expression of Lgr5 in adult lungs. In contrast with Lgr6+ cells, the majority of lineage-labeled Lgr5+ cells were located exclusively in the alveolar compartments and none of the lineage-labeled cells were airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) (Figures 1E and 1F). A small number of cells that were negative for α-SMA were found near airways (Figure S1). FACS analysis indicated that 1.24% ± 0.42% of resident lung mesenchymal cells (Tom+/CD31−CD45−EpCAM−) were lineage-labeled by Lgr5 (Figure 1G). In contrast to the high expression level of Lgr5 in Lgr6+ cells, expression of Lgr6 and Acta2 was not highly enriched in the cell populations labeled by Lgr5 (Figures 1D and 1H). These results suggest that Lgr5 and Lgr6 mark distinct mesenchymal lineages in adult lungs; the majority of Lgr6+ cells are ASMCs, whereas Lgr5+ cells are found primarily in the alveolar regions. To characterize the mesenchymal lineages labeled by Lgr5 and Lgr6, we performed scRNA-seq of individual cells isolated from Lgr5-CreERT2;R26-Tom and Lgr6-EGFP-CreERT2 mice (two replicates of each; Figure S2B). We purified single-cell suspensions of dissociated Lgr5+ and Lgr6+ cells by FACS sorting with depletion of endothelial and immune cells (Lgr5, CD31−CD45−CD11b−TER119−Tom+; Lgr6, CD31−CD45−CD11b−TER119−GFP+; Figure 2A). We analyzed profiles from 182 mesenchymal cells that passed strict quality-control thresholds (STAR Methods) and used a community detection clustering algorithm on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) cell graph, created from random subsamples of the data, to identify robust clusters by consensus clustering (STAR Methods).Figure 2Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Distinguishes Various Cell Lineages Labeled by Lgr5 and Lgr6Show full caption(A) Representative profile of FACS-sorted GFP+ populations for Lgr6-expressing cells from Lgr6-EGFP-CreERT2 mice (left) and Tom+ populations for Lgr5-expressing cells from Lgr5-CreERT2;R26-Tom mice post-induction (right) for single-cell RNA sequencing.(B and C) T-stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plot of 182 individual cells isolated in (A) (dots), where cells are either colored by the expression of Lgr5 (B, left) or Lgr6 (B, right; color bar, log2(TPM+1), left) or by their cluster assignment (C).(D) Consensus clustering.

We identified five robust clusters of cell populations with distinct transcriptional programs (clusters A–E; Figures 2B–2D and S2B). Using marker genes known to be expressed in various mesenchymal cells, we distinguished Lgr5- and Lgr6-expressing cell types that are regionally distributed. Specifically, cluster E cells had a distinctive high expression of Lgr6 and Acta2 but low expression of Lgr5, suggesting this is the Lgr6-expressing ASMCs population (Figures 2B–2E, S2B, and S2C). Cells in the cluster also highly expressed various mesenchymal genes, such as Cspg4, Tagln, and Gli1. Clusters B and D cells exhibited enriched expression of Lgr5. Some of the cells in these two clusters showed considerable Lgr6 expression, suggesting that this population contains alveolar mesenchymal cells labeled by Lgr5 and Lgr6 (Figures 2B–2E, S2B, and S2D). A distinct small population, cluster C, highly expresses genes associated with alveolar fibroblasts: Pdgfra; Wnt2; Fgf10; and Vcam1 (Figures 2B–2E, S2B, and S2E). Cells in all clusters expressing Lgr5 or Lgr6 also expressed general mesenchymal markers, such as Col1a1, Vimentin, and Pdgfrb (Figure S2F). Cluster A, a distinct small cluster of cells, expressed the epithelial marker EpCAM and lung epithelial lineage markers, such as Scgb1a1 (club cell marker) and Sftpc (alveolar type II cell marker; Figures 2B–2E, S2B, and S2G). Lineage-tracing studies confirmed that there are rare cells expressing CCSP in lineage-labeled Lgr5+ and Lgr6+ cells (Figures S2H and S2I). Each of the cell populations suggested by cluster analysis expressed a unique gene expression signature (Figures 2D and 2E). Taken together, scRNA-seq analysis shows that the cellular heterogeneity of lung mesenchymal cells expressing Lgr5 and Lgr6 is associated with distinct and separable transcriptional programs. To evaluate the cellular behavior of Lgr6+ cells in adult lungs, we established Lgr6-EGFP-CreERT2;R26-Tom mice. To determine whether lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells contribute to ASMC maintenance, we measured the proportion of lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells that are positive for α-SMA cells over time (Figure 3A). FACS analysis showed that recombination occurred in 62.7% ± 4.3% of Lgr6-expressing cells (Tom+GFP+/GFP+) at 10 days after final Tmx injection (Figure 3B). As shown in Figures 3C and 3D, the proportion of lineage-labeled Lgr6+α-SMA+ ASMCs remained constant over the 12-month chase period. To further explore whether Lgr6+ cells are resting cells or undergo proliferation in the steady state, Lgr6-EGFP-CreERT2;R26-Tom mice were injected with a single low dose of Tmx, which labels only a small proportion of Lgr6+ cells (Figure 3F). Lungs were harvested over 12-month chase period, and sections were analyzed with confocal microscopy for the presence of lineage-labeled cells or clusters that span both peri-airway and alveolar compartments (Figure 3E). Single-labeled peri-airway or alveolar cells were widely distributed at 10 days after Tmx administration (Figure 3G). Notably, after approximately 6 months, a few small clusters of lineage-labeled peri-airway cells were observed. Longer chases, up to 12 months, confirmed that lineage-labeled cells are long lived and can be found in clusters, suggesting that there is a subset of Lgr6+ cells that are capable of proliferation with a slow rate at steady state. The size distribution of clusters became increasingly heterogeneous, but mean clone size and number of cells composed of clusters increased over time, indicating the proliferative potential of lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells (Figures 3H and 3I). At 10 days post-Tmx induction, 92.02% of clones consisted of single-labeled cells (n = 231 clones, 3 mice; Figures 3G–3I). By 6 months, 38.8% of clones were composed of more than one cell, whereas the rest of clones still consisted of single-labeled cells (2 cells, 20.84%; 3 cells, 11.67%; 4 cells, 5.34%; 5–8 cells, 6.22%; n = 212 clones, 3 mice). At 12 months, 51.12% of clones consisted of more than one cell and 21.03% had five or more cells (up to 30 cells; n = 201 clones, 3 mice). Comparison of cell number in each clone indicated that proliferation rates vary among lineage-labeled cells (Figures 3H and 3I). No lineage-labeled clusters were observed in alveolar compartments even after 12 months at steady state (Figure 3G). These data support the hypothesis that Lgr6+ cells contain ASMCs, maintaining the peri-bronchiolar microenvironment in normal lung homeostasis. In addition, Lgr6+ peri-bronchiolar cells expand over time, yet the alveolar Lgr6+ cells appear to be a quiescent cell population in normal tissue homeostasis. We next used a cell-specific injury model compatible with high-resolution imaging to deplete Lgr6+ cells in vivo. We crossed mice with an inducible human diphtheria toxin receptor allele (iDTR) to Lgr6-EGFP-CreERT2;R26-Tom mice; in this system, tamoxifen administration induces expression of DTR, allowing subsequent ablation of Lgr6+ cells by DT treatment (Figure 4A). Two days after final DT injection, successful ablation of Lgr6+ cells was verified by qPCR on whole lungs for DTR mRNA (Figure 4B). In addition, we detected a substantial reduction in lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells after DT administration compared to vehicle by FACS and immunofluorescence (IF) analysis. Whereas 83.1% ± 3.78% of lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells (Tom+GFP+/GFP+) were observed in control animals, only 13.1% ± 0.42% of lineage-labeled cells were detected in the lungs after DT administration, suggesting efficient ablation of Lgr6+ cells (Figure 4C). DT injection decreased α-SMA+ ASMCs yet had no appreciable effect on α-SMA+ VSMCs, indicating that DT caused the specific ablation of Lgr6-labeled cells and not other cell types (Figures 4D and S3A). Despite the extent of Lgr6+ ASMC death, the overall histology of the lung remained remarkably intact at 2, 7, 14, and 28 days post-DT treatment; there was little inflammation and no evidence of airway disruption (Figures 4D, 4F, S3A, and S3C).Figure S3Proliferation of Lgr6-Expressing Cells following Targeted Injury of Lgr6+ Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Representative confocal images showing the specific ablation of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) marked by Lgr6 at 2 days post PBS (upper panels) or DT (lower panels) administration: Tdtomato (red), α-SMA (yellow), GFP (green), and DAPI (blue).

We next asked whether Lgr6+ cells are capable of replacing ablated ASMCs by tracking surviving lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells after depletion. As expected from our earlier long-term lineage-tracing studies, the proportion of lineage-labeled cells remained relatively constant over the chase period in control lungs (Figures 4E and S3B). In the DT-treated group, the initial proportion of lineage-labeled ASMCs was lower, with only 17.46% ± 3.61% of the α-SMA+ ASMCs being labeled at 2 days. This value was slightly increased during repair (Figures 4E and S3B). Notably, all of lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells were GFP positive, indicating the expression of Lgr6 in these cells. A higher proliferation rate of airway epithelial cells was observed in the lungs treated with DT at 2 days post-injection compared with PBS control (Figures 4F, 4G, and S3C). In contrast, a remarkable reduction in lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells was observed at this time point. At 7 days after DT treatment, fewer airway epithelial cells were proliferative, and there was a significant increase in lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells that co-expressed Ki67 (Figures 4F–4H). Of note, Lgr6-expressing cells that were not tagged (Tom−GFP+) are also capable of expansion, whereas none of Tom−GFP−α-SMA+ ASMCs expressed Ki67 (Figure S3D). The proportion of non-lineage-labeled Lgr6+α-SMA+ ASMCs (Tom−GFP+) was also slightly increased over time, whereas that of Lgr6−α-SMA+ ASMCs (Tom−GFP−) was reduced during injury repair (Figure S3B). These data indicate that Lgr6+ ASMCs are more efficient at injury repair compared to Lgr6− ASMCs. Minimal proliferation was observed in these cells at 28 days after cell depletion, suggesting repair being complete around this time. Notably, lineage-labeled small clusters were seen, indicating the expansion in lineage-labeled Lgr6+ASMCs over time (Figure 4F). Together, these results indicate that Lgr6-expressing cells are capable of proliferative expansion after genetic depletion. We next asked whether this expansion would be affected by adjacent airway epithelial cells following targeted injury. Airway secretory cells, including club cells (CD31−CD45−EpCAM+SSEA-1+), were isolated from the PBS- and DT-treated lungs at 7 days after ablation of Lgr6+ cells. qPCR analysis revealed the higher expression levels of Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and Wnt7b, in cells from DT-treated mice than in cells from PBS-treated mice (Figure 4I). Of note, isolated Lgr6+ cells from the same mice showed a significant increase in Axin2 and Ki67 expression post-injury compared to the control cells, suggesting induction of Wnt activation in proliferating Lgr6+ ASMCs following targeted injury (Figure 4J). We next assessed whether Wnt signaling induces proliferation of Lgr6+ cells in vitro. Isolated lineage-labeled Lgr6+ cells were cultured with PBS or Wnt3a. Notably, we observed the remarkable increase of proliferation in lineage-labeled ASMCs, with Wnt3a indicating again that Wnt ligands induce expansion of Lgr6+ cells (Figure 4K). Together, these results strongly suggest that Lgr6-expressing cells are capable of proliferation, at least partially stimulated by Wnt ligands from proliferative airway epithelial cells. To functionally interrogate the interactions between Lgr6+ mesenchymal cells and lung epithelial cells, we utilized a 3D organoid co-culture system (Lee et al., 2014Lee J.H. Bhang D.H. Beede A.

To gain insight into the role of inclusions in pathology and the in situ structure of protein aggregates inside cells, we employ advanced cryo-electron tomography methods to analyze the structure of inclusions formed by polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded huntingtin exon 1 within their intact cellular context. In primary mouse neurons and immortalized human cells, polyQ inclusions consist of amyloid-like fibrils that interact with cellular endomembranes, particularly of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interactions with these fibrils lead to membrane deformation, the local impairment of ER organization, and profound alterations in ER membrane dynamics at the inclusion periphery. These results suggest that aberrant interactions between fibrils and endomembranes contribute to the deleterious cellular effects of protein aggregation. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2754145575,"Following endocytosis into the endosomal network, integral membrane proteins undergo sorting for lysosomal degradation or are retrieved and recycled back to the cell surface. Here we describe the discovery of an ancient and conserved multiprotein complex that orchestrates cargo retrieval and recycling and, importantly, is biochemically and functionally distinct from the established retromer pathway. We have called this complex 'retriever'; it is a heterotrimer composed of DSCR3, C16orf62 and VPS29, and bears striking similarity to retromer. We establish that retriever associates with the cargo adaptor sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) and couples to CCC (CCDC93, CCDC22, COMMD) and WASH complexes to prevent lysosomal degradation and promote cell surface recycling of α5β1 integrin. Through quantitative proteomic analysis, we identify over 120 cell surface proteins, including numerous integrins, signalling receptors and solute transporters, that require SNX17-retriever to maintain their surface levels. Our identification of retriever establishes a major endosomal retrieval and recycling pathway."

We used a novel HPV whole-genome sequencing technique to evaluate an exceptionally large collection of 5,570 HPV16-infected case-control samples to determine whether viral genetic variation influences risk of cervical precancer and cancer. We observed thousands of unique HPV16 genomes; very few women shared the identical HPV16 sequence, which should stimulate a careful re-evaluation of the clinical implications of HPV mutation rates, transmission, clearance, and persistence. In case-control analyses, HPV16 in the controls had significantly more amino acid changing variants throughout the genome. Strikingly, E7 was devoid of variants in precancers/cancers compared to higher levels in the controls; we confirmed this in cancers from around the world. Strict conservation of the 98 amino acids of E7, which disrupts Rb function, is critical for HPV16 carcinogenesis, presenting a highly specific target for etiologic and therapeutic research."

https://openalex.org/W2752405730,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway comprises multiple ligands and receptors that interact promiscuously with one another and typically appear in combinations. This feature is often explained in terms of redundancy and regulatory flexibility, but it has remained unclear what signal-processing capabilities it provides. Here, we show that the BMP pathway processes multi-ligand inputs using a specific repertoire of computations, including ratiometric sensing, balance detection, and imbalance detection. These computations operate on the relative levels of different ligands and can arise directly from competitive receptor-ligand interactions. Furthermore, cells can select different computations to perform on the same ligand combination through expression of alternative sets of receptor variants. These results provide a direct signal-processing role for promiscuous receptor-ligand interactions and establish operational principles for quantitatively controlling cells with BMP ligands. Similar principles could apply to other promiscuous signaling pathways."

We present a predictive model of the immune component of IBD that informs causal relationships among loci previously linked to IBD through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using functional and regulatory annotations that relate to the cells, tissues, and pathophysiology of IBD. Our model consists of individual networks constructed using molecular data generated from intestinal samples isolated from three populations of patients with IBD at different stages of disease. We performed key driver analysis to identify genes predicted to modulate network regulatory states associated with IBD, prioritizing and prospectively validating 12 of the top key drivers experimentally. This validated key driver set not only introduces new regulators of processes central to IBD but also provides the integrated circuits of genetic, molecular, and clinical traits that can be directly queried to interrogate and refine the regulatory framework defining IBD."

CQRs are established with the purpose of monitoring quality of care, providing feedback, benchmarking performance, describing pattern of treatment, reducing variation and as a tool for conducting research.To synthesise the impact of clinical quality registries (CQRs) as an 'intervention' on (I) mortality/survival; (II) measures of outcome that reflect a process or outcome of health care; (III) health care utilisation; and (IV) healthcare-related costs.The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL and Google Scholar. In addition, a review of the grey literature and a reference check of citations and reference lists within articles was undertaken to identify relevant studies in English covering the period January 1980 to December 2016. The PRISMA-P methodology, checklist and standard search strategy using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and structured data extraction tools were used. Data on study design and methods, participant characteristics attributes of included registries and impact of the registry on outcome measures and/or processes of care were extracted.We identified 30102 abstracts from which 75 full text articles were assessed and finally 17 articles were selected for synthesis. Out of 17 studies, six focused on diabetes care, two on cardiac diseases, two on lung diseases and others on organ transplantations, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcer healing, surgical complications and kidney disease. The majority of studies were ""before after"" design (#11) followed by cohort design (#2), randomised controlled trial (#2), experimental non randomised study and one cross sectional comparison. The measures of impact of registries were multifarious and included change in processes of care, quality of care, treatment outcomes, adherence to guidelines and survival. Sixteen of 17 studies demonstrated positive findings in their outcomes after implementation of the registry.Despite the large number of published articles using data derived from CQRs, few have rigorously evaluated the impact of the registry as an intervention on improving health outcomes. Those that have evaluated this impact have mostly found a positive impact on healthcare processes and outcomes.PROSPERO CRD42015017319."

We apply this 'interactome mapping by high-throughput quantitative proteome analysis' (IMAHP) method to a panel of 41 breast cancer cell lines and show that deviations of the observed protein co-regulations in specific cell lines from the consensus network affects cellular fitness. Furthermore, these aberrant interactions serve as biomarkers that predict the drug sensitivity of cell lines in screens across 195 drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2756358680,"Microsatellites (MSs) are tracts of variable-length repeats of short DNA motifs that exhibit high rates of mutation in the form of insertions or deletions (indels) of the repeated motif. Despite their prevalence, the contribution of somatic MS indels to cancer has been largely unexplored, owing to difficulties in detecting them in short-read sequencing data. Here we present two tools: MSMuTect, for accurate detection of somatic MS indels, and MSMutSig, for identification of genes containing MS indels at a higher frequency than expected by chance. Applying MSMuTect to whole-exome data from 6,747 human tumors representing 20 tumor types, we identified >1,000 previously undescribed MS indels in cancer genes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the number and pattern of MS indels can accurately distinguish microsatellite-stable tumors from tumors with microsatellite instability, thus potentially improving classification of clinically relevant subgroups. Finally, we identified seven MS indel driver hotspots: four in known cancer genes (ACVR2A, RNF43, JAK1, and MSH3) and three in genes not previously implicated as cancer drivers (ESRP1, PRDM2, and DOCK3)."
https://openalex.org/W2755856084,"Background Rotavirus is a leading cause of diarrhoeal mortality in children but there is considerable disagreement about how many deaths occur each year. Methods and findings We compared CHERG, GBD and WHO/CDC estimates of age under 5 years (U5) rotavirus deaths at the global, regional and national level using a standard year (2013) and standard list of 186 countries. The global estimates were 157,398 (CHERG), 122,322 (GBD) and 215,757 (WHO/CDC). The three groups used different methods: (i) to select data points for rotavirus-positive proportions; (ii) to extrapolate data points to individual countries; (iii) to account for rotavirus vaccine coverage; (iv) to convert rotavirus-positive proportions to rotavirus attributable fractions; and (v) to calculate uncertainty ranges. We conducted new analyses to inform future estimates. We found that acute watery diarrhoea was associated with 87% (95% CI 83–90%) of U5 diarrhoea hospitalisations based on data from 84 hospital sites in 9 countries, and 65% (95% CI 57–74%) of U5 diarrhoea deaths based on verbal autopsy reports from 9 country sites. We reanalysed data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) and found 44% (55% in Asia, and 32% in Africa) rotavirus-positivity among U5 acute watery diarrhoea hospitalisations, and 28% rotavirus-positivity among U5 acute watery diarrhoea deaths. 97% (95% CI 95–98%) of the U5 diarrhoea hospitalisations that tested positive for rotavirus were entirely attributable to rotavirus. For all clinical syndromes combined the rotavirus attributable fraction was 34% (95% CI 31–36%). This increased by a factor of 1.08 (95% CI 1.02–1.14) when the GEMS results were reanalysed using a more sensitive molecular test. Conclusions We developed consensus on seven proposals for improving the quality and transparency of future rotavirus mortality estimates."

However, information collected to date varies across experiments, and further studies are needed to identify consistent relationships between parasites and commensal microbial species. Here, we explore the qualitative and quantitative differences between the microbial community profiles of cohorts of human volunteers from Sri Lanka with patent infection by one or more parasitic nematode species (H+), as well as that of uninfected subjects (H-) and of volunteers who had been subjected to regular prophylactic anthelmintic treatment (Ht). High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, followed by bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of sequence data revealed no significant differences in alpha diversity (Shannon) and richness between groups (P = 0.65, P = 0.13 respectively); however, beta diversity was significantly increased in H+ and Ht when individually compared to H-volunteers (P = 0.04). Among others, bacteria of the families Verrucomicrobiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae showed a trend towards increased abundance in H+, whereas the Leuconostocaceae and Bacteroidaceae showed a relative increase in H- and Ht respectively. Our findings add valuable knowledge to the vast, and yet little explored, research field of parasite—microbiota interactions and will provide a basis for the elucidation of the role such interactions play in pathogenic and immune-modulatory properties of parasitic nematodes in both human and animal hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2721965856,"Regulation is central to the functional versatility of cytoplasmic dynein, a motor involved in intracellular transport, cell division, and neurodevelopment. Previous work established that Lis1, a conserved regulator of dynein, binds to its motor domain and induces a tight microtubule-binding state in dynein. The work we present here—a combination of biochemistry, single-molecule assays, and cryoelectron microscopy—led to the surprising discovery that Lis1 has two opposing modes of regulating dynein, being capable of inducing both low and high affinity for the microtubule. We show that these opposing modes depend on the stoichiometry of Lis1 binding to dynein and that this stoichiometry is regulated by the nucleotide state of dynein’s AAA3 domain. The low-affinity state requires Lis1 to also bind to dynein at a novel conserved site, mutation of which disrupts Lis1’s function in vivo. We propose a new model for the regulation of dynein by Lis1."
https://openalex.org/W2755903087,"Melissa Gymrek and colleagues estimate mutation parameters for each short tandem repeat (STR) in the human genome. They find that local sequence features impact these estimates and they create a framework for measuring constraint at STRs by comparing observed and expected mutation rates, providing a tool for prioritizing pathogenic variants. Identifying regions of the genome that are depleted of mutations can distinguish potentially deleterious variants. Short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as microsatellites, are among the largest contributors of de novo mutations in humans. However, per-locus studies of STR mutations have been limited to highly ascertained panels of several dozen loci. Here we harnessed bioinformatics tools and a novel analytical framework to estimate mutation parameters for each STR in the human genome by correlating STR genotypes with local sequence heterozygosity. We applied our method to obtain robust estimates of the impact of local sequence features on mutation parameters and used these estimates to create a framework for measuring constraint at STRs by comparing observed versus expected mutation rates. Constraint scores identified known pathogenic variants with early-onset effects. Our metric will provide a valuable tool for prioritizing pathogenic STRs in medical genetics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2755782192,"Most anticancer therapies to date focus on druggable features of tumor epithelia. Despite the increasing repertoire of treatment options, patient responses remain varied. Moreover, tumor resistance and relapse remain persistent clinical challenges. These observations imply an incomplete understanding of tumor heterogeneity. The tumor microenvironment is a major determinant of disease progression and therapy outcome. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the dominant cell type within the reactive stroma of tumors. They orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus exacerbating the hallmarks of cancer and accelerating tumor malignancy. Although CAF-derived soluble factors have been investigated for tumor stroma-directed therapy, the underlying transcriptional programs that enable the oncogenic functions of CAFs remain poorly understood. Nuclear receptors (NRs), a large family of ligand-responsive transcription factors, are pharmacologically viable targets for the suppression of CAF-facilitated oncogenesis. In this study, we defined the expression profiles of NRs in CAFs from clinical cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) biopsies. We further identified a cluster of driver NRs in CAFs as important modifiers of CAF function with profound influence on cancer cell invasiveness, proliferation, drug resistance, energy metabolism and oxidative stress status. Importantly, guided by the NR profile of CAFs, retinoic acid receptor β and androgen receptor antagonists were identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin, resulting in the inhibition of chemoresistance in recurred SCC:CAF xenografts. Our work demonstrates that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy."

Drugs of abuse are thought to usurp normal learning and memory in brain circuits involved in motivation, reinforcement, and decision making (Hyman, 2005Hyman S.E. Addiction: a disease of learning and memory.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2005; 162: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Long-lasting synaptic changes are required for learning and memory processes, which in part depend on the local translation of proteins at dendrites (Buffington et al., 2014Buffington S.A. Huang W. Costa-Mattioli M. Translational control in synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37: 17-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A major contributor to the local translation of synaptic proteins is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) (Buffington et al., 2014Buffington S.A. Huang W. Costa-Mattioli M. Translational control in synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction.Annu. Rev.

Blenis J. Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). Activation of signaling pathways, predominantly the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, activates mTORC1 (Ma and Blenis, 2009Ma X.M. Blenis J. Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP), and these phosphorylation events promote the assembly of the translation initiation complex to initiate cap-dependent mRNA translation (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009Sonenberg N.

However, how mTORC1 signaling regulates synaptic functions, especially in the context of addiction, is not entirely clear. Furthermore, knowledge regarding the translation profile of mTORC1 in the central nervous system (CNS) is limited. We previously found that excessive alcohol consumption activates the PI3K/AKT pathway in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rodents resulting in the activation of mTORC1 (Beckley et al., 2016Beckley J.T.

Finally, we identified a role for mTORC1 in the reconsolidation of alcohol seeking memories (Barak et al., 2013Barak S. Liu F. Ben Hamida S. Yowell Q.V. Neasta J. Kharazia V. Janak P.H. Ron D.

Together, these data suggest that mTORC1 plays a central role in neuroadaptations underlying alcohol-drinking behaviors. Here, we set to identify downstream transducers of mTORC1 in the NAc that drive and maintain alcohol-dependent behavioral phenotypes. To do so, we isolated polysomes, which contain mRNAs actively undergoing translation (del Prete et al., 2007del Prete M.J. Vernal R. Dolznig H. Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Isolation of polysome-bound mRNA from solid tissues amenable for RT-PCR and profiling experiments.RNA. 2007; 13: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), from the NAc of mice that have been consuming large amounts of alcohol for 8 weeks and utilized a high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to identify mRNAs whose translation is increased by alcohol in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Among the identified candidates was Prosap2-interacting protein 1 (Prosapip1). Prosapip1 is a brain-specific protein that is highly enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of hippocampal neurons (Wendholt et al., 2006Wendholt D. Spilker C. Schmitt A. Dolnik A. Smalla K.H.

Prosapip1 belongs to the Fezzin family of proteins, all of which contain a Fez domain and a coiled-coil domain enabling the formation of homo- and heterodimers (Reim et al., 2016Reim D. Weis T.M.

Here, we report that Prosapip1 contributes to synaptic and structural modification in NAc neurons and, by doing so, the protein plays an important role in alcohol reward-seeking behaviors. To identify novel mTORC1-dependent mRNAs whose translation is induced in response to heavy alcohol use, mice underwent an intermittent access to 20% alcohol in a 2-bottle choice (IA20%-2BC) paradigm for 8 weeks during which animals consumed large quantities of alcohol (17.08 ± 0.53 g/kg/24 hr). Control animals had free access to water only. Three hours before the end of the last 24-hr alcohol withdrawal session, mice were systemically administered with vehicle or the specific inhibitor of mTORC1, rapamycin (Li et al., 2014Li J. Kim S.G. Blenis J. Rapamycin: one drug, many effects.Cell Metab. 2014; 19: 373-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The NAc was removed 24 hr after the end of the last drinking session, polysomes were purified, and Illumina high-throughput RNA-seq was performed (Figure 1A). RNA-seq analysis revealed 421 transcripts whose translation was increased by alcohol by at least 1.5-fold in the “Alcohol/Vehicle” group compared to the “Water/Vehicle” group. Among those, 12 transcripts exhibited a >1.25-fold decrease in translation in the “Alcohol/Rapamycin” group compared to “Alcohol/Vehicle” group (Table 1). RNA-seq data of four transcripts (Figure 1B) were then confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1C). Specifically, alcohol increased the polysomal mRNA content of the brain-specific secretory peptide TAFA-3 (Fischer et al., 2012Fischer C. Christ E. Korf H.W. von Gall C.

We chose to follow upon the candidate transcript, Prosapip1, which we found to be highly expressed in the striatum (Figure S1A). To determine whether the increases in Prosapip1 in the polysomal fraction were due solely to increased translation, we compared the level of the Prosapip1 mRNA in the polysomal fraction versus the total mRNA levels. We found that binge drinking of alcohol increased Prosapip1 levels only in the polysomal fraction, whereas the total mRNA quantity was unaltered (Figures 2A and 2B ). Rapamycin did not alter the total mRNA levels of Prosapip1 in the presence or absence of alcohol (Figure S1B), indicating that alcohol induced an increase in Prosapip1 translation without a change at the transcriptional level. In addition, rapamycin, even at a high dose (40 mk/kg), did not alter the translation of Prosapip1 in water-only-consuming animals (Figure S1C), suggesting that long-term alcohol intake that activates mTORC1 in the NAc (Laguesse et al., 2016Laguesse S. Morisot N. Phamluong K. Ron D. Region specific activation of the AKT and mTORC1 pathway in response to excessive alcohol intake in rodents.Addict.

USA. 2010; 107: 20093-20098Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) is a prerequisite for mTORC1-dependent translation of Prosapip1. Next, we tested whether the increase in the polysomal mRNA of Prosapip1 corresponds with an increase in the level of the protein. As Prosapip1 is enriched in the PSD (Wendholt et al., 2006Wendholt D. Spilker C. Schmitt A. Dolnik A. Smalla K.H. Proepper C. Bockmann J. Sobue K. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. Boeckers T.M. ProSAP-interacting protein 1 (ProSAPiP1), a novel protein of the postsynaptic density that links the spine-associated Rap-Gap (SPAR) to the scaffolding protein ProSAP2/Shank3.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13805-13816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we analyzed its protein levels in both the total homogenate and in the crude synaptosomal fraction. As shown in Figures 2C and 2D, binge drinking of alcohol increased the protein levels of Prosapip1 in both the total homogenate and the synaptosomal fraction, an increase that was maintained even after 24 hr of withdrawal (Figures 2E and 2F). Prosapip1 levels were not elevated in response to the consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol (Figure S2A), suggesting that alcohol exposure per se does not affect Prosapip1 expression, but rather the high level of intake, accompanied by cycles of binge and withdrawal periods. We further measured Prosapip1 levels in the NAc of mice consuming other rewarding solutions saccharin and sucrose and observed no change in the level of the protein as compared to water only drinking mice (Figures S2B and S2C), suggesting that the alcohol-dependent increase in Prosapip1 translation is not a common mechanism shared by other rewarding substances. To test for brain region specificity, we measured the level of the protein in the two other striatal regions, the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). In line with the observation that alcohol does not activate mTORC1 in the DMS and DLS (Laguesse et al., 2016Laguesse S. Morisot N. Phamluong K. Ron D. Region specific activation of the AKT and mTORC1 pathway in response to excessive alcohol intake in rodents.Addict. Biol. 2016; (Published online October 20, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1111/adb.12464Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Prosapip1 levels were unaltered by alcohol in either striatal regions (Figures S2D and S2E). Together, these data suggest that the translation of Prosapip1 is selectively induced in the NAc in response to chronic intermittent consumption of high levels of alcohol. In hippocampal neurons, Prosapip1 interacts with members of the spine-associated RapGAP (SPAR) proteins, which also reside in the PSD (Reim et al., 2016Reim D. Weis T.M. Halbedl S. Delling J.P. Grabrucker A.M. Boeckers T.M. Schmeisser M.J. The Shank3 Interaction Partner ProSAPiP1 Regulates Postsynaptic SPAR Levels and the Maturation of Dendritic Spines in Hippocampal Neurons.Front.

ProSAP-interacting protein 1 (ProSAPiP1), a novel protein of the postsynaptic density that links the spine-associated Rap-Gap (SPAR) to the scaffolding protein ProSAP2/Shank3.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13805-13816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that Prosapip1 associates with SPAR in Neuroblastoma 2A (N2A) cells (Figures S3A–S3D), and found that the association of Prosapip1 and SPAR is also detected in the NAc (Figures S3E and S3F). SPAR is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rap, a small G protein that participates in the reorganization of actin (Spilker and Kreutz, 2010Spilker C. Kreutz M.R. RapGAPs in brain: multipurpose players in neuronal Rap signalling.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that Prosapip1 may play a role in actin dynamics. To test this possibility, we transfected N2A cells with a plasmid expressing Prosapip1 or a plasmid expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequence targeting the Prosapip1 transcript (shProsapip1), and measured the amount of Globular actin (G-actin) versus Filamentous actin (F-actin) following gene manipulation. We found that overexpression of Prosapip1 increased (Figure 3A), whereas downregulation of the protein decreased (Figure 3B) F-actin content. These data suggest that Prosapip1 promotes F-actin assembly. Next, to test the consequences of Prosapip1 manipulation on actin dynamics in vivo, the NAc of mice was infected with a lentivirus (Ltv) expressing Prosapip1 (Ltv-Prosapip1) or a control virus expressing GFP only (Ltv-CTL), and a lentivirus expressing shProsapip1 (Ltv-shProsapip1) or a scrambled sequence control (Ltv-SCR) (Figure S4), and the relative amounts of F- and G-actin were measured. We found that overexpression of Prosapip1 in the NAc significantly increased F-actin content at the expense of G-actin (Figure 3C), whereas Prosapip1 knockdown led to a decrease in F-actin and an increase in G-actin content (Figure 3D). Together, these data suggest that Prosapip1 in the NAc plays a prominent role in actin dynamics. Next, we postulated that alcohol alters F-actin dynamics via Prosapip1. We therefore analyzed the F/G actin ratio in the NAc of mice after binge drinking of alcohol. As shown in Figure 3E, alcohol significantly increased F-actin content in the NAc of mice consuming alcohol compared to water controls. In order to determine whether excessive alcohol drinking increases F-actin content via Prosapip1, we measured F- and G-actin ratio in the NAc of mice exposed to alcohol and infected with Ltv-shProsapip1 or Ltv-SCR. To avoid any bias that could result from a reduced amount of alcohol voluntary consumed by mice infected with Ltv-shProsapip1, mice underwent 2 weeks of non-contingent chronic intermittent exposure (CIE) to alcohol vapor (Becker and Lopez, 2004Becker H.C. Lopez M.F. Increased ethanol drinking after repeated chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal experience in C57BL/6 mice.Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2004; 28: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (Figure S5A). First, we confirmed that 2 weeks of CIE exposure to alcohol activates mTORC1 and increase Prosapip1 levels in the NAc as compared to control mice (Figure S5B). We then analyzed the G-actin and F-actin content after CIE exposure in mice infected with Ltv-shProsapip1 or Ltv-SCR. As shown in Figure 3F, we found that shProsapip1 counteracted the increase in F-actin content induced by alcohol, with F- and G-actin levels similar to the air exposed controls. Together, these data suggest that Prosapip1 is required for the formation of actin filaments and that alcohol consumption increases F-actin content in the NAc via Prosapip1. Dendritic spines contain a highly dense mesh of actin filaments (Hotulainen and Hoogenraad, 2010Hotulainen P. Hoogenraad C.C. Actin in dendritic spines: connecting dynamics to function.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The head and the tip of the spine contain branched actin filaments, whereas the spine neck contains long loosely arranged filaments (Hotulainen and Hoogenraad, 2010Hotulainen P. Hoogenraad C.C. Actin in dendritic spines: connecting dynamics to function.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Spine enlargement depends on F-actin assembly and stabilization, while spine shrinkage and elimination require F-actin disassembly (Cingolani and Goda, 2008Cingolani L.A. Goda Y. Actin in action: the interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic efficacy.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 344-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Given that Prosapip1 plays a role in F-actin assembly and that excessive alcohol drinking promotes the formation of actin filaments via Prosapip1, we hypothesized that the consequences of alcohol-dependent alterations in actin dynamics are morphological modifications at dendrites, which depend on Prosapip1. Following 4 weeks of IA20%-2BC paradigm, the NAc of alcohol- or water-consuming mice was infected bilaterally with a low titer (1 × 105 pg/mL) of Ltv-shProsapip1 or Ltv-SCR. Following 1 week of recovery, IA20%-2BC was resumed for 3 weeks (Figure 4A). The low viral titer was used in order to avoid bias resulting from potential reduction in alcohol intake in response to Prosapip1 knockdown in the NAc. Infusion of Ltv-shProsapip1 at a low titer did not affect alcohol intake as measured 3 weeks following surgery (Ltv-SCR: 15.1 ± 1.57 g/kg/24 hr; Ltv-shProsapip1: 14.5 ± 0.97 g/kg/24 hr; t(7) = 0.26, p = 0.80). Low titer infection also allowed the labeling of a low number of neurons, ensuring the imaging and analysis of dendritic segments bearing spines (Figure S6A). Sholl analysis revealed no change in the length (Figure S6B) or complexity (Figures S6C–S6E) of the dendritic branches among the four conditions. We then analyzed dendritic spines characteristics. Figure 4B shows representative images of a third-order dendritic branch of infected neurons bearing dendritic spines of the four conditions (Water/Ltv-SCR, Water/Ltv-shProsapip1, Alcohol/Ltv-SCR, Alcohol/Ltv-shProsapip1). Spine density (Figure S6F) and spine length (Figure S6G) were not significantly different between the four groups. However, knockdown of Prosapip1 significantly reduced the spine area (Figure 4C, Water, Ltv-SCR versus Ltv-shProsapip1), suggesting that as predicted, Propapip1 in the NAc plays a role in dendritic spine morphology. Alcohol intake significantly increased the spine area (Figure 4C, Water Ltv-SCR versus Alcohol Ltv-SCR), and importantly, knockdown of Prosapip1 in the presence of alcohol rescued the alcohol-dependent phenotype (Figure 4C, Alcohol Ltv-SCR versus Alcohol Ltv-shProsapip1). These changes observed in spine area were not the result of different levels of GFP in dendritic spines, as GFP intensities in the parent dendritic branch were identical across groups (Figure S6H). Dendritic spines can be classified into four subclasses: filopodia-, thin-, stubby-, and mushroom-type spines (Kasai et al., 2003Kasai H. Matsuzaki M. Noguchi J. Yasumatsu N. Nakahara H. Structure-stability-function relationships of dendritic spines.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). We found that downregulation of Prosapip1 in the NAc increased the number of thin- and filopodia-type spines and decreased the number of mushroom spines (Figure 4D, Water, Ltv-SCR versus Ltv-shProsapip1). Alcohol consumption resulted in an opposite pattern: increased proportion of mushroom-type spines at the expense of thin spines (Figure 4D, Water Ltv-SCR versus Alcohol Ltv-SCR). Importantly, the alcohol-mediated changes in spine structure were not observed in the NAc of mice infected with Ltv-shProsapip1 (Figure 4C, Alcohol Ltv-SCR versus Alcohol Ltv-shProsapip1).

https://openalex.org/W2754002231,"Mucin-4 (Muc4) is a large cell surface glycoprotein implicated in the protection and lubrication of epithelial structures. Previous studies suggest that aberrantly expressed Muc4 can influence the adhesiveness, proliferation, viability and invasiveness of cultured tumor cells, as well as the growth rate and metastatic efficiency of xenografted tumors. Although it has been suggested that one of the major mechanisms by which Muc4 potentiates tumor progression is via its engagement of the ErbB2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, other mechanisms exist and remain to be delineated. Moreover, the requirement for endogenous Muc4 for tumor growth progression has not been previously explored in the context of gene ablation. To assess the contribution of endogenous Muc4 to mammary tumor growth properties, we first created a genetically engineered mouse line lacking functional Muc4 (Muc4ko), and then crossed these animals with the NDL (Neu DeLetion mutant) model of ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis. We observed that Muc4ko animals are fertile and develop normally, and adult mice exhibit no overt tissue abnormalities. In tumor studies, we observed that although some markers of tumor growth such as vascularity and cyclin D1 expression are suppressed, primary mammary tumors from Muc4ko/NDL female mice exhibit similar latencies and growth rates as Muc4wt/NDL animals. However, the presence of lung metastases is markedly suppressed in Muc4ko/NDL mice. Interestingly, histological analysis of lung lesions from Muc4ko/NDL mice revealed a reduced association of disseminated cells with platelets and white blood cells. Moreover, isolated cells derived from Muc4ko/NDL tumors interact with fewer blood cells when injected directly into the vasculature or diluted into blood from wild type mice. We further observed that blood cells more efficiently promote the viability of non-adherent Muc4wt/NDL cells than Muc4ko/NDL cells. Together, our observations suggest that Muc4 may facilitate metastasis by promoting the association of circulating tumor cells with blood cells to augment tumor cell survival in circulation."

In vivo models in which these genetic alterations occur in adult animals may more accurately reflect the features of human cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that inactivation of Cdkn2b (p15ink4b) is necessary for induction of pancreatic cancer by oncogenic KRASG12D expression and inactivation of Tp53 and Cdkn2a in adult mouse pancreatic ductal cells (P60 or older). KRASG12D overexpression in these cells activated transforming growth factor-β signaling and expression of CDKN2B, which, along with CDKN2A, led to cellular senescence and protected cells from KRAS-mediated transformation via inhibition of retinoblastoma phosphorylation. These results show a critical role of CDKN2B inactivation in pancreatic carcinogenesis, and provide a useful adult animal model by genetic engineering via lentiviral delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2754858561,"The Anseriformes is a well-known and widely distributed bird order, with more than 150 species in the world. This paper aims to revise the classification, determine the phylogenetic relationships and diversification patterns in Anseriformes by exploring the Cyt b, ND2, COI genes and the complete mitochondrial genomes (mito-genomes). Molecular phylogeny and genetic distance analyses suggest that the Dendrocygna species should be considered as an independent family, Dendrocygnidae, rather than a member of Anatidae. Molecular timescale analyses suggests that the ancestral diversification occurred during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (58 ~ 50 Ma). Furthermore, diversification analyses showed that, after a long period of constant diversification, the median initial speciation rate was accelerated three times, and finally increased to approximately 0.3 sp/My. In the present study, both molecular phylogeny and diversification analyses results support that Anseriformes birds underwent rapid and recent diversification in their evolutionary history, especially in modern ducks, which show extreme diversification during the Plio-Pleistocene (~ 5.3 Ma). Therefore, our study support that the Plio-Pleistocene climate fluctuations are likely to have played a significant role in promoting the recent diversification for Anseriformes."

By examining the regulation of the transcription factor NFIA in the developing spinal cord, we identified long-range enhancers that recapitulate NFIA expression across glial and neuronal lineages in vivo. Complementary genetic studies found that Sox9-Brn2 and Isl1-Lhx3 regulate enhancer activity and NFIA expression in glial and neuronal populations. Chromatin conformation analysis revealed that these enhancers and transcription factors form distinct architectures within these lineages in the spinal cord. In glioma models, the glia-specific architecture is present in tumors, and these enhancers are required for NFIA expression and contribute to glioma formation.

MAD2L2 (also known as REV7 or MAD2B), a small protein comprising just 211 amino acid residues in human and including the HORMA (Hop1, Rev7, and Mad2) domain (Fig. 1), interacts with many partners and is crucially involved in diverse cellular functions, including translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and mitotic events. protein–protein interaction Hop1, Rev7, and Mad2 translesion DNA synthesis polymerase chromosome alignment–maintaining phosphoprotein immobilized metal affinity chromatography immunofluorescence Western blotting immunoprecipitation.

The crystal structure of MAD2L2 in complex with a REV3 fragment revealed that MAD2L2 interacts with REV3 through its C-terminal region, termed the “safety belt,” and also implied that a second PPI site for interaction with REV1 is induced on the C-terminal β-sheet of MAD2L2 by REV3 binding (8Hara K.

Due to its sequence similarity with MAD2 (also termed MAD2A or MAD2L1), a spindle assembly checkpoint protein that interacts with CDC20 to inhibit the activity of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase, MAD2L2 was proposed to interact with CDH1 and thereby to function as an APC/C inhibitor (13Pfleger C.M.

Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); however, its distinct localization in mitotic cells away from CDH1 and the phenotype caused by its depletion imply that MAD2L2 is more likely to be engaged in spindle formation and chromosome alignment (16Bhat A. Wu Z. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Xiao W. Rev7/Mad2B plays a critical role in the assembly of a functional mitotic spindle.Cell Cycle. 2015; 14: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, the physical interaction of MAD2L2 with RAN, an important protein of bipolar spindle formation, has also been reported (17Medendorp K. van Groningen J.J. Vreede L.

A zinc finger protein ZNF828 was also identified as a MAD2L2-binding protein (18Vermeulen M. Eberl H.C. Matarese F. Marks H. Denissov S. Butter F. Lee K.K. Olsen J.V. Hyman A.A. Stunnenberg H.G.

Furthermore, it has been recently reported that CAMP is associated with a severe developmental disorder (20Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study Large-scale discovery of novel genetic causes of developmental disorders.Nature. 2015; 519: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and mutations in CAMP cause global development delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features (21Hempel M.

Mutat. 2016; 37: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure of CAMP and its PPI has considerable interest in the context of biomedical sciences and clinical investigations. Human CAMP consists of 812 amino acid residues containing C2H2-Zn finger domains (C2H2-ZNFs) and three characteristic repeats termed the WK, SPE, and FPE motifs (Fig. 1A); it interacts with MAD2L2 through its central region (residues 271–490) containing multiple WK motifs (19Itoh G. Kanno S. Uchida K.S. Chiba S. Sugino S. Watanabe K. Mizuno K. Yasui A. Hirota T. Tanaka K. CAMP (C13orf8, ZNF828) is a novel regulator of kinetochore-microtubule attachment.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), implying that this motif has a crucial involvement in MAD2L2 binding. The WK motif is not present in the MAD2L2-binding region of either REV3 or REV1; thus, the structural basis of MAD2L2–CAMP interaction remains unknown. To date, structural studies of MAD2L2 have been limited to its complexes associated with TLS rather than those associated with its mitotic function; in addition, it is of interest to clarify the structural basis of the various PPIs of MAD2L2. In this study, therefore, the crystal structure of human MAD2L2 in complex with a CAMP fragment was determined. To our knowledge this is the first structure of an MAD2L2 complex associated with mitosis. It clarifies the mechanism underlying the MAD2L2–CAMP interaction involving the WK motif of CAMP. Furthermore, two different crystal structures indicate the dynamic nature of the C-terminal region of MAD2L2, providing direct evidence for the conformational changes of MAD2L2 together with the associated functional implications. CAMP has 13 WK sequences (Fig. 1B). Of these the region containing WK-1∼WK-12 has been shown to interact with MAD2L2 (19Itoh G. Kanno S. Uchida K.S. Chiba S. Sugino S. Watanabe K. Mizuno K. Yasui A. Hirota T. Tanaka K. CAMP (C13orf8, ZNF828) is a novel regulator of kinetochore-microtubule attachment.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To identify the WK sequence responsible for MAD2L2 binding and to optimize the MAD2L2-binding region for the crystallographic study, we performed co-purification of MAD2L2 in complex with a CAMP fragment by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (Fig. 1C). Consequently, MAD2L2 in complex with a CAMP fragment containing WK-4 (residues 325–344; Fig. 1) was successfully crystallized. Crystals of human MAD2L2 in complex with the CAMP fragment were obtained in two crystal forms, Form-I and Form-II, and structures of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex in these crystals were determined at 2.1 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. The MAD2L2–CAMP complex adopted a monomeric structure in the Form-I crystal (Fig. 2A), whereas unexpectedly it formed a dimeric structure through exchange of the C-terminal region of MAD2L2 and the region adopted an immature structure in the Form-II crystal (Fig. 2B). Although structural differences of MAD2L2 were observed in the two complexes (Fig. 2C), the interactions between MAD2L2 and CAMP were essentially identical in both complexes. Therefore, the structure and interactions of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex in the Form-I crystal are described here, and the Form-II structure of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex is described below. The crystal structure of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex comprises four α-helices (αA∼αD), eight β-strands (β2∼β8′′), and 310 helices (Fig. 2, A and C). As previously observed in the structure of the MAD2L2–REV3 complex (8Hara K. Hashimoto H. Murakumo Y. Kobayashi S. Kogame T. Unzai S. Akashi S. Takeda S. Shimizu T. Sato M. Crystal structure of human REV7 in complex with a human REV3 fragment and structural implication of the interaction between DNA polymerase ζ and REV1.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12299-12307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the CAMP fragment is wrapped in the C-terminal region of MAD2L2 termed the safety belt, which was originally noted in the MAD2–MAD1 complex (24Sironi L. Mapelli M. Knapp S. De Antoni A. Jeang K.T. Musacchio A. Crystal structure of the tetrameric Mad1-Mad2 core complex: implications of a “safety belt” binding mechanism for the spindle checkpoint.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The structures of MAD2L2 bound to CAMP and REV3 are basically identical except for the β5-αC region and the N terminus (Fig. 2D). These regions also differ between the Form-I and Form-II structures (Fig. 2C); thus, they might be correlated with dynamic features of the protein, as described below. Similar to MAD2L2, the main-chain atoms of CAMP and REV3 can be closely superimposed, indicating that overall the MAD2L2–CAMP and MAD2L2–REV3 complexes adopt virtually the same structures. A previous structural study on the MAD2L2–REV3 complex revealed that multiple prolines of REV3 are crucially involved in the interaction with MAD2L2 (8Hara K. Hashimoto H. Murakumo Y. Kobayashi S. Kogame T. Unzai S. Akashi S. Takeda S. Shimizu T. Sato M. Crystal structure of human REV7 in complex with a human REV3 fragment and structural implication of the interaction between DNA polymerase ζ and REV1.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12299-12307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pro-1880 of REV3 is accommodated in a pocket of MAD2L2, where the aromatic side chain of Trp-171 of MAD2L2 stacks with the ring of Pro-1880 of REV3. Both Pro-1884 and Pro-1885 of REV3 are accommodated in another pocket of MAD2L2, where the aromatic side chain of Tyr-63 of MAD2L2 also stacks with Pro-1884 of REV3, and van der Waals interactions surround Pro-1885 of REV3. The carbonyl oxygen of Pro-1885 is supported by a hydrogen bond formed with the side chain of Tyr-37 of MAD2L2. Consistent with the structural study, a biochemical study denoted the consensus sequence for MAD2L2-binding as φφXPXXPP, where φ and X are a hydrophobic and any residue, respectively, and the second proline is less important than the third proline (25Hanafusa T. Habu T. Tomida J. Ohashi E. Murakumo Y. Ohmori H. Overlapping in short motif sequences for binding to human REV7 and MAD2 proteins.Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Distinct from REV3, the region from residues 325 to 344 of CAMP contains the sequence “PXXAP,” where the second proline is replaced with alanine (Fig. 2D). The present structure clarifies the mechanism of interaction between MAD2L2 and CAMP (Fig. 3A). Pro-336 of CAMP is accommodated in the pocket formed by Tyr-63, Phe-169, and Trp-171, where Pro-336 is recognized by Trp-171 of MAD2L2 via a stacking interaction, similar to the recognition of Pro-1880 of REV3. Ala-340 and Pro-341 are accommodated in the pocket formed by Tyr-37, Glu-59, Leu-60, Tyr-63, and Phe-146, also in a similar manner to Pro-1884 and Pro-1885 of REV3. The carbonyl oxygen of Pro-341 is also supported by a hydrogen bond formed with the side chain of Tyr-37 of MAD2L2, as observed for REV3. Although the CAMP fragment lacks the second proline, Tyr-63 of MAD2L2 still interacts with the corresponding residue, Ala-340, by van der Waals interactions. Interestingly, unlike the MAD2L2–REV3 complex, a water molecule is present in the pocket and forms hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen of Ala-340 of CAMP and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe-146 of MAD2L2, resulting in a network of hydrogen bonds. These interactions might compensate for the lack of stacking interactions that would be provided by the second proline (Pro-1884) of REV3. Shigella IpaB also interacts with MAD2L2 (26Iwai H. Kim M. Yoshikawa Y. Ashida H. Ogawa M. Fujita Y. Muller D. Kirikae T. Jackson P.K. Kotani S. Sasakawa C. A bacterial effector targets Mad2L2, an APC inhibitor, to modulate host cell cycling.Cell. 2007; 130: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and its binding region similarly contains alanine instead of the second proline, suggesting that a similar network with a water molecule might be involved in the interaction between MAD2L2 and IpaB. It seems, therefore, that the second proline is not necessary but can be replaced with a small residue such as alanine so that a water molecule can mediate the interaction. The WK motif has been identified as a novel motif in CAMP (19Itoh G. Kanno S. Uchida K.S. Chiba S. Sugino S. Watanabe K. Mizuno K. Yasui A. Hirota T. Tanaka K. CAMP (C13orf8, ZNF828) is a novel regulator of kinetochore-microtubule attachment.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed that both Trp-334 and Lys-335 of the motif are involved in binding to MAD2L2 (Fig. 3A). The aromatic side chain of Trp-334 forms van der Waals interactions with Leu-173 of MAD2L2, and the basic side chain of Lys-335 interacts with the acidic side chain of Asp-178 of MAD2L2 via ionic contacts. Furthermore, the ring of Pro-333 preceding the WK residues stacks with the aromatic side chain of His-151 of MAD2L2. In addition to the interactions described above, hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecules are involved in the interaction between MAD2L2 and CAMP (Fig. 3A). To pinpoint the significant interactions in the MAD2L2–CAMP complex, residues of CAMP or MAD2L2 were replaced with alanine, and the amount of CAMP fragment that co-purified with immobilized His-tagged MAD2L2 was evaluated (Fig. 3, B and C). As expected, mutation of Tyr-63 or Trp-171 in MAD2L2 markedly reduced the interaction between MAD2L2 and CAMP (lane 5 or 9 in Fig. 3B), as did mutation of Phe-169 (lane 8 in Fig. 3B), suggesting that van der Waals interactions formed by these aromatic residues of MAD2L2 are crucial for formation of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex (Fig. 3A). In contrast, mutation of Pro-336 in CAMP only slightly impaired the interaction between MAD2L2 and CAMP (lane 5 in Fig. 3C), although mutation of Pro-341 in CAMP had a large impact on the interaction, as expected (lane 8 in Fig. 3C). This indicates that the stacking interaction between Trp-171 of MAD2L2 and Pro-336 of CAMP is less important for formation of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex, in contrast to the significant contribution of the stacking interaction between Trp-171 and Pro-1880 in formation of the MAD2L2–REV3 complex (8Hara K. Hashimoto H. Murakumo Y. Kobayashi S. Kogame T. Unzai S. Akashi S. Takeda S. Shimizu T. Sato M. Crystal structure of human REV7 in complex with a human REV3 fragment and structural implication of the interaction between DNA polymerase ζ and REV1.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12299-12307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Hanafusa T. Habu T. Tomida J. Ohashi E. Murakumo Y. Ohmori H. Overlapping in short motif sequences for binding to human REV7 and MAD2 proteins.Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). More interestingly, mutation of Trp-334 in the WK motif of CAMP greatly reduced the interaction (lane 3 in Fig. 3C), whereas mutation of Lys-335 had only a small impact (lane 4 in Fig. 3C). Furthermore, double (W334A/K335A, W334A/P341A) and triple (W334A/P336A/P341A) mutations markedly reduced the interaction (lane 11, 12, or 13 in Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the formation mechanism of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex differs from that of the MAD2L2–REV3 complex; namely, van der Waals interactions provided by Trp-334 and Pro-341 of CAMP are mainly responsible for the interaction with MAD2L2, whereas Pro-333, Lys-335, and Pro-336 make a moderate contribution that might be utilized for fine-tuning to increase the specificity of the interaction between MAD2L2 and CAMP. As described above, the P336A mutation in CAMP had a small effect on the interaction with MAD2L2, although the W171A mutation in MAD2L2 led to a marked reduction of binding affinity. This suggests that van der Waals interactions made by Ala-336 in CAMP mutant might be sufficient to form the MAD2L2–CAMP complex due to a large contribution from residues such as Trp-334 and Pro-341 and/or a supportive contribution from other residues. To verify the results of the in vitro interaction between MAD2L2 and CAMP in human cells, immunoprecipitation assays using full-length CAMP were performed (Fig. 4). In good agreement with the in vitro results, Y63A, W171A, and Y63A/W171A mutations of MAD2L2 had a substantial impact on the interaction with CAMP (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, the W334A/K335A, W334A/P341A, and W334A/K335A/P341A mutations of CAMP abolished the interaction with MAD2L2 (Fig. 4, C and D). Significantly, the deletion of residues 324–350 in CAMP also abolished the interaction (Fig. 4, C and D). These observations indicate that the structure and interaction of the MAD2L2–CAMP complex described here is likely to reflect those in human cells. Consistently, mutations in MAD2L2 had an impact on the localization of MAD2L2 in mitotic cells (Fig. 5). Wild-type MAD2L2 was co-localized with full-length CAMP in the mitotic spindle and mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 5A). Wild-type MAD2L2 was localized to the mitotic spindle and to mitotic chromosomes, whereas MAD2L2 carrying the Y63A, W171A, or Y63A/W171A mutation was not detected in mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 5B). This clearly indicates that the interactions observed in the crystal structure are essential for co-localization with CAMP at chromosomes in mitotic cells. Interestingly, MAD2L2 carrying these mutations could still localize to the mitotic spindle. This implies that MAD2L2 may have mitotic partners other than CAMP and might interact with those proteins by alternative mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that MAD2L2 interacts with spindle-related proteins such as the small GTPase RAN (17Medendorp K. van Groningen J.J. Vreede L. Hetterschijt L. van den Hurk W.H. de Bruijn D.R. Brugmans L. van Kessel A.G. The mitotic arrest deficient protein MAD2B interacts with the small GTPase RAN throughout the cell cycle.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and clathrin light chain A (CLTA) (27Medendorp K. Vreede L. van Groningen J.J. Hetterschijt L. Brugmans L. Jansen P.A. van den Hurk W.H. de Bruijn D.R. van Kessel A.G. The mitotic arrest deficient protein MAD2B interacts with the clathrin light chain A during mitosis.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MAD2L2 might retain localization in spindle by interactions with such spindle-related proteins. Further analyses will be required to explain localization of MAD2L2 in mitotic spindles. Taken together with the crystal structure and interaction assay results, these findings reveal the interaction mechanism distinct from that of MAD2L2–REV3 complex.Figure 5Localization analysis of MAD2L2 by immunofluorescence.

Among 13 WK sequences of CAMP, WK-4, -7, and -8, have both corresponding tryptophan and proline residues. WK-7 and -8 have SP instead of 340AP341 in WK-4, implying that the polar side chain of the serine residue would be unsuitable to contact Phe-146 (Fig. 3A). In addition, WK-7 and -8 lack the proline residue preceding WK. These observations suggest that WK-4 could be determinant to interact with MAD2L2. In fact, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the deletion of residues 324–350 in CAMP, the lacking WK-4 and WK-5, abolished the interaction with MAD2L2 (Fig. 4D). WK-5 lacks AP and has 354VS355 instead, suggesting that WK-5 is unlikely involved in the interaction with MAD2L2. Therefore, we conclude that the CAMP fragment including WK-4 is responsible for the MAD2L2 interaction. In the Form-II crystal, the MAD2L2–CAMP complex forms a dimeric structure in which the C-terminal region of MAD2L2 is swapped between the dimers (Fig. 2B). The secondary structures of the swapped region are rearranged as follows (Fig. 2, B and C). The β8′ strand, which interacts with the swapped β8′′ from another complex is shortened. The following β8′′ strand is extended to the other complex and interacts with β8′ and β5, thereby forming a β-sheet structure (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the αE helix is newly fo"
https://openalex.org/W2754731929,"The reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is usually achieved by exogenous induction of transcription by factors acting in the nucleus. In contrast, during development, signaling pathways initiated at the membrane induce differentiation. The central idea of this study is to identify antibodies that can catalyze cellular de-differentiation and nuclear reprogramming by acting at the cell surface. We screen a lentiviral library encoding ∼100 million secreted and membrane-bound single-chain antibodies and identify antibodies that can replace either Sox2 and Myc (c-Myc) or Oct4 during reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into iPSCs. We show that one Sox2-replacing antibody antagonizes the membrane-associated protein Basp1, thereby de-repressing nuclear factors WT1, Esrrb and Lin28a (Lin28) independent of Sox2. By manipulating this pathway, we identify three methods to generate iPSCs. Our results establish unbiased selection from autocrine combinatorial antibody libraries as a robust method to discover new biologics and uncover membrane-to-nucleus signaling pathways that regulate pluripotency and cell fate."

Here, we investigated METTL12, a mitochondrial human S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferase and found it to methylate a single protein in mitochondrial extracts, identified as citrate synthase (CS). Using several in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrated that METTL12 methylates CS on Lys-395, which is localized in the CS active site. Interestingly, the METTL12-mediated methylation inhibited CS activity and was blocked by the CS substrate oxaloacetate. Moreover, METTL12 was strongly inhibited by the reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). In summary, we have uncovered a novel human mitochondrial KMT that introduces a methyl modification into a metabolic enzyme and whose activity can be modulated by metabolic cues. Based on the established naming nomenclature for similar enzymes, we suggest that METTL12 be renamed CS-KMT (gene name CSKMT)."

https://openalex.org/W2754744771,"The automatic detection and recognition of sound events by computers is a requirement for a number of emerging sensing and human computer interaction technologies. Recent advances in this field have been achieved by machine learning classifiers working in conjunction with time-frequency feature representations. This combination has achieved excellent accuracy for classification of discrete sounds. The ability to recognise sounds under real-world noisy conditions, called robust sound event classification, is an especially challenging task that has attracted recent research attention. Another aspect of real-word conditions is the classification of continuous, occluded or overlapping sounds, rather than classification of short isolated sound recordings. This paper addresses the classification of noise-corrupted, occluded, overlapped, continuous sound recordings. It first proposes a standard evaluation task for such sounds based upon a common existing method for evaluating isolated sound classification. It then benchmarks several high performing isolated sound classifiers to operate with continuous sound data by incorporating an energy-based event detection front end. Results are reported for each tested system using the new task, to provide the first analysis of their performance for continuous sound event detection. In addition it proposes and evaluates a novel Bayesian-inspired front end for the segmentation and detection of continuous sound recordings prior to classification."
https://openalex.org/W2952769393,"The homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela, first described from central California, USA is shown to represent two superficially similar but both morphologically and phylogenetically distinct species that are co-distributed. We here describe a new species as Oscarella pearsei, sp. nov. and re-describe Oscarella carmela; the original description was based upon material from both species. Further, we correct the identification of published genomic/transcriptomic resources that were originally attributed to O. carmela, and present new Illumina-sequenced transcriptome assemblies for each of these species, and the mitochondrial genome sequence for O. pearsei sp. nov. Using SSU and LSU ribosomal DNA and the mitochondrial genome, we report the phylogenetic relationships of these species relative to other Oscarella species, and find strong support for the placement of O. pearsei sp. nov. in a distinct clade within genus Oscarella defined by the presence of spherulous cells that contain paracrystalline inclusions; O. carmela lacks this cell type. Oscarella pearsei sp. nov and O. carmela can be tentatively distinguished based upon gross morphological differences such as color, surface texture and extent of mucus production, but can be more reliably identified using mitochondrial and nuclear barcode sequencing, ultrastructural characteristics of cells in the mesohyl, and the morphology of the follicle epithelium which surrounds the developing embryo in reproductively active individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2753664991,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with progressive enlargement of multiple renal cysts, often leading to renal failure that cannot be prevented by a current treatment. Two proteins encoded by two genes are associated with ADPKD: PC1 (pkd1), primarily a signaling molecule, and PC2 (pkd2), a Ca2+ channel. Dysregulation of cAMP signaling is central to ADPKD, but the molecular mechanism is unresolved. Here, we studied the role of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in regulating cyst growth to test the possibility that inhibiting HDAC6 might help manage ADPKD. Chemical inhibition of HDAC6 reduced cyst growth in PC1-knock-out mice. In proximal tubule–derived, PC1-knock-out cells, adenylyl cyclase 6 and 3 (AC6 and -3) are both expressed. AC6 protein expression was higher in cells lacking PC1, compared with control cells containing PC1. Intracellular Ca2+ was higher in PC1-knock-out cells than in control cells. HDAC inhibition caused a drop in intracellular Ca2+ and increased ATP-simulated Ca2+ release. HDAC6 inhibition reduced the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum induced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. HDAC6 inhibition and treatment of cells with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) reduced cAMP levels in PC1-knock-out cells. Finally, the calmodulin inhibitors W-7 and W-13 reduced cAMP levels, and W-7 reduced cyst growth, suggesting that AC3 is involved in cyst growth regulated by HDAC6. We conclude that HDAC6 inhibition reduces cell growth primarily by reducing intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ levels.

https://openalex.org/W2952175432,"Whole-genome amplification (WGA) techniques are used for non-specific amplification of low-copy number DNA, and especially for single-cell genome and transcriptome amplification. There are a number of WGA methods that have been developed over the years. One example is degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR), which is a very simple, fast and inexpensive WGA technique. Although DOP-PCR has been regarded as one of the pioneering methods for WGA, it only provides low genome coverage and a high allele dropout rate when compared to more modern techniques. Here we describe an improved DOP-PCR (iDOP-PCR). We have modified the classic DOP-PCR by using a new thermostable DNA polymerase (SD polymerase) with a strong strand-displacement activity and by adjustments in primers design. We compared iDOP-PCR, classic DOP-PCR and the well-established PicoPlex technique for whole genome amplification of both high- and low-copy number human genomic DNA. The amplified DNA libraries were evaluated by analysis of short tandem repeat genotypes and NGS data. In summary, iDOP-PCR provided a better quality of the amplified DNA libraries compared to the other WGA methods tested, especially when low amounts of genomic DNA were used as an input material."

These transporters are critical virulence factors, relying on specific and high-affinity binding of zinc by a periplasmic solute-binding protein (SBP). As such, the mechanisms of zinc binding and release among bacterial SBPs are of considerable interest as antibacterial drug targets. Zinc SBPs are characterized by a flexible loop near the high-affinity zinc-binding site. The function of this structure is not always clear, and its flexibility has thus far prevented structural characterization by X-ray crystallography. Here, we present intact structures for the zinc-specific SBP AztC from the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans in the zinc-bound and apo-states. A comparison of these structures revealed that zinc loss prompts significant structural rearrangements, mediated by the formation of a sodium-binding site in the apo-structure. We further show that the AztC flexible loop has no impact on zinc-binding affinity, stoichiometry, or protein structure, yet is essential for zinc transfer from the metallochaperone AztD. We also found that 3 His residues in the loop appear to temporarily coordinate zinc and then convey it to the high-affinity binding site. Thus, mutation of any of these residues to Ala abrogated zinc transfer from AztD. Our structural and mechanistic findings conclusively identify a role for the AztC flexible loop in zinc acquisition from the metallochaperone AztD, yielding critical insights into metal binding by AztC from both solution and AztD. These proteins are highly conserved in human pathogens, making this work potentially useful for the development of novel antibiotics.

A detailed annotation of enzymatic activities and structure–function relationships remains an important prerequisite to understand PNPLA functions in (patho-)physiology, for example, in disorders such as neutral lipid storage disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and neurodegenerative syndromes. In this study, we characterized the structural features controlling the subcellular localization and enzymatic activity of PNPLA7, a poorly annotated phospholipase linked to insulin signaling and energy metabolism. We show that PNPLA7 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that specifically promotes hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine in mammalian cells.

Enzymatic activity is instead mediated by the C-terminal domain, which maintains full catalytic competence even in the absence of N-terminal regions. Upon elevated fatty acid flux, the catalytic domain targets cellular lipid droplets and promotes interactions of PNPLA7 with these organelles in response to increased cAMP levels.

In mammalian cells, PNPLA7 localizes to the ER and lipid droplets (LDs), which are cellular lipid storage organelles with pivotal functions in energy metabolism and lipid trafficking (25Kienesberger P.C.

Although these observations closely link PNPLA7 to lipid and energy metabolism, it is presently unknown how fluctuations in PNPLA7 expression or subcellular distribution affect lipid homeostasis of cells or tissues (25Kienesberger P.C.

In this study, we further characterized the enzymatic function of PNPLA7 in cellular lipid metabolism and established detailed structure–function relationships among domain architecture, subcellular positioning, and enzymatic activity of the protein. We confirm that PNPLA7 acts as a potent intracellular lysophospholipase and identify LPC as a major substrate of PNPLA7 in living cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that PNPLA7 is composed of specific functional parts mediating ER targeting, interactions with LDs, and substrate hydrolysis. Our study provides novel structural insights into an evolutionarily conserved class of phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes. To assess possible function(s) of PNPLA7 in cellular lipid metabolism, we first created cell lines stably expressing PNPLA7-EGFP or EGFP, respectively, and subjected them to enzyme activity assays and lipid analysis. Consistent with previous studies, cell homogenates expressing PNPLA7-EGFP exhibited increased hydrolytic activity toward several lysophospholipid species as compared with EGFP-expressing control homogenates including C18:1 LPC (4.6-fold), C18:1 lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE; 4.0-fold), and C18:1 lysophosphatidylserine (LPS; 2.7-fold) (25Kienesberger P.C. Lass A. Preiss-Landl K. Wolinski H. Kohlwein S.D. Zimmermann R. Zechner R. Identification of an insulin-regulated lysophospholipase with homology to neuropathy target esterase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5908-5917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, PNPLA7-EGFP-expressing homogenates showed a low but significant increase in the hydrolytic activity toward C18:1/C18:1 PC (1.5-fold) and C18:1/C18:1 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; 1.2-fold), whereas the activity toward C18:1/C18:1 phosphatidylserine (PS) was not different from EGFP-expressing controls (Fig. 1A). The lipid hydrolase activity of PNPLA7-EGFP was 2.6-fold higher toward C18:1 LPC as compared with C18:0 LPC, suggesting a preference of the enzyme for unsaturated compared with saturated species (Fig. 1B). Lipid analysis revealed that stable expression of PNPLA7-EGFP significantly reduced cellular LPC levels (−34%) as compared with EGFP-expressing control cells but did not affect total cellular levels of LPE, LPS, PC, PE, or PS (Fig. 1C). The decrease in LPC levels observed in PNPLA7-EGFP-expressing cells was mainly due to a reduction in unsaturated LPC species containing C16:1 (−35%), C18:1 (−43%), and C18:2 (−52%) fatty acids (FAs) (Fig. 1D). Although a trend toward decreased cellular levels was also observed for other LPC species, the difference was not significant when compared with controls (Fig. 1D). To further investigate the function of PNPLA7 in cellular LPC metabolism, we depleted endogenous PNPLA7 in murine AML12 cells by RNAi and assessed cellular LPC hydrolase activities and LPC levels. Stable expression of two independent shRNA constructs targeting PNPLA7 (shRNA1 and shRNA2) decreased cellular Pnpla7 mRNA concentrations by 59 and 63%, respectively, as compared with cells expressing scrambled shRNA (Fig. 2A). This was accompanied by decreased PNPLA7 protein levels in cells expressing either shRNA1 or shRNA2, whereas expression of the closely related PNPLA6 was unchanged (Fig. 2B). The reduction in PNPLA7 expression was associated with a 16–20% decrease in cellular LPC hydrolase activity (depending on the shRNA used; Fig. 2C) but did not affect total cellular LPC levels (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data provide evidence that PNPLA7 acts as an intracellular LPC-preferring lysophospholipase that contributes to cellular LPC hydrolase activity in mammalian cells.Figure 2Effects of PNPLA7 knockdown on cellular lipid metabolism.

The arrangement of possible functional domains within the PNPLA7 polypeptide is shown in Fig. 3A. The N-terminal half of the protein includes a single predicted transmembrane (TM) domain close to the N terminus and a putative “regulatory” (R) domain, which harbors three predicted cNMP-binding domains (CBDs). The C-terminal half (C domain) includes the patatin-like phospholipase domain predicted to mediate enzymatic activity (Fig. 3A). Subcellular fractionation of Neuro-2a postnuclear supernatants (PNSs) and subsequent immunoblotting showed that endogenous PNPLA7 was enriched in the membrane fraction but undetectable in the cytosol (Fig. 3B). Likewise, a PNPLA7-EGFP fusion protein transiently expressed in COS-7 cells was exclusively recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3B), indicating a similar subcellular distribution of endogenous PNPLA7 and ectopically expressed PNPLA7-EGFP. Membrane-associated PNPLA7-EGFP was partially solubilized with Triton X-100 but not with NaCl or Na2CO3, similar to the integral membrane protein Calnexin but unlike the peripheral membrane protein DDHD2 (28Liang J. Yin C. Doong H. Fang S. Peterhoff C. Nixon R.A. Monteiro M.J. Characterization of erasin (UBXD2): a new ER protein that promotes ER-associated protein degradation.J.

Next, we used proteinase K protection assays to assess the topological orientation of PNPLA7 within cellular membranes. Incubation of isolated microsomes with increasing concentrations of proteinase K provoked a dose-dependent depletion of the signal corresponding to full-length PNPLA7-EGFP in our immunoblots (Fig. 3D). This was accompanied by the generation of a ∼25-kDa fragment likely representing EGFP, which is known to be resistant to proteinase K digestion, indicating proteolytic degradation and therefore cytosolic orientation of the C terminus of PNPLA7 (Fig. 3D). Using antibodies directed toward the C domain or the R domain of PNPLA7, we failed to detect additional protein bands eluding proteolytic digestion of PNPLA7-EGFP, suggesting that these domains are also largely exposed to the cytosol and thus accessible to proteolytic degradation (Fig. 3D). Integrity of the isolated microsomes was confirmed by the apparent protection of the 66-kDa luminal domain of Calnexin from proteolytic degradation (28Liang J. Yin C. Doong H. Fang S. Peterhoff C. Nixon R.A. Monteiro M.J. Characterization of erasin (UBXD2): a new ER protein that promotes ER-associated protein degradation.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4011-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). To address whether the N terminus of PNPLA7 is oriented toward the cytosol or the lumen, we repeated the proteinase protection assay with microsomes isolated from COS-7 cells expressing PNPLA7 harboring an N-terminal HA tag (HA-PNPLA7). As shown in Fig. 3E, proteinase K treatment depleted the signal corresponding to full-length HA-PNPLA7 and led to the accumulation of an immunoreactive peptide of less than 10 kDa consistent with a luminal orientation of the N terminus. Addition of Triton X-100 to solubilize microsomal membranes rendered this peptide susceptible to proteolytic digestion, suggesting that microsomal integrity is indeed required to protect the N-terminal part of PNPLA7 from proteolysis. In an independent approach, we permeabilized COS-7 cells expressing HA-PNPLA7 either with Triton X-100 or digitonin and costained the cells with antibodies directed toward the HA tag and the C domain (Fig. 3F). Permeabilization with Triton X-100 rendered both epitopes accessible to antibody staining, resulting in a reticular staining pattern reminiscent of the ER and an apparent overlap of both signals. In contrast, digitonin treatment, which is used to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane, rendered only the C region but not the N-terminal HA tag accessible to antibody staining (Fig. 3F). Taken together these results suggest that PNPLA7 is a bilayer-spanning TM protein that orients its N terminus toward the lumen but exposes its R and C domains largely toward the cytosol. We next addressed the functional contribution of individual protein domains to the subcellular positioning of PNPLA7. To this end, we constructed EGFP-tagged PNPLA7 variants lacking individual domains (Fig. 4A) and assessed their subcellular localization in living COS-7 cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with the results described above, ectopically expressed full-length PNPLA7-EGFP exhibited a reticulate pattern that colocalized with an ER marker protein in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4B). A PNPLA7 mutant lacking the C domain (PNPLA7-N-EGFP) exhibited a similar subcellular distribution as full-length PNPLA7-EGFP and colocalized with the ER, indicating that the C domain is dispensable for ER associatio"

Despite advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics, detecting rare mutations in primary tumors and metastases contributing to subclonal diversity is a challenge for precision genomics. Here, in order to identify rare mutations, we adapted a recently described epithelial reprograming assay for short-term propagation of epithelial cells from primary and metastatic tumors. Using this approach, we expanded minor clones and obtained epithelial cell-specific DNA/RNA for quantitative NGS analysis. Comparative Ampliseq Comprehensive Cancer Panel sequence analyses were performed on DNA from unprocessed breast tumor and tumor cells propagated from the same tumor. We identified previously uncharacterized mutations present only in the cultured tumor cells, a subset of which has been reported in brain metastatic but not primary breast tumors. In addition, whole-genome sequencing identified mutations enriched in liver metastases of various cancers, including Notch pathway mutations/chromosomal inversions in 5/5 liver metastases, irrespective of cancer types. Mutations/rearrangements in FHIT, involved in purine metabolism, were detected in 4/5 liver metastases, and the same four liver metastases shared mutations in 32 genes, including mutations of different HLA-DR family members affecting OX40 signaling pathway, which could impact the immune response to metastatic cells. Pathway analyses of all mutated genes in liver metastases showed aberrant tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor signaling in metastatic cells. Epigenetic regulators including KMT2C/MLL3 and ARID1B, which are mutated in >50% of hepatocellular carcinomas, were also mutated in liver metastases. Thus, irrespective of cancer types, organ-specific metastases may share common genomic aberrations. Since recent studies show independent evolution of primary tumors and metastases and in most cases mutation burden is higher in metastases than primary tumors, the method described here may allow early detection of subclonal somatic alterations associated with metastatic progression and potentially identify therapeutically actionable, metastasis-specific genomic aberrations."
https://openalex.org/W2754128084,"Anoikis acts as a critical barrier to metastasis by inducing cell death upon cancer cell detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby preventing tumor cell dissemination to secondary sites. The induction of anoikis requires the lysosomal-mediated downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) leading to termination of pro-survival signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that depletion of pre-mRNA splicing factor 4 kinase (PRP4K; also known as PRPF4B) causes dysregulation of EGFR trafficking and anoikis resistance. We also report a novel cytoplasmic localization of PRP4K at the late endosome, and demonstrate both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in breast, lung and ovarian cancer tissue. Mechanistically, depletion of PRP4K leads to reduced EGFR degradation following cell detachment from the ECM and correlates with increased TrkB, vimentin and Zeb1 expression. As a result, PRP4K loss promotes sustained growth factor signaling and increased cellular resistance to anoikis in vitro and in a novel zebrafish xenotransplantation model of anoikis sensitivity, as well as increased metastasis in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. Thus, PRP4K may serve as a potential biomarker of anoikis sensitivity in ovarian and other epithelial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2756237246,"Several theories about the origins of music have emphasized its biological and social functions, including in courtship. Music may act as a courtship display due to its capacity to vary in complexity and emotional content. Support for music’s reproductive function comes from the recent finding that only women in the fertile phase of the reproductive cycle prefer composers of complex melodies to composers of simple ones as short-term sexual partners, which is also in line with the ovulatory shift hypothesis. However, the precise mechanisms by which music may influence sexual attraction are unknown, specifically how music may interact with visual attractiveness cues and affect perception and behaviour in both genders. Using a crossmodal priming paradigm, we examined whether listening to music influences ratings of facial attractiveness and dating desirability of opposite-sex faces. We also tested whether misattribution of arousal or pleasantness underlies these effects, and explored whether sex differences and menstrual cycle phase may be moderators. Our sample comprised 64 women in the fertile or infertile phase (no hormonal contraception use) and 32 men, carefully matched for mood, relationship status, and musical preferences. Musical primes (25 s) varied in arousal and pleasantness, and targets were photos of faces with neutral expressions (2 s). Group-wise analyses indicated that women, but not men, gave significantly higher ratings of facial attractiveness and dating desirability after having listened to music than in the silent control condition. High-arousing, complex music yielded the largest effects, suggesting that music may affect human courtship behaviour through induced arousal, which calls for further studies on the mechanisms by which music affects sexual attraction in real-life social contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2751664752,"In ∼50% of prostate cancers, chromosomal rearrangements cause the fusion of the promoter and 5′-UTR of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) gene to the open reading frame of ERG, encoding an ETS family transcription factor. This fusion results in expression of full-length or N-terminally truncated ERG protein in prostate epithelia. ERG is not expressed in normal prostate epithelia, but when expressed, it promotes tumorigenesis via altered gene expression, stimulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular migration/invasion, and transformation. However, limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of ERG function in prostate cells has hampered efforts to therapeutically target ERG. ERK-mediated phosphorylation of ERG is required for ERG functions in prostate cells, but the reason for this requirement is unknown. Here, we report a mechanism whereby ERK-mediated phosphorylation of ERG at one serine residue causes a conformational change that allows ERK phosphorylation at a second serine residue, Ser-96. We found that the Ser-96 phosphorylation resulted in dissociation of EZH2 and SUZ12, components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), transcriptional activation of ERG target genes, and increased cell migration. Conversely, loss of ERG phosphorylation at Ser-96 resulted in recruitment of EZH2 across the ERG-cistrome and a genome-wide loss of ERG-mediated transcriptional activation and cell migration.

We also showed that ERG Ser-215 was phosphorylated by ERK in prostate cells, and this event was necessary for ERG to promote transcriptional activation and cell migration. However, the consequence of Ser-215 phosphorylation on the molecular function of ERG is unknown. ERG is known to cooperate with co-regulators to alter transcriptional output of target genes.

Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-215 leads to a conformational change in ERG that primes a second serine, Ser-96, for phosphorylation by ERK. Phosphomimetic and phosphor-null mutants indicate that the ability of ERG to activate gene expression and promote prostate cell migration is dependent solely on phosphorylated Ser-96, whereas Ser-215 phosphorylation is required to allow Ser-96 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Ser-96 resulted in dissociation of the PRC2 subunits EZH2 and SUZ12 from ERG. Further, the phospho-null mutant S96A was associated with increased EZH2 recruitment across the ERG cistrome and a failure to activate an ERG-dependent gene expression program. These data suggest that ERK potentiates transactivation and cell migration, promoting functions of ERG by phosphorylation-induced dissociation of the PRC2 complex. ERK binds D or DEF docking domains in target proteins and phosphorylates serine or threonine residues present within consensus PX(SP/TP) or sometimes SP/TP motifs (18Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Transcriptional regulation by the MAP kinase signaling cascades.Gene. 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). ERG has two putative D domains and one canonical DEF domain (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1) (12Selvaraj N. Kedage V. Hollenhorst P.C. Comparison of MAPK specificity across the ETS transcription factor family identifies a high-affinity ERK interaction required for ERG function in prostate cells.Cell Commun. Signal. 2015; 13: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We previously found that ERK binds the DEF domain in ERG (sequence FIFP) and phosphorylates nearby Ser-215 (12Selvaraj N. Kedage V.

In addition, our results suggested that Ser-96 could be a secondary phosphorylation site that may be dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-215. To further confirm this observation, ERK2 was used to in vitro phosphorylate purified ERG phospho-null mutants and a DEF docking domain mutant (FIFP to AAAP). All phosphorylation was ablated in ERG S215A and ERG AAAP, whereas the signal partially decreased in ERG S96A (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there was no change in the phosphorylation signal in negative control ERG S81A, where a non-phosphorylated serine is changed to an alanine (Fig. 1B). To test site-specific phosphorylation in cells, a phospho-specific antibody was raised to ERG phosphorylated at Ser-96 (Ser(P)-96). A phospho-specific antibody against ERG Ser-215 (Ser(P)-215) has been described previously (12Selvaraj N. Kedage V. Hollenhorst P.C.

Both phospho-specific antibodies failed to detect ERG protein purified from a bacterial expression system unless the protein was phosphorylated using purified ERK2 (Fig. 1C). An immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE1), which does not express endogenous ERG, was modified to stably express 3×FLAG-ERG (RWPE-ERG). ERG was immunoprecipitated from RWPE-ERG cells with FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with FLAG and phospho-specific antibodies. Both Ser(P)-96 and Ser(P)-215 antibodies detected a band the same size as ERG only from cells expressing ERG and not empty vector (Fig. 1D). Bands corresponding to both Ser(P)-96 and Ser(P)-215 disappeared when ERG S215A or ERG AAAP was expressed, whereas only the Ser(P)-96 band was absent when ERG S96A was expressed (Fig. 1D). Therefore, both in vitro and in cells, Ser-96 phosphorylation is dependent on Ser-215 and the FIFP ERK-docking sequence. To further confirm that ERG Ser-215 phosphorylation is required for subsequent Ser-96 phosphorylation, a phosphomimetic S215D mutant was tested. Using a luciferase reporter construct that we previously demonstrated is activated by ERG (8Kedage V. Selvaraj N. Nicholas T.R. Budka J.A. Plotnik J.P. Jerde T.J. Hollenhorst P.C. An interaction with Ewing's sarcoma breakpoint protein EWS defines a specific oncogenic mechanism of ETS factors rearranged in prostate cancer.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 1289-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we found that ERG S215D activates transcription more strongly than wild-type ERG, consistent with a phosphomimetic function (Fig. 1E). ERG S215D was purified and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by ERK2. Unlike purified ERG S215A, which was not phosphorylated, ERK phosphorylated purified ERG S215D to a similar extent as ERG S96A, consistent with a single phosphorylation event (Fig. 1F). Loss of this phosphorylation in an S96A/S215D double mutant indicated that this single phosphorylation event occurs at Ser-96 (Fig. 1F). To verify this result in cells, each of these mutants was expressed in RWPE1 cells, and Ser(P)-96 was monitored by immunoblot. In RWPE1 cells, ERG S215D was phosphorylated at Ser-96, but this band was lost in the ERG S96A-S215D double mutant (Fig. 1G). These findings indicate that prior phosphorylation of ERG at Ser-215 is required for Ser-96 phosphorylation both in vitro and in cells. Although ERK phosphorylated ERG Ser-96 in vitro, it was not clear whether ERK or some other kinase was responsible for Ser-96 phosphorylation in cells. MEK is upstream of ERK in the MAPK pathway and is responsible for phosphorylation and activation of ERK (19Gómez N. Cohen P. Dissection of the protein kinase cascade by which nerve growth factor activates MAP kinases.Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Chang F. Steelman L.S. Lee J.T. Shelton J.G. Navolanic P.M. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Signal transduction mediated by the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway from cytokine receptors to transcription factors: potential targeting for therapeutic intervention.Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1263-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). We found that the MEK inhibitor U0126 decreased phosphorylation of ERK and decreased phosphorylation of ERG at both Ser-96 and Ser-215 (Fig. 1H). However, because Ser-96 phosphorylation is dependent on prior Ser-215 phosphorylation, this experiment was repeated with the ERG S215D construct to decouple this dependence. Again, in the ERG S215D mutant, the MEK inhibitor reduced phosphorylation at Ser-96, consistent with ERK phosphorylating both Ser-96 and Ser-215 in RWPE1 cells (Fig. 1H). In ERG, the FIFP ERK-binding sequence is only 14 amino acid residues from Ser-215, whereas Ser-96 is 133 residues away (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that conformational changes associated with Ser-215 phosphorylation may either bring the FIFP-bound ERK closer to Ser-96 for phosphorylation or may expose a non-canonical ERK binding site near Ser-96. To differentiate between these models, FIFP was mutated to AAAP in the background of S215D. Interestingly, Ser-96 phosphorylation present in the S215D single mutant was lost in the S215D-AAAP double mutant, both in vitro and in RWPE1 cells (Fig. 1, I and J). These findings are consistent with a model that ERK binds to the FIFP sequence and phosphorylates Ser-215, and then ERK remains bound to FIFP and phosphorylates Ser-96. Our model is that upon phosphorylation at Ser-215, ERG undergoes a conformational change to bring Ser-96 in proximity to ERK bound to FIFP. To test changes in secondary structure of ERG, the far-UV CD spectrum of purified ERG, ERG S215A, and ERG S215D was recorded. Strikingly, ERG and ERG S215A had similar CD spectra, whereas ERG S215D was dramatically different and contained 70% more α-helix than WT (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that Ser-215 phosphorylation induces a more compact conformation by increasing α-helix content at the expense of random coil. To determine tertiary structural changes, purified ERG, ERG S215A, and ERG S215D were subjected to partial proteolytic digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin (Fig. 2B). ERG S215D displayed protected fragments in both chymotrypsin (Fig. 2B, left panel, peptides indicated by arrow, compare lanes 4 and 5) and trypsin (Fig. 2B, right panel, peptides indicated by square bracket, compare lanes 4 and 5) digestion that were quickly lost in ERG and ERG S215A. This indicates a structural difference caused by the phosphomimetic mutation. To directly monitor Ser-215 phosphorylation induced tertiary structural changes, ERG was phosphorylated by ERK2 and subjected to chymotrypsin partial digestion. A protected band similar to that of S215D-digested products (Fig. 2B) was also observed in phosphorylated ERG (peptides indicated by arrow, compare lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 2C). Under similar conditions, digestion of ERG S215A did not show any changes in proteolytic products (peptides indicated by arrow, compare lanes 6 and 8 in Fig. 2C). Overall these findings suggest that ERG undergoes secondary and tertiary structural changes when Ser-215 is phosphorylated. ERG can activate genes that induce cell migration by binding to cis-regulatory sequences consisting of neighboring ETS and AP-1 transcription factor–binding sites (6Hollenhorst P.C. Ferris M.W. Hull M.A. Chae H. Kim S. Graves B.J. Oncogenic ETS proteins mimic activated RAS/MAPK signaling in prostate cells.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To measure phosphorylation-induced transcriptional activation, a firefly luciferase reporter driven by an ETS/AP-1–containing enhancer was used (8Kedage V. Selvaraj N. Nicholas T.R. Budka J.A. Plotnik J.P. Jerde T.J. Hollenhorst P.C. An interaction with Ewing's sarcoma breakpoint protein EWS defines a specific oncogenic mechanism of ETS factors rearranged in prostate cancer.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 1289-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This ETS/AP-1 reporter was co-transfected with constructs expressing 3×FLAG-ERG and its mutants into RWPE1 cells. ERG activated the reporter compared with vector control (Fig. 3A). Reporter activation decreased with S96A and S215A mutations, indicating that these residues are important for transcriptional activity of ERG (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, an increase in reporter activity was observed with phosphomimetic ERG S96E, and this was unchanged with ERG S96E/S215A double mutant (Fig. 3A). Because genes regulated by ETS/AP-1 enhancers regulate cell migration, we measured the ability of WT and mutants to drive cell migration when stably expressed in RWPE1 cells (Fig. 3B, top). S96A and S215A mutations inhibited the ability of ERG to promote cell migration (Fig. 3B). Similar to the luciferase reporter data, an increase in cell migration with phosphomimetic ERG S96E was unchanged in the ERG S96E/S215A double mutant (Fig. 3B). ERG and mutant ERG expression did not affect cell proliferation (supplemental Fig. S2). Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-96 potentiates cell migration and transactivation functions of ERG, whereas Ser-215 phosphorylation is only required to allow Ser-96 phosphorylation. TMPRSS2-ERG fusions can express either full-length ERG or N-terminal deletions of 32 (most common) or 92 (less frequent) amino acids (2Tomlins S.A. Rhodes D.R. Perner S. Dhanasekaran S.M. Mehra R.

Ittmann M. Expression of variant TMPRSS2/ERG fusion messenger RNAs is associated with aggressive prostate cancer.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8347-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Because these deletions result in loss of a predicted D motif (Fig. 1A) and are in close proximity to Ser-96, we tested whether their absence altered phosphorylation. In vitro, ERK2 phosphorylated ERGΔ32 and ERGΔ92 similarly to full-length ERG (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Ser(P)-96 and Ser(P)-215 signal was unchanged in both deletion mutants of ERG expressed in prostate cells (Fig. 4B). Because phosphorylation at Ser-96 induces cell migration, we checked the ability of deletion mutants to drive cell migration. Both Δ32 and Δ92 ERG expressed at similar levels to full-length ERG in RWPE1 cells, and both induced cell migration similar to full-length ERG (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that N-terminal truncations found in prostate tumors have no effect on ERK-mediated phosphorylation and the cell migration function of ERG. Some ERG splicing isoforms lack exon 9 that codes for 24 amino acids including the ERK-binding motif “FIFP” (DEF motif). Inclusion of this exon in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts has been shown to be critical for the cell migration function of ERG (22Wang J. Cai Y. Yu W. Ren C. Spencer D.M. Ittmann M. Pleiotropic biological activities of alternatively spliced TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene transcripts.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8516-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that the expression of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts with exon 9 was higher in tumors than transcripts that lacked this exon (22Wang J. Cai Y. Yu W. Ren C.

We previously showed that an ERG isoform that lacks exon 9, and the FIFP motif is not phosphorylated at Ser-215 and fails to induce cell migration (12Selvaraj N. Kedage V. Hollenhorst P.C. Comparison of MAPK specificity across the ETS transcription factor family identifies a high-affinity ERK interaction required for ERG function in prostate cells.Cell Commun. Signal. 2015; 13: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As expected, Ser-96 was also not phosphorylated when ERG lacking exon 9 was expressed in RWPE1 cells (Fig. 4D). Therefore, these data indicate a critical role for exon 9 and the FIFP motif in ERG function. Phosphorylation can alter the affinity of ETS proteins to their co-regulators (11Foulds C.E. Nelson M.L. Blaszczak A.G. Graves B.J. Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling activates Ets-1 and Ets-2 by CBP/p300 recruitment.Mol. Cell.

To test whether phosphorylation at Ser-96 alters interactions with known ERG co-regulators, we incubated purified ERG and ERG S96E with nuclear extracts from the prostate cancer cell line PC3 and monitored binding of co-regulators with specific antibodies. Interaction with two known co-activators, EWS (8Kedage V. Selvaraj N. Nicholas T.R. Budka J.A. Plotnik J.P. Jerde T.J. Hollenhorst P.C.

ERG can recruit EZH2, the enzymatic component of PRC2 to target genes to repress expression (16Yu J. Mani R.S. Cao Q. Brenner C.J. Cao X. Wang X. Wu L. Li J. Hu M. Gong Y. Cheng H. Laxman B.

In our assay, ERG bound to EZH2, but ERG S96E did not, suggesting that phosphorylation could block EZH2 binding (Fig. 5A). To map the region of ERG that interacts with EZH2, ERG deletion mutants were purified and incubated with PC3 nuclear extract. EZH2 interacted with ERG Δ32 and ERG Δ92, whereas the EZH2 interaction was lost in an ERG Δ200 deletion (Fig. 5B). Thus the region between residues 93–200 in ERG that includes the Ser-96 phosphorylation site and the pointed domain is necessary for EZH2 binding. To validate the phosphorylation regulated binding of EZH2 in cells, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged ERG and its mutants from RWPE1 cells and probed for EZH2 and the PRC2 complex subunit SUZ12. Interestingly the phospho-null mutant S96A bound both EZH2 and SUZ12 better than wild-type ERG, whereas the interaction was lost in the S96E mutant (Fig. 5C). To directly test that ERK regulates PRC2 binding to ERG, RWPE1-ERG cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor to decrease ERK activation. Upon MEK inhibition, phosphorylated (activated) ERK decreased, and by co-immunoprecipitation, the interaction between ERG and both EZH2 and SUZ12 increased (Fig. 5D). To test this interaction in prostate cancer cells with a TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene, VCaP cells were treated with the phorbol ester PMA for 1 h to activate ERK. This treatment resulted in decreased interaction between ERG and EZH2 (Fig. 5E). Collectively, these data indicate that PRC2 complex binding to ERG is inhibited by ERK phosphorylation of ERG at Ser-96. To test whether Ser-96 phosphorylation alters genomic binding of ERG, we compared ChIP-seq of ERG, ERG S96A, and ERG S96E expressed in RWPE1 cells using an anti-ERG antibody. A total of 4565 regions were called as ERG-bound in one or more of these three data sets. A comparison of ERG, ERG S96A, and ERG S96E across all of these possible ERG-bound regions revealed co-occurrence at most si"

Here, we report a 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of the HiLpoA N-terminal domain. Two subdomains contain tetratricopeptide-like motifs that form a concave groove, but their relative orientation differs by ∼45° from that observed in an NMR structure of the Escherichia coli LpoA N domain. We also determined three 2.0–2.8 Å resolution crystal structures containing four independent full-length HiLpoA molecules. In contrast to an elongated model previously suggested for E. coli LpoA, each HiLpoA formed a U-shaped structure with a different C-domain orientation. This resulted from both N-domain twisting and rotation of the C domain (up to 30°) at the end of the relatively immobile interdomain linker. Moreover, a previously predicted hinge between the lobes of the LpoA C domain exhibited variations of up to 12°. Small-angle X-ray scattering data revealed excellent agreement with a model calculated by normal mode analysis from one of the full-length HiLpoA molecules but even better agreement with an ensemble of this molecule and two of the partially extended normal mode analysis-predicted models.

We described the 1.35 Å resolution crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of H. influenzae LpoA (LpoA-C; residues 257–575) (16Vijayalakshmi J. Akerley B.J. Saper M.A. Structure of YraM, a protein essential for growth of Haemophilus influenzae.Proteins. 2008; 73: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This domain shares a homologous fold, but low sequence identity, with periplasmic substrate-binding proteins involved in the high-affinity import of small molecules by ABC-like transporters (17Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The bilobate structure of LpoA-C adopts an “open” conformation, with a large cleft between the two lobes, typical of unliganded substrate-binding proteins (16Vijayalakshmi J. Akerley B.J. Saper M.A. Structure of YraM, a protein essential for growth of Haemophilus influenzae.Proteins. 2008; 73: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In periplasmic substrate-binding proteins, ligand molecules tightly bind in the cleft and stabilize a closed-cleft conformation (18Trakhanov S. Vyas N.K. Luecke H. Kristensen D.M. Ma J. Quiocho F.A. Ligand-free and -bound structures of the binding protein (LivJ) of the Escherichia coli ABC leucine/isoleucine/valine transport system: trajectory and dynamics of the interdomain rotation and ligand specificity.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6597-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because the residues exposed in the LpoA-C cleft are highly conserved in all LpoA sequences and form nonpolar as well as polar surfaces, this cleft probably binds another molecule, possibly PBP1A or peptidoglycan. Truncation experiments confirmed that the EcLpoA C domain was sufficient for the activation of the EcPBP1A transpeptidase in vitro (8Typas A. Banzhaf M. van den Berg van Saparoea B. Verheul J. Biboy J. Nichols R.J. Zietek M. Beilharz K. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M. Breukink E. den Blaauwen T. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. Regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis by outer-membrane proteins.Cell. 2010; 143: 1097-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of H. influenzae LpoA (LpoA-N), which includes residues 26–256, was predicted, based on significant sequence similarity to other periplasmic proteins of known structure, to contain repeats of the tetratricopeptide (TPR)-like motif, a helix-turn-helix motif commonly involved in protein–protein interactions (16Vijayalakshmi J. Akerley B.J. Saper M.A. Structure of YraM, a protein essential for growth of Haemophilus influenzae.Proteins. 2008; 73: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This prediction was more or less borne out by the recent NMR structure of E. coli LpoA-N, which indeed showed adjacent helix-turn-helix motifs, but without the usual curvature associated with TPR-containing domains (19Jean N.L. Bougault C.M. Lodge A. Derouaux A. Callens G. Egan A.J. Ayala I. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Simorre J.P.

Knowledge of these structures by themselves appears to be insufficient for fully understanding how LpoA promotes PG synthesis. As the cell grows, PG hydrolases and amidases form holes in the sacculus to expose acceptor peptides for cross-linking to new strands (reviewed in Refs. 7Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W.

Strynadka N.C. Fortifying the wall: synthesis, regulation and degradation of bacterial peptidoglycan.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and turgor may cause these gaps to widen (22Turner R.D. Hurd A.F. Cadby A. Hobbs J.K. Foster S.J. Cell wall elongation mode in Gram-negative bacteria is determined by peptidoglycan architecture.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whereas movement of PBP1A is known to be controlled by the cytoskeletal actin-like protein MreB and associated inner membrane proteins MreC, MreD, RodA, and RodZ, what directs PBP1A specifically to the regions requiring new PG strands is unknown. As an outer membrane lipoprotein, LpoA would be in a position to sense the integrity of PG (2Turner R.D. Vollmer W. Foster S.J. Different walls for rods and balls: the diversity of peptidoglycan.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 91: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 123-136Crossref Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Only at gaps or holes could LpoA extend its C domain through the PG and activate PBP1A to insert and cross-link new PG strands. Consistent with this proposal, recent studies of E. coli LpoB (an activator of PBP1B but structurally unrelated to LpoA) predicted that its N-terminal ∼50 residues are unstructured and probably long enough to position the LpoB globular domain so that it can interact with PBP1B (23Egan A.J.

Chem. 2014; 289: 19245-19253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, from small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR data, Jean et al. (19Jean N.L. Bougault C.M. Lodge A. Derouaux A. Callens G. Egan A.J. Ayala I. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Simorre J.P.

But it remains unknown how such an elongated and rigid protein would be accommodated in the absence of a suitable PG hole and how this LpoA structure could adapt to different distances between the inner and outer membrane in different species. To clarify what structural elements of LpoA will allow it to pass through gaps in the PG and interact with PBP1A, we set out to provide experimentally determined structural data for an intact full-length LpoA. Here we present structures from three crystal forms of full-length H. influenzae LpoA, determined to resolutions of 2.0, 2.8, and 2.6 Å, as well as the crystal structure of its N domain (LpoA-N) to a resolution of 2.0 Å. Unlike the E. coli model (19Jean N.L. Bougault C.M. Lodge A. Derouaux A. Callens G. Egan A.J. Ayala I. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Simorre J.P. Elongated structure of the outer-membrane activator of peptidoglycan synthesis LpoA: implications for PBP1A stimulation.Structure. 2014; 22: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the full-length LpoA was not elongated in the crystals but forms a variable jaw-like structure. Also, the N domain assumed the canonical superhelical twist associated with other TPR-containing proteins. These structures provide insight into the possible role of the N domain and how conformational flexibility allows LpoA to adapt to different PG architectures. The crystal structure of the H. influenzae LpoA N-terminal domain (LpoA-N), containing LpoA residues 33–253 and selenomethionine in place of Met, was refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 0.18/0.22 for data extending to 1.95 Å resolution (see Table 1 and “Experimental procedures”). The crystal structure includes two independent LpoA-N molecules with residues 33–248 and 33–249, respectively. The two molecules superpose with an RMSD of 0.49 Å for 202 of 215 residues. The molecules are arranged N-to-C along a pseudo-43-screw axis (supplemental Fig. S1). The two molecules make intermolecular polar interactions between non-conserved residues on helices H2–H4 and H11-H12.Table 1Crystallographic data and refinementLpoA-N (SeMet, PDB: 4P29)LpoAOrt (PDB: 5KCN)LpoAMon (SeMet, PDB: 5VBG)LpoAMon2 (SeMet, PDB: 5VAT)BeamlineAPS DND-CAT 5IDAPS LS-CAT 21ID-GAPS LS-CAT 21ID-DAPS LS-CAT 21ID-DWavelength (Å)0.97930.97860.97931.0781Resolution range (Å)40.49–1.95 (2.02–1.95)aStatistics for the highest-resolution shell are shown in parentheses.29.67–1.97 (2.04–1.97)35.98–2.8 (2.9–2.8)34.37–2.6 (2.69–2.6)Space groupP212121P212121P21P21Unit cell a, b, c (Å)48.03, 51.18, 198.6165.87, 68.43, 128.4067.46, 69.35, 73.5884.94, 72.7, 120.57 α, β, γ (degrees)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 110.18, 9090, 94.42, 90Molecules/asymmetric unit2112Total reflections observed369,694272,803 (23,046)44,230 (1,319)107,514 (10,036)Unique reflections36,225 (3,587)bBijovet-related reflections are counted independently.41,937 (4,049)26,165 (1,065)bBijovet-related reflections are counted independently.72,310 (7,177)bBijovet-related reflections are counted independently.Multiplicity5.4 (4.7)6.5 (5.7)1.7 (1.2)1.5 (1.4)Data completeness (%)98.7 (99.9)99 (97)84.8 (34.8)81.8 (81.8)Mean I/σ(I)10.4 (3.1)23.70 (10.37)6.08 (1.81)6.22 (2.15)Wilson B-factor39.5031.0950.5547.95Rmerge0.07 (0.39)0.057 (0.16)0.0811 (0.254)0.0772 (0.351)RmeasNAcNA, not available.0.063 (0.17)0.113 (0.354)0.109 (0.495)CC½NA0.995 (0.987)0.988 (0.927)0.982 (0.667)CC*NA0.999 (0.997)0.997 (0.981)0.995 (0.894)Reflections used in refinement36,224 (3,585)41,902 (4,048)26,126 (1,064)72,308 (7,177)bBijovet-related reflections are counted independently.Reflections used for R-free1,808 (178)2,021 (196)1,371 (58)3,153 (299)bBijovet-related reflections are counted independently.Rwork0.184 (0.290)0.177 (0.207)0.205 (0.311)0.224 (0.330)Rfree0.219 (0.336)0.214 (0.241)0.246 (0.364)0.256 (0.373)CCworkNA0.957 (0.937)0.944 (0.715)0.940 (0.659)CCfreeNA0.931 (0.922)0.938 (0.561)0.951 (0.578)Non-hydrogen atoms3,7204,6054,2778,591 Protein3,4494,2094,2518,454 Ligands28120 Solvent24339524137Protein residues4315385431,082RMSD bonds (Å)0.0050.0040.0020.002RMSD angles (degrees)0.740.630.450.54Ramachandran favored (%)98989898.23Ramachandran allowed (%)1.91.72.61.77Ramachandran outliers (%)0000Rotamer outliers (%)1.90.2200.22Clash score1.431.791.062.85Average B-factor (Å2)56.6848.9051.4166.69 Protein56.7649.3651.4667.08 Ligands70.6429.8041.87 Solvent53.8444.0342.8342.56TLS groups8535a Statistics for the highest-resolution shell are shown in parentheses.b Bijovet-related reflections are counted independently.c NA, not available. Open table in a new tab The structure is predominantly helical, consisting of 14 α-helices (Fig. 1). Near the N terminus of the structure, there are two approximately antiparallel α-helices, H1 and H2, connected by a 5-residue β-like strand. These helices do not contact each other, but both straddle helix H3 lying beneath them. The H2-H3 loop (positions 53–58) in each molecule has poor electron density, but the path of the main chain could be discerned in molecule A. Helical pairs H3 and H4, H5 and H6, and H7 and H8 as well as H9 form 3½ tetratricopeptide repeat-like (TPR-like) helix-turn-helix motifs. They pack against each other in a canonical superhelical fashion to provide the protein with concave and convex surfaces (Fig. 1B). The 6-residue helix H10 is approximately perpendicular to H9 and is not part of a TPR-like motif. H11 and H12 form a TPR-like motif but do not participate in superhelical packing, as do the other helix-turn-helix motifs. The short C-terminal helices H13 and H14 precede what in the full-length LpoA molecule is the linker strand (residues 251–257) between the N and C domains (see below). The structure of HiLpoA-N can be considered as composed of two subdomains. Subdomain 1, composed of residues 33–148 (H1–H7), contains two three-helix bundles, H3–H5 and H5–H7, each having nonpolar residues at its core. In subdomain 2, residues 149–249, nonpolar side chains from H11 interact with those from H8–H10, and these helices interact with residues downstream to form a second nonpolar core that includes three Trp residues and other aromatic residues. Other than contacts between H7 and H8, there are few interactions between subdomain 1 and subdomain 2, which allows for flexibility within the N domain, as discussed below. This division of LpoA-N into two distinct subdomains is also suggested by a comparison of the HiLpoA-N crystal structure with the NMR structure of the E. coli LpoA N domain (19Jean N.L. Bougault C.M. Lodge A. Derouaux A. Callens G. Egan A.J. Ayala I. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Simorre J.P.

HiLpoA-N and EcLpoA-N have sequences that are 30% identical, and both form similar TPR-like motifs. However, whereas the structures of residues 33–149 and of 150–248 of HiLpoA-N are similar, respectively, to the equivalent regions in EcLpoA-N (Fig. 2, A and B), the orientation of these two regions relative to one another in the HiLpoA-N structure differs markedly from that in the EcLpoA-N structure, by a ∼45° rotation (Fig. 2C). This difference is consistent with the EcLpoA-N structure not showing the typical superhelical conformation of TPR-containing domains (19Jean N.L. Bougault C.M. Lodge A. Derouaux A. Callens G. Egan A.J. Ayala I. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Simorre J.P.

To identify the surfaces of LpoA-N that are conserved, we aligned the RP75 subset of LpoA sequences from the Pfam family PF04348 (accessed March 2014) (25Chen C. Natale D.A. Finn R.D. Huang H.

This alignment resulted in 74 sequences from 40 genera of γ-proteobacteria. This analysis, when including all of the sequences, revealed the LpoA N domain to have few conserved solvent-exposed residues (Fig. 1C). A small pocket on the convex side of LpoA-N surrounded by the highly conserved residues His-235, Ala-236, and Trp-204 was also found (arrow in Fig. 1C). The lack of conservation of the surface of the N-terminal domain stands in marked contrast to the C domain (see below). In the context of the full-length HiLpoA structure, the C domain has 4 times the percentage of solvent-exposed area considered highly conserved (magenta in Fig. 1C) compared with the N domain. The C domain has been shown in E. coli to be functionally indispensable for cell growth in an LpoA-dependent cell growth assay and for binding to EcPBP1A (8Typas A.

Also, this lack of conservation anywhere on the LpoA N-domain surface contrasts with an assessment that only included sequences from the Pasteurellaceae or Enterobacteriaceae families (Fig. 1, D and E). This latter assessment did reveal highly conserved regions, on the concave side of the N domain, including the loop between H3 and H4 (residues 76–78 and 81), the surface of H2 and H3, and the H9–H14 interface, including residues Gln-172, Asp-176, and Lys-243. The packing of TPR-like motifs in LpoA-N creates a groove on the concave surface directly over H7 with side chains from H3 and H5 and H8 and H9 forming the walls of the groove (Figs. 1B and 3 (A and B)). This groove is closed at one end by residues Asp-41, Arg-136, and Arg-170, which are located on the H1-H2 connector, H7, and H8, respectively (Fig. 3A). Arg-136 and Arg-71 are conserved in several bacterial families, and these two residues form a pocket directly under the H1-H2 connector at the closed end of the groove (Fig. 3C). A sulfate ion is bound in the pocket of the LpoA-N chain A molecule. Electron density at the same position in chain B could not be identified and was modeled as glycerol. Electrostatic calculations showed the LpoA-N cleft to have an overall positive charge (Fig. 3B), with the basic residues Arg-158, Arg-170, Arg-75, Arg-106, and Lys-177 facing this groove (Fig. 3C).

For example, the TPR domains in the peroxisomal import receptor PEX5 enable binding to a range of type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal motifs. A homolog of PEX5, tetratricopeptide repeat–containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b), binds to and functions as an auxiliary subunit of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN)–gated channels. Given the similarity between TRIP8b and PEX5, this difference in function raises the question of what mechanism accounts for their binding specificity. In this report, we found that the cyclic nucleotide–binding domain and the C terminus of the HCN channel are critical for conferring specificity to TRIP8b binding. We show that TRIP8b binds the HCN cyclic nucleotide–binding domain through a 37-residue domain and the HCN C terminus through the TPR domains. Using a combination of fluorescence polarization– and co-immunoprecipitation–based assays, we establish that binding at either site increases affinity at the other. Thus, allosteric coupling of the TRIP8b TPR domains both promotes binding to HCN channels and limits binding to type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2755532062,"Alternative splicing of the oncogene murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is induced in response to genotoxic stress. MDM2-ALT1, the major splice variant generated, is known to activate the p53 pathway and impede full-length MDM2’s negative regulation of p53. Despite this perceptible tumor-suppressive role, MDM2-ALT1 is also associated with several cancers. Furthermore, expression of MDM2-ALT1 has been observed in aggressive metastatic disease in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), irrespective of histological subtype. Therefore, we generated a transgenic MDM2-ALT1 mouse model that would allow us to investigate the effects of this splice variant on the progression of tumorigenesis. Here we show that when MDM2-ALT1 is ubiquitously expressed in p53 null mice it leads to increased incidence of spindle cell sarcomas, including RMS. Our data provide evidence that constitutive MDM2-ALT1 expression is itself an oncogenic lesion that aggravates the tumorigenesis induced by p53 loss. On the contrary, when MDM2-ALT1 is expressed solely in B-cells in the presence of homozygous wild-type p53 it leads to significantly increased lymphomagenesis (56%) when compared with control mice (27%). However, this phenotype is observable only at later stages in life (⩾18 months). Moreover, flow cytometric analyses for B-cell markers revealed an MDM2-ALT1-associated decrease in the B-cell population of the spleens of these animals. Our data suggest that the B-cell loss is p53 dependent and is a response mounted to persistent MDM2-ALT1 expression in a wild-type p53 background. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of an MDM2 splice variant as a critical modifier of both p53-dependent and -independent tumorigenesis, underscoring the complexity of MDM2 posttranscriptional regulation in cancer. Furthermore, MDM2-ALT1-expressing p53 null mice represent a novel mouse model of fusion-negative RMS."
https://openalex.org/W2754588286,"Bizumic et al. (2013) have recently shown that attitudes towards peace and war reflect two distinct constructs rather than two poles of a single dimension. We present an attempt at validating the French version of their 16-item Attitudes toward Peace and War Scale (APWS) on five distinct (mainly Belgian) French-speaking samples (total N = 808). Confirmatory factor and criterion validity analyses confirmed that attitudes toward peace and war, although negatively related, are distinct in terms of their antecedents and consequences. On the one hand, antecedents of attitudes toward peace included egalitarian ideological beliefs and empathic concern for others, and consequences included intentions to engage in pro-peace behaviors. On the other hand, antecedents of attitudes toward war included national identification and authoritarian ideological beliefs, and consequences included intentions to engage in pro-war behaviors. Furthermore, both attitudes toward peace and war were, respectively, negatively and positively related to (a right-wing) political orientation. Unexpectedly however, attitudes toward war were positively related to nonegalitarian ideological beliefs and were not related to personal distress. Scores on the translated scale were unrelated to socially desirable responding. In terms of known-groups validity, men had, respectively, more and less positive attitudes toward war and peace than women. Finally, based on exploratory factor analyses, the inclusion of some items for the factorial structure of the measure is questioned and a shortened form of the measure is validated. Overall, these findings are in line with Bizumic et al. and suggest that attitudes toward peace and war also reflect two distinct constructs in a French-speaking population."
https://openalex.org/W2587268718,"Multidimensional systems coupled via complex networks are widespread in nature and thus frequently invoked for a large plethora of interesting applications. From ecology to physics, individual entities in mutual interactions are grouped in families, homogeneous in kind. These latter interact selectively, through a sequence of self-consistently regulated steps, whose deeply rooted architecture is stored in the assigned matrix of connections. The asymptotic equilibrium eventually attained by the system, and its associated stability, can be assessed by employing standard nonlinear dynamics tools. For many practical applications, it is however important to externally drive the system towards a desired equilibrium, which is resilient, hence stable, to external perturbations. To this end we here consider a system made up of N interacting populations which evolve according to general rate equations, bearing attributes of universality. One species is added to the pool of interacting families and used as a dynamical controller to induce novel stable equilibria. Use can be made of the root locus method to shape the needed control, in terms of intrinsic reactivity and adopted protocol of injection.

Several general mechanisms for toxin function have been established, but the extent to which previously uncharacterized toxins utilize these mechanisms is unknown. A study of an Escherichia coli pertussis-like toxin demonstrates that this protein acts on a known toxin substrate but displays distinct and dual chemoselectivity, suggesting this E. coli pertussis-like toxin may serve as a unique tool to study G-protein signaling in eukaryotic cells.

Structure–function analyses of a pertussis-like toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli reveal a distinct mechanism of inhibition of trimeric G-proteinsJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 292Issue 36PreviewPertussis-like toxins are secreted by several bacterial pathogens during infection. They belong to the AB5 virulence factors, which bind to glycans on host cell membranes for internalization. Host cell recognition and internalization are mediated by toxin B subunits sharing a unique pentameric ring-like assembly. Although the role of pertussis toxin in whooping cough is well-established, pertussis-like toxins produced by other bacteria are less studied, and their mechanisms of action are unclear. Full-Text PDF Open Access Bacterial pathogens utilize a variety of strategies to attack their host. One strategy is the release of protein toxins that catalyze post-translational modifications (PTMs) 2The abbreviations used are: PTM, posttranslational modification; EcPlt, E. coli-pertussis-like toxin; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor. 2The abbreviations used are: PTM, posttranslational modification; EcPlt, E. coli-pertussis-like toxin; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor. of host proteins; these PTMs then interfere with a central biological function to elicit a pathological phenotype. For example, protein toxins targeting components of the actin cytoskeleton can modulate motility, toxins targeting components of the ribosome and accessory factors can disrupt protein synthesis, and toxins targeting G-proteins, including monomeric G-proteins and heterotrimeric G proteins, can influence cell growth and metabolism (1.Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. Bacterial cytotoxins: targeting eukaryotic switches.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This functional diversity can come even in the context of conserved structural elements, providing motivation to characterize novel toxins with the goal of gaining insights into bacterial function, identifying possible novel mechanisms of pathogenesis and discovering unique tools to dissect eukaryotic signaling pathways. A new study from Littler et al. (2.Littler D.R. Ang S.Y. Moriel D.G. Kocan M. Kleifeld O. Johnson M.D. Tran M.T. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Summers R. Schrembri M. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T.T. Structure–function analyses of a pertussis-like toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli reveal a distinct mechanism of inhibition of trimeric G-proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 15143-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) provides a compelling example in these respects, describing the structural and functional characterization of an Escherichia coli toxin that acts via an unusual mechanism to cause an unexpected cellular outcome. The most common PTMs catalyzed by protein toxins are glucosylation, deadenylation, proteolysis, and ADP-ribosylation, in which toxins catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to host proteins (3.Simon N.C. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. Novel bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins: structure and function.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Two archetypical examples of ADP-ribosylating toxins act on components of heterotrimeric G-proteins: Cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates Gαs, enforcing an activated conformation that alters ion transport and water flow leading to diarrhea (4.Vanden Broeck D. Horvath C. De Wolf M.J. Vibrio cholerae: cholera toxin.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates Gαi, blocking the ability of Gαi to interact with its associated receptor, resulting in whooping cough and alterations in cell migration behavior (5.West Jr., R.E. Moss J. Vaughan M. Liu T. Liu T.Y. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of transducin. Cysteine 347 is the ADP-ribose acceptor site.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14428-14430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured cells, cholera toxin stimulates cell elongation, whereas pertussis toxin stimulates cell clustering, phenotypes that are specific for each toxin and thus can be used to identify toxin action. ADP-ribosylating toxins, including cholera and pertussis toxin, use a conserved “AB” architecture, where A is the modifying enzyme and B binds cell surface receptors and mediates internalization of A. The specific details of the A and B structures, however, can vary. For example, diphtheria toxin is a single chain AB protein that is proteolytically cleaved to create a disulfide-linked N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal translocation receptor-binding domain. Cholera toxin is an AB5 protein where the catalytic A1 domain is linked to an A2 domain that inserts noncovalently into the channel of a B pentamer. Although the catalytic A domains of the ADP-ribosylating toxins share limited primary amino acid homology, they share overall three-dimensional structure and contain several conserved amino acids, including an active site glutamic acid (6.Carroll S.F. McCloskey J.A. Crain P.F. Oppenheimer N.J. Marschner T.M. Collier R.J. Photoaffinity labeling of diphtheria toxin fragment A with NAD: structure of the photoproduct at position 148.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a result, scanning genomes for A and B sequences can point not only to uncharacterized toxins, but what the likely structure, and potential function, of the toxin might be. Extra-intestinal E. coli, including the uropathogenic E. coli and neonatal meningitis E. coli, normally reside in the gut but can damage the host when they invade other systems, such as the urinary tract or nervous system, respectively. Similar to Vibrio cholera, Bordetella pertussis, and pathogenic E. coli such as enterotogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli, extra-intestinal E. coli are known to encode AB5 toxins, but whether these toxins are functional and whether their functions follow established mechanisms are unknown. To study this question, Littler et al. (2.Littler D.R. Ang S.Y. Moriel D.G. Kocan M. Kleifeld O. Johnson M.D. Tran M.T. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Summers R. Schrembri M. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T.T. Structure–function analyses of a pertussis-like toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli reveal a distinct mechanism of inhibition of trimeric G-proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 15143-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) queried whole and partial E. coli genomes in the NCBI database using known E. coli A and B gene sequences and found a group of genes encoding AB5 toxins related to pertussis toxin that the authors termed E. coli-pertussis-like toxins (EcPlt), which were subjected to biological and biochemical characterization. Purified EcPlt elicited a pertussis toxin-like clustering of cultured cells, and the isolated A domain of EcPlt (EcPltA) ADP-ribosylated a 41-kDa host protein with the same molecular weight as pertussis toxin-treated Gαi proteins, suggesting some functional conservation. Introduction of a point mutation to the presumed active site glutamic acid (E118D) in EcPltA also reduced activity by 1000-fold, consistent with Glu-118 being the conserved active site residue within this family of toxins. EcPlt also diverged from pertussis toxin in several ways: A systemic assessment of substrate specificity showed that EcPltA ADP-ribosylated each of the three Gαi isoenzymes, but with slightly different preferences to that of pertussis toxin. Unexpectedly, mass spectrometry analysis showed that EcPltA ADP-ribosylated one of these isoenzymes, Gαi3, at Lys-345 and Asn-347, rather than at Cys-351 ribosylated by pertussis toxin or indeed any of the Cys residues present in native Gαi3. Although there are precedents from other protein toxins and the endogenous host transferase to ADP-ribosylate multiple sites within a protein (7.Ganesan A.K. Mende-Mueller L. Selzer J. Barbieri J.T. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S, a double ADP-ribosyltransferase, resembles vertebrate mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9503-9508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), EcPlt is unique in modifying both Lys and Asn amino acids. Mutagenesis studies suggested the two sites could both be necessary for a concerted mechanism of substrate recognition, the details of which will be fascinating to learn. The authors then tested the impact of EcPlt in a cellular assay of forskolin-mediated G protein recruitment to GPCRs, in which mutation of the pertussis toxin modification site Cys-351 prevents pertussis toxin from blocking recruitment. In the case of EcPlt, however, the authors observed only a modest rescue provided by the N347A mutation and no obvious rescue provided by the K345A mutation. These limited effects may reflect the intrinsic differences between agonist activation and forskolin activation or may suggest Lys-345 and Asn-347 modifications affect Gαi action by a different mechanism than Cys-351 modification, possibly uncoupling G-protein signaling through different contacts with the G-protein-coupled receptor. Finally, Littler et al. (2.Littler D.R. Ang S.Y. Moriel D.G. Kocan M. Kleifeld O. Johnson M.D. Tran M.T. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Summers R. Schrembri M. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T.T. Structure–function analyses of a pertussis-like toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli reveal a distinct mechanism of inhibition of trimeric G-proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 15143-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) solved the crystal structure of EcPlt at 2.4 Å (Fig. 1), which demonstrates structural homology, and possibly functional homology, with typhoid toxin (8.Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A2B5 typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Structural comparisons of EcPlt in the inactive oxidized state and the activated reduced state, containing a Cys-41–Cys-192 disulfide bond, further showed how EcPlt is activated via movement of the activation loop to expose the NAD-binding domain. This activation mechanism is different than that of cholera toxin (9.Mekalanos J.J. Collier R.J. Romig W.R. Enzymic activity of cholera toxin. II. Relationships to proteolytic processing, disulfide bond reduction, and subunit composition.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5855-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may provide insight into the less studied activation mechanisms of typhoid toxin and other pertussis-like toxins. The study from Littler et al. (2.Littler D.R. Ang S.Y. Moriel D.G. Kocan M. Kleifeld O. Johnson M.D. Tran M.T. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Summers R. Schrembri M. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T.T. Structure–function analyses of a pertussis-like toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli reveal a distinct mechanism of inhibition of trimeric G-proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 15143-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) provides exciting new information on the molecular and biophysical properties of an understudied subset of AB5 toxins. In addition to raising questions about the basis of chemoselectivity and revealing new conformational pathways, EcPlt may offer another benefit: Pertussis toxin has proven a useful reagent to dissect not only the molecular basis for the pathogenesis of Bordetella pertussis, but also to dissect the basis for GPCR signaling (10.Moss J. Bruni P. Hsia J.A. Tsai S.C. Watkins P.A. Halpern J.L. Burns D.L. Kanaho Y. Chang P.P. Hewlett E.L. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation: effects on the coupling of inhibitory receptors to the adenylate cyclase system.J. Recept. Res. 1984; 4: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because EcPlt may have a different basis for uncoupling G-protein signaling, EcPlt may provide a new tool to continue dissection of this important eukaryotic signaling pathway."
