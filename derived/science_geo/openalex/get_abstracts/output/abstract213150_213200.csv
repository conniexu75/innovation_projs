https://openalex.org/W2059991147,"A simple waterfall sequence is proposed to explain the function of the various protein clotting factors during the formation of the fibrin clot. When clotting is initiated, each clotting factor except fibrinogen is converted to a form that has enzymatic activity. This activation occurs in a stepwise sequence with each newly formed enzyme reacting with its specific substrate, converting it to an active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1977432502,"Changes in the physical flutter rate of a clicking sound induce simultaneous changes in the apparent flicker rate of a flashing light. For example, for one observer a flicker with a frequency of 10 cycles per second was driven downward to as low as 7 cycles per second and upward to as high as 22 cycles per second by changing the rate of initially synchronous auditory clicks. The reverse does not occur-changes in the flicker rate do not induce changes in apparent flutter rates."
https://openalex.org/W2075313013,The contents of the lamelar bodies of granular pneumocytes are normally released into the alveolar lumen. Exposure of guinea pigs to an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide causes the formation of abnormal lamellar bodies and a significant increase in the pulmonary surface tension. The eventual return to a normal pulmonary surface tension coincides with the formation of normal lamellar bodies.
https://openalex.org/W2071722434,"Intravenously administered 7S antibody is more effective than 19S antibody in inhibiting the formation of antibody to bacteriophage X174. Since considerable amounts of 7S antibody are needed for inhibition, serum antibody formation may act as a ""feedback"" mechanism to prevent hyperimmunization."
https://openalex.org/W1984951386,"When leukocytes from pairs of unrelated human subjects are mixed and cultured for several days, blast-like cells appear that are capable of DNA synthesis and mitosis. This reaction can be estimated quantitatively by measuring the uptake of tritiated thymidine in the cultures. In experiments with 15 sibling pairs, the leukocytes of most individuals reacted less strongly with those of their siblings than with those of an unrelated subject."
https://openalex.org/W2042295272,"Cytoplasmic inclusions in the special pulmonary alveolar cells of adult, newborn, and fetal rats were investigated by electron microscopy and histochemistry, and lung extracts were analyzed for surface-tension activity. The inclusions were positive in the periodic acid-Schiff test after digestion with diastase and were not stained with toluidine blue; they formed myelin figures and possessed alkaline phosphatase activity. Both the typical surface tension activity and the inclusions developed 2 days before birth. These properties differentiated the inclusions from mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2039895531,"House flies (Musca domestica) raised under sterile conditions on a diet lacking carotenoids and retinol (vitamin A) have visual receptor sensitivities -as assessed electroretinographically-which average more than 2 log units below normal, both in the near ultraviolet (340 mmicro) and visible (500 mmicro) regions of the spectrum. Loss of sensitivity can be prevented by the addition of beta-carotene to the larval food. Flies reared for several generations on a carotenoid-free diet, but under conditions where the adults are not kept sterile, do not show a further loss of sensitivity. It is suggested that carotenoid stored in the egg prevents complete blindness in the first generation, and that microorganisms can supply small amounts of carotenoid and thereby prevent complete blindness in the second and successive generations."
https://openalex.org/W2016577326,"Computer-averaged evoked potentials were recorded to visual stimuli of constant duration and varying luminance, as well as to flashes whose luminance and duration varied reciprocally. With constant duration, the latency, amplitude, and waveform of the evoked response varied as a function of luminance. The effects of decreasing the luminance on amplitude and waveform of the responses can be balanced by increasing the duration of the flash. This reciprocity between luminance and duration suggests a relationship between apparent brightness and evoked potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2046518191,"Evidence is presented indicating that the repetitive turning on and off of reinforcing brain stimulation is not a special property of restricted hypothalamic and tegmental areas. Results from a sample of 22 diverse hypothalamic, septal, amygdala, and hippocampal sites suggest that such behavior can be obtained from most neural areas from which self-stimulation behavior may be elicited. Questions thus arise about the location of aversive neural systems when aversion is considered as being expressed by the act of terminating positively reinforcing brain stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1984410284,"7-Hydroxychlorpromazine was isolated from liver and urine of psychiatric patients treated with high dosages of chlorpromazine for long periods. These patients developed a purple pigmentation limited to areas of skin exposed to sunlight, as well as opacities of the cornea and lens. Large amounts of melanin were found only in the pigmented skin. It seems likely that a toxic compound is produced by the action of ultraviolet light on a 7-hydroxylated chlorpromazine derivative deposited in skin, cornea, and lens, and that this in turn leads to excessive melanin production and eye changes."
https://openalex.org/W2052500016,Analysis of data from 80 families and 369 unrelated individuals confirms the hypothesis that human red cell acid phosphatase phenotypes are determined by three codominant alleles at a single autosomal locus. Further confirmation is afforded by the finding of the predicted sixth phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W1970139752,A communication task was developed to investigate the processes by which a speaker selects verbal clues in order to distinguish one word (referent) from another (nonreferent) and the processes by which a listener identifies the speaker's referent word. Data from speakers and listeners in this task were linked to word-association norms by means of a stochastic model.
https://openalex.org/W2071781661,"Preparation of starch granules from the developing seeds of 17 different waxy mutants of maize all transfer glucose from adenosine diphosphate-glucose to starch at about one-tenth of the rate of similar preparations from seeds of non-waxy maize. The source of most, if not all, of the activity in preparations from waxy mutants is a limited number of enzymatically active starch granules from the embryo and maternal tissue of the seed. All starch granules in these tissues appear to be enzymatically active. The endosperm which is the site of most starch synthesis and storage is apparently devoid of transferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057199291,"Callus tissue derived from mature embryos of the endive, Cichorium endivia Linn. (family Compositae) grows and develops chlorophyll on a completely defined nutrient medium. The tissue breaks up into a thick suspentsion of cells and cell groups in a liquid medium kept in a flask on a shaker. Gradually, many small round masses of tissue, designated here as embryoids, are formed; these become differentiated and organized to form numnerous small plantlets having typical curled and fringed green leaves and roots."
https://openalex.org/W2083201120,"The calvarium and scalp markedly attenuate the amplitude, but do not alter the latency or frequency, of somatosensory responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the contralateral median nerve in man. With scalp electrodes no significant potentials are obtained that are not also present in the epidural recordings when proper averaging techniques are used. The somatosensory-evoked response recorded with scalp electrodes in man appears to be the result of brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W1995353197,"Cardiac muscle fibers are made up of individual cells joined end to end; it has been suggested that the action potential must be conducted from cell to cell by some specialized mechanism. The alternative is that the electrical resistance is low at the junctions between the cells, so that the fiber behaves like a cable. The shape and time course of the foot of the action potential and the conduction velocity in the frog ventricle fit the predictions made from the cable theory."
https://openalex.org/W2039330924,"The venom of Myrmecia gulosa (Myrmeciinae, Formicidae) is of a proteinaceous type and is separated by electrophoresis into eight components. The venom contains histamine, a hyaluronidase, and a direct hemolytic factor. It also shows kinin-like activity. In structure the venom apparatus is found to be massively formed internally as well as externally. It is distinguished from the apparatus of representatives of other ant subfamilies by characteristics of the free gland filaments, the reservoir wall, the intra-reservoir glandular area, and the accessory gland."
https://openalex.org/W2041525575,"In Escherichia coli cells ionizing radiation produces a degradation of DNA to approximately 50 percent of the total amount originally insoluble in trichloroacetic acid. There is also a reduction of synthesis. Oxygen inhibits the degradation process by a dose reduction factor of 4 and the synthesis process by a factor of approximately 1.5. Thus, at relatively low doses, radiation action on bacteria is very probably mediated through the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1995275825,"Eight hypnotist-experimenters administered a standardized suggestibility test to subjects under two separate experimental conditions. The experimenters understood the problem of experimenter bias, knew that they were being checked, and felt that they had treated both groups alike, yet judges were able to tell under which condition the subjects were tested by listening to the performances of the experimenters."

https://openalex.org/W1989962993,"Incubation of the ovaries of rats and mice with the proteolytic enzyme ""pronase"" caused the step by step dispersal of cellular elements from the tissue. The first subunits to be liberated were the outermost follicles or corpora lutea or both. Next, these subunits were dispersed. It is possible to obtain isolated single follicles in all stages of development: corpora lutea, isolated cell layers from within follicles, suspensions containing free cells, and ova in all phases of maturation."

https://openalex.org/W2059244092,"Particles resembling adenovirus were recovered from tumors induced by adenovirus-12. The particles were similar to incomplete adenovirus in size, subunit morphology, and density. The presence of such incomplete viral units helps to explain why attempts to isolate infectious virus from adenovirus-induced tumors have failed despite the serological evidence that viral elements are present."
https://openalex.org/W1984797186,The mean cross-sectional area of Haversian systems in adult human ribs tends to be constant in the face of sevenfold changes in the rates at which these systems are made. This implies that different mechanisms control the total amount of cellular work in making Haversian systems and the rate at which this work is performed.
https://openalex.org/W1978511901,"Cyanide and phenethyl alcohol greatly enhance the lethal action of mitomycin C, porfiromycin, and streptonigrin on an exponentially growing culture of Escherichia coli. Dinitrophenol similarly enhances the lethal action of mitomycin C and porfiromycin, but only slightly that of streptonigrin. Phenethyl alcohol may be functioning in these experiments as an inhibitor of electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W2091275489,"Axons of the Chilean giant squid were subjected to continuous intracellular perfusion with either potassium- or sodium-rich salt solutions. In axons immersed in natural sea water and internally perfused with potassium glutamate solution, action potentials which exceeded 160 millivolts were often observed. The resting potential did not vary appreciably with the internal concentration of potassium glutamate. With perfusing solutions containing sodium aspartate or sodium glutamate, action potentials were observed which exceeded the value calculated from the Nernst equation applied to sodium-ion activity. Nervous conduction could be maintained more than 1 hour with equal concentrations of sodium inside and outside the axon."

https://openalex.org/W1976586784,"The snail hosts of schistosomiasis have found ideal conditions for rapid colonization in many irrigation and drainage canal systems. By studying the hydrodynamic aspects of snail dislodgment it may be possible to devise a control method based on engineering the snail's microenvironment. For Australorbis glabratus, a velocity exceeding 33 cm/sec at shell height produces a hydrodynamic drag force sufficient to dislodge the snail from its position on the solid boundary of a canal."
https://openalex.org/W2037149111,"Hypnotized subjects who report hallucinating a visual situation which would ordinarily elicit optokinetic nystagmus demonstrate nystagmus under these conditions. They and control subjects are unable to feign nystagmus in the waking state, either by imagining the situation or by direct efforts to simulate the eye movements. Thus an objective criterion is provided for the presence of visual hallucinations."
https://openalex.org/W2047453182,"To investigate traits differentiating highly creative research scientists from less creative ones, a questionnaire was sent to 740 male scientists (400 chemists and 340 psychologists). Half of each group had achieved eminence as research scientists; the other half had not achieved research eminence, but were matched on relevant variables. Results indicated that creative scientists are more dominant than less creative ones, that they have more initiative, and are more strongly motivated toward intellectual success."
https://openalex.org/W2090924340,"Forty-two chromosomes were counted from expanded cultured cells of four Celebes apes, Cynopithecus niger. Mitotic cells from three Indian langurs, Presbytis entellus, contained 44 chromosomes. These counts support cytogenetically the taxonomical classification of these animals according to Simpson."
https://openalex.org/W2066588488,"Mouse lymphomas induced by Moloney virus were compared with regard to their ability to elicit humoral antibodies against Moloney cells, to sensitize against Moloney isografts, and to respond to established isograft resistance. The first two properties were parallel, while the third was independent. The former, but not the latter, is attributed to the release of infectious virus."
https://openalex.org/W2009267230,A mutant of Escherichia coli has been isolated in which potassium transport and methionine biosynthesis are both impaired. Studies on the nutritional requirements of this organism suggest that the cystathionine cleavage enzyme is impaired. Experiments in low-potassium medium showed that the mutant was unable to maintain the usual high cell potassium concentration. Studies that were made of the mutant and its revertants suggested that a single genetic event was responsible.

https://openalex.org/W2086447082,Rabbits were immunized with hyaluronateprotein isolated from normal or pathological synovial fluids. Immunoelectrophoresis of hyaluroni-dase-digested pathological hyaluronateprotein and its antiserum showed a single precipitin arc extending through both alpha globulin zones. Digested normal hyaluronateprotein formed no lines with either its antiserum or with that to pathological hyaluronateprotein. The antigenic component present in pathological hyaluronateprotein formed a reaction of complete fusion with a serum protein which was identified by immunoelectrophoresis as an alpha globulin.
https://openalex.org/W2027045415,"A new strain of Staphylococcus aureus, implicated in severe ""hospital-acquired"" infections, has been recognized and identified. This strain is characterized by lysis with a recently isolated bacteriophage, UC-18. Resistance to penicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline combined with widespread prevalence in the hospital environment make S. aureus UC-18 a significant contributor to endemic staphylcoccal disease in hospitals."

https://openalex.org/W1970508100,"Isotropic hydrogen atom thermal parameters for N,N′-hexamethylenebispropionamide have been determined. They show a definite trend and vary from approximately the same as the mean thermal parameters for atoms other than hydrogen near the center of the molecule to appreciably greater for atoms near the end. The indicated trend for this compound, along with other results, provides the basis for a possible explanation of the anomolous values that have been obtained for hydrogen atom thermal parameters."

https://openalex.org/W2053980806,"An examination of possible sources of radioiodine found in samples of milk in the midwestern states during May and early June 1962 shows that atmospheric testing at Christmas Island was the principal contributor to incidents of significant concentrations of iodine-131 in milk (exceeding 300 picocuries per liter). Underground testing at Nevada played at most only a minor role during this period. There is a cause-and-effect relationship between the penetration of thunderstorms into high concentrations of nuclear debris in the lower stratosphere and the subsequent amount of iodine-131 in milk. Analyses of samples of rainwater confirm the importance of this ""scavenging"" mechanism. The relative contributions of atmospheric and underground testing to the iodine-131 found in milk samples from September 1961 to December 1963 has been reviewed and only one incident in which the amount of iodine-131 exceeded 300 picocuries per liter could be attributed to an underground test."
https://openalex.org/W2001427037,The uptake by red cells of I(131)-labeled nonagglutinating antibody to the Rh(0)(D) factor was dependent on the proportion of cells to antibody during sensitization. Inhibition of antibody binding by red cells in the region of antibody excess occurred with Rh(0)(D) positive red cells that were both papain modified and untreated; the inhibition was independent of the Rh phenotype.
https://openalex.org/W1973721076,"Evoked responses, recorded from the visual cortex, are enhanced during positive (head to tail) acceleration, and during cerebral hypotension induced by hemorrhage. The phenomenon observed during positive acceleration may therefore be due, at least in part, to its hypotensive effect, but the increased somatic stimulation must also be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2056532468,"The relation between the worldwide deposition of strontium-90, as calculated by many investigators over the last decade, and that observed in rainfall in New York City has been relatively constant. On the average, for each millicurie of strontium-90 per square mile deposited in New York City, 0.055 megacurie has been deposited on the earth's total surface. Cumulative deposits of strontium-90 on the earth's surface at various intervals over the last 10 years have been computed from this ratio. From the mean quarterly fraction of the annual strontium-90 fallout in New York City for the last 9 years, the worldwide deposition of this nuclide, equal to 2.48 megacuries, is predicted for 1964."
