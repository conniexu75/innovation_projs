https://openalex.org/W2003266654,"Electron microscopic and biochemical studies demonstrate that the fundamental structure of chromatin depleted of lysine-rich histones is composed of a flexible chain of spherical particles (nucleosomes), about 125 A in diameter, connected by DNA filaments. Such a chromatin preparation can be separated by centrifugation into two fractions which differ in the spacing of the nucleosomes; In one fraction almost all of the DNA is condensed in nucleosomes, while the other fraction contains long stretches of free DNA connecting regions where the nucleosomes are closely packed. The isolated nucleosomes contain about 200 base pairs of DNA and the four histones F2alpha1, F2alpha2, and F2b, and F3 in an overall histone/DNA ratio of 0.97; In such a structure the DNA is compacted slightly more than five times from its extended length; The same basic structure can be visualized in chromatin spilling out of lysed nuclei. However, in this latter case the nucleosomes are very closely packed, suggesting that histone F1 is involved in the superpacking of DNA in chromosomes and nuclei. The chromatin fiber appears to be a self-assembling structure, since the nucleosomal arrangement can be reconstituted in vitro from DNA and the four histones F2alpha1, F2alpha2, F2b and F3 only, irrespective of their cellular origin."
https://openalex.org/W1604863183,"The effects of choline, ethanolamine and its N-methyl analogs, different fatty acids, and L-methionine on phospholipid biosynthesis via the CDP-ester pathways and the methylation pathway were studied in rat hepatocytes. Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis was stimulated severalfold by 0.02 to 0.1 mM ethanolamine, especially in the presence of long chain unsaturated fatty acids. At higher concentrations of ethanolamine, phosphorylethanolamine accumulated but the level of CDP-ethanolamine and the rate of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis did not increase further. The rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the CDP-ester pathway responded in a way analogous to that of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis upon the addition of choline and fatty acid, except that a 10- to 20-fold higher concentration of choline was required for maximal stimulation, probably due to the rapid oxidation of choline to betaine. Phospholipids containing N-monomethyl- or N,N-dimethylethanolamine were efficiently formed from the corresponding free bases in the absence of ethanolamine and choline. Ethanolamine, but not other bases, inhibited completely phospholipid formation from N-monomethylethanolamine, probably as a result of competition at the level of CDP-ester formation. The data indicate that the cytidylytransferase reactions are rate-limiting steps in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine and probably also phosphatidylcholine. In addition, the availability of diacylglycerol and its fatty acid composition may significantly affect the rate of phospholipid synthesis. The rate of phosphatidylcholine formation via phospholipid N-methylation approximately doubled when L-methionine was added at concentrations similar to that in rat plasma. Under these conditions the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis via this pathway was 20 to 40 percent of that via diacylglycerols and CDP-choline. The methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine remained essentially constant when the rate of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis was varied 8-fold, but was significantly reduced when the formation of N-monomethyl- or N,N-dimethylphospholipid was stimulated by addition of the corresponding base. These phospholipids not only replaced phosphatidylethanolamine as the substrate for methylation but also increased the rate of phosphatidylcholine formation via this pathway. A method for the determination of nanomole amounts of different ethanolamine compounds is described."
https://openalex.org/W1577436652,"Metabolically stable GTP analogues were 10 to 40 times more potent activators of DL-isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) from pigeon erythrocyte membranes that GTP. The order of effectiveness was guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) greater than guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) greater than guanylyl methylenediphosphonate (Gpp(CH2)p greater than GTP. In contrast to activation with GTP, activation by analogues was independent of ATP concentration. The analogues seem to bind, however, to the same regulatory sites in membrane preparations to which GTP is bound but with higher affinity; Kdiss for (14C)Gpp-(nh)p and (3H)Gpp(CH2)p and membranes was 0.7 and 2.4 x 10-7 M, respectively. DL-Isoproterenol did not increase the amount of guanylnucleotide bound, it merely accelerated and potentiated activation. Bound radioactive GTP analogues were recovered unchanged from the membrane pellet. This and mutual displacement of analogues and GTP ruled out covalent attachment of the whole or of part of the nonphosphorylating GTP analogues. Treatment of the membrane preparation with Gpp(NH)p effectively (greater than 80%) protected DL-isoproterenol-activated adenylate cyclase against the action of Filipin or Lubrol PX. Activation of membrane-bound adenylate cyclase with GTP analogues resulted in a stable enzyme which could be nearly completely resolved from membranes with Lubrol PX and stripped of lipids and detergent without loss of activity. This effect was synergistically amplified by DL-isoproterenol. A protein fraction with an apparent molecular weight of 230,000, containing about 90% of (14C)Gpp(NH)p originally bound to membranes, could be solubilized and separated from adenylate cyclase activity by chromatography on Sepharose 4B. The binding protein was purified about 40- to 80-fold from activated membranes. Removal of the nucleotide binding protein was also achieved by affinity chromatography with GTP gamma S coupled to Sepharose via a spacer. When membranes which were not or only weakly and reversibly activated (with GMP) were used as source of the soluble preparation, removal of the binding protein resulted in 75% loss of Gpp(NH)p activation without change in basal and Mg2+/F-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. It is assumed that the GTP analogues cause an unphysiological, irreversible activation of membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, because, in contrast to the natural guanylnucleotides whose action they mimic, they are metabolically inert and bound quasi-irreversibly to regulatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1495461055,"An in vitro system of guinea pig pancreatic lobules convenient for the study of secretory processes is described in this paper. In this system: (a) the over-all glandular architecture of the tissue is preserved: lobules remain morphologically intact through 5 hours; (b) amylase discharge from unstimulated lobules is low (similar to 4%/hour) and linear over the 5 hours tested; (c) response to carbamylcholine chloride (10-5 M) is energy-dependent, rapid, and extensive (92% discharge of amylase by 5 hours); (d) initial rates of discharge remain stable over the first 3 hours; and (e) no autoactivation of zymogens occurs in incubation medium or tissue. The activation of four zymogens, i.e. chymotrypsinogen, trypsinogen, and procarboxypeptidases A and B, was studied using the following criteria for optimal activation: (a) maximal activation attainable under experimental conditions; (b) stability at the level of maximal activation; and (c) linear relationship between amounts of protein activated and enzyme activity elicited by activation. The concentration of activators (trypsin or enterokinase) and secretory protein, the presence or agents (bovine plasma albumin or Triton X-100) which minimize adsorptive losses of secretory protein on glass or plastic surfaces, and the temperature at which activation is carried out were found to be critical and different for each of the zymogens tested. The kinetics of the appearance of three enzyme activities (amylase, lipase, and ribonuclease) and four potential proteolytic activities (chymotrypsinogen, trypsinogen, and procarboxypeptidases A and B) into the incubation medium was studied under different conditions; i.e. rest and stimulation with various secretogogues (carbamylcholine chloride, caerulein, and pancreozymin). All seven activities estimated to represent similar to 75% of the secretory protein output of the exocrine pancreas were discharged in synchrony and in constant proportions and were released from the tissue to the same extent under each experimental condition investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1574862531,"A number of intact and partially degraded immunoglobulin glycopeptides have been tested for their ability to interact with concanavalin A. The degraded glycopeptides were prepared by using purified glycosidases to remove sugar residues from the nonreducing ends of the oligosaccharide chains of intact glycopeptides. A quantitative and sensitive assay was devised to measure the potency of the glycopeptides as haptene inhibitors of 125I-concanavalin A binding to guinea pig erythrocytes. The most potent haptene, derived from an immunoglobulin G glycopeptide, had a branched chain oligosaccharide with two GlcNAc (see article) Man (see article) nonreducing termini linked to a mannose residue in the core. The other very potent glycopeptide was an immunoglobulin E high mannose glycopeptide which contained 3 terminal alpha-mannose residues and 1 internal 2-O-mannose residue. Removal of terminal beta-N-acetylglucosamine residues or alpha-mannose residues reduced the activity of these and other glycopeptides as inhibitors of 125I-concanavalin A binding. It was concluded that the ability of these glycopeptides to interact with concanavalin A is dependent on their content of terminal beta-N-acetylglucosamine residues, terminal alpha-mannose residues, and also internal mannose residues substituted on the C-2 hydroxyl group, and that the saccharide combining site of concanavalin A must be able to bind several sugar residues."
https://openalex.org/W1590626758,"Conversion of 14C-labeled linoleic acid to dihomo-gamma-linolenic and arachidonic acids, precursors of the PG1 and PG2 series of prostaglandins, was examined in a number of mammalian cell lines in tissue culture. Diploid cells converted linoleate to arachidonate in good yield. Heteroploid or transformed cells did not desaturate linoleic acid but readily converted dihomo-gamma-[14C]linolenate to arachidonate. These observations demonstrate that separate delta6 and delta5 desaturases are involved in the conversion of linoleic to arachidonic acid in mammals. The results indicate that loss or modification of the delta6 desaturase system is a frequent occurrence in transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1519693306,"The multiple equilibria for the binding of a ligand A by a macromolecule P with n binding sites may be formulated in terms of a stoichiometric analysis or on the basis of a site-oriented scrutiny. The dependence of binding on ligand concentration can always be correlated in terms of n stoichiometric binding constants,Ki, even if there are interactions between sites that accentuate or attenuate binding affinities. A corresponding correlation in terms of site binding constants, kj, under the most general circumstances depends on the definition of n2n-1 different constants of which 2n-1 are independent. If experimental data are correlated in terms of n parameters kalpha, kbeta ... klambda in an equation of the site-binding form, (see article for formular) then there is no guarantee that the values of ka, kb, etc., have any unique relationships to site binging constants. Examples are given to illustrate this point. Equation are derived for relating stoichiometric binding constants to site binding constants, for the general case and for various special circumstances. These equations make it possible to define and analyze binding insystems with interactions and conformational accommodations. Accordingly, a graphical procedure is described (in which iKi is plotted against i, the stoichiometric binding step) that provides an affinity profile for concise representation of magnitudes of binding constants and for detecting interactions that accentuate or attenuate site binding affinities."

https://openalex.org/W2104941134,"SUMMARY A method is described for purification of sulfhydryl oxidase from bovine milk which consistently yields preparations with greater than 3000-fold purification over skim milk. A concentration-dependent association-dissociation of the enzyme was adapted to the development of an isolation procedure. Purified preparations exhibited two zones, both of which displayed activity, upon polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, but only one zone following disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Its mobility indicated a subunit weight of 89,000. Several lines of evidence suggest that iron is an integral part of the enzyme. Treatment of the enzyme with EDTA resulted in complete loss of activity which could be subsequently restored by dialysis against 1 FM ferrous sulfate. Furthermore, atomic absorption analysis and neutron activation analysis of separate enzyme preparations each indicated 0.5 atom of iron per subunit. Chemical analyses of sulfhydryl oxidase accounted for 97 % of the sample weight, of which 89% could be attributed to amino acid residues and 11% to carbohydrate residues. Five half-cystine residues per subunit were indicated by cysteic acid analysis and by sulfhydryl group determination following reaction with sodium borohydride. Comparison of this value to the total sulfhydryl groups without reduction tentatively suggests the presence of one disulfide bond. Sulfhydryl oxidase was found to catalyze the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in both small compounds and proteins, using O2 as oxidant and producing, in equimolar quantities, HzOz and the corresponding disulfide. A Michaelis constant of 90 pM was obtained using reduced glutathione as substrate, under conditions of optimal pH and temperature, viz., pH 7.0 and 35”. Substrate inhibition was apparent at GSH concentrations above 0.8 mu. In the presence of sulfhydryl oxidase, reductively denatured RNase was reoxidized and fully reactivated within 1 hour, whereas in the absence of the oxidase under otherwise identical conditions, full recovery of RNase activity required 24 hours. The presence of reducing agent was not required for this activity, nor was prior reduction of the sulfhydryl oxidase. Based on the observed activity, it appears"

https://openalex.org/W2078754869,"The observation that repetitive and single copy sequences are interspersed in animal DNAs has suggested that repetitive sequences are adjacent to single copy structural gene sequences. To test this concept, single copy DNA sequences contiguous to interspersed repetitive sequences were prepared from sea urchin DNA by hydroxyapatite fractionation (repeat-contiguous DNA fraction). These single copy sequences included about one third of the total nonrepetitive sequence in the genome as determined by the amounts recovered during the hydroxyapatite fractionation and by reassociation kinetics. 3H-labeled mRNA from sea urchin gastrula was prepared by puromycin release from polysomes and used in DNA-driven hybridization reactions. The kinetics of mRNA hybridization reactions with excess whole DNA were carefully measured, and the rate of hybridization was found to be 3–5 times slower than the corresponding single copy DNA driver reassociation rate. The mRNA hybridized with excess repeat-contiguous DNA with similar kinetics relative to the driver DNA. At completion 80% of that mRNA hybridizable with whole DNA (approximately 65%) had reacted with the repeat-contiguous DNA fraction (50%). This result shows that 80–100% of the mRNA molecules present in sea urchin embryos are transcribed from single copy DNA sequences adjacent to interspersed repetitive sequences in the genome."

https://openalex.org/W1989244997,"It is shown that a factor arising during the course of maturation in amphibian oocytes is by itself capable of inducing maturation when injected into recipient oocytes even after a series of 10 transfers. The mechanism of action of this phenomenon is shown to be under translational control. Experiments using cycloheximide suggest that MPF does not need protein synthesis for germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), but does require a translational step when serially transferred in order to sustain its renewal (“autocatalytic”) capacity. It is further shown that oocytes of Xenopus laevis lend themselves to an in vitro system, since when matured under the action of some steroids (progesterone or hydrocortisone), they are capable of supporting functional maturation with cleavage and development after having received a transplanted blastula nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1494512780,"The discharge and the intracellular transport of the exocrine proteins produced by the guinea pig pancreas have been investigated in the in vitro lobule system described by SCHEELE, G. A., AND PALADE, G. E. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2660-2670. The inquiry was carried out on a protein-specific basis by using the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic procedures worked out by TARTAKOFF, A. M., GREENE, L. J., AND PALADE, G. E. (1974) J. Biol; Chem. 249, 7420-7431. The results show that the same protein mixture is discharged by the lobules regardless of whether stimulation is by carbamylcholine (which mimics the action of acetylcholine), caerulein (which mimics the action of pancreozymin), or by 75 mM KCl. When no stimulant is present, the small quantity of discharged protein (resting secretion) also has the same composition. Analysis of successive secretion aliquots collected over a period of 2 hours of continuous timulation by carbamylcholine showed that the composition of the secretory output remains quasi-constant with time; therefore, the exocrine proteins appear to be discharged in parallel and in constant proportions, irrespective of stimulant and time under stimulation (for carbamylcholine). The analysis of a series of zymogen granule fractions prepared from lobules pulse-labeled with radioactive amino acids and chased for periods of 15 to 155 min shows that all major secretory proteins enter the condensing vacuoles of the Golgi complex and appear in zymogen granules in apparent synchrony."

The isolated chromatins were studied by circular dichroism and for their ability to bind the intercalating dye, ethidium bromide. Chromatin from cells in the middle of the S phase showed an increase in maximum ellipticity in the 250- to 300-nm region of circular dichroism spectra and an increased ability to bind ethidium bromide, when compared to chromatin isolated from mitotic cells. Chromatin from G1 cells had values intermediate between mitotic and mid-S chromatins."
https://openalex.org/W1996820696,"The molecular weight of fibroin messenger RNA has been measured by its contour length in the electron microscope and its electrophoretic mobility under conditions of complete denaturation. These methods give values of 5.6 × 106 and 6.0 × 106 daltons, respectively. The average molecular weight of 5.8 × 106 (1.6 × 104 base residues) would be expected to code for a protein of 414,000 daltons, a value about 12% larger than the most recently published size for fibroin. When the mRNA is prepared carefully to avoid shear breakage, it is as homogeneous in size as ribosomal RNA. Between 43% and 81% of the mRNA molecules bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose and are presumed to contain a poly(A) sequence. This sequence, isolated after ribonuclease digestion, comprises about 0.6% of the molecule, or an estimated 100 nucleotides. The poly(A) has been localized at the end of the molecule by hybridizing with a small poly (dT:dA) piece and subsequent visualization by electron microscopy. This observation, along with the ability of reverse transcriptase to transcribe fibroin mRNA with an oligo(dT) primer, demonstrates that the poly(A) is at the 3′ end of the mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1516277812,"Three prostaglandin F2alpha-catabolizing enzyme activities have been demonstrated in kidneys from adult rats. Activity of each of the enzymes varied with animal age. Whereas 15-hydroxydehydrogenase and delta13-reductase appeared important to the early developing kidney (prior to 4 weeks of age), 9-hydroxydehydrogenase appeared to be characteristic of the adult kidney. Prostaglandin 15-hydroxydehydrogenase rose sharply after birth to a maximal value at 19 days (59-fold relative to the adult) decreasing to adult values by Day 40. Prostaglandin delta13-reductase followed a similar pattern rising about 20-fold at Day 19. Prostaglandin 9-hydroxydehydrogenase, on the other hand, was undetectable up to Day 19, rising gradually to adult values by Day 50. Prostaglandin biosynthesis in whole kidney and renal papilla at the peak period of 15-hydroxydehydrogenase activity, i.e. 19, 22, and 24 days, did not vary significally from adult values. The dramatic rise in 15-hydroxydehydrogenase activity, reflecting an important requirement for prostaglandin inactivation during the first 3 weeks after birth, appears to correlate well with the increase during this period in the number of glomeruli, cortical tubules, and redistribution of blood flow to the cortex. These results suggest for the first time an important relationship between prostaglandin catabolizing activites and nephrogenesis."

This inhibition is minimized by (i) counterphase (luminance) patterns or (ii) red/green (chromaticity) flicker.

This compound is determined by gas chromatography, after a single purification by thin layer chromatography.

We have utilized the poly[d(A-T)]-directed reaction to determine the length of the nascent poly[r(A-U)] protected from attack by pancreatic ribonuclease. Following release of the ribonuclease resistant oligo[r(A-U)] from the ternary complex, its size was determined by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10, and the ratio of 3'-terminal uridine to internal 2':3'-UMP following alkaline hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W1486755746,"gamma-Carboxyglutamic acid has recently been identified as a component of the vitamin K-dependent region of bovine prothrombin (Nelsestuen, G. L., Zytkovicz, T. H., and Howard J. B. (1974) J. Biol Chem. 249, 6347-6350). The presence of this amino acid has been substantiated here by the reduction of vitamin K-dependent proteins with [3H]-DIBORANE. The reduction product of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, 5,5'-[3H]dihydroxyleucine, was shown to be present in hydrolysates of reduced rat prothrombin, bovine prothrombin, and bovine factor X. The results are consistent with a minimum of 10 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the nonthrombin-generating region of bovine prothrombin but no such residues in the thrombin precursor portion of prothrombin. It is concluded that amino acid analyses of [3H]diborane-reduced proteins provides a sensitive, qualitative method for the identification of proteins which contain gamma-carboxyglutamic acid and are vitamin K-dependent."

A double isotopic, differential labeling technique followed by gel electrophoresis of extracts in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed the presence of a polypeptide, or polypeptides, in human erythrocyte membranes, the reactivity of which to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was significantly enhanced in the presence of D-glucose. Molecular weights of the peptides were estimated to be approximately 180,000.

Although several peaks of (3H)GTP-binding activity were present in crude preparations of solubilized myocardium, one peak was associated with the adenylate cyclase peak. Binding of (3H)GTP to this material was rapid (equilibrium within 3 min at 37 degrees) and reversible and not associated with nucleotide hydrolysis. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of (3H)GTP binding sites with KA = 3 x 10-6 M-1 and total binding capacity of 50 pmol per mg of protein. The GTP analog Gpp(NH)p competed for the sites with an affinity somewhat lower than GTP, although its ability to activate the adenylate cyclase was far greater. GTP and other guanine nucleotides activated the soluble cyclase only weakly, although they antagonized competitively enzyme stimulation by Gpp(NH)p. Ability of GTP and other nucleotides to compete with (3H)GTP for binding sites and to antagonize competitively adenylate cyclase activation by Gpp(NH)p were directly parallel. The potency series was GTP = GDP = dGTP greater than GMP greater than ITP greater than UTP, CTP. Dissociation constants of nucleotides for the sites determined by inhibition of (3H)GTP binding and inhibition of Gpp(NH)p activation of cyclase agreed closely. Gpp(NH)p dose-response curves for activation of adenylate cyclase and inhibition of (3H)GTP binding were superimposable."

This compound is of considerable interest since its level can be greatly increased in certain lipidoses, either of a genetic nature or caused by drugs.

This paper reports the enzymatic formation of bis(monoacylglyceryl)P and acylphosphatidylglycerol as minor products from cytidine diphosphate diglyceride and radioactive sn-glycerol-3-P using a crude mitochondrial fraction from normal rat liver; phosphatidylglycerol was the principal product. Evidence is also presented which shows the enzymatic formation of acylphosphatidylglycerol and bis(monoacylglyceryl)P from [1',3'-14C]phosphatidylglycerol by a crude rat liver mitochondrial preparation in vitro. The structures of the radioactive bis(monoacylglyceryl)P and acylphosphatidylglycerol were tentatively established by thin layer chromatography, and chromatography of the products of mild alkaline hydrolysis and acetolysis. Radioactive acylphosphatidylglycerol was stoichiometrically converted to bis(monoacylglyceryl)P by treatment with bee venom phospholipase A, providing additional evidence for the structure of acylphosphatidylglycerol and bis(monoacylglyceryl)P."

The cytoplasmic end product of this pathway is UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-D-Glu-meso-Dap-D-Ala-D-Ala (see article). UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and its precursor, UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide, were found to be effective inhibitiors of the enzyme.

At least 8 RNA species with unique electrophoretic mobilities have been recognized. The complex of RNAs has been eluted from the gels in three groups, A, B, and C, in increasing order of mobility. The template activity of the three fractions and the unfractionated starting material was examined in the mouse Krebs II ascites tumor cell-free protein synthesizing system. The unfractionated messenger complex programs the synthesis of proteins that co-electrophorese exclusively with sea urchin histones in both sodium dodecyl sulfate and acid urea gel systems. The products of in vitro protein systhesis stimulated by the individual polyacrylamide gel RNA fractions were similarly examined. Each stimulated protein synthesis and was enriched for specific histone templates. We conclude that RNA fraction A is template for histone f1, C is template for histone f2a1, and B serves as template for f2b, f2a2, and f3 histones. A minor degree of contamination of the A and B RNA fractions was obvious from the production of other histones by each template. The co-electrophoresis of specific template activity with specific radiolabeled RNAs supports the concept that most or all of the labeled RNAs are indeed themselves the histone mRNAs."

Addition of a variety of C-19 and C-21 steroids to cell suspensions resulted, after 4 to 6 hours of incubation, in 2- to 5-fold increase in the activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase as measured in liver cell homogenates. The increase was prevented by cycloheximide. The most active steroid inducers tested were pregnene or pregnane derivatives with keto or hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-20; in particular a beta-hydroxyl group at C-20 enhanced activity. These C-21 steroids at optimal initial concentrations caused 3- to 5-fold induction over 4 hours. A number of C-19 androstene and androstane compounds caused 2- to 3-fold inducation over the same period. Hydrocortisone had no effect. For a variety of androstane and pregnane derivatives, inducation by 5alphaH steroids was as great as or greater than that by 5betaH compounds, in contrast to previous findings in chick embryo liver. Induction of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase by steroids in isolated liver cells was shown to be subject to feedback repression by hemin."
https://openalex.org/W1585350407,"When primary rabbit kidney cell cultures are treated with either polyadenylic acid-polyuridylic acid or polyadenylic acid-polyribothymidylic acid (poly(rT)) and then judiciously exposed to actinomycin D and cycloheximide, high titers of interferon are found in the extracellular medium (superinduction) (Vilcek, J. (1970) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 173, 390-403; Tan, Y. H., Armstrong, J. A., Ke, Y. H., and Ho, M. (1970) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 67, 464-471). If polyinosinic acid is added 1 hour prior to, simultaneously with, or 1 hour after the active interferon inducers, dramatic reductions in interferon production from the superinduced cells result. Based on experiments involving sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, pancreatic ribonuclease A resistance, ultraviolet mixing curves, and ultraviolet absorbance-temperature profiles, the explanation for this phenomenon was determined to be the formation of polynucleotide triplexes in the following way: poly(A)-poly(U) + poly(I) yields poly(A)-poly(U)-poly(I)poly(A)-poly(rT) + poly(I) yields poly(A)-poly(rT)-poly(I). In addition, based on similar methodology, the following reactions involving these triplexes were demonstrated: poly(A)-2 poly(I) + poly(U) yields poly(A)-poly(U)-poly(I) + poly(I)poly(A)-2 poly(I) + poly(rT) yields poly(A)-poly(rT)-poly(I) + poly(I)POLY(A)-2 poly(I) + 2 poly(U) yields poly(A)-2 poly(U) + 2 poly(I) and POLY(A)-poly(U)-poly(I) + poly (U) yields poly(A)-2 poly(U) + poly(I)."
https://openalex.org/W1571072820,"Partially purified testicular myoinositol 1-phosphate synthase was incubated with glucose 6-phosphate and NAD+. After 2 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of NaB3H4. Phosphorylated reduced sugars were isolated by ion exchange and dephosphorylated enzymatically. Scylloinositol and myoinositol, added as carriers, were re-isolated and purified to constant specific radioactivity. Since scylloinositol phosphate is uniquely related to myoinosose-2 1-phosphate, the finding of labeled scylloinositol and myoinositol is considered strong evidence for the presence of myoinosose-2 1-phosphate, an intermediate which has been postulated in the synthase-catalyzed isomerization of glucose 6-phosphate to myoinositol 1-phosphate. About one-half the amount of intermediate was demonstrable with boiled synthase, indicating firm binding of myoinosose-2 phosphate to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1597772993,"Particulate enzyme preparations of the fungus imperfectus Cryptococcus laurentii catalyze transfer of mannosyl and galactosyl residues from GDP-[14C]mannose and UDP-[3H]-galactose to the same endogenous acceptor. After solubilization with pronase, the major portion of both labels is retarded on Sepharose columns and forms a symmetrical peak, in which 14C and 3H coincide. Label also coincides with endogenous protein and carbohydrate. Both labels bind to Sepharose-Concanavalin A (Con A) and are eluted with alpha-methylglucoside. After beta elimination with NaOH-NaBH4 only 14C label retains binding to Sepharose-Con A; 3H label representing (6-O-alpha-galactosyl)10-O-beta-galactosyl-O-mannitol as previously reported (Raizada, M. K., Kloepfer, H. G., Schutzbach, J. S., and Ankel, H. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6080-6086) no longer binds. The [14C]mannose-containing material after beta elimination yields a pentasaccharide and a trisaccharide. Similar penta- and trisaccharides can be isolated following beta elimination of particulate preparations of the organism after pronase treatment. Analytical data suggest that the structure of the isolated pentasaccharides corresponds to that of a pentasaccharide previously synthesized de novo using cell-free enzyme preparations of the organism: 2-O-alpha-mannosyl-6-O-alpha-mannosyl-3-O-alpha-mannosyl-(2-O-beta-xylosyl)-O-mannose (Schutzbach, J. S., Raizada, M. K., and Ankel, H. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2953-2958). The trisaccharide has the structure 2-O-alpha-mannosyl-2-O-alpha-mannosyl-O-mannitol. The data are consistent with a glycoprotein structure in which these three types of oligosaccharides are bound to a common polypeptide core through O-glycosidic linkages to threonyl and seryl residues."

The extent of stimulation of BALB/C AND CBA strain mouse spleens by these factors is significantly greater than that attained with PHA or PWM and requires thymus-derived lymphocytes. Abrin has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, physically characterized, and may undergo conversion from a toxic to mitogenic form. Hurin is the best mitogen we have tested."

https://openalex.org/W1496409531,"Palmitoyl-CoA dissociates the fatty acid synthetase complex from Mycobacterium smegmatis into inactive subunits of molecular weight 250,000 as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Palmitoyl-CoA binds to the subunits but the binding can be prevented and reversed by the mycobacterial 3-O-methylmannose-containing polysaccharide. When the palmitoyl-CoA containing inactive subunits were isolated by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B, and then concentrated and dialyzed against 0.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3 mM of the complexing agent heptakis-(2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin, activity was regenerated to the level of 40 percent of a control sample. The reversibility of the dissociation and inactivation of the synthetase by palmitoyl-CoA suggests that this end product might play a regulatory role by acting as a feedback inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1573320166,"The molecular weights of the three nonidentical subunits of citrate lyase of Klebsiella aerogenes have been determined by three methods: sedimentation equilibrium in 6 M guanidinium chloride, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, and gel filtration on 6 percent agarose column in 6 M guanidinium chloride. The molecular weights of the subunits, names I, II, and III (or acyl carrier protein) in order of elution from the agarose column, were 54,500, 32,000, and 11,000, respectively. The agarose-guanidine column provided a nearly complete separation of the three subunits. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was found by sedimentation equilibrium to be 520,000 plus or minus 10,000. The uncertainties in the molecular weights of the enzyme and its subunits did not permit a valid postulation of the subunit composition."

The amino acid sequence of this peptide has been reinvestigated and revised. The 38-amino acid peptide was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, chymotrypsin, and trypsin. The amino acid sequences were then established by Edman degradation as well as with overlapping peptides; Homology in the sequence was good between this bovine growth hormone fragment and peptides occurring in ovine growth hormone, human growth hormone, and human chorionic somatomammotropin."
https://openalex.org/W1548048256,"The specificity of hybridization was compared between the human and rabbit alpha and beta-globin complementary DNAs (cDNAs) and the corresponding alpha and beta-globin messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The globin chain-specific mRNAs of rabbit were prepared from polysomes incubated with O-methylthreonine (alpha and beta) or from postribosomal supernatant (alpha). Enrichment for either the alpha- or beta-globin mRNA was demonstrated by cell-free protein synthesis and by RNA-cDNA hybridization. Human mRNAs, active as templates for RNA-directed DNA polymerase, were prepared from reticulocytes of patients with hemolytic anemia, alpha-thalassemia (hemoglobin H disease), and beta-thalassemia. Because there was partial cross-hybridization between human mRNA and rabbit cDNA, the rabbit alpha- and beta-globin cDNAs could be used to demonstrate that the beta-thalassemia mRNA was enriched in human alpha-globin mRNA sequences and that the alpha-thalassemia mRNA was enriched in human beta-globin mRNA sequences. These results were confirmed by preparation of thalassemia globin cDNAs and subsequent hybridization to their template mRNAs. The amount of cross-hybridization between the human and rabbit alpha-globin mRNA and the two alpha-globin cDNAs was comparable to the cross-hybridization between the two beta-globin mRNAs and the two beta-globin cDNAs, indicating a similar degree of evolutionary divergence in the nucleotide sequences of the two globin genes."

https://openalex.org/W1595591820,"Carnitine palmityltransferase was measured in neonatal and adult rat heart and liver mitochondria. When compared to the adult, no developmental differences in liver mitochondrial carnitine palmityltransferase were seen 24 hours postpartum. In neonatal heart, enzyme activity was initially low, reaching adult levels by 20 days. Polarographic measurements of oxygen consumption revealed normal levels of palmityl coenzyme A oxidation in the presence of carnitine and of palmitylcarnitine oxidation in both neonatal heart and liver. Phospholipase C treatment produced higher specific activities of carnitine palmityltransferase in neonatal and activities of carnitine palmityltransferase in neonatal and adult liver, probably due to decreases in total mitochondrial protein. Phospholipase C treatment had no effect on adult rat heart carnitine palmityltransferase but increased neonatal heart enzyme activity to adult levels. Low levels of measured enzyme activity were proposed to be due to masking of enzyme expression in intact mitochondrial preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1534506336,"Treatment of human oxyhemoglobin with methylacetimidate results in selective amidination of the epfilon-amino group of lysin C5(40)alpha. The modified hemoglobin exhibits increased oxygen affinity, high cooperatively, and normal Bohr effect. Hybrid molecules containing amidinated beta chains and normal alpha chains have normal ligand-binding properties, whereas hybrid molecules containing amidinated alpha chains have ligand-binding properties identical with fully amidinated hemoglobin. Amidination of deoxyhemoglobin produces only minimal changes in ligand-binding properties. We propose that amidination of lysine C5(40)alpha prevents its participation in the salt bond with histidine HC3(146)beta in deoxyhemoglobin, thus shifting the allosteric equilibrium in favor of the high affinity oxy conformation."

The main features of the system, such as ion and nucleotide requirements, temperature, dependence, inhibitors sensitivity, and ability to reinitiate, were studied. The nature of the product has been determined by specific immunoprecipitation and its size has been estimated by sucrose density gradient and sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under our conditions, the thyroglobulin precursor was mainly synthesized by membrane-bound ribosomes."
