https://openalex.org/W2031171780,"Nanoantennas are key optical components for light harvesting; photodiodes convert light into a current of electrons for photodetection. We show that these two distinct, independent functions can be combined into the same structure. Photons coupled into a metallic nanoantenna excite resonant plasmons, which decay into energetic, ""hot"" electrons injected over a potential barrier at the nanoantenna-semiconductor interface, resulting in a photocurrent. This dual-function structure is a highly compact, wavelength-resonant, and polarization-specific light detector, with a spectral response extending to energies well below the semiconductor band edge."
https://openalex.org/W2080235308,"We estimate and partition genetic variation for height, body mass index (BMI), von Willebrand factor and QT interval (QTi) using 586,898 SNPs genotyped on 11,586 unrelated individuals. We estimate that ∼45%, ∼17%, ∼25% and ∼21% of the variance in height, BMI, von Willebrand factor and QTi, respectively, can be explained by all autosomal SNPs and a further ∼0.5–1% can be explained by X chromosome SNPs. We show that the variance explained by each chromosome is proportional to its length, and that SNPs in or near genes explain more variation than SNPs between genes. We propose a new approach to estimate variation due to cryptic relatedness and population stratification. Our results provide further evidence that a substantial proportion of heritability is captured by common SNPs, that height, BMI and QTi are highly polygenic traits, and that the additive variation explained by a part of the genome is approximately proportional to the total length of DNA contained within genes therein."

https://openalex.org/W1981543052,"The modified DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), sometimes called the sixth base, is present in the mammalian genome where it is generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC; the fifth base) by enzymes of the Tet family. Four papers in this issue, from the Helin, Zhang, Rao and Reik laboratories, respectively, report on the genome-wide distribution of Tet1 and/or 5hmC in mouse embryonic stem cells using the ChIP-seq technique. Links between Tet1 and transcription regulation — both activation and repression — are revealed. Anjana Rao and colleagues also describe two alternative methods with increased sensitivity for mapping single 5hmC bases. In the associated News & Views, Nathalie Véron and Antoine H. F. M. Peters discuss what these and other recent papers reveal about the role of Tet proteins in regulating DNA methylation and gene expression. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a modified base present at low levels in diverse cell types in mammals1,2,3,4,5. 5hmC is generated by the TET family of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes through oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC)1,2,4,5,6,7. 5hmC and TET proteins have been implicated in stem cell biology and cancer1,4,5,8,9, but information on the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC is limited. Here we describe two novel and specific approaches to profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, termed GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation) uses a combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA fragments containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves conversion of 5hmC to cytosine 5-methylenesulphonate (CMS) by treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulphite, followed by immunoprecipitation of CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS5. High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells showed strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites. 5hmC was especially enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters bear dual histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Our results indicate that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and suggest a model in which 5hmC contributes to the ‘poised’ chromatin signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in ES cells."

https://openalex.org/W2129687578,"Here we present a standard developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) for reporting marker gene sequences—the minimum information about a marker gene sequence (MIMARKS). We also introduce a system for describing the environment from which a biological sample originates. The 'environmental packages' apply to any genome sequence of known origin and can be used in combination with MIMARKS and other GSC checklists. Finally, to establish a unified standard for describing sequence data and to provide a single point of entry for the scientific community to access and learn about GSC checklists, we present the minimum information about any (x) sequence (MIxS). Adoption of MIxS will enhance our ability to analyze natural genetic diversity documented by massive DNA sequencing efforts from myriad ecosystems in our ever-changing biosphere."

We combined bottom-up atomic fabrication with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to construct and read out atomic-scale model systems performing logic operations.

https://openalex.org/W2060584787,"Mature cortical pyramidal neurons receive excitatory inputs onto small protrusions emanating from their dendrites called spines. Spines undergo activity-dependent remodelling, stabilization and pruning during development, and similar structural changes can be triggered by learning and changes in sensory experiences. However, the biochemical triggers and mechanisms of de novo spine formation in the developing brain and the functional significance of new spines to neuronal connectivity are largely unknown. Here we develop an approach to induce and monitor de novo spine formation in real time using combined two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and two-photon laser uncaging of glutamate. Our data demonstrate that, in mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, glutamate is sufficient to trigger de novo spine growth from the dendrite shaft in a location-specific manner. We find that glutamate-induced spinogenesis requires opening of NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors) and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) but is independent of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) receptors. Furthermore, newly formed spines express glutamate receptors and are rapidly functional such that they transduce presynaptic activity into postsynaptic signals. Together, our data demonstrate that early neural connectivity is shaped by activity in a spatially precise manner and that nascent dendrite spines are rapidly functionally incorporated into cortical circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2167940154,"Responses of neurons that integrate multiple sensory inputs are traditionally characterized in terms of a set of empirical principles. However, a simple computational framework that accounts for these empirical features of multisensory integration has not been established. We propose that divisive normalization, acting at the stage of multisensory integration, can account for many of the empirical principles of multisensory integration shown by single neurons, such as the principle of inverse effectiveness and the spatial principle. This model, which uses a simple functional operation (normalization) for which there is considerable experimental support, also accounts for the recent observation that the mathematical rule by which multisensory neurons combine their inputs changes with cue reliability. The normalization model, which makes a strong testable prediction regarding cross-modal suppression, may therefore provide a simple unifying computational account of the important features of multisensory integration by neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2057492396,"KIF7, the human ortholog of Drosophila Costal2, is a key component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Here we report mutations in KIF7 in individuals with hydrolethalus and acrocallosal syndromes, two multiple malformation disorders with overlapping features that include polydactyly, brain abnormalities and cleft palate. Consistent with a role of KIF7 in Hedgehog signaling, we show deregulation of most GLI transcription factor targets and impaired GLI3 processing in tissues from individuals with KIF7 mutations. KIF7 is also a likely contributor of alleles across the ciliopathy spectrum, as sequencing of a diverse cohort identified several missense mutations detrimental to protein function. In addition, in vivo genetic interaction studies indicated that knockdown of KIF7 could exacerbate the phenotype induced by knockdown of other ciliopathy transcripts. Our data show the role of KIF7 in human primary cilia, especially in the Hedgehog pathway through the regulation of GLI targets, and expand the clinical spectrum of ciliopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2069478187,"Sparse coding presents practical advantages for sensory representations and memory storage. In the insect olfactory system, the representation of general odors is dense in the antennal lobes but sparse in the mushroom bodies, only one synapse downstream. In locusts, this transformation relies on the oscillatory structure of antennal lobe output, feed-forward inhibitory circuits, intrinsic properties of mushroom body neurons, and connectivity between antennal lobe and mushroom bodies. Here we show the existence of a normalizing negative-feedback loop within the mushroom body to maintain sparse output over a wide range of input conditions. This loop consists of an identifiable ""giant"" nonspiking inhibitory interneuron with ubiquitous connectivity and graded release properties."
https://openalex.org/W2007764395,"Cilia-associated human genetic disorders are striking in the diversity of their abnormalities and their complex inheritance. Inactivation of the retrograde ciliary motor by mutations in DYNC2H1 causes skeletal dysplasias that have strongly variable expressivity. Here we define previously unknown genetic relationships between Dync2h1 and other genes required for ciliary trafficking. Mutations in mouse Dync2h1 disrupt cilia structure, block Sonic hedgehog signaling and cause midgestation lethality. Heterozygosity for Ift172, a gene required for anterograde ciliary trafficking, suppresses cilia phenotypes, Sonic hedgehog signaling defects and early lethality of Dync2h1 homozygotes. Ift122, like Dync2h1, is required for retrograde ciliary trafficking, but reduction of Ift122 gene dosage also suppresses the Dync2h1 phenotype. These genetic interactions illustrate the cell biology underlying ciliopathies and argue that mutations in intraflagellar transport genes cause their phenotypes because of their roles in cilia architecture rather than direct roles in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2113045387,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic inflammatory conditions for which new therapeutic approaches are needed. Genetic and pharmacological data point to a protective role of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor activation in IBD experimental models. Therefore, increasing the endogenous levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the main full agonist of these receptors, should have beneficial effects on colitis. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol levels were raised in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mouse model by inhibiting monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, using the selective inhibitor JZL184. MAGL inhibition in diseased mice increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels, leading to a reduction of macroscopic and histological colon alterations, as well as of colonic expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The restored integrity of the intestinal barrier function after MAGL inhibition resulted in reduced endotoxemia as well as reduced peripheral and brain inflammation. Coadministration of either CB1 (SR141716A) or CB2 (AM630) selective antagonists with JZL184 completely abolished the protective effect of MAGL inhibition on TNBS-induced colon alterations, thus demonstrating the involvement of both cannabinoid receptors. In conclusion, increasing 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels resulted in a dramatic reduction of colitis and of the related systemic and central inflammation. This could offer a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of IBD based on the new protective role of 2-arachidonoylglycerol described here.—Alhouayek, M., Lambert, D. M., Delzenne, N.

https://openalex.org/W2125454666,"Control of many infectious diseases relies on the detection of clinical cases and the isolation, removal, or treatment of cases and their contacts. The success of such ""reactive"" strategies is influenced by the fraction of transmission occurring before signs appear. We performed experimental studies of foot-and-mouth disease transmission in cattle and estimated this fraction at less than half the value expected from detecting virus in body fluids, the standard proxy measure of infectiousness. This is because the infectious period is shorter (mean 1.7 days) than currently realized, and animals are not infectious until, on average, 0.5 days after clinical signs appear. These results imply that controversial preemptive control measures may be unnecessary; instead, efforts should be directed at early detection of infection and rapid intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2119398029,"Zebra Chip (ZC) is an emerging plant disease that causes aboveground decline of potato shoots and generally results in unusable tubers. This disease has led to multi-million dollar losses for growers in the central and western United States over the past decade and impacts the livelihood of potato farmers in Mexico and New Zealand. ZC is associated with ‘Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’, a fastidious alpha-proteobacterium that is transmitted by a phloem-feeding psyllid vector, Bactericera cockerelli Sulc. Research on this disease has been hampered by a lack of robust culture methods and paucity of genome sequence information for ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’. Here we present the sequence of the 1.26 Mbp metagenome of ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’, based on DNA isolated from potato psyllids. The coding inventory of the ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ genome was analyzed and compared to related Rhizobiaceae to better understand ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ physiology and identify potential targets to develop improved treatment strategies. This analysis revealed a number of unique transporters and pathways, all potentially contributing to ZC pathogenesis. Some of these factors may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Taxonomically, ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ is related to ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’, a suspected causative agent of citrus huanglongbing, yet many genome rearrangements and several gene gains/losses are evident when comparing these two Liberibacter. species. Relative to ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’, ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ probably has reduced capacity for nucleic acid modification, increased amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis functionalities, and gained a high-affinity iron transport system characteristic of several pathogenic microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2128090246,"Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial disease most usually caused by point mutations in tRNA genes encoded by mtDNA. Here, we report on how this mutation affects mitochondrial function in primary fibroblast cultures established from 2 patients with MELAS who harbored the A3243G mutation. Both mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) levels were significantly decreased in MELAS fibroblasts. A similar decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was found in intact MELAS fibroblasts. Mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with increased oxidative stress and the activation of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which triggered the degradation of impaired mitochondria. Furthermore, we found defective autophagosome elimination in MELAS fibroblasts. Electron and fluorescence microscopy studies confirmed a massive degradation of mitochondria and accumulation of autophagosomes, suggesting mitophagy activation and deficient autophagic flux. Transmitochondrial cybrids harboring the A3243G mutation also showed CoQ deficiency and increased autophagy activity. All these abnormalities were partially restored by CoQ supplementation. Autophagy in MELAS fibroblasts was also abolished by treatment with antioxidants or cyclosporine, suggesting that both reactive oxygen species and MPT participate in this process. Furthermore, prevention of autophagy in MELAS fibroblasts resulted in apoptotic cell death, suggesting a protective role of autophagy in MELAS fibroblasts.—Cotán, D., Cordero, M.

In this study, we utilized microRNA (miRNA) arrays to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines established in vitro. We observed concordant upregulation of miR-135a in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines representing three human malignancies. Subsequently, the role of miRNA-135a was evaluated in an in vivo model of paclitaxel resistance. In this model, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line and treated with paclitaxel for a prolonged period. In paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, established either in vitro or in vivo, blockage of miR-135a sensitized resistant cell lines to paclitaxel-induced cell death. We further demonstrated a correlation between paclitaxel response and miR-135a expression in paclitaxel-resistant subclones that were established in vivo. The paclitaxel-resistant phenotype of these subclones was maintained upon retransplantation in new mice, as shown by decreased tumor response upon paclitaxel treatment compared with controls. Upregulation of miR-135a was associated with reduced expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC). APC knockdown increased paclitaxel resistance in parental cell lines. Our results indicate that paclitaxel resistance is associated with upregulation of miR-135a, both in vitro and in vivo, and is in part determined by miR-135a-mediated downregulation of APC."
https://openalex.org/W2098701491,"When making a decision, we have to take into account not only the information that is available, but also the reliability of this information. This behavioral study finds that, while searching for a visual target, people weigh up cue reliability in an almost identical fashion to a mathematical ideal observer, and a neural network model can explain how this behavior is produced. The ability to search efficiently for a target in a cluttered environment is one of the most remarkable functions of the nervous system. This task is difficult under natural circumstances, as the reliability of sensory information can vary greatly across space and time and is typically a priori unknown to the observer. In contrast, visual-search experiments commonly use stimuli of equal and known reliability. In a target detection task, we randomly assigned high or low reliability to each item on a trial-by-trial basis. An optimal observer would weight the observations by their trial-to-trial reliability and combine them using a specific nonlinear integration rule. We found that humans were near-optimal, regardless of whether distractors were homogeneous or heterogeneous and whether reliability was manipulated through contrast or shape. We present a neural-network implementation of near-optimal visual search based on probabilistic population coding. The network matched human performance."
https://openalex.org/W2000243870,"To define a role for phospholipase Cε (PLCε) signaling in cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth, PLCε protein was depleted from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) using siRNA. NRVMs with PLCε depletion were stimulated with endothelin (ET-1), norepinephrine, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), or isoproterenol and assessed for development of hypertrophy. PLCε depletion dramatically reduced hypertrophic growth and gene expression induced by all agonists tested. PLCε catalytic activity was required for hypertrophy development, yet PLCε depletion did not reduce global agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate production, suggesting a requirement for localized PLC activity. PLCε was found to be scaffolded to a muscle-specific A kinase anchoring protein (mAKAPβ) in heart and NRVMs, and mAKAPβ localizes to the nuclear envelope in NRVMs. PLCε-mAKAP interaction domains were defined and overexpressed to disrupt endogenous mAKAPβ-PLCε complexes in NRVMs, resulting in significantly reduced ET-1-dependent NRVM hypertrophy. We propose that PLCε integrates multiple upstream signaling pathways to generate local signals at the nucleus that regulate hypertrophy."

The slyA ORF was amplified from the purified genomic DNA of S. enterica serovar typhimurium strain LT2 (American Type Culture Collection) using the following PCR primers: TACTTCCAATCCAATGCCATGGAATCGCCACTAGGTTCTGATC (forward) and TTATCCACTTCCAATGTTAATCGTGAGAGTGCAATTCCATAATATTGTG (reverse). Ligation-independent cloning of the amplified slyA ORF into plasmid pMCSG19 was carried out essentially as described by Donnelly et al. (18Donnelly M.I. Zhou M. Millard C.S. Clancy S. Stols L. Eschenfeldt W.H. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified PCR product was treated with ligation-independent cloning-qualified T4 DNA polymerase (Novagen) in the presence of 5 mm DTT and 2.5 mm dCTP to generate single-stranded ends. The insert was then annealed to linearized pMCSG19 and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying pRK1037. The resulting recombinant construct encodes the SlyA protein fused to maltose-binding protein with a His6 tag at its N terminus. Maltose-binding protein was cleaved from the protein in vivo by tobacco vein mottling virus protease expressed from pRK1037. The SlyA coding sequence in our construct contains the dipeptide Glu-Pro at residues 97 and 98; the UniProt Database sequence (P40676) contains Asp-Ala at these positions as a result of a two-nucleotide inversion. Because the original sequence of SlyA contains Glu-Pro at these positions (1Libby S.J. Goebel W. Ludwig A. Buchmeier N. Bowe F. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Songer J.G. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), as well as many other SlyA proteins from different Salmonella strains in the NCBI Entrez Gene Database, we did not attempt to mutate the SlyA coding sequence. The identity of these residues as Glu-Pro was supported by independent cloning and sequencing experiments. E. coli cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until A600 = 0.5–0.6 was reached. To induce protein expression, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cultures were further incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. Cell pellets were washed with a 0.9% saline solution, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until needed for protein purification. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm imidazole). To lyse cells, spermine and lysozyme were added to the suspension to 20 mm and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively. The suspension was incubated on ice for 20 min and sonicated. Clarified filtered cell lysates were applied to a 5-ml HisTrap nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A, and His-tagged SlyA was eluted on a 20–500 mm imidazole gradient. Fractions enriched for His-tagged SlyA were pooled, concentrated to 1–2 ml, and exchanged into buffer A, and the His6 tag was cleaved with His-tagged recombinant tobacco etch virus protease. The cleavage reaction was passed over a second HisTrap column, and tag-free SlyA was eluted with buffer A before being exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT for crystallization experiments. Selenomethionine (SeMet) 2The abbreviations used are: SeMetselenomethionineHTHhelix-turn-helix.-substituted SlyA was generated using the methionine biosynthesis inhibition method (19Doublié S.

SeMet-substituted SlyA was concentrated to 20 mg/ml and crystallized in 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0) and 30% Jeffamine ED-6000 (Hampton Research) by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 16 °C. Crystals grew to full size overnight, at which time coverslips were transferred to wells containing 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0) and 45% Jeffamine ED-6000 and incubated for an additional 24 h at 16 °C. Following this step, crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Intensity data at the selenium K-edge peak wavelength were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, using Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team beamline 21-ID-D. Data were processed with HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion, which located two of three selenium atoms in an asymmetric unit containing one SlyA monomer. Phase calculations were performed by SOLVE and density modification by RESOLVE as part of the AutoSol module of the PHENIX suite (21Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N.

Small irregular crystals were originally grown in hanging drops by combining SlyA and a 22-bp oligodeoxynucleotide with single-nucleotide 5′-overhangs (see Fig. 3A) at a molar ratio of 2:1.5 in a solution of 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.1), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000. Larger crystals of better diffraction quality were grown from a slightly modified solution containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.7) and 2% benzamidine HCl (Sigma). Crystals appeared in 1–2 days. For phasing experiments, crystals were exchanged into drops containing 0.25 mm hexatantalum tetradecabromide and allowed to soak overnight. After rinsing in crystallization solution supplemented with 20% glycerol, crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Intensity data for native and hexatantalum tetradecabromide-soaked crystals were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, using General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team beamline 23-ID-B. Data for multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing were collected from one hexatantalum tetradecabromide-soaked crystal at three wavelengths near the tantalum LIII-edge. All data were processed in HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Phase calculation and density modification using the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion data were performed by the AutoSol module of the PHENIX suite (21Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G.

Two hexatantalum tetradecabromide clusters were located in the low-resolution electron density map. Phases from the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set were then combined with amplitudes from the native data set in AutoBuild to generate an initial model and electron density maps for the native complex. Model building was completed using Coot, and the model was refined in PHENIX. Figures were prepared with PyMOL (25DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2008Google Scholar). Binding reactions (10 μl) containing 100 nm purified tag-free SlyA and 25 nm high-affinity DNA were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, reactions were supplemented with sodium salicylate from 0.5 m stock solution. After 20 min, loading buffer containing 20% glycerol was added to each reaction. The 8% native polyacrylamide gel was prerun for 30 min in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA before sample loading. Free and bound DNAs were resolved by electrophoresis at 85 V for 60 min at room temperature. The gel was stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen), and the DNA was visualized in a UV cabinet. The SlyA protein structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion from a SeMet-substituted crystal form. Apo-SlyA crystallized in space group P6522 and was refined to 2.4 Å (Table 1). The final structure contains three selenium atoms, including two in alternate conformations at residue 138, and has excellent stereochemistry. The asymmetric unit contains one SlyA monomer whose dimeric partner lies across a crystallographic symmetry axis.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsData collectionSeMet-SlyASpace groupP6522Cell dimensionsa = 50.69, b = 50.69, c = 173.58 Å; α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 120°Wavelength (Å)0.97938Resolution (Å)50–2.20 (2.24–2.20)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.Rmerge (%)bRmerge = Σ|Ihkl − 〈I〉 /ΣIhkl, where Ihkl is the observed intensity for reflection hkl, and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity.9.6 (71.3)I/σI34.0 (1.8)Completeness (%)94.0 (58.2)Redundancy10.8 (3.3)Data collectionNative SlyA-DNA complexTaBr-SlyA-DNASpace groupP41212P41212Cell dimensionsa = 60.11, b = 60.11, c = 290.49 Å; α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°a = 59.6, b = 59.6, c = 291.2 Å; α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°Wavelength (Å)0.979341.254941.255251.2061Resolution (Å)50–2.97 (3.08–2.97)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.50–4.00 (4.14–4.00)Rmerge (%)8.1 (26.0)11.1 (28.7)11.1 (29.7)10.9 (28.0)I/σI35.3 (4.0)44.2 (16.0)45.2 (16.0)61.6 (22.1)Completeness (%)94.4 (63.2)98.8 (99.0)98.8 (99.0)98.0 (98.3)Redundancy12.5 (7.7)14.9 (13.8)14.8 (13.6)25.9 (26.2)PhasingSeMet-SlyATaBr-SlyA-DNAPhasing resolution (Å)42.6–2.2550–5.00Figure of merit (before/after density modification)0.64/0.760.65/0.82RefinementSeMet-SlyANative SlyA-DNA complexResolution (Å)39–2.40 (2.46–2.40)46–2.96 (3.09–2.96)Rwork/Rfree (%)cRwork = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs|.

Open table in a new tab The global structure of SlyA resembles other known structures of MarR/SlyA family proteins (Fig. 1). There are six α-helices (Fig. 1A), of which helices α1, α5, and α6 form the dimerization domain, and helices α3 and α4 form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. Between helices α4 and α5 there exists a wing motif comprising two antiparallel β-strands and their connecting loop. This loop is disordered in the apo crystal form and could not be built. The HTH domain is stabilized by intramolecular hydrophobic interactions between Thr-36, Leu-37, Ile-40, Leu-52, Leu-63, Leu-67, and Leu-70. Helix α2 divides the upper dimerization domain from the lower DNA-binding domain. The SlyA dimer has a triangular shape (Fig. 1B). In the dimerization domain, Leu-12 from one monomer interacts hydrophobically with Ile-130 and Leu-133 from the second subunit. The two Leu-126 residues, one from each subunit, interact with each other to complete the hydrophobic dimer interface. The bottom half of the dimer is in a “closed” position, with the N termini of the two α4 helices separated by ∼15 Å. Glu-59 and Arg-65 from each subunit form intermolecular salt bridges to hold these helices in place. To investigate the mode of DNA binding by SlyA, SlyA was crystallized in the presence of a 22-bp duplex derived from a sequence just downstream of the slyA transcriptional start site. This sequence contains a 12-bp high-affinity binding site, TTAGCAAGCTAA, which was discovered by DNase footprinting of the slyA promoter region and confirmed by SELEX (5Stapleton M.R. Norte V.A. Read R.C. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17630-17637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The complex of SlyA and this DNA fragment crystallized in space group P41212. Complex crystals were soaked in hexatantalum tetradecabromide and solved by three-wavelength anomalous dispersion with a resolution cutoff of 5.0 Å. Initial phases from soaked crystals were combined with high-resolution amplitudes from unsoaked crystals, and the final structure was refined to 2.96 Å (Table 1). Each asymmetric unit contains one SlyA dimer bound to one DNA duplex. The structure of SlyA in the complex reveals the complete shape of the protein, including the β-wing region (Fig. 2A), suggesting that DNA stabilizes this motif. The SlyA dimer rests atop the DNA, with the helical axis passing underneath the dimeric axis of symmetry. The base of the triangular dimer is oriented at an angle of ∼19° with respect to the DNA and measures 72 Å from the tip of one wing (defined as Cα of Ser-83) to the other. The SlyA dimer in the complex looks very different from that in the apo crystal (Fig. 2B). Superposition of 258 Cα atoms from the two dimers results in a root mean square deviation of 5.4 Å. Notably, binding to DNA causes a large motion in the α4 helices of both subunits, so these helices can fit into consecutive major grooves ∼32 Å apart (Fig. 2, B and C). In the SlyA-DNA complex, the DNA bends upward toward the bottom of the SlyA dimer at the pseudo-palindromic center, generating a kink of ∼16°, and the DNA is undertwisted by 1.2°. Near the center of the duplex, the major grooves widen by up to 2.3 Å to accommodate the α4 recognition helices, whereas near the ends of the binding site, the minor grooves narrow slightly. At the very end of the duplex, the minor groove actually grows wider, perhaps on account of contacts between DNA molecules in the crystal. Each SlyA subunit makes a nearly identical set of contacts with the two halves of the high-affinity sequence (Fig. 3A). The α4 recognition helices emerge from the major grooves at the pseudo-palindromic center, with their N termini pointed into each groove. The sole direct contact with the DNA bases in this region is provided by Arg-65, which forms bidentate hydrogen bonds between the guanidinium NH groups and O6 and N7 of guanine 14 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S1A). Two residues from this helix participate in van der Waals contacts with the DNA bases: Cβ of Pro-61 contacts O4 of thymine 8 of one strand and thymine 16 on the opposite strand, whereas Oγ of Ser-62 approaches C5 of cytosine 15. Oγ of Ser-62 also contacts the phosphate group of cytosine 15, along with the backbone NH of Glu-59. In one subunit, the side chain of Glu-59 also contacts the phosphate group of thymine 16, whereas in the other subunit, Oγ of Ser-62 contributes a third van der Waals contact at the sugar ring of guanine 14′. Within the central 12-bp pseudo-palindrome, helix α2 also stabilizes the complex through an electrostatic interaction between the N-terminal positive dipole and the DNA backbone and via contacts between Oγ of Thr-32, C3′ of the thymine 13 sugar ring, and the phosphate of guanine 14. The side chain of Thr-30 on one subunit, a residue found in the linker between helices α1 and α2, also approaches the adenine 13 phosphate group. The outer portions of the high-affinity sequence are contacted by residues from the β-wing and helix α3. In our structure, several of these contacts are unique to each subunit because the natural slyA sequence bordering the 12-bp pseudo-palindrome is not symmetrical; the sequence reads AATAAC in the sense direction and TTATAA in the opposite strand. The most pronounced effect of this asymmetry is seen in the wing-minor groove interaction network. Here, the side chain of Arg-86 extends into the minor groove and is sandwiched between two sugar rings belonging to specifically positioned nucleotides, one being three positions ahead of the 5′-end of the pseudo-palindromic sequence (i.e. adenine 4/thymine 4′) and the other being five positions after the 3′-position of the same element on the antiparallel strand (i.e. adenine 23/thymine 23′). Arg-86 is also held in place by an electrostatic interaction with the side chain of Asp-84 and a contact between the backbone NH of Arg-85 and the phosphate of adenine 23/thymine 23′. However, on the “downstream” side of the SlyA dimer, the guanidinium moiety of Arg-86 also hydrogen bonds to the O2 atoms of thymine 22 and thymine 4′ (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas N3 of adenine 22′ makes a van der Waals contact with Cδ of Arg-86 on the “upstream” subunit. Also, Arg-85 of the downstream subunit curves around to form an interaction between its side chain and the adenine 23 phosphate, and Cδ of upstream Asp-84 contacts C5′ of thymine 23′. Beside the interactions described above, there exists a large collection of contacts between the sugar phosphate DNA backbone, the SlyA wing, and helix α3. O3′ of the adenine 5 sugar engages with Cβ of Ala-87. The phosphate group on nucleotide 6 is an epicenter of the interaction network; here, there are contacts made with backbone NH groups from Gln-49, Ile-50, and Lys-88, with Ile-50 and Ala-87 also contributing van der Waals contacts from their aliphatic side chains. Ser-48 Cβ makes a van der Waals contact with this group in the upstream subunit. The positive dipole of helix α3 also points directly toward this phosphate. The phosphate group of thymine 7 can form hydrogen bonds with the side chain nitrogen atoms of Gln-49, Arg-78, or Lys-88. Finally, an extra van der Waals contact is found between O∈ of downstream Gln-49 and C3′ of the sugar ring of adenine 6′. At the beginning of this study, we found an unpublished structure of SlyA bound to the drug salicylate in the Protein Data Bank (code 3DEU). Salicylate is known to modulate the interaction between DNA and E. coli MarR and was co-crystallized in the structure of MarR (11Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that salicylate may cause SlyA to dissociate from DNA. We performed a gel shift assay using purified native SlyA and DNA representing the high-affinity SlyA-binding sequence. The addition of salicylate in quantities of 50 mm (the concentration used to co-crystallize SlyA for the 3DEU structure) or 25 mm led to complete dissociation of SlyA from the high-affinity target DNA, suggesting that salicylate could be an effector for SlyA at high concentrations (Fig. 4A). We have solved the structures of the Salmonella virulence factor SlyA, including its structure in complex with a high-affinity DNA sequence, which, to our knowledge, represents the first such crystal structure of this master virulence regulator. Previous biochemical and genetic studies revealed the importance of several residues, including Leu-12, Leu-63, Arg-65, Leu-67, Leu-70, and Leu-126, for SlyA function based on targeted mutagenesis that abolished transcriptional activation and/or DNA binding when these residues were changed to alanine (6Okada N. Oi Y. Takeda-Shitaka M. Kanou K. Umeyama H. Haneda T. Miki T. Hosoya S. Danbara H. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 548-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Haider F. Lithgow J.K. Stapleton M.R. Norte V.A. Roberts R.E. Green J. Int. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 245-250PubMed Google Scholar). Our structures permit us to unequivocally assign functions to many of these residues, whose roles include maintenance of structural integrity, dimerization, and DNA binding. The SlyA wing shares many features with that of OhrR, the first MarR family protein crystallized with DNA (14Hong M. Fuangthong M. Helmann J.D. Brennan R.G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). SlyA Arg-86 mirrors OhrR Arg-94, which enters the minor groove, and both are held in place by a conserved aspartic acid (Asp-84 and Asp-92, respectively). Both half-sites of the ohrA operator contain a conserved thymine that is hydrogen-bonded to OhrR Arg-94 in the crystal structure. The proposed role of OhrR Arg-94 is to select pyrimidines over purines in the ohrA minor groove. In contrast, our structure suggests a role for indirect readout of DNA by SlyA Arg-86 because both Arg-86 residues can be said to “measure” the width of the minor groove by interacting with a pair of sugars at specific positions, whereas only one of these residues also forms hydrogen bonds with the minor groove base surfaces (Fig. 3). The large number of contacts with the DNA backbone versus the bases of the slyA operator provides further evidence that SlyA uses an indirect contact mechanism to bind DNA. As a regulator of multiple genes, SlyA must recognize several sequences in the Salmonella genome. These sequences need not be identical in length or sequence, as has been shown by DNase footprinting assays of several SlyA-responsive promoters (3Shi Y. Latifi T. Cromie M.J. Groisman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38618-38625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Navarre W.W. Halsey T.A. Walthers D. Frye J. McClelland M. Potter J.L. Kenney L.J. Gunn J.S. Fang F.C.

Microbiology. 2007; 153: 548-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We predict that indirect readout and reliance on DNA shape rather than sequence for high-affinity recognition will be a hallmark of the MarR family proteins that are global virulence regulators. Instead of reading one promoter sequence, this property enables the global regulatory function. The binding of MarR family proteins to DNA is often modulated by small molecule ligands, thereby linking environmental signals with gene expression responses (10Wilkinson S.P. Grove A. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2006; 8: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the high-affinity binding site from slyA, purified SlyA required no cofactor to bind DNA, but the interaction could be disrupted by salicylate (Fig. 4A). Superposition of 122 Cα atoms from a SlyA monomer bound to salicylate onto one monomer from our SlyA-DNA complex showed few large conformational changes, with an overall root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å (Fig. 4B). Close inspection of the superposed molecules revealed that one of three salicylate molecules in the Protein Data Bank 3DEU structure occupies the same place as the DNA backbone at guanine 14; furthermore, helix α4 of salicylate-bound SlyA undergoes a rotation of ∼35° around its axis, which would lead to disruption of protein-DNA contacts in this region, including the interaction between Arg-65 and guanine 14 (Fig. 4C). Translation of this motion to the neighboring wing appears to pull it out and away from the minor groove, although many residues in this region are not modeled in the 3DEU structure. Conformational changes to the winged HTH domain are a common mechanism of DNA derepression across the MarR family, linking ligand binding to gene response. Oxidation of a cysteine in Xanthomonas campestris OhrR by organic hydroperoxide disrupts a critical hydrogen-bonding network and leads to formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond, causing a 28° rotation in the winged HTH domain (26Newberry K.J. Fuangthong M. Panmanee W. Mongkolsuk S. Brennan R.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 652-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similar oxidation of a homologous cysteine to a mixed disulfide produces large motions in the S. aureus global regulator SarZ. Compared with its reduced and sulfenic acid forms, the mixed-disulfide SarZ appears to be incompatible with DNA binding (16Poor C.B. Chen P.R. Duguid E. Rice P.A. He C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23517-23524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Binding of the antirepressor peptide ArmR to MexR causes helix α4 in that protein to shift up to 13 Å and the wing to move up to 18 Å, leading to dissociation from DNA (27Wilke M.S. Heller M. Creagh A.L. Haynes C.A. McIntosh L.P. Poole K. Strynadka N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14832-14837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast with these large motions, the conformational change in SlyA upon salicylate binding is much more subtle. Interestingly, MexR can also use an oxidation-sensing mechanism involving intersubunit disulfide bond formation to release from DNA (28Chen H. Hu J. Chen P.R. Lan L. Li Z. Hicks L.M. Dinner A.R. He C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13586-13591Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the oxidized MexR dimer also reveals little overall structural change compared with the DNA-binding form; instead, the disulfide bonds would inhibit a MexR-DNA complex via steric clashes with the DNA backbone (29Chen H. Yi C. Zhang J. Zhang W. Ge Z. Yang C.G. He C. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There is growing interest in the concept of antivirulence as an approach to creating new antibiotics that evade the ever-present challenge of drug resistance. Such therapies would inhibit the activity of important virulence factors, which leave the bacterium viable but in a latent state, thereby eliminating the evolutionary pressure to acquire antibiotic resistance genes (30Escaich S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The flexible HTH domains of SlyA and closely related proteins, such as RovA in Yersinia, could be attractive targets for rational drug design efforts in this vein. Given the major roles played by SlyA in the pathogenesis of Salmonella, the structures presented here provide a platform for this work.

https://openalex.org/W2057872280,"Maintaining the proper expression of the transcriptome during development or in response to a changing environment requires a delicate balance between transcriptional regulators with activating and repressing functions. The budding yeast transcriptional co-repressor Tup1-Ssn6 is a model for studying similar repressor complexes in multicellular eukaryotes. Tup1-Ssn6 does not bind DNA directly, but is directed to individual promoters by one or more DNA-binding proteins, referred to as Tup1 recruiters. This functional architecture allows the Tup1-Ssn6 to modulate the expression of genes required for the response to a variety of cellular stresses. To understand the targeting or the Tup1-Ssn6 complex, we determined the genomic distribution of Tup1 and Ssn6 by ChIP-chip. We found that most loci bound by Tup1-Ssn6 could not be explained by co-occupancy with a known recruiting cofactor and that deletion of individual known Tup1 recruiters did not significantly alter the Tup1 binding profile. These observations suggest that new Tup1 recruiting proteins remain to be discovered and that Tup1 recruitment typically depends on multiple recruiting cofactors. To identify new recruiting proteins, we computationally screened for factors with binding patterns similar to the observed Tup1-Ssn6 genomic distribution. Four top candidates, Cin5, Skn7, Phd1, and Yap6, all known to be associated with stress response gene regulation, were experimentally confirmed to physically interact with Tup1 and/or Ssn6. Incorporating these new recruitment cofactors with previously characterized cofactors now explains the majority of Tup1 targeting across the genome, and expands our understanding of the mechanism by which Tup1-Ssn6 is directed to its targets."
https://openalex.org/W2038613219,"Traits that converge in appearance under similar environmental conditions among phylogenetically independent lineages are thought to represent adaptations to local environments. We tested for convergence in nest morphology and composition of birds breeding in two ecologically different locations in Canada: Churchill in northern Manitoba and Elgin in southeastern Ontario. We examined nests from four families of passerine birds (Turdidae: Turdus, Parulidae: Dendroica, Emberizidae: Passerculus and Fringillidae: Carduelis) where closely related populations or species breed in both locations. Nests of American Robins, Yellow Warblers, and Carduelis finches had heavier nest masses, and tended to have thicker nest-walls, in northern Manitoba compared with conspecifics or congenerics breeding in southeastern Ontario. Together, all species showed evidence for wider internal and external nest-cup diameters in northern Manitoba, while individual species showed varying patterns for internal nest-cup and external nest depths. American Robins, Yellow Warblers, and Carduelis finches in northern Manitoba achieved heavier nest masses in different ways. American Robins increased all materials in similar proportions, and Yellow Warblers and Common Redpolls used greater amounts of select materials. While changes in nest composition vary uniquely for each species, the pattern of larger nests in northern Manitoba compared to southeastern Ontario in three of our four phylogenetically-independent comparisons suggests that birds are adapting to similar selective pressures between locations."

Based on the 1.75-Å crystal structure of Nurf55 bound to histone H4 helix 1, we analyzed interactions of Nurf55 (Nurf55 or p55 in fly and RbAp48/46 in human) with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, the first helix of histone H4, and an N-terminal fragment of the PRC2 subunit Su(z)12 using isothermal calorimetry and pulldown experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the binding site of histone H3 at the top of the Nurf55 WD40 propeller. Unmodified or K9me3- or K27me3-containing H3 peptides were bound with similar affinities, whereas the affinity for K4me3-containing H3 peptides was reduced. Helix 1 of histone H4 and Su(z)12 bound to the edge of the β-propeller using overlapping binding sites. Our results show similarities in the recognition of histone H4 and Su(z)12 and identify Nurf55 as a versatile interactor that simultaneously contacts multiple partners."

In the postnatal heart, BMP10 is restricted to the right atrium. The inactive pro-BMP10 (∼60 kDa) is processed into active BMP10 (∼14 kDa) by an unknown protease. Proteolytic cleavage occurs at the RIRR316↓ site (human), suggesting the involvement of proprotein convertase(s) (PCs). In vitro digestion of a 12-mer peptide encompassing the predicted cleavage site with furin, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7, showed that furin cleaves the best, whereas PC7 is inactive on this peptide. Ex vivo studies in COS-1 cells, a cell line lacking PC5/6, revealed efficient processing of pro-BMP10 by endogenous PCs other than PC5/6. The lack of processing of overexpressed pro-BMP10 in the furin- and PACE4-deficient cell line, CHO-FD11, and in furin-deficient LoVo cells, was restored by stable (CHO-FD11/Fur cells) or transient (LoVo cells) expression of furin. Use of cell-permeable and cell surface inhibitors suggested that endogenous PCs process pro-BMP10 mostly intracellularly, but also at the cell surface. Ex vivo experiments in mouse primary hepatocytes (wild type, PC5/6 knock-out, and furin knock-out) corroborated the above findings that pro-BMP10 is a substrate for endogenous furin. Western blot analyses of heart right atria extracts from wild type and PACE4 knock-out adult mice showed no significant difference in the processing of pro-BMP10, implying no in vivo role of PACE4.

The heart is the first organ to be formed during embryogenesis and it develops via a complex and sequential process that involves simultaneous morphogenesis and differentiation. Cardiac morphogenesis is under the control of a large variety of regulatory proteins, including TGF-β-related family members (1Srivastava D. Olson E.N.

Despite their functional redundancy ex vivo, these PCs fulfill key processing events in vivo, as revealed by the specific phenotypes resulting from their respective gene inactivation in mice. Pcsk3 (furin gene) knock-out (KO) in mice causes early death by embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) due to hemodynamic insufficiency and cardiac ventral closure defects translated into failure of the heart tube to fuse and undergo looping morphogenesis (4Roebroek A.J.

These phenotypes emphasize the critical involvement of furin in cardiac development. Pcsk5 (PC5/6 gene) KO leads to death at birth with an altered antero-posterior patterning, including extra vertebrae, lack of tail, kidney agenesis, hemorrhages, collapsed alveoli, and retarded ossification, as well as heart ventricular-septal defects (5Essalmani R.

Mice lacking Pcsk6 (PACE4 gene) KO survive to adulthood, and some develop incompletely penetrant left-right patterning defects combined with cyclopia, craniofacial, and cardiac malformations (7Constam D.B.

Thus, heart defects are a common phenotype associated with the single KO of the mouse genes coding for furin, PC5/6, or PACE4, but not PC7. Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10) is a newly identified cardiac-specific growth factor that is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and is known to play a critical role in heart development. BMP10 expression is most abundant in the developing and postnatal heart and weaker in the adult liver and lung (10Neuhaus H. Rosen V. Thies R.S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). During mouse cardiogenesis, after completion of embryonic cardiac patterning and looping and at the onset of trabeculation and chamber maturation, BMP10 is transiently expressed in the ventricular trabecular myocardium (E9–E13.5). By E16.5–E18.5, BMP-10 is only expressed in the atria, and is restricted to the right atrium (RA) in the postnatal heart, where it promotes increased cardiomyocyte and heart size (10Neuhaus H.

Homozygous BMP10 KO embryos die in utero between E10 and E10.5 due to arrested cardiac development. Compared with wild type (WT) embryos, KO embryos appear normal at E8.5, but display cardiac dysgenesis at E9–E9.5 with profound hypoplastic ventricular walls, absence of ventricular trabeculae, and a significantly lower heart rate (11Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z. Schneider M.D. Chien K.R. Conway S.J. Yoder M.C. Haneline L.S. Franco D. Shou W. Development. 2004; 131: 2219-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). As with all members of the TGF-β superfamily, BMP10 is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein (pro-BMP10, ∼60 kDa) that is presumably activated by proteolytic cleavage, likely at the motif RIRR313↓ (mouse nomenclature) releasing the secreted non-glycosylated C-terminal mature peptide of 108 aa (∼14 kDa; BMP10) and an N-terminal prosegment of ∼50 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1). Mature BMP10 exhibits a conserved pattern of 7 cysteines, one of which is thought to be engaged in an interchain disulfide bond (13Mazerbourg S. Sangkuhl K. Luo C.W. Sudo S. Klein C. Hsueh A.J. J.

Cleavage of pro-BMP10 at the motif RXRR↓ suggests the involvement of basic aa-specific PCs (2Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The restricted expression of BMP10 mRNA to the RA of the heart in adult mice, and heart-specific phenotypes observed in mice lacking furin, PC5/6, or PACE4, led us to test herein the implication of these convertases in the generation of mature BMP10. We identified all human and mouse protein sequences with signal peptides in ENSEMBL and screened them for the consensus sequence (R/K)-Xn-R↓[N] (where X = 0, 2, 4, 6 aa) using the FuzzPro program (EMBOSS). Positive hits, where the potential cleavage motif was present in both human and mouse proteins, were screened against the Mouse Genome Informatics data base to identify the proteins where there is also genetic evidence for their relevance in heart development. Data were integrated and queried using a relational data base. Enzymatic in vitro activities of the purified furin, PC5/6, PACE4, and PC7 (15Fugère M. Limperis P.C. Beaulieu-Audy V. Gagnon F.

The release of free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was detected with a Spectra MAX GEMINI EM microplate spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices) (excitation, 370 nm; emission, 460 nm; emission cutoff, 435 nm). 1 unit of enzymatic activity was defined as 1 pmol of AMC released from 100 μm Pyr-RTKR-MCA/min at 37 °C. The 12-mer synthetic peptides encompassing the predicted cleavage site of mouse pro-BMP10, DSSARIRR313↓NAKG (WT-mBMP10), and DSSARIRR313↓DAKG (N314D-mBMP10, in which the Asn at the P1′ position was mutated to Asp), were obtained from GenScript (NJ). To determine the specificity of the PCs for the processing of the above synthetic substrates, peptides were individually incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in vitro (200 μm peptide in 100 μl of buffer: 25 mm Tris-MES, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7) with 2 units of purified PCs (15Fugère M.

For measurement of the time dependence of in vitro cleavage of WT-mBMP10 peptide by furin, PC5/6, or PACE4, the incubations were carried out as above for 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min. For each incubation mixture the cleavage products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) on a Varian C18 column (5 μm, 100 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm) using a 0–50% acetonitrile (+0.1% TFA) gradient over 50 min, at 1 ml/min flow rate. Peptide bonds were detected at 214 nm. The cleavage site RIRR313↓ was confirmed by mass spectrometry using MS/MS. For the determination of kinetic parameters Vmax(app) and Km(app), furin samples (2 units) were incubated at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of WT-mBMP10 peptide ranging from 0 to 200 μm in a total volume of 200 μl of buffer as described above. From each reaction mixture, corresponding to one peptide concentration, 25 μl were subjected to RP-HPLC analysis per time point (see above) and 2–3 time points were assayed, varying from 0 to 15 min. The initial rate of substrate cleavage was obtained from the increase over time of the normalized peak area (peak area/number of peptide bonds) corresponding to the C-terminal fragment NAKG. The values were transformed into micromolar/h by a standard curve generated from variable concentrations of intact WT-mBMP10 peptide for which the peak area was normalized to the number of peptide bonds. Vmax(app) and Km(app) were calculated from a fit to Michaelis-Menten equation (vi = (Vmax(app) × [S])/(Km(app) + [S])) of plots of initial rates of cleavage (vi) against the peptide concentration ([S]) using TableCurve2D software (TableCurve2D version 5.01, SYSTAT Software Inc.). The cDNA encoding for human BMP10 (pCMV6 × 15 vector) was obtained from OriGene (MD). Human BMP10 and its mutant cDNAs (R313A, R316A, and R313A/R316A) were subcloned, with a ProtC tag at the N terminus, into pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech).

Proteins from medium of cultured cells (transfected with ProtC-tagged pro-BMP10) were analyzed by 8% Tris glycine SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using a ProtC-Ab (1:1000; GenScript) and a rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary Ab (1:10,000; Invitrogen). Pro-BMP10 and its prosegment tagged with ProtC at the N terminus were immunoprecipitated from mouse primary hepatocytes culture medium (200 μl) using a ProtC-Ab (2 μg; Abgent), resolved by 8% Tris glycine SDS-PAGE gels, and immunodetected using the same ProtC-Ab (1:1,000) and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:2,000, TrueBlot). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Pierce). Quantitation was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), and normalization was reported to β-actin. When media were analyzed by Western blotting, the same volumes were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. HEK293 cells (1 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected in 60-mm dishes using Effectene (Qiagen) and a total of 1 μg of DNA. Two days post-transfection, the cells were washed and pulse-labeled with 250 μCi/ml of [32S]Met/Cys for either 15 min (pulse-chase experiments) or 2 h. When pulse-labeled for 2 h, the cells were also incubated with brefeldin A (2.5 μg/ml), tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), D6R (10 μm), cell permeable RVKR-CMK (50 μm), or dimethyl sulfoxide. For the pulse-chase experiments, following the 15-min pulse, the cells were chased for various periods in a medium containing excess unlabeled Met/Cys. The cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Mixture Set I; Calbiochem). Cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated with BMP10 Ab (2 μg) recognizing the mature form. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% Tricine gels and autoradiographed. Genetic evidence indicated that the proprotein convertases play key roles in cardiogenesis and left-right (furin and PACE4) or antero-posterior patterning (PC5/6) (5Essalmani R. Zaid A.

Indeed, deletion of the PC5/6 gene (Pcsk5) led to death at birth, with mice exhibiting multiple bone morphogenic defects and heart abnormalities, including ventricular-septal defects (5Essalmani R.

One of the in vivo specific PC5/6 substrates associated with patterning defects was identified as growth differentiating factor 11 (Gdf11) (5Essalmani R. Zaid A. Marcinkiewicz J. Chamberland A.

The PC5/6-specific processing of NTKRSRR295↓NLGLD in pro-Gdf11 required the presence of Asn at the P1′ position, as its replacement by Asp led to the loss of PC5/6 specificity (5Essalmani R. Zaid A.

We therefore hypothesized that the motifs (R/K)X(R/K)R↓N, (R/K)XXR↓N, or (R/K)XXXXR↓N may represent specific PC5/6 recognition sequences, as they fit the general basic aa-specific PC consensus motif (R/K)XnR↓, where Xn = 0, 2, or 4 aa (2Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Consequently, we undertook a bioinformatic analysis of all the genes coding for secretory proteins containing a similar luminal motif, and whose gene deletion results in heart defects. Interestingly, the only substrate matching these criteria and exhibiting a paired basic aa motif was BMP10 (supplemental Table S1). All the other hits contained a single Arg at the P1 cleavage site. We chose to synthesize five 12–13-aa peptides (shown in bold in supplemental Table S1) and tested their cleavage in vitro by furin, PC5/6, PACE4, or PC7. This prospective screening revealed that only BMP10 was cleaved to any significant extent by the PCs (not shown), making it the focus of the present study. Analysis of the BMP10 precursor (pro-BMP10) sequence (supplemental Fig. S1) strongly suggested that cleavage of the N-terminal prosegment at DSSARIRR313↓NAKG (mouse nomenclature) would release active BMP10. The prosegment contains two potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn67 and Asn131 and its size is predicted to be ∼50 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1). It was reported that, under non-reducing conditions, both purified human BMP10 precursor (pro-BMP10) and mature BMP10 migrate as a mixture of monomers and disulfide-linked homodimers (13Mazerbourg S.

Accordingly, we first expressed a recombinant human pro-BMP10 in COS-1 cells and analyzed the secreted products by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, followed by Western blotting using an antibody that only recognizes the native precursor and its mature BMP10 form (nonreducing conditions are recommended by the R&D manufacturer of the BMP10 antibody) (Fig. 1A, left panel). The data showed that endogenous enzymes in COS-1 cells are able to only partially process pro-BMP10 (present as monomer and dimer) into mature BMP10. However, co-expression of furin completely transformed both monomeric and dimeric forms of the precursor into the mature ∼17-kDa BMP10, which in our hands migrates as a monomer even under non-reducing, but denaturing conditions. Using the same antibody, Western blot analysis of left (LA) and right (RA) mouse heart atria extracts revealed the presence of mature ∼17-kDa BMP10 only in extracts of the RA (Fig. 1A, right panel). Because this antibody was raised in mouse, we could not identify with certainty the pro-BMP10 form, as it migrates close to non-reduced mouse IgGs recognized by the secondary anti-mouse HRP-labeled antibody (Fig. 1A, right panel). Nevertheless, the presence of the ∼17-kDa BMP10 only in heart RA extracts agrees with our QPCR analysis (Fig. 1B) and the previously reported in situ hybridization and QPCR analyses (11Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z. Schneider M.D. Chien K.R. Conway S.J. Yoder M.C. Haneline L.S. Franco D. Shou W. Development. 2004; 131: 2219-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), all of which revealed the restricted expression of BMP10 mRNA in adult mouse RA. In conclusion, mature BMP10 (∼17 kDa) is detected in mouse RA extracts and the cognate processing enzyme(s) of pro-BMP10 in the RA is/are yet to be defined. Thus, we first measured by QPCR the mRNA levels of the three plausible processing enzymes furin, PC5/6, and PACE4 in RA and LA of adult mice. Transcripts of the above three convertases were similarly expressed in both RA and LA (Fig. 1C), with furin and PACE4 as the major convertases found in this tissue. To define the best processing enzyme(s) of pro-BMP10, we first undertook an in vitro kinetic analysis of the cleavage of a 12-mer peptide mimicking the processing site of wild type (WT) mouse pro-BMP10: DSSARIRR313↓NAKG. This peptide was digested for 2 h with equal activity units of furin, PACE4, PC5/6, or PC7 and the products were separated by RP-HPLC and identified by mass spectroscopy (Fig. 2A). The data showed that 86% of the 12-mer peptide was cleaved by furin at the predicted Arg313↓ site, as compared with 67, 68, and 4% by PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7, respectively (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S2A). Kinetic analyses revealed that furin is ∼3-fold more efficient in processing the 12-mer peptide as compared with P"
https://openalex.org/W2066958955,"λ exonuclease degrades one strand of duplex DNA in the 5'-to-3' direction to generate a 3' overhang required for recombination. Its ability to hydrolyze thousands of nucleotides processively is attributed to its ring structure, and most studies have focused on the processive phase. Here we have used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to reveal three phases of λ exonuclease reactions: the initiation, distributive and processive phases. The distributive phase comprises early reactions in which the 3' overhang is too short to stably engage with the enzyme. A mismatched base is digested one-fifth as quickly as a Watson-Crick-paired base, and multiple concatenated mismatches have a cooperatively negative effect, highlighting the crucial role of base pairing in aligning the 5' end toward the active site. The rate-limiting step during processive degradation seems to be the post-cleavage melting of the terminal base pair. We also found that an escape from a known pausing sequence requires enzyme backtracking."
https://openalex.org/W2100426249,"Individuals with germline mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene CYLD are at high risk of developing disfiguring cutaneous appendageal tumours, the defining tumour being the highly organised cylindroma. Here, we analysed CYLD mutant tumour genomes by array comparative genomic hybridisation and gene expression microarray analysis. CYLD mutant tumours were characterised by an absence of copy-number aberrations apart from LOH chromosome 16q, the genomic location of the CYLD gene. Gene expression profiling of CYLD mutant tumours showed dysregulated tropomyosin kinase (TRK) signalling, with overexpression of TRKB and TRKC in tumours when compared with perilesional skin. Immunohistochemical analysis of a tumour microarray showed strong membranous TRKB and TRKC staining in cylindromas, as well as elevated levels of ERK phosphorylation and BCL2 expression. Membranous TRKC overexpression was also observed in 70% of sporadic BCCs. RNA interference-mediated silencing of TRKB and TRKC, as well as treatment with the small-molecule TRK inhibitor lestaurtinib, reduced colony formation and proliferation in 3D primary cell cultures established from CYLD mutant tumours. These results suggest that TRK inhibition could be used as a strategy to treat tumours with loss of functional CYLD."
https://openalex.org/W1999077310,"Background Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) has been described as a novel adipokine, playing an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum levels of A-FABP and the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Chinese subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings Circulating A-FABP level was determined by ELISA in 341 Chinese subjects (221 men, 120 women) who underwent coronary angiography. A-FABP levels in patients with CAD were significantly higher compared with non-CAD subjects (P = 0.029 in men; P = 0.031 in women). Serum A-FABP increased significantly in multi-vessel diseased patients than in non-CAD subjects (P = 0.011 in men, P = 0.004 in women), and showed an independent correlation with coronary atherosclerosis index (standardized β = 0.173, P = 0.025). In multiple logistic regression analysis, serum A-FABP was an independent risk factor for CAD in women (OR = 5.637, 95%CI: 1.299-24.457, P = 0.021). In addition, amino terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was demonstrated to be positively and independently correlated with A-FABP (standardized β = 0.135, P = 0.027). Conclusions/Significance Serum A-FABP is closely associated with the presence and severity of CAD in Chinese women."
https://openalex.org/W2002711785,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a challenging clinical entity with high rates of induction failure and relapse. To discover the genetic changes occurring in T-ALL, and those contributing to relapse, we studied zebrafish (Danio rerio) T-ALL samples using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We performed aCGH on 17 T-ALLs from four zebrafish T-ALL models, and evaluated similarities between fish and humans by comparing all D. rerio genes with copy number aberrations (CNAs) with a cohort of 75 published human T-ALLs analyzed by aCGH. Within all D. rerio CNAs, we identified 893 genes with human homologues and found significant overlap (67%) with the human CNA dataset. In addition, when we restricted our analysis to primary T-ALLs (14 zebrafish and 61 human samples), 10 genes were recurrently altered in >3 zebrafish cancers and ⩾4 human cases, suggesting a conserved role for these loci in T-ALL transformation across species. We also conducted iterative allo-transplantation with three zebrafish malignancies. This technique selects for aggressive disease, resulting in shorter survival times in successive transplant rounds and modeling refractory and relapsed human T-ALL. Fifty-five percent of original CNAs were preserved after serial transplantation, demonstrating clonality between each primary and passaged leukemia. Cancers acquired an average of 34 new CNAs during passaging. Genes in these loci may underlie the enhanced malignant behavior of these neoplasias. We also compared genes from CNAs of passaged zebrafish malignancies with aCGH results from 50 human T-ALL patients who failed induction, relapsed or would eventually relapse. Again, many genes (88/164) were shared by both datasets. Further, nine recurrently altered genes in passaged D. rerio T-ALL were also found in multiple human T-ALL cases. These results suggest that zebrafish and human T-ALLs are similar at the genomic level, and are governed by factors that have persisted throughout evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2012524208,"Regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors (IP(3)R) by IP(3) and Ca(2+) allows them to initiate and regeneratively propagate intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The distribution and mobility of IP(3)R determines the spatial organization of these Ca(2+) signals. Until now, there has been no systematic comparison of the distribution and mobility of the three mammalian IP(3)R subtypes in a uniform background. We used confocal microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to define these properties for each IP(3)R subtype expressed heterologously in COS-7 cells. IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 were uniformly distributed within the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the distribution of IP(3)R2 was punctate. The mobile fractions (M(f) = 84 ± 2 and 80 ± 2%) and diffusion coefficients (D = 0.018 ± 0.001 and 0.016 ± 0.002 μm(2)/s) of IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 were similar. Other ER membrane proteins (ryanodine receptor type 1 and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase type 1) and a luminal protein (enhanced GFP with a KDEL retrieval sequence) had similar mobile fractions, suggesting that IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 move freely within an ER that is largely, although not entirely, continuous. IP(3)R2 was less mobile, but IP(3)R2 mobility differed between perinuclear (M(f) = 47 ± 4% and D = 0.004 ± 0.001 μm(2)/s) and near-plasma membrane (M(f) = 64 ± 6% and D = 0.013 ± 0.004 μm(2)/s) regions, whereas IP(3)R3 behaved similarly in both regions. We conclude that IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 diffuse freely within a largely continuous ER, but IP(3)R2 is more heterogeneously distributed and less mobile, and its mobility differs between regions of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2055545693,"A variety of cellular insults activate the tumour suppressor p53, leading generally to cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. However, it is not inconceivable that cellular protective mechanisms may be required to keep cells alive while cell-fate decisions are made. In this respect, p53 has been suggested to perform functions that allow cells to survive, by halting of the cell-cycle, and thus preventing immediate cell death. Nonetheless, the existence of direct pro-survival p53 target genes regulating cellular survival is lacking. We show here evidence for p53-dependent cellular survival in a context-dependent manner. Both mouse and human cells lacking p53 are hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced cell death compared with their isogenic wild-type counterparts. By contrast, p53(-/-) cells are expectedly resistant to cell death upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide. Although p53 and its classical targets such as p21 and Mdm2 are activated by both H(2)O(2) and CDDP, we found that the expression of haeme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-an antioxidant and antiapoptotic protein-was directly induced only upon H(2)O(2) treatment in a p53-dependent manner. Consistently, p53, but not its homologue p73, activated HO-1 expression and was bound to the HO-1 promoter specifically only upon H(2)O(2) treatment. Moreover, silencing HO-1 expression enhanced cell death upon H(2)O(2) treatment only in p53-proficient cells. Finally, H(2)O(2)-mediated cell death was rescued significantly in p53-deficient cells by antioxidant treatment, as well as by bilirubin, a by-product of HO-1 metabolism. Taken together, these data demonstrate a direct role for p53 in promoting cellular survival in a context-specific manner through the activation of a direct transcriptional target, HO-1."
https://openalex.org/W2160777604,"Inflammatory pain represents an important unmet clinical need with important socioeconomic implications. Ceramide, a potent proinflammatory sphingolipid, has been shown to elicit mechanical hyperalgesia, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. We now demonstrate that, in addition to mechanical hyperalgesia, intraplantar injection of ceramide (10 μg) led to the development of thermal hyperalgesia that was dependent on induction of the inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and subsequent increase of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The development of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and increased production of PGE2 was blocked by NS-398 (15-150 ng), a selective COX-2 inhibitor. The importance of the COX-2 to PGE2 pathway in ceramide signaling was underscored by the findings that intraplantar injection of a monoclonal PGE2 antibody (4 μg) blocked the development of hyperalgesia. Our results further revealed that COX-2 induction is regulated by NF-κB and p38 kinase activation, since intraplantar injection of SC-514 (0.1-1 μg) or SB 203580 (1-10 μg), well-characterized inhibitors of NF-κB and p38 kinase activation, respectively, blocked COX-2 induction and increased formation of PGE2 and thermal hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, activation of NF-κB was dependent on upstream activation of p38 MAPK, since SB 203580 (10 μg) blocked p65 phosphorylation, whereas p38 kinase phosphorylation was unaffected by NF-κB inhibition by SC-514 (1 μg). Our findings not only provide mechanistic insight into the signaling pathways engaged by ceramide in the development of hyperalgesia, but also provide a potential pharmacological basis for developing inhibitors targeting the ceramide metabolic-to-COX-2 pathway as novel analgesics.—Doyle, T., Chen, Z., Muscoli, C., Obeid, L.

Porous hydrogel scaffolds have widespread applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and drug discovery as viable tissue mimics. However, the existing hydrogel fabrication techniques suffer from limited control over pore interconnectivity, density and size, which leads to inefficient nutrient and oxygen transport to cells embedded in the scaffolds. Here, we demonstrated an innovative approach to develop a new platform for tissue engineered constructs using live bacteria as sacrificial porogens. E.coli were patterned and cultured in an interconnected three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel network. The growing bacteria created interconnected micropores and microchannels. Then, the scafold was decellularized, and bacteria were eliminated from the scaffold through lysing and washing steps. This 3D porous network method combined with bioprinting has the potential to be broadly applicable and compatible with tissue specific applications allowing seeding of stem cells and other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2053763621,"Cell proliferation, specification and terminal differentiation must be precisely coordinated during brain development to ensure the correct production of different neuronal populations. Most Drosophila neuroblasts (NBs) divide asymmetrically to generate a new NB and an intermediate progenitor called ganglion mother cell (GMC) which divides only once to generate two postmitotic cells called ganglion cells (GCs) that subsequently differentiate into neurons. During the asymmetric division of NBs, the homeodomain transcription factor PROSPERO is segregated into the GMC where it plays a key role as cell fate determinant. Previous work on embryonic neurogenesis has shown that PROSPERO is not expressed in postmitotic neuronal progeny. Thus, PROSPERO is thought to function in the GMC by repressing genes required for cell-cycle progression and activating genes involved in terminal differentiation. Here we focus on postembryonic neurogenesis and show that the expression of PROSPERO is transiently upregulated in the newly born neuronal progeny generated by most of the larval NBs of the OL and CB. Moreover, we provide evidence that this expression of PROSPERO in GCs inhibits their cell cycle progression by activating the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) DACAPO. These findings imply that PROSPERO, in addition to its known role as cell fate determinant in GMCs, provides a transient signal to ensure a precise timing for cell cycle exit of prospective neurons, and hence may link the mechanisms that regulate neurogenesis and those that control cell cycle progression in postembryonic brain development."
