https://openalex.org/W4292641742,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal disease with limited treatment options and poor survival. We studied 83 spatial samples from 31 patients (11 treatment-naïve and 20 treated) using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing, bulk-proteogenomics, spatial transcriptomics and cellular imaging. Subpopulations of tumor cells exhibited signatures of proliferation, KRAS signaling, cell stress and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mapping mutations and copy number events distinguished tumor populations from normal and transitional cells, including acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Pathology-assisted deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic data identified tumor and transitional subpopulations with distinct histological features. We showed coordinated expression of TIGIT in exhausted and regulatory T cells and Nectin in tumor cells. Chemo-resistant samples contain a threefold enrichment of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts that upregulate metallothioneins. Our study reveals a deeper understanding of the intricate substructure of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors that could help improve therapy for patients with this disease."
https://openalex.org/W4292641357,"Gene-environment correlations affect associations between genetic variants and complex traits in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Here we showed in up to 43,516 British siblings that educational attainment polygenic scores capture gene-environment correlations, and that migration extends these gene-environment correlations beyond the family to broader geographic regions. We then ran GWASs on 56 complex traits in up to 254,387 British individuals. Controlling for geographic regions significantly decreased the heritability for socioeconomic status (SES)-related traits, most strongly for educational attainment and income. For most traits, controlling for regions significantly reduced genetic correlations with educational attainment and income, most significantly for body mass index/body fat, sedentary behavior and substance use, consistent with gene-environment correlations related to regional socio-economic differences. The effects of controlling for birthplace and current address suggest both passive and active sources of gene-environment correlations. Our results show that the geographic clustering of DNA and SES introduces gene-environment correlations that affect GWAS results."
https://openalex.org/W4299293190,"There are currently no effective biomarkers for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) or tracking its progression. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to detect PD and track its progression from nocturnal breathing signals. The model was evaluated on a large dataset comprising 7,671 individuals, using data from several hospitals in the United States, as well as multiple public datasets. The AI model can detect PD with an area-under-the-curve of 0.90 and 0.85 on held-out and external test sets, respectively. The AI model can also estimate PD severity and progression in accordance with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (R = 0.94, P = 3.6 × 10-25). The AI model uses an attention layer that allows for interpreting its predictions with respect to sleep and electroencephalogram. Moreover, the model can assess PD in the home setting in a touchless manner, by extracting breathing from radio waves that bounce off a person's body during sleep. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of objective, noninvasive, at-home assessment of PD, and also provides initial evidence that this AI model may be useful for risk assessment before clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4292641407,"Abstract Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is being explored as a predictive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer. BFAST (NCT03178552)—an open-label, global, multicohort trial—evaluated the safety and efficacy of first-line targeted therapies or immunotherapy in patients with unresectable Stage IIIB or IV advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who were selected for biomarker status using blood-based targeted next-generation sequencing. In the Phase 3 cohort C evaluating blood-based (b)TMB as a biomarker of atezolizumab efficacy, patients with bTMB of ≥10 ( N = 471) were randomized 1:1 to receive atezolizumab or platinum-based chemotherapy per local standard of care. Cohort C did not meet its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the population with bTMB of ≥16 (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.59, 1.00; P = 0.053). Adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal occurred in 10% of patients in the atezolizumab arm and 20% in the chemotherapy arm. Adverse events of special interest occurred in 42% of patients in the atezolizumab arm and 26% in the chemotherapy arm. A prespecified exploratory analysis compared the bTMB clinical trial assay with the FoundationOne Liquid Companion Diagnostic assay and showed high concordance between assays. Additional exploration of bTMB to identify optimal cutoffs, confounding factors, assay improvements or cooperative biomarkers is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4292641167,"The development of technologies to protect or enhance memory in older people is an enduring goal of translational medicine. Here we describe repetitive (4-day) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) protocols for the selective, sustainable enhancement of auditory-verbal working memory and long-term memory in 65-88-year-old people. Modulation of synchronous low-frequency, but not high-frequency, activity in parietal cortex preferentially improved working memory on day 3 and day 4 and 1 month after intervention, whereas modulation of synchronous high-frequency, but not low-frequency, activity in prefrontal cortex preferentially improved long-term memory on days 2-4 and 1 month after intervention. The rate of memory improvements over 4 days predicted the size of memory benefits 1 month later. Individuals with lower baseline cognitive function experienced larger, more enduring memory improvements. Our findings demonstrate that the plasticity of the aging brain can be selectively and sustainably exploited using repetitive and highly focalized neuromodulation grounded in spatiospectral parameters of memory-specific cortical circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W4292641516,"Abstract The Antibody Mediated Prevention trials showed that the broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) VRC01 prevented acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) sensitive to VRC01. Using AMP trial data, here we show that the predicted serum neutralization 80% inhibitory dilution titer (PT 80 ) biomarker—which quantifies the neutralization potency of antibodies in an individual’s serum against an HIV-1 isolate—can be used to predict HIV-1 prevention efficacy. Similar to the results of nonhuman primate studies, an average PT 80 of 200 (meaning a bnAb concentration 200-fold higher than that required to reduce infection by 80% in vitro) against a population of probable exposing viruses was estimated to be required for 90% prevention efficacy against acquisition of these viruses. Based on this result, we suggest that the goal of sustained PT 80 &gt;200 against 90% of circulating viruses can be achieved by promising bnAb regimens engineered for long half-lives. We propose the PT 80 biomarker as a surrogate endpoint for evaluation of bnAb regimens, and as a tool for benchmarking candidate bnAb-inducing vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4292641506,"Tau is an intrinsically disordered microtubule-associated protein (MAP) implicated in neurodegenerative disease. On microtubules, tau molecules segregate into two kinetically distinct phases, consisting of either independently diffusing molecules or interacting molecules that form cohesive 'envelopes' around microtubules. Envelopes differentially regulate lattice accessibility for other MAPs, but the mechanism of envelope formation remains unclear. Here we find that tau envelopes form cooperatively, locally altering the spacing of tubulin dimers within the microtubule lattice. Envelope formation compacted the underlying lattice, whereas lattice extension induced tau envelope disassembly. Investigating other members of the tau family, we find that MAP2 similarly forms envelopes governed by lattice spacing, whereas MAP4 cannot. Envelopes differentially biased motor protein movement, suggesting that tau family members could spatially divide the microtubule surface into functionally distinct regions. We conclude that the interdependent allostery between lattice spacing and cooperative envelope formation provides the molecular basis for spatial regulation of microtubule-based processes by tau and MAP2."
https://openalex.org/W4292641205,"The incorporation of new information into the hippocampal network is likely to be constrained by its innate architecture and internally generated activity patterns. However, the origin, organization and consequences of such patterns remain poorly understood. In the present study we show that hippocampal network dynamics are affected by sequential neurogenesis. We birthdated CA1 pyramidal neurons with in utero electroporation over 4 embryonic days, encompassing the peak of hippocampal neurogenesis, and compared their functional features in freely moving adult mice. Neurons of the same birthdate displayed distinct connectivity, coactivity across brain states and assembly dynamics. Same-birthdate neurons exhibited overlapping spatial representations, which were maintained across different environments. Overall, the wiring and functional features of CA1 pyramidal neurons reflected a combination of birthdate and the rate of neurogenesis. These observations demonstrate that sequential neurogenesis during embryonic development shapes the preconfigured forms of adult network dynamics. Huszár et al. show that hippocampal neurons born on the same day share physiological features, take part in the same neuronal assemblies during both waking and sleep and have overlapping place fields. Neurons that are born together, fire together."
https://openalex.org/W4292641634,"The antimicrobial resistance crisis requires the introduction of novel antibiotics. The use of conventional broad-spectrum compounds selects for resistance in off-target pathogens and harms the microbiome. This is especially true for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where treatment requires a 6-month course of antibiotics. Here we show that a novel antimicrobial from Photorhabdus noenieputensis, which we named evybactin, is a potent and selective antibiotic acting against M. tuberculosis. Evybactin targets DNA gyrase and binds to a site overlapping with synthetic thiophene poisons. Given the conserved nature of DNA gyrase, the observed selectivity against M. tuberculosis is puzzling. We found that evybactin is smuggled into the cell by a promiscuous transporter of hydrophilic compounds, BacA. Evybactin is the first, but likely not the only, antimicrobial compound found to employ this unusual mechanism of selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4292681988,"In the past 40 years, the continuous strengthening of the greenhouse effect has led to a significant increase in the global average temperature. Although people’s understanding of climate change has been strengthened, the world has not yet witnessed a significant decline in pollutant emissions; hence it is imperative to get to the root cause. This paper is based on the STIRPAT model framework and uses the panel data of G20 countries over the period 1999–2019 to examine the role of financial development on carbon emissions under good governance. The results show that financial development significantly promotes carbon dioxide emissions, and the impact presents an inverted “U”-shaped trend when the quadratic term of financial development is introduced. Surprisingly, governance quality indicators increase carbon emissions. However, financial development accompanied by good governance suppresses carbon emissions. Moreover, according to the grouped results of developed and developing countries, different nations should adopt differentiated strategies in development finance to implement the carbon emission targets proposed by the G20. In addition, this paper also confirms the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. In light of this, policymakers should optimize the quality of governance while shifting their agendas toward environmentally responsible financial practices to promote financial development to improve environmental quality effectively. Furthermore, strengthen international cooperation, enhance public environmental protection concepts, and take joint actions to achieve low-carbon and win-win results."
https://openalex.org/W4292636322,"The present study is focused on the flood inundation in Brahmaputra Basin, which is one of the most recurrent and destructive natural disasters of the region. The flood inundation was assessed using C-Band Sentinel 1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) during 2015–2020 with precipitation patterns, runoff discharge, and their impacts on land cover in the basin. The study exhibited a very high precipitation during monsoon in the upper catchment resulting in severe flood inundation in downslopes of Brahmaputra Basin. A very high (900–2000 mm) to extremely high (&gt;2000 mm) monthly cumulative precipitation in the south and south-eastern parts of basin led to high discharge (16,000 to 18,000 m 3 s -1 ) during July-August months. The river discharge increases with cumulative effects of precipitation and melting of snow cover during late summer and monsoon season, and induced flood inundation in lower parts of basin. This flood has largely affected agricultural land (&gt;77% of total basin), forests (~3%), and settlement (426 to 1758 km 2 ) affecting large wildlife and livelihood during 2015–2020. The study highlights the regions affected with recurrent flood and necessitates adopting an integrated, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder approach with an emphasis on self-reliance of the community for sustenance with local resources and practices."
https://openalex.org/W4292767190,"Background Depression is the most common psychiatric condition among older adults, and it goes unnoticed by individuals themselves and is under-diagnosed by clinicians due to the misconception that these are normal parts of aging. However, the problem is not properly addressed in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of depression among the older adults in Bahir Dar city. Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 423 older adults in Bahir Dar city. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Depression was assessed using a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore the potential determinants of depression among the participants. Results The prevalence of depression among older adults was found to be 57.9% (95% CI: 53.2–62.6). This study showed that educational status with grades 5-8 th (AOR: 5.72, 95% CI: 2.87–11.34), and 9-12 th grade (AOR: 3.44, 95% CI: 1.59–7.41), income &lt;2004 ETB (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.16–3.07), cognitive impairments (AOR: 3.54, 95% CI: 2.16–5.81), family history of mental illness (AOR:3.06, 95% CI: 1.03–9.04), and poor quality of life (AOR: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.74–4.46) were significantly associated with depression. Conclusion The prevalence of depression among older adults was found to be huge. Having low educational status, low monthly income, cognitive impairments, family history of mental illness, and poor quality of life were associated with depression. Therefore, raising community awareness of mental health, increasing social participation, providing supportive counseling and routine screening of depressive symptoms are essential in combating depression among Bahir-Dar city older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3183749896,"Closed-loop brain stimulation refers to capturing neurophysiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG), quickly identifying neural events of interest, and producing auditory, magnetic or electrical stimulation so as to interact with brain processes precisely. It is a promising new method for fundamental neuroscience and perhaps for clinical applications such as restoring degraded memory function; however, existing tools are expensive, cumbersome, and offer limited experimental flexibility. In this article, we propose the Portiloop, a deep learning-based, portable and low-cost closed-loop stimulation system able to target specific brain oscillations. We first document open-hardware implementations that can be constructed from commercially available components. We also provide a fast, lightweight neural network model and an exploration algorithm that automatically optimizes the model hyperparameters to the desired brain oscillation. Finally, we validate the technology on a challenging test case of real-time sleep spindle detection, with results comparable to off-line expert performance on the Massive Online Data Annotation spindle dataset (MODA; group consensus). Software and plans are available to the community as an open science initiative to encourage further development and advance closed-loop neuroscience research [https://github.com/Portiloop]."
https://openalex.org/W4292636324,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the Chinese labor force; to explore the relationship between depressive symptoms and socioeconomic status among the Chinese labor force, including both the structural determinants and the intermediary determinants of health inequities; and to identify vulnerable populations who would benefit from intervention measures.Data were from the China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) 2016. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess depressive symptoms. The World Health Organization's theoretical framework of the social determinants of health was adopted to analyze the relationship between social determinants and depressive symptoms.Of the participants in the research from the Chinese labor force, 17.34% were identified as having depressive symptoms. Depression was significantly related to socioeconomic factors such as hukou status (p < 0.05 in the age < 45 model), education (p < 0.01 in all five models), employment (p < 0.05 in the male model), income (p < 0.05 in all five models), and self-assessed social class position (p < 0.01 in all five models). Intermediary factors were also related to depressive symptoms, such as gender (p < 0.001 in the overall model), age (p < 0.05 in the overall model), marriage (p < 0.05 in the female model), occupational exposure (p < 0.01 in the overall model), exercise (p < 0.05 in all five models), and health insurance (p < 0.05 in the overall model). The results showed that low socioeconomic status was associated with an increased risk of depression and there were some gradient changes in the distribution of depressive symptoms in socioeconomic status.The findings showed that depression symptoms are significantly related to structural determinants and intermediary determinants in China's labor force. There are some gradient changes in the distribution of depressive symptoms among people of different socioeconomic status. Low socioeconomic status is associated with increased risk of depression. Women, older people, and single and divorced people are the relative vulnerable groups in China's labor force."
https://openalex.org/W4292749563,"Tree and shrub barks have been used as folk medicine by numerous cultures across the globe for millennia, for a variety of indications, including as vasorelaxants and antispasmodics. Here, using electrophysiology and myography, we discovered that the KCNQ5 voltage-gated potassium channel mediates vascular smooth muscle relaxant effects of barks used in Native American folk medicine. Bark extracts (1%) from Birch, Cramp Bark, Slippery Elm, White Oak, Red Willow, White Willow, and Wild Cherry each strongly activated KCNQ5 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Testing of a subset including both the most and the least efficacious extracts revealed that Red Willow, White Willow, and White Oak KCNQ-dependently relaxed rat mesenteric arteries; in contrast, Black Haw bark neither activated KCNQ5 nor induced vasorelaxation. Two compounds common to the active barks (gallic acid and tannic acid) had similarly potent and efficacious effects on both KCNQ5 activation and vascular relaxation, and this together with KCNQ5 modulation by other tannins provides a molecular basis for smooth muscle relaxation effects of Native American folk medicine bark extracts."

To gain a better understanding of the longitudinal utility of the NSAA, we evaluated NSAA data from a phase II trial of 120 patients with DMD treated with domagrozumab or placebo.The NSAA exploratory analyses included assessment of individual skills gained/lost, total skills gained/lost, cumulative loss of function, and the impact of transient loss of function due to a temporary disability on NSAA total score (temporary zero score).There was no significant difference in the total number of NSAA skills gained (mean 1.41 and 1.04, respectively; p = 0.3314) or lost (3.90 vs. 5.0; p = 0.0998) between domagrozumab- vs. placebo-treated patients at week 49. However, domagrozumab-treated patients were less likely to lose the ability to perform a NSAA item (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.98, p = 0.029) over 48-weeks vs. placebo-treated patients. When temporary zero scores were changed to ""not obtainable"" (8 values from 7 patients), domagrozumab-treated patients scored higher on the NSAA total score versus placebo-treated patients (difference at week 49: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.1-3.9, p = 0.0359).These exploratory analyses reveal additional approaches to interpreting the NSAA data beyond just change in NSAA total score. These observations also highlight the importance of reporting items as ""not obtainable"" for a patient with a temporary/transient physical disability that impacts their ability to perform the NSAA test.NCT02310763."
https://openalex.org/W4292767185,"Out-of-pocket spending and lack of adequate health policy support for people living with sickle cell disease in Nigeria may predispose to high economic burden and catastrophic cost. The objective of the study was to evaluate the economic burden and catastrophic cost of sickle cell disease patients in a Nigerian tertiary health institution. In this study, a cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used to study a sample of 149 sickle cell disease patients managed at University of Nigeria Teaching hospital Enugu, South east Nigeria. A structured pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect primary data from adult participants and caregivers of paediatric patients. Data collection lasted for three months. The major findings were median monthly economic burden of approximately N76, 711 (US$385) per person. Of this, outpatient cost constituted approximately 88%. Admission, drugs and blood transfusion constitute the major contributors to the economic burden experienced by the sickle cell disease patients in the study. All socio-economic status groups suffered catastrophic expenditure but the poorest quartile had the highest incidence: 61% at 40% threshold, 71% at 30% threshold and at 88% at 10% threshold. Conclusion: economic burden was high for sickle cell disease patients who also suffered high catastrophic costs due to the impact of out-of-pocket expenditure. People living with sickle cell disease need financial protection especially for the poorest since they buy from the same market and incur same costs. Policy decision making to assist the sickle cell disease patients cope with cost of care is needful in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4292635963,"Objectives To utilize the UK Biobank to identify genetic variants associated with the ICD10 (International Classification of Diseases10)-based diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease (CeVD). Background Cerebrovascular disease occurs because of a complex interplay between vascular, environmental, and genetic factors. It is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding who may be genetically predisposed to cerebrovascular disease can help guide preventative efforts. Moreover, there is considerable interest in the use of real-world data, such as EHR (electronic health records) to better understand disease mechanisms and to discover new treatment strategies, but whether ICD10-based diagnosis can be used to study CeVD genetics is unknown. Methods Using the UK Biobank, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) where we analyzed the genomes of 11,155 cases and 122,705 controls who were sex, age and ancestry-matched in a 1:11 case: control design. Genetic variants were identified by Plink’s firth logistic regression and assessed for association with the ICD10 codes corresponding to CeVD. Results We identified two groups of SNPs closely linked to PITX2 and LRRTM4 that were significantly associated with CeVD in this study (p &lt; 5 x 10 −8 ) and had a minor allele frequency of &gt; 0.5%. Discussion Disease assignment based on ICD10 codes may underestimate prevalence; however, for CeVD, this does not appear to be the case. Compared to the age- and sex-matched control population, individuals with CeVD were more frequently diagnosed with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia &amp; atrial fibrillation or flutter, confirming their contribution to CeVD. The UK Biobank based ICD10 study identified 2 groups of variants that were associated with CeVD. The association between PITX2 and CeVD is likely explained by the increased rates of atrial fibrillation and flutter. While the mechanism explaining the relationship between LRRTM4 and CeVD is unclear, this has been documented in previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W4292636178,"Application of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) with nitrogen (N) fertilizer is one of the most efficient ways to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). To fully understand the efficiency of NIs with N fertilizer on soil nitrification, yield and NUE of maize (Zea mays L.), an outdoor pot experiment with different NIs in three soils with different pH was conducted. Five treatments were established: no fertilizer (Control); ammonium sulfate (AS); ammonium sulfate + 3, 4-dimethyl-pyrazolate phosphate (DMPP) (AD); ammonium sulfate + nitrogen protectant (N-GD) (AN); ammonium sulfate + 3, 4-dimethyl-pyrazolate phosphate + nitrogen protectant (ADN). The results showed that NIs treatments (AD, AN and ADN) significantly reduced soil nitrification in the brown and red soil, especially in AD and ADN, which decreased apparent nitrification rate by 28% - 44% (P < 0.05). All NIs treatments significantly increased yield and NUE of maize in three soils, especially ADN in the cinnamon soil and AD in the red soil were more efficiency, which significantly increased maize yield and apparent nitrogen recovery by 5.07 and 6.81 times, 4.39 and 8.16 times, respectively. No significant difference on maize yield was found in the brown soil, but AN significantly increased apparent nitrogen recovery by 70%. Given that the effect of NIs on both soil nitrification and NUE of maize, DMPP+N-GD was more efficient in the cinnamon soil, while N-GD and DMPP was the most efficiency in the brown and red soil, respectively. In addition, soil pH and soil organic matter play important role in the efficiency of NIs."
https://openalex.org/W4292636314,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranks first among liver diseases in Western countries. NAFLD is typically associated with obesity and diabetes, however it also develops in lean individuals without metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of lean NAFLD is 7 percent in the U.S. and 25–30 percent in some Asian countries. NAFLD starts with excess liver fat accumulation (NAFL), progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pathogenesis of lean NASH-HCC and how it differs from obese NASH-HCC is not well understood. Methods In this work, we generated a mouse model of lean and obese NASH-HCC using a choline deficient/high trans-fat/fructose/cholesterol diet and a choline supplemented/high trans-fat/fructose/cholesterol diet, respectively, to compare progression to NASH-HCC in lean versus obese mice. Comparisons were made at the organismal, histological, and molecular level by investigating fatty acid metabolism in the plasma of these mice. Results Obese mice showed more pronounced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, higher levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, and higher penetrance of NASH compared to lean mice. Despite the abnormal metabolic profile of obese mice, male obese and lean mice developed HCC with similar penetrance (53.3% and 53.8%, respectively), albeit lean mice showed faster tumor progression as evidenced by the larger tumor size and lower HCC-free survival. None of the female lean mice developed HCC, while 50% of female obese mice developed HCC. Both groups of mice showed a reduction in plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), however, the levels were higher towards the endpoint in obese mice compared to lean mice. Conclusions Unhealthy diet composition appears to drive progression to NASH-HCC rather than the organismal effects of obesity. PUFA levels may increase due to systemic inflammation in obese mice and act as suppressors of tumor progression, thus delaying HCC progression in obese mice compared to lean mice. These models could be used to further dissect the molecular pathogenesis of lean and obese NASH-HCC and address the mechanisms whereby PUFAs may be implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4292636442,"Although researchers and practitioners have suggested that the quality of family planning services impacts contraceptive discontinuation, establishing a causal relationship has been challenging, primarily due to data limitations and a lack of agreement on how to measure quality. This longitudinal study estimated the relationship of the dissatisfaction with family planning services on contraceptive discontinuation for a sample of 797 female clients who sought family planning services at urban facilities across Kenya, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso. Clients who sought family planning services were first interviewed in person at private and public health facilities and received a follow-up phone interview four to six months later. In our sample, 18.2% of clients who were using a modern contraceptive at baseline stopped using it by follow-up. At baseline, nearly 14% of clients reported experiencing a problem with service convenience, nearly 12% with the availability of medicines and contraceptives, and nearly 6% with facility cleanliness and/or staff treatment. We hypothesized that client dissatisfaction with the family planning services received informed their decision to discontinue contraception and estimated univariate and bivariate probit regression models, controlling for individual and health facility characteristics. We found that client’s perceptions of staff treatment and facility cleanliness informed their expectations about service and contraceptive standards, affecting subsequent contraceptive discontinuation. The difference in the probability of discontinuing contraception was 8.2 percentage-points between dissatisfied and satisfied clients. Examining client dissatisfaction with family planning services can inform the family planning community on needed improvements to increase contraceptive adherence for women in need, which can prevent unplanned pregnancies and unwanted births in the long run."
https://openalex.org/W4292767194,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with mental health outcomes and healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress, among frontline HCWs at COVID-19 isolation and treatment sites in Gaborone, Botswana. Methods This was a cross-sectional study using self-administered questionnaires at the six (6) isolation facilities. The 42-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) was used to assess for the outcomes. The proportions are presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Logistic regression analysis identified predictors of the outcomes. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 447 participants with a median age of 30 years responded. Depression, anxiety and stress were detected in 94 (21.0% (95% CI 17.3–25.1%)), 126 (28.2% (CI 24.1–32.6%)) and 71 (15.9% (12.6–19.6%)) of the participants respectively. Depression was associated with smoking (AOR 2.39 (95% CI 1.23–4.67)), working at the largest COVID-19 isolation centre, Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital (SKMTH) (AOR 0.25 (95% CI 0.15–0.43)) and experience of stigma (AOR 1.68 (95% CI 1.01–2.81)). Tertiary education (AOR 1.82 (95% CI 1.07–3.07)), SKMTH (AOR 0.49 (95% CI 0.31–0.77)), household members with chronic lung or heart disease (AOR 2.05 (95% CI 1.20–3.50)) and losing relatives or friends to COVID-19 (AOR 1.72 (95% CI 1.10–2.70)) were predictors of anxiety. Finally, predictors of stress were smoking (AOR 3.20 (95% CI 1.42–7.39)), household members with chronic heart or lung disease (AOR 2.44 (95% CI 1.27–4.69)), losing relatives or friends to COVID-19 (AOR 1.90 (1.05–3.43)) and working at SKMTH (AOR 0.24 (0.12–0.49)). Conclusion Depression, anxiety and stress are common among frontline HCWs working in the COVID-19 isolation sites in Gaborone. There is an urgent need to address the mental health outcomes associated with COVID-19 including addressing the risk factors identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W4292767195,"Vietnam has undergone four waves of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, which have posed significant market risks to various sectors. Understanding the market risk of Vietnamese sectors and its changes is important for policy implementation to support the economy after the pandemic. This study measures the sectoral market risks and examines the effects of the pandemic, policy responses and macroeconomic fundamentals on the market risks across sectors in Vietnam. We employ the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) techniques to measure the market risks for 24 sectors from 2012 to 2021. The market risk levels across Vietnamese sectors have changed significantly in response to the pandemic. Oil and Gas and Services sectors show the largest potential loss during the two Covid-19 waves in 2020. The Securities sector is the riskiest sector during the last two Covid-19 waves in 2021. Our results indicate that the new Covid-19 cases reported by the Government increase the market risk levels across Vietnamese sectors. On the other hand, enhancing containment and health policy and reducing economic policy uncertainty result in lower market risk across sectors.

Before 1865, Great-tailed Grackles were only documented in Central America, Mexico, and southern Texas in the USA. Given the rapid northern expansion of this species, it is relevant to study its role in the dynamics of avian blood parasites. Here, 87 Great-tailed grackles in Arizona (a population in the new center of the range) were screened for haemosporidian parasites using microscopy and PCR targeting the parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Individuals were caught in the wild from January 2018 until February 2020. Haemosporidian parasite prevalence was 62.1% (54/87). A high Plasmodium prevalence was found (60.9%, 53/87), and one grackle was infected with Haemoproteus ( Parahaemoproteus ) sp. (lineage SIAMEX01). Twenty-one grackles were infected with P . cathemerium , sixteen with P . homopolare , four with P . relictum (strain GRW04), and eleven with three different genetic lineages of Plasmodium spp. that have not been characterized to species level (MOLATE01, PHPAT01, and ZEMAC01). Gametocytes were observed in birds infected with three different Plasmodium lineages, revealing that grackles are competent hosts for some parasite species. This study also suggests that grackles are highly susceptible and develop chronic infections consistent with parasite tolerance, making them competent to transmit some generalist haemosporidian lineages. It can be hypothesized that, as the Great-tailed Grackle expands its geographic range, it may affect local bird communities by increasing the transmission of local parasites but not introducing new species into the parasite species pool."
https://openalex.org/W4292636252,"Background Haiti has been experiencing a resurgence of diphtheria since December 2014. Little is known about the factors contributing to the spread and persistence of the disease in the country. Geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis were used to characterize the epidemiology of diphtheria in Haiti between December 2014 and June 2021. Methods Data for the study were collected from official and open-source databases. Choropleth maps were developed to understand spatial trends of diphtheria incidence in Haiti at the commune level, the third administrative division of the country. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed using the global Moran’s I. Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were employed to detect areas with spatial dependence. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were built to identify factors associated with diphtheria incidence. The performance and fit of the models were compared using the adjusted r-squared (R 2 ) and the corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC c ). Results From December 2014 to June 2021, the average annual incidence of confirmed diphtheria was 0.39 cases per 100,000 (range of annual incidence = 0.04–0.74 per 100,000). During the study period, diphtheria incidence presented weak but significant spatial autocorrelation (I = 0.18, p&lt;0.001). Although diphtheria cases occurred throughout Haiti, nine communes were classified as disease hotspots. In the regression analyses, diphtheria incidence was positively associated with health facility density (number of facilities per 100,000 population) and degree of urbanization (proportion of urban population). Incidence was negatively associated with female literacy. The GWR model considerably improved model performance and fit compared to the OLS model, as indicated by the higher adjusted R 2 value (0.28 v 0.15) and lower AIC c score (261.97 v 267.13). Conclusion This study demonstrates that GIS and spatial analysis can support the investigation of epidemiological patterns. Furthermore, it shows that diphtheria incidence exhibited spatial variability in Haiti. The disease hotspots and potential risk factors identified in this analysis could provide a basis for future public health interventions aimed at preventing and controlling diphtheria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4292636317,"Mass media and social networks portray a unified image of the perfect male body. The intensity and universality of this influence is an important element of the process of Westernization, especially in traditional cultures such as that of Poland. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the differences between Polish gay and heterosexual men in terms of the role played by self-esteem and the level of internalization of sociocultural standards of body appearance as predictors of the development of their body images. The research study was conducted by reference to 19- to 29-year-old Polish heterosexual (n = 287) and gay (n = 97) men. The variables were measured using Polish versions of the Sociocultural Attitudes towards Appearance Scale-3, the Self-Esteem Scale, and the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. Statistical analyses identified several variables as the main predictors of body image in both heterosexual and gay young men: self-esteem, information-seeking, perceived pressure and the internalization of sociocultural standards regarding an athletic body image drawn from mass media. The only significant difference between the two groups was the fact that self-esteem, perceived pressure and the internalization of sociocultural standards from mass media did not play a predictive role with respect to Appearance Orientation among the group of gay men."
https://openalex.org/W4292636328,"The elaborate ornamental plumage displayed by birds has largely been attributed to sexual selection, whereby the greater success of ornamented males in attaining mates drives a rapid elaboration of those ornaments. Indeed, plumage elaboration tends to be greatest in species with a high variance in reproductive success such as polygynous mating systems. Even among socially monogamous species, many males are extremely colourful. In their now-classic study, Møller and Birkhead (1994) suggested that increased variance in reproductive success afforded by extra-pair paternity should intensify sexual selection pressure and thus an elaboration of male plumage and sexual dichromatism, but the relatively few measures of extra-pair paternity at the time prevented a rigorous test of this hypothesis. In the nearly three decades since that paper’s publication, hundreds of studies have been published on rates of extra-pair paternity and more objective measures of plumage colouration have been developed, allowing for a large-scale comparative test of Møller and Birkhead’s (1994) hypothesis. Using an analysis of 186 socially monogamous passerine species with estimates of extra-pair paternity, our phylogenetically controlled analysis confirms Møller and Birkhead’s (1994) early work, demonstrating that rates of extra-pair paternity are positively associated with male, but not female, colouration and with the extent of sexual dichromatism. Plumage evolution is complex and multifaceted, driven by phylogenetic, ecological, and social factors, but our analysis confirms a key role of extra-pair mate choice in driving the evolution of ornamental traits."
https://openalex.org/W4292636392,"The adaptive exponentially weighted moving average (AEWMA) control charts are the advanced form of classical memory control charts used for efficiently monitoring small-to-large shifts in the process parameters (location and/or dispersion). These AEWMA control charts estimate the unknown shifts using exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) or cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts statistics. The hybrid EWMA (HEWMA) control chart is preferred over classical memory control charts to detect early shifts in process parameters. So, this study presents a new auxiliary information-based (AIB) AEWMA (IAEWMAAIB) control chart for process location that estimates the unknown location shift using HEWMA statistic. The objective is to develop an unbiased location shift estimator using HEWMA statistic and then adaptively update the smoothing constant. The shift estimation using HEWMA statistic instead of EWMA or CUSUM statistics boosts the performance of the proposed IAEWMAAIB control chart. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to get the numerical results. Famous performance evaluation measures like average run length, extra quadratic loss, relative average run length, and performance comparison index are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed chart with existing counterparts. The comparison reveals the superiority of the proposed control chart. Finally, two real-life applications from the glass manufacturing industry and physicochemical parameters of groundwater are considered to show the proposed control chart's implementation procedure and dominance."
https://openalex.org/W4292636398,"Extracting features of retinal vessels from fundus images plays an essential role in computer-aided diagnosis of diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular diseases. Although a number of deep learning-based methods have been used in this field, the accuracy of retinal vessel segmentation remains challenging due to limited densely annotated data, inter-vessel differences, and structured prediction problems, especially in areas of small blood vessels and the optic disk. In this paper, we propose an ARN model with a atrous block to address these issues, which can avoid the loss of data structure, and enlarge the receptive field, so that each convolution output contains a larger range of information. In addition, we also introduce residual convolution network to increase the network depth and improve the network performance.Some key parameters are used to measure the feasibility of the model, such as sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), F1-score (F1), accuracy (Acc), and area under each curve (AUC). Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which accuracy are 0.9686 on the DRIVE and 0.9746 on the CHASE DB1. The segmentation structure can assist the doctor in diagnosis more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4292636400,"""Sacrificial dilemmas"" are the scenarios typically used to study moral judgment and human morality. However, these dilemmas have been criticized regarding their lack of ecological validity. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a relevant context to further examine individuals' moral judgment and choice of action with more realistic sacrificial dilemmas. Using this context, the purpose of the present study is to investigate how moral responses are influenced by the contextualization of the dilemma (i.e., contextualized or not within the Covid-19 pandemic). By comparing two versions of one dilemma, Experiment 1 revealed that the more realistic version (the one contextualized within the Covid-19 pandemic) did not elicit more utilitarian responses than the less realistic version (the one not contextualized within the Covid-19 pandemic). In Experiment 2, we examined more specifically whether both the perceived realism of the dilemma and the plausibility of a utilitarian action influence moral responses. Results confirmed that the contextualization of the dilemma does not make any difference in moral responses. However, the plausibility of an action appears to exert an influence on the choice of action. Indeed, participants were more inclined to choose the utilitarian action in the plausible action versions than in the implausible action versions of the dilemma. Overall, these results shed light on the importance for future research of using mundane and dramatic realistic dilemmas displaying full information regarding a sacrificial action and its consequences."
https://openalex.org/W4292636412,"This paper presents new updated evidence on the initial public offering (IPO) aftermarket performance for 144 public listed firms on the Colombo Stock Exchange from 1991 to 2017. We found that average aftermarket returns are always lower than 1%. On average, buy and hold abnormal returns are negative in a short period, and abnormal returns gradually become positive over a longer period (12.46% in 3 years). Further, aftermarket returns are positively related to investor sentiment and the annual volume of listings while being negatively related to initial returns, which is consistent with the divergence of opinion hypothesis. We suggest that investors should hold their subscriptions of IPO shares for a prolonged time, usually exceeding two years, as the dynamic of shares rewards the investors with positive abnormal returns in the long run."
https://openalex.org/W4292636428,"Numerous studies have analysed the relationship between C 4 plant cover and climate. However, few have examined how different C 4 taxa vary in their response to climate, or how environmental factors alter C 4 :C 3 abundance. Here we investigate (a) how proportional C 4 plant cover and richness (relative to C 3 ) responds to changes in climate and local environmental factors, and (b) if this response is consistent among families. Proportional cover and richness of C 4 species were determined at 541 one-hectare plots across Australia for 14 families. C 4 cover and richness of the most common and abundant families were regressed against climate and local parameters. C 4 richness and cover in the monocot families Poaceae and Cyperaceae increased with latitude and were strongly positively correlated with January temperatures, however C 4 Cyperaceae occupied a more restricted temperature range. Seasonal rainfall, soil pH, soil texture, and tree cover modified proportional C 4 cover in both families. Eudicot families displayed considerable variation in C 4 distribution patterns. Proportional C 4 Euphorbiaceae richness and cover were negatively correlated with increased moisture availability (i.e. high rainfall and low aridity), indicating they were more common in dry environments. Proportional C 4 Chenopodiaceae richness and cover were weakly correlated with climate and local environmental factors, including soil texture. However, the explanatory power of C 4 Chenopodiaceae models were poor, suggesting none of the factors considered in this study strongly influenced Chenopodiaceae distribution. Proportional C 4 richness and cover in Aizoaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Portulacaceae increased with latitude, suggesting C 4 cover and richness in these families increased with temperature and summer rainfall, but sample size was insufficient for regression analysis. Results demonstrate the unique relationships between different C 4 taxa and climate, and the significant modifying effects of environmental factors on C 4 distribution. Our work also revealed C 4 families will not exhibit similar responses to local perturbations or climate."
https://openalex.org/W4292767175,"There is a disagreement on whether extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) have a beneficial or harmful effect on anxiety-like behavior. Prenatal stress induces frequent disturbances in offspring physiology such as anxiety-like behavior extending to adulthood. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of prenatal stress and ELF-EMF exposure before and during pregnancy on anxiety-like behavior and some anxiety-related pathways in the hippocampus of female rat offspring. A total of 24 female rats 40 days of age were distributed into four groups of 6 rats each: control, Stress (rats whose mothers underwent chronic stress), EMF (rats whose mothers were exposed to electromagnetic fields) and EMF/S (rats whose mothers were simultaneously exposed to chronic stress and ELF-EMF). The rats were given elevated plus-maze and open field tests and then their brains were dissected and their hippocampus were subjected to analysis. ELISA was used to measure 24(S)-hydroxy cholesterol, corticosterone, and serotonin levels. Cryptochrome2, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 3B-Hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2(NMDAr2) and phosphorylated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2(PNMDAr2) were assayed by immunoblotting. Anxiety-like behavior increased in all treatment groups at the same time EMF increased anxiety induced by maternal stress in the EMF/S group. The stress group showed decreased serotonin and increased corticosterone levels. ELF-EMF elevated the PNMDAr2/NMDAr2 ratio and 24(S)-hydroxy cholesterol compared to the control group but did not change corticosterone. EMF did not restore changes induced by stress in behavioral and molecular tests. The results of the current study, clarified that ELF-EMF can induce anxiety-like behavior which may be attributed to an increase in the PNMDAr2/NMDAr2 ratio and 24(S)-OHC in the hippocampus, and prenatal stress may contribute to anxiety via a decrease in serotonin and an increase in corticosterone in the hippocampus. We also found that anxiety-like behavior induced by maternal stress exposure, is exacerbated by electromagnetic fields radiation."
https://openalex.org/W4292767230,"The purpose of this study was to determine intra- and inter-observer agreement for the three skeletal ages derived from the TW2 method among male pubertal soccer players. The sample included 142 participants aged 11.0–15.3 years. Films of the left hand-wrist were evaluated twice by each of two observers. Twenty bones were rated and three scoring systems used to determine SA adopting the TW2 version: 20-bone, CARPAL and RUS. Overall agreement rates were 95.1% and 93.8% for, respectively, Observer A and Observer B. Although, agreement rates between observers differed for 13 bones (5 carpals, metacarpal-I, metacarpal-III, metacarpal-V, proximal phalanges-I, III and V, distal phalanx-III), intra-class correlationa were as follows: 0.990 (20-bone), 0.969 (CARPAL), and 0.988 (RUS). For the three SA protocols, BIAS was negligible: 0.02 years (20-bone), 0.04 years (CARPAL), and 0.03 years (RUS). Observer-associated error was not significant for 20-bone SA (TEM = 0.25 years, %CV = 1.86) neither RUS SA (TEM = 0.31 years, %CV = 2.22). Although the mean difference for CARPAL SAs between observers (observer A: 12.48±1.18 years; observer B: 12.29±1.24 years; t = 4.662, p&lt;0.01), the inter-observer disagreement had little impact (TEM: 0.34 years: %CV: 2.78). The concordance between bone-specific developmental stages seemed was somewhat more problematic for the carpals than for the long bones. Finally, when error due to the observer is not greater than one stage and the replicated assignments had equal probability for being lower or higher compared to initial assignments, the effect on SAs was trivial or small."
https://openalex.org/W4296502103,"Trypanosomes cause the devastating disease trypanosomiasis, in which the action of trans-sialidase (TS) enzymes harbored on their surface is a key virulence factor. TS enzymes are N-glycosylated, but the biological functions of their glycans have remained elusive. In this study, we investigated the influence of N-glycans on the enzymatic activity and structural stability of TconTS1, a recombinant TS from the African parasite Trypanosoma congolense. We expressed the enzyme in Chinese hamster ovary Lec1 cells, which produce high-mannose type N-glycans similar to the TS N-glycosylation pattern in vivo. Our MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data revealed that up to eight putative N-glycosylation sites were glycosylated. In addition, we determined that N-glycan removal via endoglycosidase Hf treatment of TconTS1 led to a decrease in substrate affinity relative to the untreated enzyme but had no impact on the conversion rate. Furthermore, we observed no changes in secondary structure elements of hypoglycosylated TconTS1 in CD experiments. Finally, our molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence for interactions between monosaccharide units of the highly flexible N-glycans and some conserved amino acids located at the catalytic site. These interactions led to conformational changes, possibly enhancing substrate accessibility and enzyme-substrate complex stability. The here-observed modulation of catalytic activity via N-glycans represents a so-far-unknown structure-function relationship potentially inherent in several members of the TS enzyme family."
https://openalex.org/W4292636198,"We conducted a seroprevalence survey to estimate the true number of infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in King County as of August 2020 by measuring the proportion of residents from who had antibodies against the virus. Participants from 727 households took part in a cross-sectional address-based household survey with random and non-random samples and provided dried blood spots that were tested for total antibody against the viral nucleocapsid protein, with confirmatory testing for immunoglobulin G against the spike protein. The data were weighted to match King County’s population based on sex, age group, income, race, and Hispanic status. After weighting and accounting for the accuracy of the tests, our best overall estimate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in King County as of August 2020 is 3.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4%-6.0%) with an effective sample size of 589. Comparing seroprevalence with positive test reports, our survey suggests that viral testing underestimated incidence by a factor of about five and suggests that the proportion of cases that were serious (based on hospitalization) or fatal was 2.4% and 0.8%, respectively. Prevalence varied by subgroup; households reporting incomes at or below $100,000 in 2019 had nearly five times higher estimated antibody prevalence than those with incomes above $100,000. Those reporting non-White/non-Asian race had roughly seven times higher estimated antibody prevalence than those reporting White race. This survey was noteworthy for including people of all ages; among all age groups, the weighted estimate of prevalence was highest in older teens and young adults and lowest in young children, although these differences were not statistically significant."
https://openalex.org/W4292636246,"Maternal intake of folic acid supplements is reportedly associated with the risk of early-onset allergies in offspring. However, only a few studies have considered the intake of both folic acid supplements and dietary folate. Here, the relationship between maternal intake of folic acid supplements and allergic symptoms such as wheeze and eczema in offspring was analyzed while considering dietary folate intake. We examined 84,361 mothers and 85,114 children in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study. The participants were divided into three groups depending on maternal folic acid supplementation (“no use,” “occasional use,” and “daily use”). Each group was then subdivided into three groups based on total folic acid and dietary folate intake. Outcomes were determined considering the wheeze and eczema status of each child at the age of 2 years. The status was based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. It was found that 22.1% of the mothers took folic acid supplements daily. In contrast, 56.3% of the mothers did not take these supplements. Maternal intake of folic acid supplements was not associated with wheeze and eczema in the offspring. In contrast, only dietary folate intake was positively associated with wheeze at the age of 2 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.103; 95% confidence interval, 1.003–1.212). However, there is no scientific evidence of a biological mechanism that clarifies this result. Potential confounders such as other nutrition, outdoor/indoor air pollution, and genetic factors may have affected the results. Therefore, further studies on the association between maternal intake of folic acid and allergic symptoms at the age of 3 or above are needed to confirm the results of this study.

https://openalex.org/W4292636389,"Purpose We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to determine whether genetically predicted basal metabolic rate (BMR) was a causal risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) or whether a genetically predicted CRC risk can influence the BMR level (i.e., reverse causation). Methods We employed 1,040 genetic variants as proxies for BMR to obtain effect estimates on CRC risk. Another 58 CRC-associated variants were used to estimate effects on BMR levels. Stratified analysis by tumor site was used to examine the causal associations between BMR and colon/rectal cancer risk. Results The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method indicated a significant causal effect of genetically determined BMR on CRC risk (OR SD = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.07–1.51). No significant reverse causal association was identified between genetically increased CRC risk and BMR levels [IVW ( β = 0, 95% CI = -0.01 to 0)]. The results of MR-Egger and the weighted median method were consistent with the IVW method. Stratified analysis by CRC sites identified significant causal associations between BMR and colon cancer [IVW (OR SD = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.16-1-80)], and null evidence of a causal association between BMR and rectal cancer risk was found ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion Our findings add to the current literature by validating a positive relationship between high BMR levels and CRC risk instead of reverse causality. The genetically predicted BMR level was causally associated with colon cancer risk but not rectal cancer risk."

With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening the health, wellbeing, and economic circumstances of people around the world, this study aims to assess the impacts of the pandemic on YEH in Toronto, Ontario, as well as to identify recommendations for future waves of COVID-19. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with YEH (ages 16–24, n = 45) and staff who work in one of four downtown emergency shelters for youth (n = 31) in Toronto, Ontario. Results YEH experienced both structural changes and psychosocial impacts resulting from the pandemic. Structural changes included a reduction in services, barriers to employment and housing, and changes to routines. Psychosocial outcomes included isolation, worsened mental health, and increased substance use. Impacts were magnified and distinct for subpopulations of youth, including for youth that identified as Black, 2SLGBTQ+, or those new to Canada. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic increased distress among YEH while also limiting access to services. There is therefore a need to balance health and safety with continued access to in-person services, and to shift the response to youth homelessness to focus on prevention, housing, and equitable supports for subpopulations of youth."
https://openalex.org/W4292636436,"Currently, the connectivity calculation of complex pipeline networks is mostly simplified or ignores the influence of nodes such as elbows and tees on the connectivity reliability of the entire network. Historical earthquake damage shows that the seismic performance of municipal buried pipelines depends on the ability of nodes and interfaces to resist deformation. The influence of node reliability on network connectivity under reciprocal loading is a key issue to be addressed. Therefore, based on the general connectivity probabilistic analysis algorithm, this paper embeds the reliability of nodes into the reliability of edges, and derives a more detailed and comprehensive on-intersecting minimum path recursive decomposition algorithm considering elbows, tees, and other nodes; then, based on the reliability calculation theory of various pipeline components, the reliability of various nodes in different soil is calculated using finite element numerical simulation; finally, the reliability of a small simple pipeline network and a large complex pipeline network are used as examples to reveal the importance of considering nodes in the connectivity calculation of pipeline network. The reliability of the network system decreases significantly after considering the nodes such as elbows and tees. The damage of one node usually causes the failure of the whole pipes of the path. The damage probability is greater in the area with dense elbow and tee nodes. In this study, all types of nodes that are more prone to damage are considered in detail in the calculation. As a result, the proposed algorithm has been improved in computational accuracy, which lays the foundation for further accurate calculation of pipeline network connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4292636451,"The friction coefficient between the tire and the road is one of the key parameters affecting road traffic safety. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the risk of skidding for the vehicles due to the friction evolution caused by the traffic polishing in the horizontal curve. Based on the reliability theory, an innovative dynamic risk assessment model is developed in the present study for passenger cars and trucks. The influence of two traffic characteristics for pavement friction is quantified: cumulative traffic volume (CTV) and annual average daily traffic of trucks (AADTT). The speed distribution on the horizontal curve of the motorway is obtained through field experiments as the basic parameter of the model. The Hasofer-Lind Method is adopted to solve the reliability and the risk probability of vehicle skidding. The results show that in the traffic characteristics, the AADTT has a significant impact on the pavement friction; When the AADTT on the road exceeds 2000 veh/d, the increasing CTV leads to friction decrease rapidly and therefore has a significant impact on the risk of horizontal curve. Especially for roads with more than 50 million vehicles of the CTV, the risk of the horizontal curve shows a sharp increase with CTV rising. The research results can provide reference for the road maintenance department to determine the timing of road maintenance."

To address this question, we generated forebrain-specific Ppp2cα knockout (KO) mice. We show that Ppp2cα KO mice display robust neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses in the postnatal cortex. Previous evidence has revealed that PD98059 is a potent ERK inhibitor and may protect the brain against cell death after cardiac arrest. To study whether PD98059 may have any effects on Ppp2cα KO mice, the latter was treated with this inhibitor. We demonstrated that the total number of cleaved caspase3 positive (+) cells in the cortex was significantly reduced in Ppp2cα KO mice treated with PD98059 compared with those without PD98059 treatment. We observed that the total number of IBA1+ cells in the cortex was significantly decreased in Ppp2cα KO mice treated with PD98059. Mechanistic analysis reveals that deletion of PP2Aca causes DNA damage, which may be attenuated by PD98059. Together, this study suggests that inhibition of ERK may be an effective strategy to reduce cell death in brain diseases with abnormal neuronal apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4292839971,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked genetic disorder induced by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to a degeneration of muscle fibers, triggering retrograde immunomodulatory, and degenerative events in the central nervous system. Thus, neuroprotective drugs such as pregabalin (PGB) can improve motor function by modulating plasticity, together with anti-inflammatory effects. The present work aimed to study the effects of PGB on axonal regeneration after axotomy in dystrophic and non-dystrophic mice. For that, MDX and C57BL/10 mouse strains were subjected to peripheral nerve damage and were treated with PGB (30 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 28 consecutive days. The treatment was carried out in mice as soon as they completed 5 weeks of life, 1 week before the lesion, corresponding to the peak period of muscle degeneration in the MDX strain. Six-week-old mice were submitted to unilateral sciatic nerve crush and were sacrificed in the 9th week of age. The ipsi and contralateral sciatic nerves were processed for immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, evaluating the expression of proteins and gene transcripts related to neuronal and Schwann cell activity. Cranial tibial muscles were dissected for evaluation of neuromuscular junctions using α-bungarotoxin, and the myelinated axons of the sciatic nerve were analyzed by morphometry. The recovery of motor function was monitored throughout the treatment through tests of forced locomotion (rotarod) and spontaneous walking track test (Catwalk system). The results show that treatment with PGB reduced the retrograde cyclic effects of muscle degeneration/regeneration on the nervous system. This fact was confirmed after peripheral nerve injury, showing better adaptation and response of neurons and glia for rapid axonal regeneration, with efficient muscle targeting and regain of function. No side effects of PGB treatment were observed, and the expression of pro-regenerative proteins in neurons and Schwann cells was upregulated. Morphometry of the axons was in line with the preservation of motor endplates, resulting in enhanced performance of dystrophic animals. Overall, the present data indicate that pregabalin is protective and enhances regeneration of the SNP during the development of DMD, improving motor function, which can, in turn, be translated to the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4292843247,"One approach towards advancing the quality of mental health care is to improve psychotherapists' skills through education and training. Recently, psychotherapy training has benefitted from adapting training methods from other professions (e.g., deliberate practice). The apprenticeship model has a long history in skill trades and medicine, but has yet to be adopted in training mental health professionals. This study aims to investigate the impact of apprenticeship training on clinical psychology students' skills.In a pragmatic mixed-methods trial, 120 first year students in a Master's degree clinical psychology program will be randomized to either training-as-usual or training-as-usual plus psychotherapy apprenticeship. In the intervention group, students will participate, over a period of 10 weeks, in weekly treatment sessions together with licensed therapists at outpatient mental health and substance use treatment clinics. Outcomes are assessed post-intervention and at two-year follow-up. The main outcome measure is the Facilitative Interpersonal Skills (FIS) performance test. Additional self-report measures tap self-efficacy, self-compassion, worry, rumination, and stress. Weekly reflection log entries written by the students will be qualitatively analyzed in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the learning process. Students' and therapists' experiences with the intervention will be explored in focus group interviews.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first controlled study to investigate the impact of apprenticeship as an isolated training component in the education of clinical psychologists. The study is designed so as to yield a comprehensive understanding of an approach which could prove to be a valuable supplement to the existing educational methods in this field and ultimately, contribute to improve the quality of mental health care."
