https://openalex.org/W1978927200,"As human lifespan increases, a greater fraction of the population is suffering from age-related cognitive impairments, making it important to elucidate a means to combat the effects of aging. Here we report that exposure of an aged animal to young blood can counteract and reverse pre-existing effects of brain aging at the molecular, structural, functional and cognitive level. Genome-wide microarray analysis of heterochronic parabionts--in which circulatory systems of young and aged animals are connected--identified synaptic plasticity-related transcriptional changes in the hippocampus of aged mice. Dendritic spine density of mature neurons increased and synaptic plasticity improved in the hippocampus of aged heterochronic parabionts. At the cognitive level, systemic administration of young blood plasma into aged mice improved age-related cognitive impairments in both contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. Structural and cognitive enhancements elicited by exposure to young blood are mediated, in part, by activation of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (Creb) in the aged hippocampus. Our data indicate that exposure of aged mice to young blood late in life is capable of rejuvenating synaptic plasticity and improving cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W1983517349,"We describe a new mechanism regulating the tumor endothelial barrier and T cell infiltration into tumors. We detected selective expression of the death mediator Fas ligand (FasL, also called CD95L) in the vasculature of human and mouse solid tumors but not in normal vasculature. In these tumors, FasL expression was associated with scarce CD8(+) infiltration and a predominance of FoxP3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells. Tumor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) cooperatively induced FasL expression in endothelial cells, which acquired the ability to kill effector CD8(+) T cells but not Treg cells because of higher levels of c-FLIP expression in Treg cells. In mice, genetic or pharmacologic suppression of FasL produced a substantial increase in the influx of tumor-rejecting CD8(+) over FoxP3(+) T cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of VEGF and PGE2 produced a marked increase in the influx of tumor-rejecting CD8(+) over FoxP3(+) T cells that was dependent on attenuation of FasL expression and led to CD8-dependent tumor growth suppression. Thus, tumor paracrine mechanisms establish a tumor endothelial death barrier, which has a critical role in establishing immune tolerance and determining the fate of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2068714945,"Tissue-resident macrophages are highly heterogeneous in terms of their functions and phenotypes as a consequence of adaptation to different tissue environments. Local tissue-derived signals are thought to control functional polarization of resident macrophages; however, the identity of these signals remains largely unknown. It is also unknown whether functional heterogeneity is a result of irreversible lineage-specific differentiation or a consequence of continuous but reversible induction of diverse functional programs. Here, we identified retinoic acid as a signal that induces tissue-specific localization and functional polarization of peritoneal macrophages through the reversible induction of transcription factor GATA6. We further found that GATA6 in macrophages regulates gut IgA production through peritoneal B-1 cells. These results provide insight into the regulation of tissue-resident macrophage functional specialization by tissue-derived signals."
https://openalex.org/W2106462080,"To investigate the cell-intrinsic aging mechanisms that erode the function of somatic stem cells during aging, we have conducted a comprehensive integrated genomic analysis of young and aged cells. We profiled the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and histone modifications of young and old murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGF-β signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Altogether, these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior. Ribosomal biogenesis emerged as a particular target of aging with increased transcription of ribosomal protein and RNA genes and hypomethylation of rRNA genes. This data set will serve as a reference for future epigenomic analysis of stem cell aging."
https://openalex.org/W2040104847,"The identity and behavior of mouse spermatogenic stem cells have been a long-standing focus of interest. In the prevailing ""As model,"" stem cell function is restricted to singly isolated (As) spermatogonia. By examining single-cell dynamics of GFRα1+ stem cells in vivo, we evaluate an alternative hypothesis that, through fragmentation, syncytial spermatogonia also contribute to stem cell function in homeostasis. We use live imaging and pulse labeling to quantitatively determine the fates of individual GFRα1+ cells and find that, during steady-state spermatogenesis, the entire GFRα1+ population comprises a single stem cell pool, in which cells continually interconvert between As and syncytial states. A minimal biophysical model, relying only on the rates of incomplete cell division and syncytial fragmentation, precisely predicts the stochastic fates of GFRα1+ cells during steady state and postinsult regeneration. Thus, our results define an alternative and dynamic model for spermatogenic stem cell function in the mouse testis."
https://openalex.org/W1976246361,"Cisplatin-based treatment is the first line chemotherapy for several cancers including ovarian cancer. The development of cisplatin resistance results in treatment failure, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we show that the induction of autophagy plays an important role in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Specifically, we show that cisplatin resistance is correlated with autophagy induction in a panel of ovarian cancer cells but not in immortalized human ovarian surface epithelial cells. Mechanistically, cisplatin treatment activates ERK and subsequently promotes autophagy. The inhibition of ERK activation with MEK inhibitors or knockdown of ERK expression with siRNA decreases cisplatin-induced autophagy and subsequently sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In ovarian cancer cells that have developed acquired cisplatin resistance, both ERK activation and autophagy induction are increased. Importantly, knockdown of ERK or inhibition of autophagy promotes cisplatin-induced apoptosis in acquired cisplatin-resistant cells. Collectively, our data indicate that ERK-mediated autophagy can lead to cisplatin resistance and suggest that cisplatin resistance can be overcome by inhibition of autophagy in ovarian cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056317902,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable disorder, in both a dominant and recessive manner, of connective tissue characterized by brittle bones, fractures and extraskeletal manifestations. How structural mutations of type I collagen (dominant OI) or of its post-translational modification machinery (recessive OI) can cause abnormal quality and quantity of bone is poorly understood. Notably, the clinical overlap between dominant and recessive forms of OI suggests common molecular pathomechanisms. Here, we show that excessive transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling is a mechanism of OI in both recessive (Crtap(-/-)) and dominant (Col1a2(tm1.1Mcbr)) OI mouse models. In the skeleton, we find higher expression of TGF-β target genes, higher ratio of phosphorylated Smad2 to total Smad2 protein and higher in vivo Smad2 reporter activity. Moreover, the type I collagen of Crtap(-/-) mice shows reduced binding to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin, a known regulator of TGF-β activity. Anti-TGF-β treatment using the neutralizing antibody 1D11 corrects the bone phenotype in both forms of OI and improves the lung abnormalities in Crtap(-/-) mice. Hence, altered TGF-β matrix-cell signaling is a primary mechanism in the pathogenesis of OI and could be a promising target for the treatment of OI."
https://openalex.org/W2119326805,"The cricket paralysis virus internal ribosome entry site (CrPV-IRES) is a folded structure in a viral mRNA that allows initiation of translation in the absence of any host initiation factors. By using recent advances in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy, we have solved the structure of CrPV-IRES bound to the ribosome of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis in both the canonical and rotated states at overall resolutions of 3.7 and 3.8 Å, respectively. In both states, the pseudoknot PKI of the CrPV-IRES mimics a tRNA/mRNA interaction in the decoding center of the A site of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The structure and accompanying factor-binding data show that CrPV-IRES binding mimics a pretranslocation rather than initiation state of the ribosome. Translocation of the IRES by elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is required to bring the first codon of the mRNA into the A site and to allow the start of translation."
https://openalex.org/W4210241576,"The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a supra-molecular complex akin to bacteriophage tails, with VgrG proteins acting as a puncturing device. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa H1-T6SS has been extensively characterized. It is involved in bacterial killing and in the delivery of three toxins, Tse1-3. Here, we demonstrate the independent contribution of the three H1-T6SS co-regulated vgrG genes, vgrG1abc, to bacterial killing. A putative toxin is encoded in the vicinity of each vgrG gene, supporting the concept of specific VgrG/toxin couples. In this respect, VgrG1c is involved in the delivery of an Rhs protein, RhsP1. The RhsP1 C terminus carries a toxic activity, from which the producing bacterium is protected by a cognate immunity. Similarly, VgrG1a-dependent toxicity is associated with the PA0093 gene encoding a two-domain protein with a putative toxin domain (Toxin_61) at the C terminus. Finally, VgrG1b-dependent killing is detectable upon complementation of a triple vgrG1abc mutant. The VgrG1b-dependent killing is mediated by PA0099, which presents the characteristics of the superfamily nuclease 2 toxin members. Overall, these data develop the concept that VgrGs are indispensable components for the specific delivery of effectors. Several additional vgrG genes are encoded on the P. aeruginosa genome and are not linked genetically to other T6SS genes. A closer inspection of these clusters reveals that they also encode putative toxins. Overall, these associations further support the notion of an original form of secretion system, in which VgrG acts as the carrier."
https://openalex.org/W2084020418,"Rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer of skeletal muscle lineage, is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Major subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma include alveolar (ARMS) and embryonal (ERMS) tumors. Whereas ARMS tumors typically contain translocations generating PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 fusions that block terminal myogenic differentiation, no functionally comparable genetic event has been found in ERMS tumors. Here we report the discovery, through whole-exome sequencing, of a recurrent somatic mutation encoding p.Leu122Arg in the myogenic transcription factor MYOD1 in a distinct subset of ERMS tumors with poor outcomes that also often contain mutations altering PI3K-AKT pathway components. Previous mutagenesis studies had shown that MYOD1 with a p.Leu122Arg substitution can block wild-type MYOD1 function and bind to MYC consensus sequences, suggesting a possible switch from differentiation to proliferation. Our functional data now confirm this prediction. Thus, MYOD1 p.Leu122Arg defines a subset of rhabdomyosarcomas eligible for high-risk protocols and the development of targeted therapeutics."

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocyst stage embryos. They have two defining features: the ability to become any other cell type, known as pluripotency; and the ability to proliferate indefinitely while maintaining the pluripotent state, known as self-renewal. At the transcriptional level, ESC self-renewal and pluripotency are maintained by a highly orchestrated gene expression program (Dejosez and Zwaka, 2012Dejosez M. Zwaka T.P.

The regulators of this program can activate, repress, or establish a poised state for gene expression. Master ESC transcription factors Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 form the core of the pluripotency transcription network. They form a self-regulatory loop and activate pluripotency genes while repressing those involved in differentiation (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S.

Many other pluripotency factors further modulate and refine the core circuitry and augment the function of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B.

How the master transcription factors act differently to activate ESC and repress differentiation genes is not clear. In addition to transcription factors, recent studies indicate that the chromatin of ESCs has a unique open conformation, which likely contributes to self-renewal and pluripotency by providing an appropriate environment for gene expression (Mattout and Meshorer, 2010Mattout A. Meshorer E. Chromatin plasticity and genome organization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indeed, ESCs are highly sensitive to reduced levels of chromatin architectural proteins such as Cohesin and Mediator (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B.

They are also sensitive to the depletion of chromatin regulators such as histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodelers (Fazzio et al., 2008Fazzio T.G. Huff J.T. Panning B.

Although the complex interplay of the master ESC transcription factors with chromatin regulators is a focus of intense investigation, much remains to be learned. Of the chromatin regulators, the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes can move, eject, or restructure nucleosome composition and dynamics (Clapier and Cairns, 2009Clapier C.R. Cairns B.R.

As a result, they play a central role in gene regulation by controlling the packing and unpacking of the chromatin to provide regulated DNA accessibility. Several chromatin remodelers, including Chd1, Chd7, esBAF, and Tip60-p400, have been studied in ESCs (Fazzio et al., 2008Fazzio T.G. Huff J.T. Panning B.

However, little is known regarding how the master ESC transcription factors themselves utilize chromatin remodeling factors to selectively activate the genes required for self-renewal and pluripotency. We and others have previously identified the INO80 complex as a self-renewal factor in RNAi screens (Chia et al., 2010Chia N.Y. Chan Y.S. Feng B. Lu X. Orlov Y.L. Moreau D. Kumar P. Yang L. Jiang J.

A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies a new transcriptional module required for self-renewal.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The INO80 complex belongs to the INO80 subfamily of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes. Although it is known to function in a variety of nuclear transactions, including transcription regulation, DNA repair, and DNA replication (Conaway and Conaway, 2009Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

Biol. 2010; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), its role in ESCs remains undefined. Here, we show that the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex is required for ESC self-renewal, as well as for reprogramming and embryonic development. INO80 selectively occupies promoters of core pluripotency genes bound by the master ESC transcription factors, but not those involved in differentiation, and its occupancy is dependent on OCT4 and WDR5. Importantly, INO80 maintains accessible chromatin architecture and facilitates recruitment of Mediator and RNA polymerase II at these genes, promoting their expression. These results define an essential role for the INO80 complex in the establishment and maintenance of the pluripotent state through its specific action on a core network of pluripotency genes. To define the role of the INO80 complex in ESCs, we silenced individual subunits with siRNAs. Using the Oct4GiP reporter ESCs (Ying and Smith, 2003Ying Q.L. Smith A.G. Defined conditions for neural commitment and differentiation.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Zheng and Hu, 2012Zheng X. Hu G. Oct4GiP reporter assay to study genes that regulate mouse embryonic stem cell maintenance and self-renewal.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; https://doi.org/10.3791/3987Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), in which the expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is driven by the ESC-specific Oct4 promoter, we found that silencing of all the tested subunits (Figure S1A available online) resulted in ESC differentiation as evidenced by the loss of EGFP expression (Figure 1A). Furthermore, INO80 complex silencing also led to the loss of typical ESC morphology (Figure 1B), suggesting that it plays an essential role in ESC maintenance. As Ino80 is the SWI/SNF ATPase in the complex and its knockdown (KD) led to the most pronounced phenotype (Figures 1A and 1B), we chose to focus on this specific subunit to elucidate the role of the INO80 complex in ESCs. Consistent with the above results, Ino80 KD led to the loss of alkaline phosphatase (an ESC marker) staining (Figure S1B). Furthermore, it led to decreased expression of key pluripotency factors including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, and Esrrb, as well as increased expression of lineage markers such as Cdx2, Fgf5, Nestin, and Pax3 (Figures 1C and 1D). To minimize the possibility of the off-target effect, we used two siRNAs and three shRNAs for Ino80 silencing. In all cases, Ino80 silencing led to similar changes in pluripotency marker expression (Figures S1C and S1D). Thus, Ino80 is required for ESC self-renewal. In agreement with its role in self-renewal, Ino80 is downregulated during ESC differentiation, similar to the ESC marker Oct4 (Figure 1E). In addition, it is expressed at higher levels in ESCs compared to other cell types, such as trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Figure S2). Interestingly, analysis of published chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data sets showed that key pluripotency factors such as OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, KLF4, and ESRRB co-occupy regions near the Ino80 transcription start site (TSS; Figure 1F). Moreover, Oct4 or Sox2 KD resulted in significant downregulation of Ino80 within 48 hr (Figure 1G). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that Ino80 expression correlates with the ESC state and is tightly regulated by pluripotency factors. To understand how the INO80 complex regulates self-renewal and pluripotency, we carried out microarray analysis upon silencing of individual subunits in ESCs. Ino80, Ino80b, Ino80c, and Ino80e KD induced expression changes of 2,406, 1,845, 1,810, and 1,276 genes, respectively. Overlap analysis indicated that 440 genes had altered expression patterns no matter which subunit was silenced (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, the overwhelming majority of these genes (407 of the 440) were downregulated following depletion of INO80 subunits, suggesting that the INO80 complex may function to sustain their expression. Furthermore, this gene set included key pluripotency genes such as Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcl1, Tbx3, and Foxd3 (Figures S3A and S3B), suggesting that the INO80 complex is required for the expression of pluripotency factors in ESCs. To monitor the dynamic gene expression changes upon Ino80 KD, we performed microarray analysis at days 2, 4, and 6 after silencing the ATPase Ino80 with a lentiviral-based shRNA. Consistent with the above results using siRNAs, Ino80 KD by shRNA induced downregulation of almost all the well-characterized pluripotency factors over time, including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcl1, Tbx3, Nr0b1, Nr5a2, Foxd3, Zfp42, and Tet1 (Figures 2B and S3C). Furthermore, Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) indicated that Ino80-regulated genes are highly enriched for pluripotency factors (Figure S3D), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that genes downregulated after Ino80 KD are highly enriched for genes that are downregulated during ESC differentiation (Figure 2C). In contrast, the vast majority of housekeeping genes were not downregulated after Ino80 silencing (Figures S3E and S3F). To understand how Ino80 fits into the pluripotency transcription network, we next compared the gene expression changes caused by Ino80 KD with those caused by the depletion of other pluripotency factors. Ino80 KD clustered with Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Figure 2D), suggesting that similar to those master transcription factors, Ino80 plays a critical role in maintaining the gene expression program in ESCs. Together, these results support the notion that the INO80 complex is an important component of the pluripotency transcription circuitry and is required for the expression of pluripotency factors. The fact that key pluripotency factors such as Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, and Esrrb were quickly downregulated after INO80 silencing (Figures 2B and S3A–S3C) suggested that the complex may directly regulate their expression. To test this hypothesis, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and identified 12,749 genomic regions occupied by Ino80 with high confidence (FDR = 10−6). The Ino80 peaks were enriched in gene-rich chromosomal regions where they tended to colocalize with transcription start sites (TSS; Figures 2E and S4A) as has been observed in yeast (Yen et al., 2013Yen K. Vinayachandran V. Pugh B.F. SWR-C and INO80 chromatin remodelers recognize nucleosome-free regions near +1 nucleosomes.Cell. 2013; 154: 1246-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ino80 peaks colocalized with active histone marks including H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, but not inactive chromatin marks such as H3K27me3. They also closely colocalized with the master ESC transcription factors OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 (Figures 2F and S4B). Inspection of individual gene tracks and ChIP followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) showed that Ino80 occupied genomic regions near well-characterized pluripotency genes, including the master ESC transcription factors (Figure 2G). Of the 2,126 genes that showed differential expression after Ino80 KD, 678 had Ino80 occupancy nearby and were likely its direct targets (Figure 2H). These Ino80 target genes included nearly all the key pluripotency factors and were strongly enriched for genes involved in ESC self-renewal and pluripotency (Figures 2H and 2I). Notably, whereas many Ino80-occupied genes were co-occupied by master ESC transcription factors OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, the converse statement was not true. A significantly smaller fraction of the OCT4, NANOG, or SOX2-bound genes were co-occupied by Ino80 (Figures 3A and S4B). GSEA indicated that Ino80-occupied genes were mostly downregulated during ESC differentiation (Figures 3A and 3B), consistent with the idea that INO80 facilitates expression at these loci and may function as an activator (Figure 2A). In contrast, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2-bound genes were either upregulated or downregulated during differentiation (Figures 3A and S4C). Because Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 are known to maintain self-renewal by activating ESC genes and repressing differentiation genes, our data suggest that Ino80 is required for the master transcription factors to activate pluripotency genes integral to the ESC state. In agreement with this, genes co-occupied by Ino80, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 are highly enriched for pluripotency genes and tend to be downregulated during differentiation (Figures 3C, S4D, S4E; Table S5). Genes co-occupied by OCT4, NANOG, SOX2 but not Ino80 are enriched for developmental and differentiation-associated genes and are more likely to be upregulated during differentiation (Figures 3C, S4D, S4E; Table S5). To understand how Ino80 is recruited to pluripotency genes promoters, we searched for factors that are required for its genomic occupancy. Because chromatin regulators are often recruited by pioneer factors, we hypothesized that Ino80 may be recruited by master ESC transcription factors. Indeed, it has been reported that OCT4 interacts with Ino80 (Pardo et al., 2010Pardo M. Lang B. Yu L. Prosser H. Bradley A. Babu M.M. Choudhary J. An expanded Oct4 interaction network: implications for stem cell biology, development, and disease.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 382-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and we confirmed the interaction by immunoprecipitation (Figure 3D). To test our hypothesis, we used the ZHBTc4 cells in which Oct4 expression can be repressed by doxycycline treatment (Niwa et al., 2000Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Quantitative expression of Oct-3/4 defines differentiation, dedifferentiation or self-renewal of ES cells.Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). We found that Oct4 depletion by 48 hr of doxycycline treatment led to a profound reduction in Ino80 occupancy near pluripotency gene promoters, with only a modest decrease in Ino80 expression (Figures 3E and 3F). This result suggested that OCT4 is important for Ino80 recruitment. However, we reasoned that there may be additional factor(s) involved, because Ino80 occupancy was not abolished in OCT4 depleted cells and Ino80 only occupies a small subset of genes that are occupied by OCT4. To search for the additional factor(s), we carried out Ino80 immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass spectrometry, and found that Ino80 interacts with another known pluripotency protein WDR5 (data not shown). We confirmed this interaction by IP-western (Figures 3D and S4F). WDR5 is a key component of the H3K4 methyltransferase complex. It occupies actively transcribed genes in ESCs and is required for self-renewal (Ang et al., 2011Ang Y.S. Tsai S.Y. Lee D.F. Monk J. Su J. Ratnakumar K. Ding J. Ge Y. Darr H. Chang B. et al.Wdr5 mediates self-renewal and reprogramming via the embryonic stem cell core transcriptional network.Cell. 2011; 145: 183-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To test its role in Ino80 recruitment, we silenced Wdr5 with shRNAs. At 48 hr, Wdr5 silencing significantly reduced Ino80 genomic occupancy without affecting its expression (Figures 3G and 3H). Thus, Ino80 occupancy is dependent on both OCT4 and WDR5. Because Oct4 and Wdr5 occupy developmental genes and actively transcribed genes, respectively, they may cooperatively facilitate the recruitment of Ino80 to pluripotency gene promoters. Consistent with this notion, there is a significant overlap between genes co-occupied by OCT4 and WDr5 and those occupied by Ino80 (Figure 3I). However, there are likely other factors involved in the recruitment of Ino80, because Oct4 and Wdr5 occupy both promoter and enhancer regions whereas Ino80 preferentially occupies promoter regions. Our results indicate that the INO80 complex is required for pluripotency gene expression. We therefore hypothesize that INO80 may activate pluripotency genes by recruiting factors necessary for their transcription. Consistent with this idea, we found that Ino80 occupancy at promoter proximal regions strongly correlates with occupancy of factors important in ESC gene expression and self-renewal, such as OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, ESRRB, KLF4, and MED1 (Figures 4A, 4B, S5A, and S5B). To test whether Ino80 occupancy affects the recruitment of these factors, we carried out ChIP-seq for OCT4, KLF4, and MED1 48 hr after Ino80 shRNA virus transduction. At this time point, Ino80 silencing led to significant downregulation of Ino80 protein, but only subtle decreases in pluripotency mRNA and protein levels and a slight upregulation of MED1 level (Figures S5C and S5D). However, Ino80 silencing led to an obvious reduction in MED1 binding at Ino80 and MED1 co-occupied TSS regions (Figures 4C and 4D). Furthermore, MED1 binding was reduced near genes that were downregulated after Ino80 silencing (Figures 4E and 4F). In contrast, Ino80 silencing did not cause a similar decrease in OCT4 or KLF4 binding (Figures 4C and 4D). OCT4 binding was even slightly increased, consistent with a recent report that slightly reduced OCT4 level increases its occupancy (Karwacki-Neisius et al., 2013Karwacki-Neisius V. Göke J. Osorno R. Halbritter F. Ng J.H. Weiße A.Y. Wong F.C. Gagliardi A. Mullin N.P. Festuccia N. et al.Reduced Oct4 expression directs a robust pluripotent state with distinct signaling activity and increased enhancer occupancy by Oct4 and Nanog.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 531-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, Ino80 does not appear to directly regulate the recruitment of pluripotency transcription factors. Examination of individual gene tracks and ChIP-qPCR confirmed that Ino80 silencing caused significant reduction of Mediator binding near key pluripotency gene promoter regions (Figures 4G and 4H). Because Mediator is essential for transcription initiation (Ansari and Morse, 2013Ansari S.A. Morse R.H. Mechanisms of Mediator complex action in transcriptional activation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 2743-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), our results suggest that Ino80 may normally promote pluripotency gene expression through the recruitment of Mediator. Because Mediator loss-of-function has been found to compromise RNA polymerase II association with promoters of active genes in other cell types (Ansari and Morse, 2013Ansari S.A. Morse R.H. Mechanisms of Mediator complex action in transcriptional activation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 2743-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we next examined whether Ino80 silencing and impaired Med1 recruitment has an impact on Pol II occupancy. Based on ChIP-seq, Ino80 silencing led to decreased binding of Pol II near promoters occupied by Ino80 (Figures 5A and 5B ), as well as promoters of genes downregulated after Ino80 silencing (Figures 5C and 5D). This result was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR at the Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Klf4 promoters (Figure 5E). Importantly, Ino80, MED1, and Pol II co-occupied genes were highly enriched for those that are downregulated during ESC differentiation into EBs (Figures 5F and 5G). Together, our data suggest that Ino80 activates pluripotency genes by facilitating the recruitment of Mediator and Pol II at their promoters. Recent work in yeast has demonstrated a striking association of INO80-family chromatin remodelers with nucleosome depleted regions around transcription start sites where it participates in H2A/H2A.Z exchange and nucleosome turnover (Ranjan et al., 2013Ranjan A. Mizuguchi G. FitzGerald P.C. Wei D. Wang F. Huang Y. Luk E. Woodcock C.L. Wu C.

SWR-C and INO80 chromatin remodelers recognize nucleosome-free regions near +1 nucleosomes.Cell. 2013; 154: 1246-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that physical occupancy of these regions by the INO80 complex might preclude stable nucleosome formation in these regions at bound loci, leaving DNA in and around the TSS more accessible to the general transcription machinery, Mediator, and RNA pol II. Thus, we evaluated the nucleosome occupancy in the presence or absence of Ino80 by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion and PCR at selected regions. Whereas no effect was observed on genomic regions that are only occupied by ESC master transcription factors, nucleosome occupancy at regions co-occupied by Ino80 and master transcription factors was greatly increased at 48 hr of Ino80 KD (Figure 6A). Consistent with that observation, Ino80 binding sites resided in nucleosome-depleted regions in ESCs (Figure 6B). In contrast, the overall OCT4 occupied regions were not associated with nucleosome depletion (Figure 6B), but those that were co-occupied by Ino80 showed some depletion (Figure S5E). To determine how Ino80-mediated nucleosome depletion affects genome accessibility, we carried out DNase I sensitivity assay for selected regions in the presence or absence of Ino80. Ino80 depletion led to reduced DNase I sensitivity at regions co-occupied by Ino80 and ESC master transcription factors, but had no effect on those only occupied by master transcription factors (Figure 6C). In agreement with that, almost all Ino80 bound regions (12,470 out of 12,749, 97.81%) overlapped with DNase I hypersensitive sites (Figure 6D), and Ino80 occupancy positively correlated with DNase I hypersensitivity (Figure 6E). These data suggest that Ino80 maintains an open chromatin structure near pluripotency genes. To test whether Ino80-mediated open chromatin structure facilitates the activation of the neighboring gene, we cloned DNA fragments occupied by Ino80 in ESCs into a luciferase reporter construct (Whyte et al., 201"
https://openalex.org/W1970254583,"Timothy Chan and colleagues show that the PARK2 tumor suppressor is a master regulator of G1 and S phase cyclins and is critical for proper cell cycle regulation. PARK2 genetic alterations are common across many human cancers as well as in hereditary Parkinson's disease. Coordinate control of different classes of cyclins is fundamentally important for cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, yet the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that the PARK2 tumor suppressor mediates this coordination. The PARK2 E3 ubiquitin ligase coordinately controls the stability of both cyclin D and cyclin E. Analysis of approximately 5,000 tumor genomes shows that PARK2 is a very frequently deleted gene in human cancer and uncovers a striking pattern of mutual exclusivity between PARK2 deletion and amplification of CCND1, CCNE1 or CDK4—implicating these genes in a common pathway. Inactivation of PARK2 results in the accumulation of cyclin D and acceleration of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, PARK2 is a component of a new class of cullin-RING–containing ubiquitin ligases targeting both cyclin D and cyclin E for degradation. Thus, PARK2 regulates cyclin-CDK complexes, as does the CDK inhibitor p16, but acts as a master regulator of the stability of G1/S cyclins."
https://openalex.org/W2012208277,"Many common human mesenchymal tumors, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS), feature myogenic differentiation. Here we report that intragenic deletion of the dystrophin-encoding and muscular dystrophy-associated DMD gene is a frequent mechanism by which myogenic tumors progress to high-grade, lethal sarcomas. Dystrophin is expressed in the non-neoplastic and benign counterparts of GIST, RMS and LMS tumors, and DMD deletions inactivate larger dystrophin isoforms, including 427-kDa dystrophin, while preserving the expression of an essential 71-kDa isoform. Dystrophin inhibits myogenic sarcoma cell migration, invasion, anchorage independence and invadopodia formation, and dystrophin inactivation was found in 96%, 100% and 62% of metastatic GIST, embryonal RMS and LMS samples, respectively. These findings validate dystrophin as a tumor suppressor and likely anti-metastatic factor, suggesting that therapies in development for muscular dystrophies may also have relevance in the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1970561675,"DNA damage is considered to be a prime factor in several spinocerebellar neurodegenerative diseases; however, the DNA lesions underpinning disease etiology are unknown. We observed the endogenous accumulation of pathogenic topoisomerase-1 (Top1)-DNA cleavage complexes (Top1ccs) in murine models of ataxia telangiectasia and spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy 1. We found that the defective DNA damage response factors in these two diseases cooperatively modulated Top1cc turnover in a non-epistatic and ATM kinase-independent manner. Furthermore, coincident neural inactivation of ATM and DNA single-strand break repair factors, including tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase-1 or XRCC1, resulted in increased Top1cc formation and excessive DNA damage and neurodevelopmental defects. Notably, direct Top1 poisoning to elevate Top1cc levels phenocopied the neuropathology of the mouse models described above. Our results identify a critical endogenous pathogenic lesion associated with neurodegenerative syndromes arising from DNA repair deficiency, indicating that genome integrity is important for preventing disease in the nervous system."

Most intratumoral CD8+ T cells exhibited an antigen-experienced effector memory cell phenotype and were capable of producing IFN-γ. CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and IL-17 producing T helper cells were significantly more prevalent in tumor than in blood. Consistent with the association with reduced survival in previous studies, we observed higher frequencies of both myeloid cells and Treg in poorly differentiated tumors. The majority of intratumoral T cells expressed the co-inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1), suggesting one potential mechanism through which PDA may evade antitumor immunity. Successful multimodal neoadjuvant therapy altered the immunoregulatory balance and was associated with reduced infiltration of both myeloid cells and Treg.Our data show that human PDA contains a complex mixture of inflammatory and regulatory immune cells, and that neoadjuvant therapy attenuates the infiltration of intratumoral cells associated with immunosuppression and worsened survival."
https://openalex.org/W2019427642,"Talins are adaptor proteins that regulate focal adhesion signaling by conjugating integrins to the cytoskeleton. Talins directly bind integrins and are essential for integrin activation. We previously showed that β1 integrins are activated in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) cells, increasing PCa metastasis to lymph nodes and bone. However, how β1 integrins are activated in PCa cells is unknown. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism of β1 integrin activation. Using knockdown experiments, we first demonstrated that talin1, but not talin2, is important in β1 integrin activation. We next showed that talin1 S425 phosphorylation, but not total talin1 expression, correlates with metastatic potential of PCa cells. Expressing a non-phosphorylatable mutant, talin1(S425A), in talin1-silenced PC3-MM2 and C4-2B4 PCa cells, decreased activation of β1 integrins, integrin-mediated adhesion, motility and increased the sensitivity of the cells to anoikis. In contrast, reexpression of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant talin1(S425D) led to increased β1 integrin activation and generated biologic effects opposite to talin1(S425A) expression. In the highly metastatic PC3-MM2 cells, expression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant, talin1(S425A), in talin1-silenced PC3-MM2 cells, abolished their ability to colonize in the bone following intracardiac injection, while reexpression of phosphorylation-mimicking mutant talin1(S425D) restored their ability to metastasize to bone. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that talin S425 phosphorylation is significantly increased in human bone metastases when compared with normal tissues, primary tumors or lymph node metastases. We further showed that p35 expression, an activator of Cdk5, and Cdk5 activity were increased in metastatic tumor cells, and that Cdk5 kinase activity is responsible for talin1 phosphorylation and subsequent β1 integrin activation. Together, our study reveals Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of talin1 leading to β1 integrin activation is a novel mechanism that increases metastatic potential of PCa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969377459,"The plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for several abiotic stress responses. ABA signaling is normally repressed by group-A protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs), but stress-induced ABA binds Arabidopsis PYR/PYL/RCAR (PYL) receptors, which then bind and inhibit PP2Cs. X-ray structures of several receptor-ABA complexes revealed a tunnel above ABA's 3' ring CH that opens at the PP2C binding interface. Here, ABA analogs with sufficiently long 3' alkyl chains were predicted to traverse this tunnel and block PYL-PP2C interactions. To test this, a series of 3'-alkylsulfanyl ABAs were synthesized with different alkyl chain lengths. Physiological, biochemical and structural analyses revealed that a six-carbon alkyl substitution produced a potent ABA antagonist that was sufficiently active to block multiple stress-induced ABA responses in vivo. This study provides a new approach for the design of ABA analogs, and the results validated structure-based design for this target class."

As many soil microbes are capable of degrading petroleum, knowledge about the intrinsic degraders and the microbial dynamics in the deep subsurface could extend our understanding of the application of in-situ bioremediation. In this study, an experiment was conducted to investigate the bacterial communities in response to simulated contamination to deep soil samples by using 454 pyrosequencing amplicons. The result showed that bacterial diversity was reduced after 8-weeks contamination. A shift in bacterial community composition was apparent in crude oil-amended soils with Proteobacteria (esp. α-subdivision) being the dominant phylum, together with Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. The contamination led to enrichment of indigenous bacterial taxa like Novosphingobium, Sphingobium, Caulobacter, Phenylobacterium, Alicylobacillus and Arthrobacter, which are generally capable of degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The community shift highlighted the resilience of PAH degraders and their potential for in-situ degradation of crude oil under favorable conditions in the deep soils."
https://openalex.org/W2013194737,"Cilia and flagella are conserved, motile, and sensory cell organelles involved in signal transduction and human disease. Their scaffold consists of a 9-fold array of remarkably stable doublet microtubules (DMTs), along which motor proteins transmit force for ciliary motility and intraflagellar transport. DMTs possess Ribbons of three to four hyper-stable protofilaments whose location, organization, and specialized functions have been elusive. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and structural arrangements of Ribbon proteins from sea urchin sperm flagella, using quantitative immunobiochemistry, proteomics, immuno-cryo-electron microscopy, and tomography. Isolated Ribbons contain acetylated α-tubulin, β-tubulin, conserved protein Rib45, >95% of the axonemal tektins, and >95% of the calcium-binding proteins, Rib74 and Rib85.5, whose human homologues are related to the cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. DMTs contain only one type of Ribbon, corresponding to protofilaments A11-12-13-1 of the A-tubule. Rib74 and Rib85.5 are associated with the Ribbon in the lumen of the A-tubule. Ribbons contain a single ∼5-nm wide filament, composed of equimolar tektins A, B, and C, which interact with the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. A summary of findings is presented, and the functions of Ribbon proteins are discussed in terms of the assembly and stability of DMTs, ciliary motility, and other microtubule systems."
https://openalex.org/W2139350893,"The active form of vitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, has significant immunomodulatory properties and is an important determinant in the differentiation of CD4+ effector T cells. The biological actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and are believed to correlate with the VDR protein expression level in a given cell. The aim of this study was to determine if and how 1,25(OH)2D3 by itself regulates VDR expression in human CD4+ T cells. We found that activated CD4+ T cells have the capacity to convert the inactive 25(OH)D3 to the active 1,25(OH)2D3 that subsequently up-regulates VDR protein expression approximately 2-fold. 1,25(OH)2D3 does not increase VDR mRNA expression but increases the half-life of the VDR protein in activated CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces a significant intracellular redistribution of the VDR. We show that 1,25(OH)2D3 stabilizes the VDR by protecting it from proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that proteasome inhibition leads to up-regulation of VDR protein expression and increases 1,25(OH)2D3-induced gene activation. In conclusion, our study shows that activated CD4+ T cells can produce 1,25(OH)2D3, and that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces a 2-fold up-regulation of the VDR protein expression in activated CD4+ T cells by protecting the VDR against proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2094809025,"Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) loss in lung adenocarcinoma is commonly caused by genetic mutations, but these mutations rarely occur in Asian patients. We recently reported wild-type LKB1 loss via the alteration of NKX2-1/p53-axis-promoted tumor aggressiveness and predicted poor outcomes in cases of lung adenocarcinoma. The mechanistic action of wild-type LKB1 loss within tumor progression remains unknown. The suppression of MYC by LKB1 controls epithelial organization; therefore, we hypothesize that MYC expression can be increased via wild-type LKB1 loss and promotes tumor progression. Here, MYC transcription is upregulated by LKB1-loss-mediated MZF1 expression. The wild-type LKB1-loss-mediated MZF1/MYC axis is responsible for soft-agar growth, migration and invasion in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, wild-type LKB1 loss-induced cell invasiveness was markedly suppressed by MYC inhibitors (10058-F4 and JQ1). Patients with low-LKB1/high-MZF1 or low-LKB1/high-MYC tumors have shorter overall survival and relapse-free-survival periods than patients with high-LKB1/low-MZF1 or high-LKB1/low-MYC tumors. In summary, MZF1-mediated MYC expression may promote tumor progression, resulting in poor outcomes in cases of lung adenocarcinoma with low-wild-type-LKB1 tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1989041528,"A major goal of cell therapy for vascular diseases is to promote revascularization through the injection of endothelial stem/progenitor cells. The gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie endothelial progenitor-mediated vascular repair, however, remain elusive. Here, we identify the transcription factor TAL1/SCL as a key mediator of the vascular repair function of primary human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). Genome-wide analyses in ECFCs demonstrate that TAL1 activates a transcriptional program that promotes cell adhesion and migration. At the mechanistic level, we show that TAL1 upregulates the expression of migratory and adhesion genes through recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300. Based on these findings, we establish a strategy that enhances the revascularization efficiency of ECFCs after ischemia through ex vivo priming with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA. Thus, small molecule epigenetics drugs are effective tools for modifying the epigenome of stem/progenitor cells prior to transplantation as a means to enhance their therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2053493373,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults with a dismal prognosis. Current therapy of surgical removal combined with Temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy only slightly prolongs the survival of GBM patients. Thus, it is essential to elucidate mechanism underlying its highly malignant properties in order to develop efficacious therapeutic regimens. In this study, we showed that progranulin (PGRN) was overexpressed in most GBM cell lines and the majority of human tumor samples. PGRN overexpression conferred GBM cells with tumorigenic properties and TMZ resistance by upregulating DNA repair (PARP, ATM, BRCA1, Rad51, XRCC1 and so on) and cancer stemness (CD133, CD44, ABCG2) genes, in part via an AP-1 transcription factor, specifically cFos/JunB. Curcumin, an AP-1 inhibitor, was also found to regulate PGRN promoter activity and expression including its downstream effectors aforementioned. These data suggested a feedforward loop between PGRN signaling and AP-1. PGRN depletion significantly decreased unlimited self-renewal and multilineage differentiation and the malignant properties of GBMs cells S1R1, and enhanced their vulnerability to TMZ. In addition, S1R1 depleted of PGRN also lost the ability to form tumor in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, PGRN had a critical role in the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of GBM and functioned at the top of the hierarchy of cellular machinery that modulates both DNA repair pathways and cancer stemness. Our data suggest that a new strategy combining current regimens with compounds targeting PGRN/AP-1 loop like curcumin may significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2046129853,"Fate decisions in neural progenitor cells are orchestrated via multiple pathways, and the role of histone acetylation in these decisions has been ascribed to a general function promoting gene activation. Here, we show that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) cofactor transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (Trrap) specifically regulates activation of cell-cycle genes, thereby integrating discrete cell-intrinsic programs of cell-cycle progression and epigenetic regulation of gene transcription in order to control neurogenesis. Deletion of Trrap impairs recruitment of HATs and transcriptional machinery specifically to E2F cell-cycle target genes, disrupting their transcription with consequent cell-cycle lengthening specifically within cortical apical neural progenitors (APs). Consistently, Trrap conditional mutants exhibit microcephaly because of premature differentiation of APs into intermediate basal progenitors and neurons, and overexpressing cell-cycle regulators in vivo can rescue these premature differentiation defects. These results demonstrate an essential and highly specific role for Trrap-mediated histone regulation in controlling cell-cycle progression and neurogenesis."

The UHM-containing alternative splicing factor CAPERα regulates splicing of tumor-promoting VEGF isoforms, yet the molecular target of the CAPERα UHM is unknown. Here we present structures of the CAPERα UHM bound to a representative SF3b155 ULM at 1.7 Å resolution and, for comparison, in the absence of ligand at 2.2 Å resolution. The prototypical UHM/ULM interactions authenticate CAPERα as a bona fide member of the UHM family of proteins. We identify SF3b155 as the relevant ULM-containing partner of full-length CAPERα in human cell extracts. Isothermal titration calorimetry comparisons of the purified CAPERα UHM binding known ULM-containing proteins demonstrate that high affinity interactions depend on the presence of an intact, intrinsically unstructured SF3b155 domain containing seven ULM-like motifs. The interplay among bound CAPERα molecules gives rise to the appearance of two high affinity sites in the SF3b155 ULM-containing domain. In conjunction with the previously identified, UHM/ULM-mediated complexes of U2AF(65) and SPF45 with SF3b155, this work demonstrates the capacity of SF3b155 to offer a platform for coordinated recruitment of UHM-containing splicing factors."
https://openalex.org/W1970165340,"p27(Kip1) (p27), a key regulator of cell division, has been implicated in autophagy of cancer cells. However, its role in autophagy, the evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that enables cells to remove unwanted proteins and damaged organelles, had not been examined in the heart. Here we report that ectopic delivery of a p27 fusion protein (TAT-p27) was sufficient to induce autophagy in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in vitro, under basal conditions and after glucose deprivation. Conversely, lentivirus-delivered shRNA against p27 successfully reduced p27 levels and suppressed basal and glucose-deprived levels of autophagy in cardiomyocytes in vitro. Glucose deprivation mimics myocardial ischemia and induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. During glucose deprivation, TAT-p27 inhibited apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of p27 decreased survival of cardiomyocytes. However, inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological (3-methyladenine, chloroquine, or bafilomycin A1) or genetic approaches (siRNA-mediated knockdown of Atg5) sensitized cardiomyocytes to glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis, even in the presence of TAT-p27. TAT-p27 was also able to provoke greater levels of autophagy in resting and fasting cardiomyocytes in vivo. Further, TAT-p27 enhanced autophagy and repressed cardiomyocytes apoptosis, improved cardiac function, and reduced infarct size following myocardial infarction. Again, these effects were lost when cardiac autophagy in vivo was blocked by chloroquine. Taken together, these data show that p27 positively regulates cardiac autophagy in vitro and in vivo, at rest and after metabolic stress, and that TAT-p27 inhibits apoptosis by promoting autophagy in glucose-deprived cardiomyocytes in vitro and in post-myocardial infarction hearts in vivo."

Data were collected from adolescents, adults, and elderly using a representative, complex, multistage probability-based survey in 2003 and in 2008 in São Paulo, southeast of Brazil.2631 Brazilians were studied in 2003 and 1662 in 2008.Daily mean of red and processed meat consumption was 100 g/day in 2003, and 113 g/day in 2008. Excessive red and processed meat consumption was observed in almost 75% of the subjects, especially among adolescents in both surveys. Beef represented the largest proportion of meat consumed, followed by poultry, pork and fish in both surveys.Daily red and processed meat consumption was higher in 2008 than in 2003, and almost the entire population consumed more than what is recommended by World Cancer Research Fund. Public health strategies are needed, in order to reduce red and processed meat consumption to the recommended amounts, for a healthy diet."
https://openalex.org/W2080889972,"Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of protists that sequester the first six or seven glycolytic steps inside specialized peroxisomes, named glycosomes. Because of the glycosomal membrane impermeability to nucleotides, ATP molecules consumed by the first glycolytic steps need to be regenerated in the glycosomes by kinases, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). The glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which reversibly converts phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate, could also be involved in this process. To address this question, we analyzed the metabolism of the main carbon sources used by the procyclic trypanosomes (glucose, proline, and threonine) after deletion of the PPDK gene in the wild-type (Δppdk) and PEPCK null (Δppdk/Δpepck) backgrounds. The rate of acetate production from glucose is 30% reduced in the Δppdk mutant, whereas threonine-derived acetate production is not affected, showing that PPDK function in the glycolytic direction with production of ATP in the glycosomes. The Δppdk/Δpepck mutant incubated in glucose as the only carbon source showed a 3.8-fold reduction of the glycolytic rate compared with the Δpepck mutant, as a consequence of the imbalanced glycosomal ATP/ADP ratio. The role of PPDK in maintenance of the ATP/ADP balance was confirmed by expressing the glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC) in the Δppdk/Δpepck cell line, which restored the glycolytic flux. We also observed that expression of PGKC is lethal for procyclic trypanosomes, as a consequence of ATP depletion, due to glycosomal relocation of cytosolic ATP production. This illustrates the key roles played by glycosomal and cytosolic kinases, including PPDK, to maintain the cellular ATP/ADP homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2042359703,"Posttetanic potentiation (PTP) is a widely observed form of short-term plasticity lasting for tens of seconds after high-frequency stimulation. Here we show that although protein kinase C (PKC) mediates PTP at the calyx of Held synapse in the auditory brainstem before and after hearing onset, PTP is produced primarily by an increased probability of release (p) before hearing onset, and by an increased readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP) thereafter. We find that these mechanistic differences, which have distinct functional consequences, reflect unexpected differential actions of closely related calcium-dependent PKC isoforms. Prior to hearing onset, when PKCγ and PKCβ are both present, PKCγ mediates PTP by increasing p and partially suppressing PKCβ actions. After hearing onset, PKCγ is absent and PKCβ produces PTP by increasing RRP. In hearing animals, virally expressed PKCγ overrides PKCβ to produce PTP by increasing p. Thus, two similar PKC isoforms mediate PTP in distinctly different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2123467725,"In this study, we aimed to identify molecular mechanisms involved in the specification of the 4d (mesentoblast) lineage in Platynereis dumerilii. We employ RT-PCR and in situ hybridization against the Platynereis dumerilii twist homolog (Pdu-twist) to reveal mesodermal specification within this lineage. We show that Pdu-twist mRNA is already maternally distributed. After fertilization, ooplasmatic segregation leads to relocation of Pdu-twist transcripts into the somatoblast (2d) lineage and 4d, indicating that the maternal component of Pdu-twist might be an important prerequisite for further mesoderm specification but does not represent a defining characteristic of the mesentoblast. However, after the primordial germ cells have separated from the 4d lineage, zygotic transcription of Pdu-twist is exclusively observed in the myogenic progenitors, suggesting that mesodermal specification occurs after the 4d stage. Previous studies on spiral cleaving embryos revealed a spatio-temporal correlation between the 4d lineage and the activity of an embryonic organizer that is capable to induce the developmental fates of certain micromeres. This has raised the question if specification of the 4d lineage could be connected to the organizer activity. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the existence of such a proposed conserved organizer in Platynereis employing antibody staining against dpERK. In contrast to former observations in other spiralian embryos, activation of MAPK signaling during 2d and 4d formation cannot be detected which questions the existence of a conserved connection between organizer function and specification of the 4d lineage. However, our experiments unveil robust MAPK activation in the prospective nephroblasts as well as in the macromeres and some micromeres at the blastopore in gastrulating embryos. Inhibition of MAPK activation leads to larvae with a shortened body axis, defects in trunk muscle spreading and improper nervous system condensation, indicating a critical function for MAPK signaling for the reorganization of embryonic tissues during the gastrulation process."

Circulating TH levels are tightly regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion within the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Although circadian TSH secretion has been well documented, the mechanism of this observation remains unclear. Recently, the nuclear corepressor, NCOR1, has been postulated to regulate TSH expression, presumably by interacting with thyroid hormone receptors (THRs) bound to TSH subunit genes. We report herein the first in vitro study of NCOR1 regulation of TSH in a physiologically relevant cell system, the TαT1.1 mouse thyrotroph cell line. Knockdown of NCOR1 by shRNA adenovirus increased baseline Tshb mRNA levels compared with scrambled control, but surprisingly had no affect on the T3-mediated repression of this gene. Using ChIP, we show that NCOR1 enriches on the Tshb promoter at sites different from THR previously identified by our group. Furthermore, NCOR1 enrichment on Tshb is unaffected by T3 treatment. Given that NCOR1 does not target THR on Tshb, we hypothesized that NCOR1 targeted Rev-Erbα (NR1D1), an orphan nuclear receptor that is a potent repressor of gene transcription and regulator of metabolism and circadian rhythms. Using a serum shock technique, we synchronized TαT1.1 cells to study circadian gene expression. Post-synchronization, Tshb and Nr1d1 mRNA levels displayed oscillations that inversely correlated with each other. Furthermore, NR1D1 was enriched at the same locus as NCOR1 on Tshb.

Circadian rhythms are fundamental phenomena in most living organisms whereby behavior and biological function are regulated through an autonomous clock. Control of this rhythm has been traced to a central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (12Gachon F. Nagoshi E. Brown S.A. Ripperger J. Schibler U.

The circadian cycle is triggered by a CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer that is regulated under a negative feedback loop mediated by the orphan nuclear receptor Rev-Erbα (NR1D1) (16Lande-Diner L. Boyault C.

TSH and T3 secretion are also known to follow a photoperiodic circadian rhythm, with a nadir during the day and a peak secretory activity just before sleep (20Van Reeth O. Sturis J. Byrne M.M.

Interestingly, TSH may induce the expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase in the hypothalamus, which enzymatically converts the prohormone T4 into its bioactive T3 product, providing an additional mechanism for controlling the HPT axis (21Ono H. Hoshino Y. Yasuo S. Watanabe M. Nakane Y. Murai A. Ebihara S. Korf H.W. Yoshimura T. Involvement of thyrotropin in photoperiodic signal transduction in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Given that this diurnal rhythm of TSH is disrupted in states as diverse as depression, poorly controlled diabetes, and mostly importantly, after pharmacologic T4 replacement to hypothyroid patients, further elucidation of this mechanism is warranted (23Fisher D.A. Physiological variations in thyroid hormones: physiological and pathophysiological considerations.Clin.

Despite characterization of TSH diurnal rhythm in physiologic and pathologic states over many years, the upstream regulators are yet to be well characterized. We have established an appropriate and physiologically relevant mouse cell line model to study regulation of Tshb (25Yusta B. Alarid E.T. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. The thyrotropin β-subunit gene is repressed by thyroid hormone in a novel thyrotrope cell line, mouse TαT1 cells.Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4476-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Chiamolera M.I.

Endocrinol. 2012; 26: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using this model, our studies shed light on an unprecedented role of NCOR1 in repression of Tshb that is independent of THR action. We hypothesize that circadian regulation of TSH and T3 secretion is maintained by NCOR1 interaction with NR1D1, not THR, and that circadian changes in T3 levels may have a previously unrecognized role in controlling overall metabolism. TαT1.1 cells were plated in DMEM (Corning Cellgro, Manassas, VA) containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Before the cells were seeded, the plates were coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) to facilitate adhesion. Matrigel was diluted 30-fold with Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen) before coating the plates. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an environment of 5% CO2. Treatment of cells with either T3, TRH, or SR9011 (Sigma) was performed for the indicated durations after 24-h medium replacement with DMEM containing 10% FBS stripped of thyroid hormone by treatment with AG1X-8 resin (Bio-Rad) and charcoal (Sigma). Adenoviruses expressing nonspecific scrambled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or shRNA against Ncor1 mRNA were generated using a BLOCK-iT adenoviral RNAi expression system following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). shNcor1 (3910–3930) targeted the sequence 5′-CATCCAAGGGCCATGTTATC-3′. TαT1.1 cells were transduced 24 h after the cells were seeded with adenoviruses to knock down the gene(s) of interest. The medium was changed the following day, and cells were harvested 72 h after infection. Hormone treatment with T3 was done using stripped serum 8 h before harvesting. The concentration of adenoviruses was determined and all solutions had equivalent titer. Scrambled adenovirus control was used in the same concentration as the virus of interest. Total RNA from TαT1.1 cells was extracted by standard methodology (TRIzol reagent; Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR analyses were performed in a fluorescent temperature cycler using SYBR Green reagent according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Primers for Ncor1, Ncor2, Tshb, Cga, Gh, Nr1d1, and 36B4 are listed in supplemental Table S1. Cycle threshold values for 36B4 were used to normalize each sample. All results are expressed as a fraction of samples treated with vehicle only. TαT1.1 cells were treated with experimental conditions, after which whole cell extracts were prepared in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Extract (20 μg of total protein) was run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membrane was probed using antibodies for the following proteins from the indicated suppliers: NCOR1 (gift from A. Hollenberg, generated against the C-terminal portion of protein), SMRT (Affinity Bio), NR1D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin (Chemicon). ChIP assays were performed on TαT1.1 cells at ∼90% of confluence using ChIP-IT Express kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies against the following proteins were used from the indicated suppliers: rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NCOR1 (Abcam), acetyl-H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), acetyl-H4 (Upstate), and Rev-Erbα (Abcam). Cross-links were reversed, and the DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The DNA recovered from the assay was subjected to qPCR using specific primers designed to detect enrichment in the proximal promoters of Tshb, Cga, and Gh (supplemental Table S2). TαT1.1 cells were seeded overnight in 6-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM for 4 h. Cells were then shocked with DMEM containing 50% horse serum for 2 h, after which medium was replaced with 10% stripped FBS (t = 0 h). Cells were harvested using TRIzol and stored at −80 °C until analyzed for RNA. Values are represented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments, unless otherwise noted. Statistical testing was performed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant, and the respective levels of significance and group sizes are stated in respective figure legends. Studies have shown that T3 regulates thyrotopin subunit gene expression in the TαT1.1 thyrotroph cell line. Whereas T3 reduces Tshb mRNA levels, it has no effect on Cga mRNA levels. Negative regulation of transcription by nuclear receptors is often associated with recruitment of corepressors, and NCOR1 is thought to be the key corepressor that regulates the THR. To test the importance of NCOR1 on gene expression in TαT1.1 cells, we treated cells with adenovirus expressing NCOR1 shRNA (shNcor1). Ncor1 mRNA levels were reduced 45%, whereas Ncor2 mRNA levels that encode a closely related transcription factor, SMRTs (silencing mediator of retinoid or thyroid hormone receptors), were unaffected (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis confirmed depletion of NCOR1 protein in these cells (Fig. 1B). Cga expression in TαT1.1 cells was not regulated by T3, and there was no change after treatment with shNcor1 (Fig. 1C). Throughout this work, we use Cga as a negative control. Gh, a gene up-regulated by T3 binding to THR, is generally repressed by NCOR1 (27Kim S.W. Ahn I.M. Larsen P.R. In vivo genomic footprinting of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in pituitary tumor cell lines.Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4465-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TαT1.1 cells express Gh at low levels such that this gene can be used as a positive control in our experiments. Knockdown of NCOR1 not only raised basal expression but also resulted in a reduction in T3-mediated activation of Gh (Fig. 1D). Although shNcor1 did not affect T3 repression of Tshb mRNA levels, the baseline level (vehicle treatment) did increase significantly compared with treatment with scrambled shRNA (Fig. 1E). Given that knockdown of NCOR1 affects basal expression of Tshb, we next explored whether the T3 response is altered by determining a T3 concentration response after SC and shNcor1 treatment (Fig. 1F). Tshb mRNA levels were maximally repressed at 10 nm T3 after either SC treatment (71%) or shNcor1 treatment (66%). When the T3-treated Tshb mRNA levels for the shNcor1-treated cells were compared with shNcor1 vehicle, instead of scrambled shRNA vehicle, the dose response curves overlapped. The calculated EC50 for both treatments was 0.3 nm, indicating that NCOR1 does not mediate T3 regulation of Tshb. Based on this novel finding that NCOR1 affects baseline Tshb mRNA expression, but not T3-mediated levels, we next determined whether NCOR1 interacts directly with Tshb. We performed ChIP-qPCR, scanning for NCOR1 enrichment around the transcription start site of Tshb (Fig. 2). Our laboratory has previously published that THRs enrich at sites −1861 and +18 bp relative to the transcription start site, regions containing several TRE half-sites (26Chiamolera M.I. Sidhaye A.R. Matsumoto S. He Q. Hashimoto K. Ortiga-Carvalho T.M. Wondisford F.E.

Endocrinol. 2012; 26: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NCOR1, however, was found to be enriched at a different site, −2959 bp, and its occupancy was unaffected by T3 treatment (Fig. 2). On the Gh gene, THR is bound to a −220 bp site (28Flug F. Copp R.P. Casanova J. Horowitz Z.D. Janocko L. Plotnick M. Samuels H.H. Cis-acting elements of the rat growth hormone gene which mediate basal and regulated expression by thyroid hormone.J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9441-9446Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NCOR1 was enriched in this region and released upon T3 treatment, consistent with reports on Gh regulation (Fig. 2). We expected this response on Gh because NCOR1 recruitment is reported to be mediated through binding to THR-β (THRB). The contrasting action on Tshb lead us to hypothesize that NCOR1 may be bound by a different transcription factor than THRB. Activation of gene expression is associated with histone acetylation, whereas repression is usually associated with deacetylation. Following this dogma, we assessed the enrichment of acetylated histones on the Tshb promoter. In Fig. 3A, a ChIP assay shows no significant changes in histone H3 acetylation on Tshb or Cga after treatment with 10 nm T3. TRH is known to stimulate Tshb expression, and this response was confirmed by increased acetyl-H3 after hormone treatment at sites centered on −684 and +18 bp (Fig. 3B). The latter region corresponds to a region also enriched with THRB (26Chiamolera M.I. Sidhaye A.R. Matsumoto S. He Q. Hashimoto K. Ortiga-Carvalho T.M. Wondisford F.E. Fundamentally distinct roles of thyroid hormone receptor isoforms in a thyrotroph cell line are due to differential DNA binding.Mol.

These findings indicate that the assembly of transcription factors that regulate Tshb is likely to contain both a T3-independent mechanism that uniquely involves NCOR1 and a TRH-dependent mechanism that is associated with histone acetylation. The interplay of these pathways was evidenced after knocking down NCOR1. Treating cells with shNcor1 resulted in a marked increase in acetyl-H3 at the +18 bp site (Fig. 3E). This study was performed without hormone treatment and could possibly be the explanation for the increase in baseline Tshb mRNA levels after shNcor1 transduction. For example, if more H3 is acetylated on Tshb, one would expect an increase in basal expression. To define further the hormone-independent mechanism of Tshb expression, we studied gene expression over time in TαT1.1 cells. Although the cyclic secretion of TSH expression may be critical to cellular homeostasis, little is known about the overall impact of this physiologic event or the mechanism mediating the rhythm. By synchronizing TαT1.1 cells in culture, we were able to mimic Tshb mRNA cycling in this pituitary cell line. According to established protocols to study circadian regulation, we synchronized TαT1.1 cells by incubating them in serum-free medium, followed by a brief period of serum shock in 50% horse serum, and then harvesting mRNA at various time points for a qPCR analysis (Fig. 4). In this model, Tshb mRNA levels cycled with a 36-hour period, with peaks at 18 and 54 h, and nadirs at 0 and 36 h. Because expression amplitude dampened with each successive cycle, Tshb mRNA levels were difficult to measure beyond 72 h. NR1D1, a heme receptor transcribed on the antisense strand of Thra, is a potent repressor of gene transcription and a key driver of circadian rhythms and metabolism. NR1D1 has also been associated with NCOR1-dependent repression of nuclear receptors, and direct binding between the two proteins has been established (11You S.H. Liao X. Weiss R.E. Lazar M.A. The interaction between nuclear receptor corepressor and histone deacetylase 3 regulates both positive and negative thyroid hormone action in vivo.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate Nr1d1 expression in our synchronized TαT1.1 cells and also observed a significant oscillation in expression (Fig. 4). Initial Nr1d1 mRNA levels decreased before rising at 12 h, with peaks at 36 and 72h, and a nadir at 54 h. NR1D1 protein levels followed a similar pattern (data not shown). When comparing these mRNA levels, Tshb levels began to decline after the 18-h peak, whereas the Nr1d1 levels increased. From 30 to 54 h, Nr1d1 levels declined, and Tshb mRNA levels increased. The second decline in Tshb mRNA levels (54 to 72 h) was again marked with an increase in Nr1d1. The two mRNA oscillations appeared to oppose each other, suggesting that this hormone-independent circadian rhythm of Tshb may be controlled by Nr1d1. NR1D1 is an orphan nuclear receptor with a unique structure, in that it lacks the helix 12 motif that is typically required for coactivators to bind the receptor (30Zamir I. Dawson J. Lavinsky R.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Cloning and characterization of a corepressor and potential component of the nuclear hormone receptor repression complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previously described as a DNA-binding protein that interacts with NCOR1, we hypothesize that NR1D1 regulates Tshb basal rhythm via recruitment of NCOR1. To study the interaction of these two proteins on DNA, we performed ChIP assays, scanning for NR1D1 and NCOR1 enrichment on the Tshb promoter (Fig. 5). When Nr1d1 expression is low at 4 h, it enriches at −2959 bp, but after 8 h, when NR1D1 levels are rising, additional enrichment at −2959 bp and a new enrichment at −2362 bp are noted (Fig. 5A). NCOR1 recruitment to the Tshb promoter showed a similar pattern (Fig. 5B). Previously, we only observed NCOR1 enrichment at the −2959 site, but 8 h post-synchronization, NCOR1 is additionally recruited to this new −2362-bp region. Our data show that NCOR1 binds directly to the proximal promoter of Tshb and represses its basal mRNA expression independent of thyroid hormone regulation. NR1D1 also influences basal regulation of Tshb mRNA levels, likely through its recruitment of NCOR1 to the promoter. To confirm that NCOR1-based repression of Tshb is dependent on NR1D1, an NR1D1 agonist was employed (SR9011). SR9011 is a potent agonist of NR1D1 and demonstrates minimal cross-reactivity with other nuclear receptors (31Solt L.A. Wang Y. Banerjee S. Hughes T. Kojetin D.J. Lundasen T. Shin Y. Liu J. Cameron M.D. Noel R. Yoo S.H. Takahashi J.S. Butler A.A. Kamenecka T.M. Burris T.P. Regulation of circadian behaviour and metabolism by synthetic REV-ERB agonists.Nature. 2012; 485: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). TαT1.1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of SR9011 (or vehicle) for 8 h, and mRNA was harvested for qPCR studies. SR9011 induced a concentration-dependent decrease in Tshb mRNA levels (Fig. 6, A and B). One nm T3 and 5 μm SR9011 treatments resulted in maximal inhibition of mRNA expression of 65 and 80%, respectively. High concentrations of either ligand had no significant effect on Cga mRNA levels in this cell line (data not shown). ChIP assays showed that addition of 5 μm SR9011 to TαT1.1 cells also promoted NCOR1 recruitment to the −2362-bp region of Tshb in addition to the −2959-bp site (Fig. 6C). In summary, these data confirm our hypothesis that NCOR1 is recruited to NR1D1, triggering repression of Tshb gene expression (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Proposed model for NCOR1 regulation of gene expression. A, on a THR-mediated gene such as Gh, NCOR1 binds THR in the absence of T3 and represses transcriptional activity. Binding of T3 induces a conformation change of the receptor that releases NCOR1 and recruits coactivators to activate transcription. B, on Tshb, NR1D1 cycles on and off a primary site (−2959) and an inducible site (−2362) depending on protein levels. THR enriches at different downstream sites (−1861 and +18) mediate T3-dependent repression. The nature of the THR complex on Tshb has not been fully characterized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For decades, researchers have studied the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of metabolism. On positively regulated genes, T3 binds to THR, inducing a conformational change that favors coactivator over corepressor binding. The regulation of genes repressed by thyroid hormone, however, is not a simple reversal of this process. Thyroid hormone repression is critical for regulation of the HPT axis and hence thyroid hormone synthesis. TSH is central to regulation of the HPT axis, and both subunit genes that comprise TSH are down-regulated by T3 in vivo (29Machado D.S. Sabet A. Santiago L.A. Sidhaye A.R. Chiamolera M.I. Ortiga-Carvalho T.M. Wondisford F.E. A thyroid hormone receptor mutation that dissociates thyroid hormone regulation of gene expression in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9441-9446Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Abel E.D. Boers M.E. Pazos-Moura C. Moura E. Kaulbach H. Zakaria M. Lowell B. Radovick S. Liberman M.C. Wondisford F. Divergent roles for thyroid hormone receptor β isoforms in the endocrine axis and auditory system.J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that T3-bound THRB represses Tshb subunit gene expression by recruiting cofactors to the ligand-binding domain (33Ortiga-Carvalho T.M. Shibusawa N. Nikrodhanond A. Oliveira K.J. Machado D.S. Liao X.H. Cohen R.N. Refetoff S. Wondisford F.E. Negative regulation by thyroid hormone receptor requires an intact coactivator-binding surface.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2517-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our current findings show that there are two pathways for Tshb repression: one that involves T3 and THR and one that involves NCOR1 independent of T3. The latter pathway interested us in that it suggested a relationship between NCOR1 and NR1D1 on Tshb that has not been described previously. Our first objective in establishing the role of NCOR1 on T3-responsive genes was to knock it down using an shRNA adenoviral construct. Knockdown of NCOR1 on the thyroid hormone positively regulated Gh gene demonstrated that NCOR1 was dismissed from the proximal Gh promoter as suggested previously. In the absence of T3, cells treated with shNcor1 displayed elevated basal Gh mRNA expression and eliminated any further increase after T3 treatment. On the negatively regulated Tshb, however, this increase in basal expression did not hinder T3 repression. In fact, comparing an extensive T3 concentration response between scrambled and shNcor1 treatments revealed absolutely no change in the relative T3 inhibition of Tshb mRNA levels. In this regard, our findings are in agreement with in vivo models of NCOR1 action. Although global deletion of NCOR1 is embryonic lethal, mutating the inhibitory domains of NCOR1 revealed a hypersensitivity to TH in peripheral tissues that was not seen in the HPT axis (10Astapova I. Vella K.R. Ramadoss P. Holtz K.A. Rodwin B.A. Liao X.H. Weiss R.E. Rosenberg M.A. Rosenzweig A. Hollenberg A.N.

The thyroid axis is regulated by NCoR1 via its actions in the pituitary.Endocrinology. 2012; 153: 5049-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This is likely due to changes in basal gene expression that we also find in the current investigation using a thyrotroph cell line. Because of its critical role in controlling T3-mediated development, metabolism, and other vital processes in the body, TSH secretion requires a highly conserved and tightly regulated system of control. The T3 negative feedback response seems to be protected at the level of the pituitary and is not affected by NCOR1. A T3-independent NCOR1 pathway was further confirmed when ChIP assays showed enrichment of NCOR1 binding to the Tshb promoter sites, which are >1000 bp upstream of reported THR binding sites (26Chiamolera M.I. Sidhaye A.R. Matsumoto S. He Q. Hashimoto K. Ortiga-Carvalho T.M. Wondisford F.E. Fundamentally distinct roles of thyroid hormone receptor isoforms in a thyrotroph cell line are due to differential DNA binding.Mol. Endocrinol. 2012; 26: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NCOR1 was neither released nor further enriched at these sites after treatment with T3. Because acute repression of TSH by T3 was unaffected by NCOR1 depletion, we next evaluated whether baseline Tshb mRNA expression was affected by NCOR1 depletion. A well known characteristic of TSH and T3 secretion are their circadian secretory patterns. Metabolic processes can be affected by oscillations in hormone levels, light/dark periodicity, and feeding and are perpetuated by a core clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. BMAL1-CLOCK, the heterodimeric transcriptional controller of this central clock, is a direct target of NR1D1, and together, are required for the onset and continuation of each period in the cycle (16Lande-Diner L. Boyault C. Kim J.Y. Weitz C.J. A positive feedback loop links circadian clock factor CLOCK-BMAL1 to the basic transcriptional machinery.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lazar M.A. A circadian rhythm orchestrated by histone deacetylase 3 controls hepatic lipid metabolism.Science. 2011; 331: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We explored the involvement of NR1D1 in our model because of its known role in circadian rhythm generation, as well as its direct interaction with NCOR1. When the TαT1.1 thyrotroph cell line was synchronized, we were able to mimic a circadian cycle of Tshb mRNA levels in these cells. The mRNA expression of Tshb and Nr1d1 displayed opposing cycles, with peaks for one matching the nadir for the other, and vice versa. If NR1D1 were truly a mediator of NCOR1-driven Tshb repression, we would need to demonstrate its direct binding to Tshb, as well as interaction with NCOR1. NR1D1 did show enrichment to Tshb at the same locus as NCOR1. In addition, at a time when NR1D1 protein expression was increasing, it was enriched at a second site not described previously. Using the NR1D1 agonist SR9011, we showed that activation of NR1D1 was sufficient to elicit NCOR1 binding at the two sites we identified and lead to a reduction in Tshb mRNA levels. Acute control of TSH secretion is tightly regulated through thyroid hormone negative feedback. We believe that basal regulation of Tshb is regulated by NR1D1, which recruits NCOR1 and leads to transcriptional repression. Recent studies have revealed a dynamic balance and highly protected role of NR1D1 in circadian and metabolic regulation (17Cho H. Zhao X. Hatori M. Yu R.T. Barish G.D. Lam M.T. Chong L.W. DiTacchio L. Atkins A.R. Glass C.K. Liddle C. Auwerx J. Downes M. Panda S. Evans R.M. Regulation of circadian behaviour and metabolism by REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β.Nature. 2012; 485: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Conserving its activity on multiple levels demonstrates its vital importance and necessity in not just maintaining, but also driving, the core clock. Given that NR1D1 also drives circadian regulation of Tshb expression by binding to the promoter and recruiting NCOR1, it may provide a previously unknown way for metabolism to be regulated in a circadian rhythm by T3.

With Gram-negative bacteria, the translocation of acetyl groups from the cytoplasm is performed by an integral membrane protein, PatA, for its transfer to peptidoglycan by O-acetyltransferase PatB, whereas a single bimodal membrane protein, OatA, appears to catalyze both reactions of the process in Gram-positive bacteria. Only phenotypic evidence existed in support of these pathways because no in vitro biochemical assay was available for their analysis, which reflected the complexities of investigating integral membrane proteins that act on a totally insoluble and heterogeneous substrate, such as peptidoglycan. In this study, we present the first biochemical and kinetic analysis of a peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase using PatB from N. gonorrhoeae as the model system. The enzyme has specificity for muropeptides that possess tri- and tetrapeptide stems on muramyl residues. With chitooligosaccharides as substrates, rates of reaction increase with increasing degrees of polymerization to 5/6. This information will be valuable for the identification and development of peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase inhibitors that could represent potential leads to novel classes of antibiotics."

This work presents a highly reliable computational technique for predicting DNA-binding function at the level of protein-DNA complex structures, rather than low-resolution two-state prediction of DNA-binding as most existing techniques do. The method first predicts protein-DNA complex structure by utilizing the template-based structure prediction technique HHblits, followed by binding affinity prediction based on a knowledge-based energy function (Distance-scaled finite ideal-gas reference state for protein-DNA interactions). A leave-one-out cross validation of the method based on 179 DNA-binding and 3797 non-binding protein domains achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.77 with high precision (94%) and high sensitivity (65%). We further found 51% sensitivity for 82 newly determined structures of DNA-binding proteins and 56% sensitivity for the human proteome. In addition, the method provides a reasonably accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues in proteins based on predicted DNA-binding complex structures. Its application to human proteome leads to more than 300 novel DNA-binding proteins; some of these predicted structures were validated by known structures of homologous proteins in APO forms.

However, the physiological role of α1-AR signaling in bone metabolism is largely unknown. In this study, the stimulation of phenylephrine (PHE), a nonspecific α1-AR agonist, increased the transcriptional factor Nfil3/E4BP4 and led to the rhythmic expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. We also showed that Bmp4 mRNA expression peaked in bone near zeitgeber time 8 in a 24-h rhythm. Furthermore, the expression of Nfil3 and Bmp4 displayed a circadian pattern with opposing phases, which suggested that Nfil3 repressed the expression of the Bmp4 gene during a circadian cycle. On a molecular level, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that Nfil3/E4BP4 negatively regulated Bmp4 expression in osteoblasts. Furthermore, the systemic administration of PHE increased the expression of Nfil3 mRNA in bone, whereas it decreased that of Bmp4 mRNA. The expression of Bmp4 mRNA was decreased significantly by exposure to PHE, and this was concomitant with the increase in Nfil3 binding to the D-box-containing Bmp4 promoter region in MC3T3-E1 cells, which indicates that the expression of Nfil3 by α1-AR signaling can bind directly to the Bmp4 promoter and inhibit Bmp4 expression in osteoblasts. Our results suggest that α1-AR signaling regulates clock genes and Bmp4 expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, α1-AR signaling negatively regulated Bmp4 expression by up-regulating the transcriptional factor Nfil3/E4BP4 in osteoblasts."

Each of the three NSAIDs was applied topically to rabbits, and after 0.5 to 8 hrs, the concentration of each drug in the aqueous humor and the retinochoroidal tissues was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The pharmacokinetics of the drugs in the tissues after repeated doses as is done on patients was calculated by a simulation software. The inhibitory effect of each NSAID on the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier was assessed by the vitreous protein concentration on concanavalin A-induced retinochoroidal inflammation in rabbits.The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of diclofenac, bromfenac, and amfenac was 55.5, 5.56, and 15.3 nM for human COX-1, and 30.7, 7.45, and 20.4 nM for human COX-2, respectively. The three NSAIDs were detected in the aqueous humor and the retinochoroidal tissue at all-time points. Simulated pharmacokinetics showed that the levels of the three NSAIDs were continuously higher than the IC50 of COX-2, as an index of efficacy, in the aqueous humor, whereas only the bromfenac concentration was continuously higher than the IC50 at its trough level in the retinochoroidal tissues. The intravitreous concentration of proteins was significantly reduced in rabbits that received topical bromfenac (P = 0.026) but not the other two NSAIDs.Topical bromfenac can penetrate into the retinochoroidal tissues in high enough concentrations to inhibit COX-2 and exerts its inhibitory effect on the blood-retinal barrier breakdown in an experimental retinochoroidal inflammation in rabbits. Topical bromfenac may have a better therapeutic benefit than diclofenac and nepafenac for retinochoroidal inflammatory diseases."

Although a series of antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of infection and suppression of dissemination, HSV-1 remains highly prevalent worldwide. Therefore, the development of novel antiviral agents with different mechanisms of action is a matter of extreme urgency. During the proliferation of HSV-1, capsid assembly is essential for viral growth, and it is highly conserved in all HSV-1 strains. In this study, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against the HSV-1 capsid protein were screened to explore the influence of silencing capsid expression on the replication of HSV-1. We designed and chemically synthesized siRNAs for the capsid gene and assessed their inhibitory effects on the expression of target mRNA and the total intracellular viral genome loads by quantitative real-time PCR, as well as on the replication of HSV-1 via plaque reduction assays and electron microscopy. Our results showed that siRNA was an effective approach to inhibit the expression of capsid protein encoding genes including UL18, UL19, UL26, UL26.5, UL35 and UL38 in vitro. Interference of capsid proteins VP23 (UL18) and VP5 (UL19) individually or jointly greatly affected the replication of clinically isolated acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 as well as HSV-1/F and HSV-2/333. Plaque numbers and intracellular virions were significantly reduced by simultaneous knockdown of UL18 and UL19. The total intracellular viral genome loads were also significantly decreased in the UL18 and UL19 knockdown groups compared with the viral control. In conclusion, interfering with UL18 and UL19 gene expression could inhibit HSV-1 replication efficiently in vitro.

Here we demonstrate the small GTPase Cdc42 is misregulated in the absence of CLN3, and thus may be a common link to multiple cellular defects. We discover that active Cdc42 (Cdc42-GTP) is elevated in endothelial cells from CLN3 deficient mouse brain, and correlates with enhanced PAK-1 phosphorylation, LIMK membrane recruitment, and altered actin-driven events. We also demonstrate dramatically reduced plasma membrane recruitment of the Cdc42 GTPase activating protein, ARHGAP21. In line with this, GTP-loaded ARF1, an effector of ARHGAP21 recruitment, is depressed. Together these data implicate misregulated ARF1-Cdc42 signaling as a central defect in JNCL cells, which in-turn impairs various cell functions.

https://openalex.org/W1968029848,"Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) is a potent membrane-damaging cytolytic toxin that belongs to the family of β barrel pore-forming protein toxins. VCC induces lysis of its target eukaryotic cells by forming transmembrane oligomeric β barrel pores. The mechanism of membrane pore formation by VCC follows the overall scheme of the archetypical β barrel pore-forming protein toxin mode of action, in which the water-soluble monomeric form of the toxin first binds to the target cell membrane, then assembles into a prepore oligomeric intermediate, and finally converts into the functional transmembrane oligomeric β barrel pore. However, there exists a vast knowledge gap in our understanding regarding the intricate details of the membrane pore formation process employed by VCC. In particular, the membrane oligomerization and membrane insertion steps of the process have only been described to a limited extent. In this study, we determined the key residues in VCC that are critical to trigger membrane oligomerization of the toxin. Alteration of such key residues traps the toxin in its membrane-bound monomeric state and abrogates subsequent oligomerization, membrane insertion, and functional transmembrane pore-formation events. The results obtained from our study also suggest that the membrane insertion of VCC depends critically on the oligomerization process and that it cannot be initiated in the membrane-bound monomeric form of the toxin. In sum, our study, for the first time, dissects membrane binding from the subsequent oligomerization and membrane insertion steps and, thus, defines the exact sequence of events in the membrane pore formation process by VCC."

Effective interventions to reduce workplace discrimination are therefore needed to protect these vulnerable populations. The current study investigated potential associations between sociodemographic factors and prejudice toward HIV and HBV/HCV infected colleagues within a Japanese working population. Methods An online anonymous, nationwide internet survey was administered to a cross-section of approximately 3,000 individuals in Japan. The survey comprised 14 questions focusing on demographics (five items), basic HIV or HBV/HCV knowledge (eight items), and potential prejudice toward HIV or HBV/HCV infected colleagues (one item). The sociodemographic characteristics evaluated were sex, age, educational level, employment status, and individual income; with multiple logistic regression used for the analysis. Results In total, 3,055 individuals were recruited for the HIV related survey and 3,129 for the HBV/HCV related survey. Older age was significantly and positively associated with prejudice toward HIV infected colleagues (p<0.01) and negatively associated with prejudice toward HBV/HCV infected colleagues (p<0.01). Statistically significant associations were not observed between other sociodemographic characteristics and potential prejudice toward HIV and HBV/HCV infected coworkers. Conclusion Overall, this study suggests that age may be associated with prejudice toward HIV and HBV/HCV infected colleagues among the working age population of Japan. As such, policy makers should consider the age of participants when formulating efforts to reduce prejudice toward HIV and HBV/HCV infected workers."

Here, we generated a transgenic zebrafish line expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under the control of the hair-cell specific myo6b promoter, in order to examine the role of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel in sensory encoding in afferent neurons. We performed in vivo recordings from afferent neurons of the zebrafish lateral line while activating hair cells with either mechanical stimuli from a waterjet or optical stimuli from flashes of ∼470-nm light. Comparison of the patterns of encoded spikes during 100-ms stimuli revealed no difference in mean first spike latency between the two modes of activation. However, there was a significant increase in the variability of first spike latency during optical stimulation as well as an increase in the mean number of spikes per stimulus. Next, we compared encoding of spikes during hair-cell stimulation at 10, 20, and 40-Hz. Consistent with the increased variability of first spike latency, we saw a significant decrease in the vector strength of phase-locked spiking during optical stimulation. These in vivo results support a physiological role for the MET channel in the high fidelity of first spike latency seen during encoding of mechanical sensory stimuli. Finally, we examined whether remote activation of hair cells via ChR2 activation was sufficient to elicit escape responses in free-swimming larvae. In transgenic larvae, 100-ms flashes of ∼470-nm light resulted in escape responses that occurred concomitantly with field recordings indicating Mauthner cell activity. Altogether, the myo6b:ChR2 transgenic line provides a platform to investigate hair-cell function and sensory encoding, hair-cell sensory input to the Mauthner cell, and the ability to remotely evoke behavior in free-swimming zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W1984969864,"In multiple myeloma (MM), the malignant plasma cells usually localize to the bone marrow where they develop drug resistance due to adhesion to stromal cells and various environmental signals. Hence, modulation of this interaction is expected to influence drug sensitivity of MM cells. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands have displayed heterogeneous effects on B-cell malignancies and also on MM cells in a few recent studies, but effects on adhesion and drug sensitivity of myeloma cells in the context of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have never been investigated. In the present study, we explored the modulatory effects of TLR1/2 ligand (Pam3CSK4) on adhesion of human myeloma cells to BMSCs. It is shown that TLR1/2 triggering has opposite effects in different HMCLs on their adhesion to BMSCs. Fravel, L363, UM-6, UM-9 and U266 showed increased adhesion to BMSC in parallel with an increased surface expression of integrin molecules α4 and αVβ3. OPM-1, OPM-2 and NCI-H929 showed a dose-dependent decrease in adhesion upon TLR activation following a downregulation of β7 integrin expression. Importantly, TLR1/2 triggering increased cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of bortezomib in myeloma cells independent of the effect on stromal cell adhesion. Moreover, the apoptosis-enhancing effect of Pam3CSK4 paralleled induction of cleaved caspase-3 protein in FACS analysis suggesting a caspase-dependent mechanism. Our findings uncover a novel role of TLR activation in MM cells in the context of bone marrow microenvironment. Stimulation of TLR1/2 bypasses the protective shield of BMSCs and may be an interesting strategy to enhance drug sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003416002,"A recent genome wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated that more than 100 genetic variants influence the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated what proportion of the general population can be considered at high genetic risk of MS, whether genetic information can be used to predict disease development and how the recently found genetic associations have influenced these estimates. We used summary statistics from GWAS in MS to estimate the distribution of risk within a large simulated general population. We profiled MS associated loci in 70 MS patients and 79 healthy controls (HC) and assessed their position within the distribution of risk in the simulated population. The predictive performance of a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) on disease status was investigated using receiver operating characteristic statistics. When all known variants were considered, 40.8% of the general population was predicted to be at reduced risk, 49% at average, 6.9% at elevated and 3.3% at high risk of MS. Fifty percent of MS patients were at either reduced or average risk of disease. However, they showed a significantly higher wGRS than HC (median 13.47 vs 12.46, p = 4.08×10(-10)). The predictive performance of the model including all currently known MS associations (area under the curve = 79.7%, 95%CI = 72.4%-87.0%) was higher than that of models considering previously known associations. Despite this, considering the relatively low prevalence of MS, the positive predictive value was below 1%. The increasing number of known associated genetic variants is improving our ability to predict the development of MS. This is still unlikely to be clinically useful but a more complete understanding of the complexity underlying MS aetiology and the inclusion of environmental risk factors will aid future attempts of disease prediction."
https://openalex.org/W1980159662,"The focal cone electroretinogram is a sensitive marker for macular disease, but have we unlocked its full potential? Typically assessment of waveform parameters is subjective and focuses on a small number of locations (e.g. the a-wave). This study evaluated the discriminatory and diagnostic potential of 4 conventional and 15 novel, objectively determined, parameters in patients with early Age-related Macular Degeneration. Focal cone electroretinograms were recorded in 54 participants with early Age-related Macular Degeneration (72.9±8.2 years) and 54 healthy controls (69±7.7 years). Conventional a and b wave amplitudes and implicit times were measured and compared to novel parameters derived from both the 1st and 2nd derivatives and the frequency-domain power spectrum of the electroretinogram.Statistically significant differences between groups were shown for all conventional parameters, the majority of 1st and 2nd derivative parameters and the power spectrum at 25 and 30 Hz. Receiver operating characteristics showed that both conventional and 1st and 2nd derivative implicit times had provided the best diagnostic potential. A regression model showed a small improvement over any individual parameter investigated. The non-conventional parameters enhanced the objective evaluation of the focal electroretinogram, especially when the amplitude was low. Furthermore, the novel parameters described here allow the implicit time of the electroretinogram to be probed at points other than the peaks of the a and b waves. Consequently these novel analysis techniques could prove valuable in future electrophysiological investigation, detection and monitoring of Age-related Macular Degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2020708761,"Although constitutive activation of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) leads to different cancers, the mechanism of trans-molecular regulation of Jak3 activation is not known. Previously we reported that Jak3 interactions with adapter protein p52ShcA (Shc) facilitate mucosal homeostasis. In this study, we characterize the structural determinants that regulate the interactions between Jak3 and Shc and demonstrate the trans-molecular mechanism of regulation of Jak3 activation by Shc. We show that Jak3 autophosphorylation was the rate-limiting step during Jak3 trans-phosphorylation of Shc where Jak3 directly phosphorylated two tyrosine residues in Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and one tyrosine residue each in calponin homology 1 (CH1) domain and phosphotyrosine interaction domain (PID) of Shc. Direct interactions between mutants of Jak3 and Shc showed that although FERM domain of Jak3 was sufficient for binding to Shc, CH1 and PID domains of Shc were responsible for binding to Jak3. Functionally Jak3 was autophosphorylated under IL-2 stimulation in epithelial cells. However, Shc recruited tyrosine phosphatases SHP2 and PTP1B to Jak3 and thereby dephosphorylated Jak3. Thus we not only characterize Jak3 interaction with Shc, but also demonstrate the molecular mechanism of intracellular regulation of Jak3 activation where Jak3 interactions with Shc acted as regulators of Jak3 dephosphorylation through direct interactions of Shc with both Jak3 and tyrosine phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W2081416758,"Human cooperation and altruism towards non-kin is a major evolutionary puzzle, as is ‘strong reciprocity’ where no present or future rewards accrue to the co-operator/altruist. Here, we test the hypothesis that the development of extra-somatic weapons could have influenced the evolution of human cooperative behaviour, thus providing a new explanation for these two puzzles. Widespread weapons use could have made disputes within hominin groups far more lethal and also equalized power between individuals. In such a cultural niche non-cooperators might well have become involved in such lethal disputes at a higher frequency than cooperators, thereby increasing the relative fitness of genes associated with cooperative behaviour. We employ two versions of the evolutionary Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) model – one where weapons use is simulated and one where it is not. We then measured the performance of 25 IPD strategies to evaluate the effects of weapons use on them. We found that cooperative strategies performed significantly better, and non-cooperative strategies significantly worse, under simulated weapons use. Importantly, the performance of an ‘Always Cooperate’ IPD strategy, equivalent to that of ‘strong reciprocity’, improved significantly more than that of all other cooperative strategies. We conclude that the development of extra-somatic weapons throws new light on the evolution of human altruistic and cooperative behaviour, and particularly ‘strong reciprocity’. The notion that distinctively human altruism and cooperation could have been an adaptive trait in a past environment that is no longer evident in the modern world provides a novel addition to theory that seeks to account for this major evolutionary puzzle."
https://openalex.org/W2046543002,"The etiology of post-inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) motility dysfunction, after resolution of acute symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and intestinal infection, is largely unknown, however, a possible involvement of T cells is suggested.Using the mouse model of T cell activation-induced enteritis, we investigated whether enhancement of smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction by interleukin (IL)-17A is involved in postinflammatory GI hypermotility.Activation of CD3 induces temporal enteritis with GI hypomotility in the midst of, and hypermotility after resolution of, intestinal inflammation. Prolonged upregulation of IL-17A was prominent and IL-17A injection directly enhanced GI transit and contractility of intestinal strips. Postinflammatory hypermotility was not observed in IL-17A-deficient mice. Incubation of a muscle strip and SMCs with IL-17A in vitro resulted in enhanced contractility with increased phosphorylation of Ser19 in myosin light chain 2 (p-MLC), a surrogate marker as well as a critical mechanistic factor of SMC contractility. Using primary cultured murine and human intestinal SMCs, IκBζ- and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK)-mediated downregulation of the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), which suppresses muscarinic signaling of contraction by promoting inactivation/desensitization of Gαq/11 protein, has been suggested to be involved in IL-17A-induced hypercontractility. The opposite effect of L-1β was mediated by IκBζ and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation.We propose and discuss the possible involvement of IL-17A and its downstream signaling cascade in SMCs in diarrheal hypermotility in various GI disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1990105086,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can be activated by the tyrosine kinase domain of the chimeric protein nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM/ALK), and has a pivotal role in mediating NPM/ALK-related malignant cell transformation. Although the role of STAT3 and wild-type NPM in oncogenesis has been extensively investigated, the relationship between both molecules in cancer remains poorly understood. In the present study, we first demonstrate that STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the expression level of NPM. Nuclear co-translocation of phosphorylated STAT3 with NPM can be triggered by interferon-alpha (IFN-α) stimulation of Jurkat cells and phosphorylated STAT3 co-localizes with NPM in cancer cells showing constitutive STAT3 activation. We further demonstrate that STAT3 phosphorylation can transcriptionally mediate NPM upregulation in IFN-α-stimulated Jurkat cells and is responsible for maintaining its expression in cancer cells showing constitutive STAT3 activation. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation or knockdown of NPM expression abrogates their simultaneous transnuclear movements. Finally, we found evidence for a physical interaction between NPM and STAT3 in conditions of STAT3 activation. In conclusion, NPM is a downstream effector of the STAT3 signaling, and can facilitate the nuclear entry of phosphorylated STAT3. These observations might open novel opportunities for targeting the STAT3 pathway in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2053048008,"Alphaherpesviruses, which have co-evolved with their hosts for more than 200 million years, evade and subvert host immune responses, in part, by expression of immuno-modulatory molecules. Alphaherpesviruses express a single, broadly conserved chemokine decoy receptor, glycoprotein G (gG), which can bind multiple chemokine classes from multiple species, including human and mouse. Previously, we demonstrated that infection of chickens with an infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) mutant deficient in gG resulted in altered host immune responses compared to infection with wild-type virus. The ability of gG to disrupt the chemokine network has the potential to be used therapeutically. Here we investigated whether gG from ILTV or equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) could modulate the protective immune response induced by the Helicobacter pylori vaccine antigen, catalase (KatA). Subcutaneous immunisation of mice with KatA together with EHV-1 gG, but not ILTV gG, induced significantly higher anti-KatA IgG than KatA alone. Importantly, subcutaneous or intranasal immunisation with KatA and EHV-1 gG both resulted in significantly lower colonization levels of H. pylori colonization following challenge, compared to mice vaccinated with KatA alone. Indeed, the lowest colonization levels were observed in mice vaccinated with KatA and EHV-1 gG, subcutaneously. In contrast, formulations containing ILTV gG did not affect H. pylori colonisation levels. The difference in efficacy between EHV-1 gG and ILTV gG may reflect the different spectrum of chemokines bound by the two proteins. Together, these data indicate that the immuno-modulatory properties of viral gGs could be harnessed for improving immune responses to vaccine antigens. Future studies should focus on the mechanism of action and whether gG may have other therapeutic applications."
