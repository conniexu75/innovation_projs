https://openalex.org/W2989744940,"Growth factors in serum-free conditioned media from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-CM) are known to be effective in bone regeneration. However, the secretomes in MSC-CM that act as active ingredients for bone regeneration, as well as their mechanisms, remains unclear. Exosomes, components of MSC-CM, provide the recipient cells with genetic information and enhance the recipient cellular paracrine stimulation, which contributes to tissue regeneration. We hypothesized that MSC-CM-derived exosomes (MSC-Exo) promoted bone regeneration, and that angiogenesis was a key step. Here, we prepared an MSC-Exo group, MSC-CM group, and Exo-antiVEGF group (MSC-Exo with angiogenesis inhibitor), and examined the osteogenic and angiogenic potential in MSCs. Furthermore, we used a rat model of calvaria bone defect and implanted each sample to evaluate bone formation weekly, until week 4 after treatment. Results showed that MSC-Exo enhanced cellular migration and osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression in MSCs compared to that in other groups. In vivo, early bone formation by MSC-Exo was also confirmed. Two weeks after implantation, the newly formed bone area was 31.5 ± 6.5% in the MSC-Exo group while those in the control and Exo-antiVEGF groups were 15.4 ± 4.4% and 8.7 ± 1.1%, respectively. Four weeks after implantation, differences in the area between the MSC-Exo group and the Exo-antiVEGF or control groups were further broadened. Histologically, notable accumulation of osteoblast-like cells and vascular endothelial cells was observed in the MSC-Exo group; however, fewer cells were found in the Exo-antiVEGF and control groups. In conclusion, MSC-Exo promoted bone regeneration during early stages, as well as enhanced angiogenesis. Considering the tissue regeneration with transplanted cells and their secretomes, this study suggests that exosomes might play an important role, especially in angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2990366782,"Background Maternal physical and mental health during pregnancy are key determinants of birth outcomes. There are relatively few prospective data that integrate physical and mental maternal health measures with birth outcomes in low- and middle-income country settings. We aimed to investigate maternal health during pregnancy and the impact on birth outcomes in an African birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study. Methods Pregnant women attending 2 public health clinics, Mbekweni (serving a predominantly black African population) and TC Newman (predominantly mixed ancestry) in a poor peri-urban area of South Africa were enrolled in their second trimester and followed through childbirth. All births occurred at a single public hospital. Maternal sociodemographic, physical and psychosocial characteristics were comprehensively assessed. Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore associations between maternal health and birth outcomes. Results Over 3 years, 1137 women (median age 25.8 years; 21% HIV-infected) gave birth to 1143 live babies. Most pregnancies were uncomplicated but gestational diabetes (1%), anaemia (22%) or pre-eclampsia (2%) occurred in a minority. Most households (87%) had a monthly income of less than USD 350; only 27% of moms were employed and food insecurity was common (37%). Most babies (80%) were born by vaginal delivery at full term; 17% were preterm, predominantly late preterm. Only 74 (7%) of babies required hospitalisation immediately after birth and only 2 babies were HIV-infected. Food insecurity, socioeconomic status, pregnancy-associated hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and mixed ancestry were associated with lower infant gestational age while maternal BMI at enrolment was associated with higher infant gestational age. Primigravida or alcohol use during pregnancy were negatively associated with infant birth weight and head circumference. Maternal BMI at enrolment was positively associated with birth weight and gestational diabetes was positively associated with birth weight and head circumference for gestational age. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with lower infant birth weight. Conclusion Several modifiable risk factors including food insecurity, smoking, and alcohol consumption during pregnancy were identified as associated with negative birth outcomes, all of which are amenable to public health interventions. Interventions to address key exposures influencing birth outcomes are needed to improve maternal and child health in low-middle income country settings."
https://openalex.org/W2990183082,"Background Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a global health threat. Antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli infections are associated with high morbidity and expenditure when compared with infections caused by susceptible strains. In Nigeria, antimicrobial drugs are readily available over-the-counter with potential for indiscriminate use by poultry farmers and eventual development of drug resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate prevalence and risk factors for multi-drug resistant E. coli among poultry workers (PW) in Abuja, Nigeria. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 122 randomly selected apparently healthy poultry workers (poultry-farmers/ sellers) in Municipal and Kuje Area Councils from December 2018 to April 2019. Data was collected on socio-demographics and exposure factors using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. E. coli was isolated and identified from stool samples of poultry workers. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials. Data was analyzed by computing proportions, prevalence odds-ratios (POR) and logistic regression at 5% significance level. Results Among PW, there were 121 males (99.2%). Mean age of the male workers was 30.6 ± 9.7years, 54.6% (n = 66) married, 57.9% (n = 70) had secondary education and 62.0% (n = 75) were farm-workers. Prevalence of E. coli was 39.7% (n = 48), highest among farm-workers (POR = 2.7, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.3-5.7; p = 0.01) compared to poultry-sellers. Of the 48 E. coli isolates, 16.7% (n = 8) were extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producers and 79.2% (n = 38) were MDR. We detected resistance against Tetracycline: (83.3%, n = 40), Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim: (79.2%, n = 38), Ampicillin: (77.1%, n = 37), Streptomycin: (72.9%, n = 35), Nalidixic acid: (50%, n = 24), Gentamicin: (41.7%, n = 20), Chloramphenicol: (31.3%, n = 15), Cephalothin: (27.1%, n = 13), Nitrofurantoin: (10.4%, n = 5) and Imipenem: (6.3%, n = 3). Absence of lavatory (POR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1-6.7); existence of farm/market for >10years (POR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.4) and PW's history of diarrhea in last three months (POR = 2.8, CI = 1.2-6.3) were associated with MDR. Controlling for age, absence of lavatory (adjusted OR [aOR] = 4.31, 95% CI = 1.6-11.9); PW's history of diarrhea in last three months (aOR = 3.3,95%CI = 1.3-8.5) and work exposure >10years (aOR = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.1-0.9) remained independent risk factors for MDR. Conclusion Prevalence of resistant E. coli was highest among farm-workers and associated with older farms/markets, occupational exposure of over 10 years and poor hygienic measures. The management of Municipal and Kuje Area Councils were recommended to provide lavatories for public use in farm-settlements/markets. The importance of hand-hygiene and responsible use of antimicrobials in poultry production was emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2991059578,"Among different post-translational modifications (PTMs), one of the most important one is the lysine crotonylation in proteins. Its importance cannot be undermined related to different diseases and essential biological practice. The key step for finding the hidden mechanisms of crotonylation along with their occurrence sites is to completely apprehend the mechanism behind this biological process. In previously reported studies, researchers have used different techniques, like position weighted matrix (PWM), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN), and many others. However, the maximum prediction accuracy achieved was not such high. To address this, herein, we propose an improved predictor for lysine crotonylation sites named iCrotoK-PseAAC, in which we have incorporated various position and composition relative features along with statistical moments into PseAAC. The results of self-consistency testing were 100% accurate, while the 10-fold cross validation gave 99.0% accuracy. Based on the validation and comparison of model, it is concluded that the iCrotoK-PseAAC is more accurate than the previously proposed models."
https://openalex.org/W2991112375,"Performed in a Slovenian higher education institution, the presented research was designed to help investigate which factors influence the ways a student perceives an e-course's usefulness in a blended learning environment. The study is based on an online questionnaire completed by 539 students whose participation in the survey was voluntary. Using structural equation modelling, the students' perceptions of different aspects were investigated, including their attitudes to course topics and technology, learning preferences, teachers' role in course design and managing the teaching process. The empirical results show e-learning is positively perceived to be usefulness when: (1) the teacher is engaged and their activities in an e-course, with the (2) a student's attitude to the subject matter and the lecturer's classroom performance having a direct impact, and (3) technology acceptance having an indirect impact. No major differences were revealed when the model was tested on student subgroups sorted by gender, year of study, and students' weekly spare-time activities."
https://openalex.org/W2991256217,"Studies have shown scholastic, creative, and social benefits of Montessori education, benefits that were hypothesized to result from better executive functioning on the part of those so educated. As these previous studies have not reported consistent outcomes supporting this idea, we therefore evaluated scholastic development in a cross-sectional study of kindergarten and elementary school-age students, with an emphasis on the three core executive measures of cognitive flexibility, working memory update, and selective attention (inhibition). Two hundred and one (201) children underwent a complete assessment: half of the participants were from Montessori settings, while the other half were controls from traditional schools. The results confirmed that Montessori participants outperformed peers from traditional schools both in academic outcomes and in creativity skills across age groups and in self-reported well-being at school at kindergarten age. No differences were found in global executive functions, except working memory. Moreover, a multiple mediations model revealed a significant impact of creative skills on academic outcomes influenced by the school experience. These results shed light on the possibly overestimated contribution of executive functions as the main contributor to scholastic success of Montessori students and call for further investigation. Here, we propose that Montessori school-age children benefit instead from a more balanced development stemming from self-directed creative execution."
https://openalex.org/W2990982401,"Within triple negative breast cancer, several molecular subtypes have been identified, underlying the heterogeneity of such an aggressive disease. The basal-like subtype is characterized by mutations in the TP53 gene, and is associated with a low pathologic complete response rate following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In a genome-scale short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen of breast cancer cells, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) was a frequent and strong hit in the basal breast cancer cell lines indicating its importance for growth and survival of these breast cancer cells. Plk1 regulates progression of cells through the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. We assessed the activity of two ATP-competitive Plk1 inhibitors, GSK461364 and onvansertib, alone and with a taxane in a set of triple negative breast cancer cell lines and in vivo. GSK461364 showed synergism with docetaxel in SUM149 (Combination Index 0.70) and SUM159 (CI, 0.62). GSK461364 in combination with docetaxel decreased the clonogenic potential (interaction test for SUM149 and SUM159, p<0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively) and the tumorsphere formation of SUM149 and SUM159 (interaction test, p = 0.01 and p< 0.001). In the SUM159 xenograft model, onvansertib plus paclitaxel significantly decreased tumor volume compared to single agent paclitaxel (p<0.0001). Inhibition of Plk1 in combination with taxanes shows promising results in a subset of triple negative breast cancer intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy. Onvansertib showed significant tumor volume shrinkage when combined with paclitaxel in vivo and should be considered in clinical trials for the treatment of triple negative cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2990357870,"To better understand the mechanisms behind cells decision-making to differentiate, we assessed the influence of stochastic gene expression (SGE) modulation on the erythroid differentiation process. It has been suggested that stochastic gene expression has a role in cell fate decision-making which is revealed by single-cell analyses but studies dedicated to demonstrate the consistency of this link are still lacking. Recent observations showed that SGE significantly increased during differentiation and a few showed that an increase of the level of SGE is accompanied by an increase in the differentiation process. However, a consistent relation in both increasing and decreasing directions has never been shown in the same cellular system. Such demonstration would require to be able to experimentally manipulate simultaneously the level of SGE and cell differentiation in order to observe if cell behavior matches with the current theory. We identified three drugs that modulate SGE in primary erythroid progenitor cells. Both Artemisinin and Indomethacin decreased SGE and reduced the amount of differentiated cells. On the contrary, a third component called MB-3 simultaneously increased the level of SGE and the amount of differentiated cells. We then used a dynamical modelling approach which confirmed that differentiation rates were indeed affected by the drug treatment. Using single-cell analysis and modeling tools, we provide experimental evidence that, in a physiologically relevant cellular system, SGE is linked to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2991360492,"Background The United States is experiencing a continuing crisis of gun violence, and economically marginalized and racially segregated inner-city areas are among the most affected. To decrease this violence, public health interventions must engage with the complex social factors and structural drivers—especially with regard to the clandestine sale of narcotics—that have turned the neighborhood streets of specific vulnerable subgroups into concrete killing fields. Here we present a mixed-methods ethnographic and epidemiological assessment of narcotics-driven firearm violence in Philadelphia’s impoverished, majority Puerto Rican neighborhoods. Methods Using an exploratory sequential study design, we formulated hypotheses about ethnic/racial vulnerability to violence, based on half a dozen years of intensive participant-observation ethnographic fieldwork. We subsequently tested them statistically, by combining geo-referenced incidents of narcotics- and firearm-related crime from the Philadelphia police department with census information representing race and poverty levels. We explored the racialized relationships between poverty, narcotics, and violence, melding ethnography, graphing, and Poisson regression. Findings Even controlling for poverty levels, impoverished majority-Puerto Rican areas in Philadelphia are exposed to significantly higher levels of gun violence than majority-white or black neighborhoods. Our mixed methods data suggest that this reflects the unique social position of these neighborhoods as a racial meeting ground in deeply segregated Philadelphia, which has converted them into a retail endpoint for the sale of astronomical levels of narcotics. Implications We document racial/ethnic and economic disparities in exposure to firearm violence and contextualize them ethnographically in the lived experience of community members. The exceptionally concentrated and high-volume retail narcotics trade, and the violence it generates in Philadelphia’s poor Puerto Rican neighborhoods, reflect unique structural vulnerability and cultural factors. For most young people in these areas, the narcotics economy is the most readily accessible form of employment and social mobility. The performance of violence is an implicit part of survival in these lucrative, illegal narcotics markets, as well as in the overcrowded jails and prisons through which entry-level sellers cycle chronically. To address the structural drivers of violence, an inner-city Marshall Plan is needed that should include well-funded formal employment programs, gun control, re-training police officers to curb the routinization of brutality, reform of criminal justice to prioritize rehabilitation over punishment, and decriminalization of narcotics possession and low-level sales."
https://openalex.org/W2989817171,"The effective evaluation of the impact of a scholarly article is a significant endeavor; for this reason, it has garnered attention. From the perspective of knowledge flow, this paper extracted various knowledge flow patterns concealed in articles citation counts to describe the citation impact of the articles. First, the intensity characteristic of knowledge flow was investigated to distinguish the different citation vitality of articles. Second, the knowledge diffusion capacity was examined to differentiate the size of the scope of articles' influences on the academic environment. Finally, the knowledge transfer capacity was discussed to investigate the support degree of articles on the follow-up research. Experimental results show that articles got more citations recently have a higher knowledge flow intensity. The articles have various impacts on the academic environment and have different supporting effects on the follow-up research, representing the differences in their knowledge diffusion and knowledge transfer capabilities. Compared with the single quantitative index of citation frequency, these knowledge flow patterns can carefully explore the citation value of articles. By integrating the three knowledge flow patterns to examine the total citation impact of articles, we found that the articles exhibit distinct value of citation impact even if they were published in the same field, in the same year, and with similar citation frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2990022215,"There is recent evidence of widespread declines of shovelnose ray populations (Order Rhinopristiformes) in heavily fished regions. These declines, which are likely driven by high demand for their fins in Asian markets, raises concern about their risk of over-exploitation and extinction. Using life-history theory and incorporating uncertainty into a modified Euler-Lotka model, the maximum intrinsic rates of population increase (rmax) were estimated for nine species from four families of Rhinopristiformes, using four different natural mortality estimators. Estimates of mean rmax, across the different natural mortality methods, varied from 0.03 to 0.59 year-1 among the nine species, but generally increased with increasing maximum size. Comparing these estimates to rmax values for other species of chondrichthyans, the species Rhynchobatus australiae, Glaucostegus typus, and Glaucostegus cemiculus were relatively productive, while most species from Rhinobatidae and Trygonorrhinidae had relatively low rmax values. If the demand for their high-value products can be addressed then population recovery for some species is likely possible, but will vary depending on the species."
https://openalex.org/W2990429659,"Transporting a severely injured patient directly to a trauma center (TC) is consensually considered optimal. Nevertheless, disagreement persists regarding the association between secondary transfer status and outcome. The aim of the study was to compare adjusted mortality between road traffic trauma patients directly or secondarily transported to a level 1 trauma center (TC) in an exclusive French trauma system with a physician staffed prehospital emergency medical system (EMS).A retrospective cohort study was performed using 2015-2017 data from a regional trauma registry (Traumabase®), an administrative database on road-traffic accidents and prehospital-EMS records. Multivariate logistic regression models were computed to determine the role of the modality of admission on mortality and to identify factors associated with secondary transfer. The primary outcome was day-30 mortality. Results: During the study period, 121.955 victims of road-traffic accident were recorded among which 4412 trauma patients were admitted in the level 1 regional TCs, 4031 directly and 381 secondarily transferred from lower levels facilities. No significant association between all-cause 30-day mortality and the type of transport was observed (Odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.3-1.9]) when adjusted for potential confounders. Patients secondarily transferred were older, with low-energy mechanism and presented higher head and abdominal injury scores. Among all 947 death, 43 (4.5%) occurred in lower-level facilities. The population-based undertriage leading to death was 0.15%, 95%CI [0.12-0.19].In an exclusive trauma system with physician staffed prehospital care, road-traffic victims secondarily transferred to a TC do not have an increased mortality when compared to directly transported patients."
https://openalex.org/W2990396971,"In longitudinal studies, in vivo micro-Computed Tomography (microCT) imaging is used to investigate bone changes over time due to interventions in mice. However, ionising radiation can provoke significant variations in bone morphometric parameters. In a previous study, we evaluated the effect of reducing the integration time on the properties of the mouse tibia measured from microCT images. A scanning procedure (100 ms integration time, 256 mGy nominal radiation dose) was selected as the best compromise between image quality and radiation dose induced on the animal. In this work, the effect of repeated in vivo scans has been evaluated using the selected procedure. The right tibia of twelve female C57BL/6 (six wild type, WT, six ovariectomised, OVX) and twelve BALB/c (six WT, six OVX) mice was scanned every two weeks, starting at week 14 of age. At week 24, mice were sacrificed and both tibiae were scanned. Standard trabecular and cortical morphometric parameters were calculated. The spatial distribution of densitometric parameters (e.g. bone mineral content) was obtained by dividing each tibia in 40 partitions. Stiffness and strength in compression were estimated using homogeneous linear elastic microCT-based micro-Finite Element models. Differences between right (irradiated) and left (non-irradiated control) tibiae were evaluated for each parameter. The irradiated tibiae had higher Tb.Th (+3.3%) and Tb.Sp (+11.6%), and lower Tb.N (-14.2%) compared to non-irradiated tibiae, consistently across both strains and intervention groups. A reduction in Tb.BV/TV (-14.9%) was also observed in the C57BL/6 strain. In the OVX group, a small reduction was also observed in Tt.Ar (-5.0%). In conclusion, repeated microCT scans (at 256 mGy, 5 scans, every two weeks) had limited effects on the mouse tibia, compared to the expected changes induced by bone treatments. Therefore, the selected scanning protocol is acceptable for measuring the effect of bone interventions in vivo."

Anemia during pregnancy has maternal and perinatal diverse consequences and it increase the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. The aim of this study is to assess magnitude and factors associated with anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Bench Maji, Keffa and Sheka zones of public hospitals, South west, Ethiopia, 2018. Methods A cross-sectional study was employed on 1871 pregnant mothers from selected hospitals. All third trimester pregnant women attending antenatal care at Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital, Tepi, Gebretsadik Shawo and Wacha public hospitals were included in the study. Data was entered to Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify independently associate factors at confidence interval of 95% and significance level of P-value <0.05. Result The magnitude of anemia in this study from the total study participant was 356 (19.0%). Among anemic pregnant women, 330 (92.7%), 21(5.9%) and 5(1.4%) were mild anemia, moderate anemia and severe anemia respectively. Age group 20–24 [AOR 6.28(2.40–16.42)], 25–29 [AOR = 6.38 (2.71–15.01)], 30–34 [AOR = 5.13 (2.27–11.58) and age ≥35 years [AOR = 2.53 (1.07–5.98)], educational status (read and write) [AOR 2.06, 95% CI (1.12–3.80)], gestational age(term)[AOR 1.94, 95% CI (1.27–2.96)], Caffeine (coffee and tea) and alcohol use occasionally [AOR 2.01, 95% CI (1.14–3.55)] and [AOR 2.59, 95% CI (1.49–4.52)] respectively, nutritional status (under nutrition) [AOR 3.00, 95% CI (2.22–3.97)] and family size (>6) [AOR 2.66, 95% CI (1.49–4.77)] were factors associated with anemia. Conclusion The magnitude of anemia found to be high. Age, educational status of the mother, gestational age, caffeine and alcohol use, Nutritional status and family size were factors significantly associated with anemia. To prevent adverse outcome of anemia, health care providers should work on these factors."
https://openalex.org/W2989949581,"Gliomas account for 26.5% of all primary central nervous system tumors. Recent studies have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to extract white matter fibers and the diffusion coefficients derived from MR processing to provide useful, non-invasive insights into the extent of tumor invasion, axonal integrity, and gross differentiation of glioma from metastasis. Here, we extend this work by examining whether a tract-based analysis can improve non-invasive localization of tumor impact on white matter integrity. This study retrospectively analyzed preoperative magnetic resonance sequences highlighting contrast enhancement and DTI scans of 13 subjects that were biopsy-confirmed to have either high or low-grade glioma. We reconstructed the corticospinal tract and superior longitudinal fasciculus by applying atlas-based regions of interest to fibers derived from whole-brain deterministic streamline tractography. Within-subject comparison of hemispheric diffusion coefficients (e.g., fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) indicated higher levels of white matter degradation in the ipsilesional hemisphere. Novel application of along-tract analyses revealed that tracts traversing the tumor region showed significant white matter degradation compared to the contralesional hemisphere and ipsilesional tracts displaced by the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2990916546,"Human infections due to the monkey malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi are increasingly being reported from Malaysia. The parasite causes high parasitaemia, severe and fatal malaria in humans thus there is a need for urgent measures for its control. The MSP4 is a potential vaccine candidate, which is well studied in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax; however, no study has been conducted in the orthologous gene of P. knowlesi. In this study, we investigated the level of polymorphisms, haplotypes, natural selection and population structure of full-length pkmsp4 in 32 clinical samples from Malaysian Borneo along with 4 lab-adapted strains. We found low levels of polymorphism across the gene with exon I showing higher diversity than the exon II. The C- terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains and GPI-anchored region within exon II were mostly conserved with only 2 non-synonymous substitutions. Although 21 amino acid haplotypes were found, the frequency of mutation at the majority of the polymorphic positions was low. We found evidence of negative selection at the exon II of the gene indicating existence of functional constraints. Phylogenetic haplotype network analysis identified shared haplotypes and indicated geographical clustering of samples originating from Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. High population differentiation values were observed within parasite populations originating from Malaysian Borneo (Kapit, Sarikei and Betong) and laboratory-adapted strains obtained from Peninsular Malaysia and Philippines indicating distinct population structure. This is the first study to genetically characterize the full-length msp4 gene from clinical isolates of P. knowlesi from Malaysia and thus would be very useful for future rational vaccine studies. Further studies with higher number of samples and functional characterization of the protein will be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2989788856,"Many tropical and subtropical species are sensitive to sudden temperature changes, especially drops in temperature. During winters 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, unusually cold temperatures occurred in many parts of Florida, USA, resulting in increased mortality of Florida manatees, sea turtles, fish, corals, and other species. The Florida manatee, in particular, is highly susceptible to cold stress and death when water temperatures drop below 20°C. We sought to characterize the magnitude and timing of reports of cold-related manatee carcasses in relation to fluctuations in water and air temperatures in central-east and central-west Florida during the six winters from 2008 to 2014. We used a generalized linear model to predict counts of manatee carcasses with a cold-related cause of death reported over 7-day bins in relation to various short-term (two weeks or less) and cumulative (incrementally summed from the start of the winter) heating-degree-day effects (HDD; < 20°C) and a categorical winter variable. Using water temperature data, the top-ranked model in both regions included a short-term temperature effect (14-day HDD sum) that preceded increases in reports of cold-related manatee carcasses by 7 days. Cumulative exposure to cold weather over the winter amplified effects on mortality in the central-east region. Quantifying the relationship between cold events and manatee mortality helps us prepare for rescue and salvage operations when extremely cold weather is forecast. This is especially important because anticipated loss or degradation of warm-water refuges due to human activities and sea level rise could potentially impact the manatee population in the future. These methods could also be applied to other species susceptible to cold-related mortality."

We conducted a comprehensive and nationwide study on MDR-TB in 17 provinces for the period from June 2009 to June 2015, and a total of 1154 cases of MDR-TB were finally investigated. The study sought to assess the clinical features and contrast drug susceptibility profiles of MDR-TB patients in China. Cavitary disease, young age, and long duration of TB disease among MDR-TB patients were important predictors. A high resistance proportion of first-line drugs was observed in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Resistant proportions of second-line anti-TB drugs in western region for amikacin, aminosalicylic acid, and levofloxacin were higher than eastern and central regions. High levels of drug resistance were seen in earlier cases (before 2011) and outpatients. We found high levels of resistance to 1st- and 2nd-line drugs in all settings, with considerable variabilities in terms of different Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) programme, level of economic development(eastern, central and western regions) and patient source (inpatients and outpatients). Timely drug susceptibility testing (DST) and effective management are necessary to ensure an early detection of MDR-TB and its proper treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2990575904,"Background The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between personal values in adolescence retrospectively assessed and psychological distress in adults in a representative sample of community adults in Japan. Methods We used the J-SHINE data collected in 2010 and 2017. Personal values in adolescence were retrospectively measured in the 2017 survey in two ways: (1) value priorities developed from Schwartz’s theory of basic values; and (2) commitment to values measured by Personal Values Questionnaire II (PVQ-II). Psychological distress was measured by using K6 in 2010. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to clarify the association between personal values in adolescence and psychological distress in adults, adjusting for sociodemographic variables, smoking, alcohol drinking, and economic status at age 15. Results Enduring active challenging, cherishing family and friends, and the commitment to values were significantly and negatively associated with psychological distress in adults. Pursuing one’s interest was significantly and positively associated with psychological distress. Conclusions Having a value priority of enduring active challenging, cherishing family and friends, and the commitment to values in adolescence may reduce psychological distress in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2990734264,"Sea star wasting disease (SSWD) describes a suite of disease signs believed to have led to catastrophic die-offs in many asteroid species, beginning in 2013. While most studies have focused on large, easily visible sea stars with widely-dispersing larvae, less information is available on the effect of this disease outbreak on smaller sea star species, such as the six-armed sea star Leptasterias spp. Unlike many larger sea stars, Leptasterias brood non-feeding young instead of broadcast-spawning planktonic larvae. Limited dispersal and thus limited gene flow may make these sea stars more vulnerable to local selective pressures, such as disease outbreaks. Here, we examined Leptasterias populations at sites along the California coast and documented abundance changes coincident with recent Pacific coast SSWD in 2014. Detection of Leptasterias in central California declined, and Leptasterias were not detected at multiple sites clustered around the San Francisco Bay outflow in the most recent surveys. Additionally, we categorized disease signs in Leptasterias in the field and laboratory, which mirrored those seen in larger sea stars in both settings. Finally, we found that magnesium chloride (MgCl2) slowed the progression of physical deterioration related to SSWD when applied to sea stars in the laboratory, suggesting that MgCl2 may prolong the survival of diseased individuals."

This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence, burden and further identify socioeconomic factors influencing ethnic differences in knee pain and symptoms of OA among older adults aged 55 years and over in Greater Kuala Lumpur (the capital city of Malaysia). The sample for the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) was selected using stratified random sampling, by age and ethnicity from the electoral rolls of three parliamentary constituencies. Information on knee pain was available in 1226 participants, mean age (SD) 68.96 (1.57) years (409 Malay, 416 Chinese, 401 Indian). The crude and weighted prevalence of knee pain and self-reported knee OA symptoms were 33.3% and 30.8% respectively. There were significant ethnic differences in knee pain (crude prevalence: Malays 44.6%, Chinese 23.5% and Indians 31.9%, p<0.001). The presence of two or more non-communicable diseases (NCD) attenuated the increased risk of knee pain among the ethnic Indians compared to the ethnic Chinese. The prevalence of knee pain remained significantly higher among the ethnic Malays after adjustment for confounders. While the prevalence of knee pain in our older population appears similar to that reported in other published studies in Asia, the higher prevalence among the ethnic Malays has not previously been reported. Further research to determine potential genetic susceptibility to knee pain among the ethnic Malays is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2990743718,"The presynaptic dopamine transporter mediates rapid reuptake of synaptic dopamine. Although cell surface DAT trafficking recently emerged as an important component of DAT regulation, it has not been systematically investigated. Here, we apply our single quantum dot (Qdot) tracking approach to monitor DAT plasma membrane dynamics in several heterologous expression cell hosts with nanometer localization accuracy. We demonstrate that Qdot-tagged DAT proteins exhibited highly heterogeneous membrane diffusivity dependent on the local membrane topography. We also show that Qdot-tagged DATs were localized away from the flat membrane regions and were dynamically retained in the membrane protrusions and cell edges for the duration of imaging. Single quantum dot tracking of wildtype DAT and its conformation-defective coding variants (R60A and W63A) revealed a significantly accelerated rate of dysfunctional DAT membrane diffusion. We believe our results warrant an in-depth investigation as to whether compromised membrane dynamics is a common feature of brain disorder-derived DAT mutants."

SMRs are increasingly being explored as strength-based and person-centered adjuncts to care for people receiving inpatient psychiatry services. The aim of this study is to understand health provider and inpatient service user perceptions on the use of SMRs on acute psychiatric units.We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten service users and nine health providers (four occupational therapists and five nurses) regarding their experiences of the SMRs located on three acute inpatient units in a large urban tertiary care hospital. We audio recorded and transcribed the focus groups and used thematic analysis to analyze the data.Our results suggested four common themes amongst health provider and service user experiences of sensory modulation rooms: (1) service user empowerment through self-management, (2) emotional regulation, (3) an alternative to current practices, and (4) health provider and service user education.Our study supports the ecological utility of SMRs as person-centred adjunct therapeutic space viewed positively by both service users and health providers. This understanding of SMRs is critical for future service design, research and policy aimed at improving the service user experience and care for this population. Future research is needed to validate the experience of the SMRs with other patient groups and health providers."
https://openalex.org/W2990499834,"Quercetin molecule (3, 3', 4', 5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone, C15H10O7) is an important flavonoid compound of natural origin, consisting of two aromatic A and B rings linked through the C ring with endocyclic oxygen atom and five hydroxyl groups attached to the 3, 3', 4', 5 and 7 positions. This molecule is found in many foods and plants, and is known to have a wide range of therapeutic properties, like an anti-oxidant, anti-toxic, anti-inflammatory etc. In this study for the first time we have revealed and investigated the pathways of the tautomeric transformations for the most stable conformers of the isolated quercetin molecule (Brovarets' & Hovorun, 2019) via the intramolecular proton transfer. Energetic, structural, dynamical and polar characteristics of these transitions, in particular relative Gibbs free and electronic energies, characteristics of the intramolecular specific interactions-H-bonds and attractive van der Waals contacts, have been analysed in details. It was demonstrated that the most probable process among all investigated is the proton transfer from the O3H hydroxyl group of the C ring to the C2' carbon atom of the C2'H group of the B ring along the intramolecular O3H…C2' H-bond with the further formation of the C2'H2 group. It was established that the proton transfer from the hydroxyl groups to the carbon atoms of the neighboring CH groups is assisted at the transition states by the strong intramolecular HCH…O H-bond (~28.5 kcal∙mol-1). The least probable path of the proton transfer-from the C8H group to the endocyclic O1 oxygen atom-causes the decyclization of the C ring in some cases. It is shortly discussed the biological importance of the obtained results."
https://openalex.org/W2990542737,"The colonisation of specific body sites in contact with the external environment by microorganisms is both well-described and universally accepted, whereas, the existence of microbial evidence in other “classically sterile” locations including the blood, synovial space, and lungs, is a relatively new concept. Increasingly, a role for the microbiome in disease is being considered, and it is therefore necessary to increase our understanding of these. To date, little data support the existence of a “synovial fluid microbiome”. Methods The presence and identity of bacterial and fungal DNA in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy control subjects was investigated through amplification and sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer region 2 respectively. Synovial fluid concentrations of the cytokines IL-6, IL-17A, IL22 and IL-23 were determined by ELISA. Results Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were detected in 87.5% RA patients, and all healthy control subjects. At the phylum level, the microbiome was predominated by Proteobacteria (Control = 83.5%, RA = 79.3%) and Firmicutes (Control = 16.1%, RA = 20.3%), and to a much lesser extent, Actinobacteria (Control = 0.2%, RA = 0.3%) and Bacteroidetes (Control = 0.1%, RA = 0.1%). Fungal DNA was identified in 75% RA samples, and 88.8% healthy controls. At the phylum level, synovial fluid was predominated by members of the Basidiomycota (Control = 53.9%, RA = 46.9%) and Ascomycota (Control = 35.1%, RA = 50.8%) phyla. Statistical analysis revealed key taxa that were differentially present or abundant dependent on disease status. Conclusions This study reports the presence of a synovial fluid microbiome, and determines that this is modulated by disease status (RA) as are other classical microbiome niches."
https://openalex.org/W2989821007,"Thalassemia and hemoglobinopathy is a group of hereditary blood disorder with diverse clinical manifestation inherited by autosomal recessive manner. The Beta thalassemia/Hemoglobin E disease (HbE/βthal) causes a variable degree of hemolysis and the most severe form of HbE/βthal disease develop a lifelong transfusion-dependent anemia. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is an established procedure of embryo genetic analysis to avoid the risk of passing on this particular condition from the carrier parents to their offspring. Preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy (PGT-A) also facilitates the selection of embryos without chromosomal aberration resulting in the successful embryo implantation rate. Herein, we study the clinical outcome of using combined PGT-M and PGT-A in couples at risk of passing on HbE/βthal disease. The study was performed from January 2016 to December 2017. PGT-M was developed using short tandem repeat linkage analysis around the beta globin gene cluster and direct mutation testing using primer extension-based mini-sequencing. Thereafter, we recruited 15 couples at risk of passing on HbE/βthal disease who underwent a combined total of 22 IVF cycles. PGT was performed in 106 embryos with a 3.89% allele drop-out rate. Using combined PGT-M and PGT-A methods, 80% of women obtained satisfactory genetic testing results and were able to undergo embryo transfer within the first two cycles. The successful implantation rate was 64.29%. PGT accuracy was evaluated by prenatal and postnatal genetic confirmation and 100% had a genetic status consistent with PGT results. The overall clinical outcome of successful live birth for couples at risk of producing offspring with HbE/βthal was 53.33%. Conclusively, combined PGT-M and PGT-A is a useful technology to prevent HbE/βthal disease in the offspring of recessive carriers."

Nonparametric control charts are helpful when the probability model of the process output is not known. In such cases, the sampling mechanism becomes very important for picking a suitable sample for process monitoring. This study proposes a nonparametric arcsine exponentially weighted moving average sign chart by using an efficient scheme, namely, sequential sampling scheme. The proposal intends to enhance the detection ability of the arcsine exponentially weighted moving average sign chart, particularly for the detection of small shifts. The performance of the proposal is assessed, and compared with its counterparts, by using some popular run length properties including average, median and standard deviation run lengths. The proposed chart shows efficient shift detection ability as compared to the other charts, considered in this study. A real-life application based on the smartphone accelerometer data-set, for the implementation of the proposed scheme, is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2991354352,"The study aimed to survey maraviroc use and assess effectiveness and durability of maraviroc-containing antiretroviral treatment (ART) in routine practice across Europe.Data were retrieved from 26 cohorts in 8 countries comprising adults who started maraviroc in 2005-2016 and had ≥1 follow-up visit. Available V3 sequences were re-analysed centrally for tropism determination by geno2pheno[coreceptor]. Treatment failure (TF) was defined as either virological failure (viral load >50 copies/mL) or maraviroc discontinuation for any reason over 48 weeks. Predictors of TF were explored by logistic regression analysis. Time to maraviroc discontinuation was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.At maraviroc initiation (baseline), among 1,381 patients, 67.1% had experienced ≥3 ART classes and 45.6% had a viral load <50 copies/mL. Maraviroc was occasionally added to the existing regimen as a single agent (7.3%) but it was more commonly introduced alongside other new agents, and was often (70.4%) used with protease inhibitors. Accompanying drugs comprised 1 (40.2%), 2 (48.6%) or ≥3 (11.2%) ART classes. Among 1,273 patients with available tropism data, 17.6% showed non-R5 virus. Non-standard maraviroc use also comprised reported once daily dosing (20.0%) and a total daily dose of 150mg (12.1%). Over 48 weeks, 41.4% of patients met the definition of TF, although the 1-year estimated retention on maraviroc was 82.1% (95% confidence interval 79.9-84.2). Among 1,010 subjects on maraviroc at week 48, the viral load was >50 copies/mL in 19.9% and >200 copies/mL in 10.7%. Independent predictors of TF comprised a low nadir CD4 count, a detectable baseline viral load, previous PI experience, non-R5 tropism, having ≥3 active drugs in the accompanying regimen, and a more recent calendar year of maraviroc initiation.This study reports on the largest observation cohort of patients who started maraviroc across 8 European countries. In this overall highly treatment-experienced population, with a small but appreciable subset that received maraviroc outside of standard treatment guidelines, maraviroc was safe and reasonably effective, with relatively low rates of discontinuation over 48 weeks and only 2 cases of serum transaminase elevations reported as reasons for discontinuation."
https://openalex.org/W2989801246,"To assess the mRNA expression profile and explore the hub mRNAs and potential molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of human thoracic aortic dissection (TAD).mRNA microarray expression signatures of TAD tissues (n = 6) and non-TAD tissues (NT; n = 6) were analyzed by an Arraystar human mRNA microarray. Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the results of the mRNA microarray. Bioinformatic tools, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were utilized. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed based on data from the STRING database. Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) and cytoHubba analyses were used to predict the strongest hub gene and pathway.The top 10 hub genes were CDK1, CDC20, CCNB2, CCNB1, MAD2L1, AURKA, C3AR1, NCAPG, CXCL12 and ASPM, which were identified from the PPI network. Module analysis revealed that TAD was associated with the cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, the p53 signaling pathway, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of all hub genes was significantly increased in TAD samples (p < 0.05). Immunostaining of Ki-67 and CDK1 showed a high proliferation state and high expression in TAD, respectively.CDK1 could be used as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target of TAD."
https://openalex.org/W2990919038,"Phylogenetic trees are frequently used in biology to study the relationships between a number of species or organisms. The shape of a phylogenetic tree contains useful information about patterns of speciation and extinction, so powerful tools are needed to investigate the shape of a phylogenetic tree. Tree shape statistics are a common approach to quantifying the shape of a phylogenetic tree by encoding it with a single number. In this article, we propose a new resolution function to evaluate the power of different tree shape statistics to distinguish between dissimilar trees. We show that the new resolution function requires less time and space in comparison with the previously proposed resolution function for tree shape statistics. We also introduce a new class of tree shape statistics, which are linear combinations of two existing statistics that are optimal with respect to a resolution function, and show evidence that the statistics in this class converge to a limiting linear combination as the size of the tree increases.

https://openalex.org/W2991002574,"Background In most parts of the world, men access health services less frequently than women, and this trend is unrelated to differences in need for services. While male involvement in healthcare as partners or fathers has been extensively studied, less is known about the health-seeking behavior of men as clients themselves. This interventional research study aimed to determine how the introduction of male-friendly clinics impacted male care-seeking behavior and to describe the reasons for accessing services among men in rural Kenya. Methods and findings We questioned men to assess utilization and perceptions of existing health clinics, then designed and evaluated a “male clinics” intervention where dedicated male health workers were hired for one year to offer routine, free services exclusively to men within existing healthcare facilities. Results were compared between data from Male Clinics in specific health facilities, the same facilities concurrently, nearby control facilities concurrently, and intervention facilities historically. Costs of services, distance to facilities, and quality of care were the main barriers to healthcare access reported. The number of total visits was significantly higher than control groups (p<0·0001). In the intervention group, 18·6% of visits were for a checkup compared to almost none in control groups. The most common diagnoses overall were upper respiratory tract infections, malaria and injury. A major limitation of this study is the non-comparability in information captured using the Male Clinic registers compared to control registers. Conclusions Costs and quality of services deter men from seeking healthcare. The introduction of male-friendly health services could encourage men to seek preventive care and increase service uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2990048215,"In this paper, we explore gender norms held by men and women that might contribute to male perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Ghana. This qualitative research was conducted at the pre-intervention stage of a cluster randomized controlled trial. Our intervention uses community-based action teams to change social norms on gender and violence. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted within communities. We found that male perpetrated IPV is a common phenomenon within the study communities, yet it is complex and experienced differently depending on the context. A woman's non-compliance with gender norms provided context for the male partner to enforce societal conformity through IPV. Also, male partners' misbehavior (e.g. alcohol abuse) may exacerbate IPV. Whereas the former is socially acceptable, the latter may be contested. Victims may challenge/counteract IPV using varying tactics (e.g. threats), which were mainly directed toward male partners' immoral behavior. We conclude that there is a need to assess IPV with key considerations for female agency, as some victims may respond with violence. Moreover, some communities have the tendency to demonstrate more gender-equitable attitudes regarding male perpetration of IPV, as indicated by laws instituted by some traditional leaders to deter perpetrators. These are key learnings that can inform the design and delivery of various interventions that seek to address IPV."

The aim of this research was to investigate the difference of serum metabolic profiles in recurrent abortion women with APS and healthy women to explore the mechanism of this disease.Serum samples of 25 recurrent abortion women with APS and 25 healthy women were collected and analyzed by LC/MS in this study. Potential biomarkers were discovered by multivariate statistical analysis and then identified based on analysis results.Totally, we identified five biomarkers that involved in different metabolic pathway such as purine metabolism, amino acid metabolism and tyrosine metabolism. These biomarkers showed different roles in disease development.Metabolomics was proved as a powerful tool in understanding the mechanism of recurrent abortion caused by APS."
https://openalex.org/W2989721083,"Use of electronic media is widespread among adolescents. Many male adolescents spend a major part of their evenings playing video games. The increased exposure to artificial light as well as the exciting nature of this pastime is under suspicion to impair sleep. Sleep is considered to be important for memory consolidation, so there is also a potential risk for memory impairment due to video gaming. As learning and gaining knowledge is a very important part of adolescence, we decided to study the effects of prolonged video gaming on sleep and memory. The study was structured in a repeated measures design. Eighteen male participants played either the violent video game ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive"" or the board game ""Monopoly"" for five hours each on two Saturday nights. The game evenings were followed by sleep studies. Memory testing and vigilance evaluation was performed the next morning. During the course of the study, saliva samples were taken to determine melatonin and cortisol levels. The results of this crossover study showed slightly reduced sleep efficiency after ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive"" (-3.5%, p = .017) and impaired declarative memory recall (p = .005) compared to ""Monopoly"". Melatonin levels at bedtime were lower after ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive"" (p = .005), cortisol levels were elevated while playing the video game (p = .031). Negative effects on sleep were not strong but consistent with more wake after sleep onset (+12 min) and a higher arousal index after ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive"". We conclude that excessive video gaming in the evening can contribute to worsened sleep and impaired memory in male adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2990494776,"Objectives To explore staff perceptions of barriers to the identification of mild to moderate distress and the provision of emotional support in patients with end-stage renal disease. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews with staff in two hospitals (n = 31), with data analysed using a hybrid approach combining thematic analysis with aspects of grounded theory. Results Staff appeared very aware that many patients with end-stage renal disease experience distress, and most thought distressed patients should be helped as part of routine care. However, practice was variable and looking for and addressing distress was not embedded in care pathways. Interviews identified six themes: i) staff perceptions about how distress is manifested and what causes distress were variable; ii) staff perceptions of patients could lead to distress being overlooked because patients were thought to hide their distress whilst some groups were assumed to be more prone to distress than others; iii) role perceptions varied, with many staff believing it to be their role but not feeling comfortable with it, with doctors being particularly ambivalent; iv) fears held back some staff, who were concerned about what might happen when talking about distress, or who found the emotional load for themselves to be too high; v) staff felt they lacked skills, confidence and training, vi) capacity to respond may be limited, as staff perceive there to be insufficient time, with little or no specialist support services to refer patients to. Conclusions Staff perceived significant barriers in identifying and responding to patient distress. Barriers related to skills and knowledge could be addressed through training, with training ideally targeted at staff with positive attitudes, but who currently lack skills and confidence. Barriers related to role perceptions would be harder to address. The study is relevant internationally as part of improving long-term condition pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2990775842,"TV series represent a growing sector of the entertainment industry. Being able to predict their performance allows a broadcasting network to better focus the high investment needed for their preparation. In this paper, we consider a well known TV series—The Big Bang Theory—to identify factors leading to its success. The factors considered are mostly related to the script, such as the characteristics of dialogues (e.g., length, language complexity, sentiment), while the performance is measured by the reviews submitted by viewers (namely the number of reviews as a measure of popularity and the viewers’ ratings as a measure of appreciation). Through correlation and regression analysis, two sets of predictors are identified respectively for appreciation and popularity. In particular the episode number, the percentage of male viewers, the language complexity and text length emerge as the best predictors for popularity, while again the percentage of male viewers and the language complexity plus the number of we-words and the concentration of dialogues are the best choice for appreciation."

The community bears the brunt of inequities, reflected in their poor nutritional and socioeconomic status. We have employed qualitative design for the study, as we wanted to understand the contextual factors for Baiga tribal children's inferior nutrition status. Twenty in-depth interviews with the mothers of the children suffering from moderate to severe malnutrition and several other interviews were conducted with the key stakeholders like anganwadi workers, Integrated Child Development Scheme supervisors, Accredited Social Health Activists, public distribution system shopkeeper and registered medical practitioners. Interviews with the key informants were conducted in the Balagahat district of Madhya Pradesh. Key factors responsible for perpetuating malnutrition were then identified through thematic analysis. It was found that dissatisfaction with public services and indifferent attitude of public servants resulting in poor uptake of public services further accentuated the problem. A qualitative enquiry into the issue of high and persistent levels of malnourishment among these tribal children revealed several aspects which quantitative method may not have captured. This implies that while framing a policy for improvement in the nutrition status in such population, a holistic approach is required instead of focussing on one aspect such as supplementation of nutrition alone."

This study further tests the efficacy of PAPP-A inhibition with a monoclonal antibody inhibitor (mAb-PA) in ovarian cancer (OC) platinum-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Methods PAPP-A expression was quantitated in platinum-resistant PDX models by ELISA. A subset with High (n = 5) and Low (n = 2) expression were revived in female SCID/beige mice for studies with either saline, carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP) + mAb-PA, or CP + IgG2a. The primary endpoint was tumor area by ultrasound on day 28 relative to baseline. Conversion to platinum-sensitive was defined by average tumor regression below baseline. Statistical analyses included linear mixed effects modeling and Kaplan Meier curves. Response to therapy was correlated with changes in the ratio of phosphorylated/total AKT and ERK 1/2 using Wes analysis. Results The addition of mAb-PA to CP induced tumor regression below baseline in one High PAPP-A PDX model; another three models exhibited notable growth inhibition relative to CP + IgG2a. None of the Low PAPP-A PDX models regressed below baseline. The PDX model with the greatest magnitude of tumor regression from baseline after combination therapy was maintained on single agent mAb-PA or IgG2a, but no benefit was observed. Decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 correlated with conversion to platinum-sensitive. Conclusions The addition of mAb-PA to CP overcame platinum-resistance in one of five High PAPP-A PDX models; three other models demonstrated improved platinum-response. This supports further clinical development of this novel therapeutic."

https://openalex.org/W2990875833,"Background The relationship between maternal weight change between pregnancies and premature birth is unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether interpregnancy weight change between first and second, or second and third pregnancy is associated with premature birth. Methods Routinely collected data from 2003 to 2018 from one English maternity centre was used to produce two cohorts. The primary cohort (n = 14,961 women) consisted of first and second live-birth pregnancies. The secondary cohort (n = 5,108 women) consisted of second and third live-birth pregnancies. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between interpregnancy BMI change and premature births adjusted for confounders. Subgroup analyses were carried out, stratifying by initial pregnancy BMI groups and analysing spontaneous and indicated premature births separately. Results In the primary cohort, 3.4% (n = 514) of births were premature compared to 4.2% (n = 212) in the secondary cohort, with fewer indicated than spontaneous premature births in both cohorts. Primary cohort Weight loss (>3kg/m2) was associated with increased odds of premature birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR):3.50, 95% CI: 1.78–6.88), and spontaneous premature birth (aOR: 3.34, 95%CI: 1.60–6.98), in women who were normal weight (BMI 18.5-25kg/m2) at first pregnancy. Weight gain >1kg/m2 was not associated with premature birth regardless of starting BMI. Secondary cohort Losing >3kg/m2 was associated with increased odds of premature birth (aOR: 2.01, 95%CI: 1.05–3.87), when analysing the whole sample, but not when restricting the analysis to women who were overweight or obese at second pregnancy. Conclusions Normal-weight women who lose significant weight (>3kg/m2) between their first and second live pregnancies have greater odds of premature birth compared to normal-weight women who remain weight stable in the interpregnancy period. There was no evidence of association between weight change in women who were overweight or obese at the start of their first pregnancy and premature birth."
https://openalex.org/W2989663789,"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to be a highly burdensome disease worldwide. The often-asymptomatic nature of early-stage CHC means that the disease often remains undiagnosed, leaving its prevalence highly uncertain. This generates significant uncertainty in the planning of hepatitis C eradication programs to meet WHO targets. The aim of this work is to establish a mathematical framework for the estimation of a geographic locale’s CHC prevalence and the proportion of its CHC population that remains undiagnosed. A Bayesian MCMC approach is taken to infer these populations from the observed occurrence of CHC-related events using a recently published natural history model of the disease. Using the Canadian context as a specific example, this study estimates that in 2013, the CHC prevalence rate in Canada was 0.63% (95% CI: 0.53% - 0.72%), with 27.1% (95% CI: 19.3% - 36.1%) of the infected population undiagnosed."

It is a feasible instrument to assess IBD in PC, but has not yet been evaluated in clinical routine. This study, therefore, aimed to validate whether the CalproQuest increases pretest-probability for a positive fecal Calprotectin.Prospective diagnostic trial. The CalproQuest consists of 4 major and 4 minor questions suggestive for IBD. It is considered positive if ≥ 2 major or 1 major and 2 minor criteria are positive. Primary outcome: Sensitivity and specificity of the CalproQuest for Calprotectin levels ≥ 50 μg/g and for positive IBD diagnosis among patients referred to endoscopic evaluation at secondary care level. Secondary finding: Patient-reported diagnostic delay.156 patients from 7 study centers had a complete CalproQuest and fecal Calprotectin test. The sensitivity and specificity of CalproQuest for Calprotectin ≥ 50 μg/g was 36% and 57%. The sensitivity and specificity of the CalproQuest for positive IBD diagnosis was 37% and 67%. The diagnostic delay was 61 months (SD 125.2).In this prospective diagnostic study, the sensitivity and specificity of CalproQuest for Calprotectin levels ≥ 50 μg/g and positive IBD diagnosis were poor.

https://openalex.org/W2990807296,"Normalization for body size is required for reliable left ventricular mass (LVM) evaluation, especially in children due to the large variability of body size. In clinical practice, the allometrically adjusted ratio of LVM to height raised to the power of 2.7 is often used. However, studies presenting normative LVM data for children recommend centile curves as optimal for the development of normative data. This study aimed to assess whether the allometrically adjusted LVM-to-height ratio can reliably reproduce the results of LVM normalization for height based on the centile curves method.Left ventricular mass was computed for 464 boys and 327 girls, 5-18 years old, based on echocardiographic examination. Normalized data representing LVM for height were developed using the centile curves construction method and two variants of the allometrically adjusted ratio method: one variant with the allometric exponents specific to the study groups, and one variant with the universal exponent of 2.7. The agreement between the allometric methods and the centile curves method was analyzed using the concordance correlation coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity.For both the specific allometric variant and the universal variant, the analysis of concordance has indicated high reproducibility compared to the centile curves method. The respective coefficient values were 0.9917 and 0.9916 for girls, and 0.9886 and 0.9869 for boys. The sensitivity and specificity test has also shown high agreement. However, for girls, the sensitivity was higher for the specific variant (100% vs. 90.9%).The results of the study show that allometric scaling of LVM for height can very reliably reproduce the results of LVM normalization for height based on the centile curves method. However, the analysis of sensitivity and specificity indicates greater agreement for the allometric normalization with the group-specific allometric exponents."

It is the causative agent of nasopharyngeal aspirate disease and death in children. The HboV genomic structure is a linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Its clinical pathogenic characteristics have been extensively studied, however, at present the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HBoV infection is not completely clear. In this study, a total of 293 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between ARTI cases and healthy plasma samples were characterized using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled bioinformatics analysis, among which 148 were up-regulated and 135 were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) annotated an enrichment of DEPs in complement activation and biological processes like immunity, inflammation, signal transduction, substance synthesis, and metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis enriched DEPs mainly in the Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310), PPAR signaling pathway (ko03320), intestinal immune network for IgA production (ko04672), complement and coagulation cascades (ko04610), Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04620) and B cell receptor signaling pathway (ko04662). Further, expression levels of three candidate proteins (upregulated PPP2R1A and CUL1, and downregulated CETP) were validated using western blotting. Our investigation is the first analysis of the proteomic profile of HBoV-infected ARTI cases using the iTRAQ approach, providing a foundation for a better molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of ARTI in children."
https://openalex.org/W2991257963,"A quasi-experimental field study was undertaken to examine whether the source credibility of point-of-decision (POD) prompts would affect their effectiveness in increasing stair use. POD prompts attributed either to a more credible source, a less credible source, or nothing were randomly installed in three student halls of residence at a public university in Hong Kong (plus a control). The stair and elevator use of residents were recorded by view-from-top surveillance cameras and counted using motion-detection software, resulting in 14,189 observations. The findings show that all the POD prompts can yield, as hypothesized, a significant positive effect on stair use. The relative increase in stair use was 2.49% on average. However, contrary to our second hypothesis, the POD prompt attributed to the more credible source was not the most effective intervention. The implications of these findings are discussed in conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2991389130,"Psychological effects connected with fluent processing are called fluency effects. In a sample of 403 participants we test whether conceptual fluency effects can be found in the context of inductive reasoning, a context that has not been investigated before. As a conceptual manipulation we vary the use of symbols (persons and crosses) in reasoning tasks. These symbols were chosen to provide hints for the solution of the implemented tasks and thus manipulate fluency. We found evidence that these hints influence ease of processing. The proportion of solved tasks increased by 11% on average in the condition with conceptual hints, F(1,399) = 13.47, partial η2 = .033, p < .001. However, we did not find an effect of the conceptual manipulation on the temporal perception of the task. In a second study (n = 62) we strengthened our findings by investigating solution strategies for the tasks in more detail, 79% of the participants described the tasks in a way they were intended. Our results illustrate the advantages of the separation of ease of processing, fluency experience, and judgments."
https://openalex.org/W2991477923,"Current research on preschool-age psychopathology suggests specific impairments in the two domains of social competence–prosocial behavior and social initiative–in children with externalizing and internalizing symptoms. While behavioral observation methods have been largely neglected in the past, they may extend the predominating questionnaire-based assessment as they allow for a precise and objective assessment of children’s social behavior. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether prosocial behavior and social initiative measured in a limited resource task are related to externalizing and internalizing symptoms in a preschool-age community sample (N = 117, M = 4.67 years, SD = 2.75 months, females = 57). Externalizing and internalizing symptoms were rated by teachers (n = 109) and parents (n = 77) using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and by children using the Berkeley Puppet Interview (n = 97). Reduced prosocial actions were related to children’s higher ratings of externalizing symptoms, while reduced social initiative actions were related to parents’ higher ratings of internalizing symptoms. Prosocial behavior in the behavioral task was a marginally significant positive predictor of internalizing symptoms from children’s perspective. These results highlight the value of behavioral observation measures and contribute to our understanding of interpersonal deficits already related to psychopathology at preschool age."
https://openalex.org/W2990820832,"Energy consuming, heat-producing beige adipocytes, located in classic white adipose tissue (WAT), hold promise for the treatment of obesity. Few reports have quantitatively assessed the contribution of browned 'WAT' to energy expenditure. There is a need for methods to examine beige-fat thermogenesis, independently of classical brown fat. The aim of this study is to optimize an inducible lentiviral shRNA to conditionally knock-down Ucp1 and assess the effects on 'browned' WAT. Primary adipocytes from mouse inguinal WAT converted into thermogenic adipocytes when stimulated with β-adrenergic agonist and thiazolidinedione. There was increased UCP1 protein and importantly increases in various indicators of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Next, we determined optimal transfection conditions for the UCP1-shRNA lentiviral system and subsequently applied this to 'browned' WAT. UCP1 knockdown decreased the brown/beige-fat gene profile and decreased mitochondrial respiration. In summary, this study optimizes lentiviral UCP1-shRNA technology in vitro. This technique could be applied to inguinal fat depots in vivo. This would allow investigation of contribution of depots to whole-body metabolism to help elucidate the physiological relevance of beige fat."
https://openalex.org/W2989829414,"The weekly NO-DO newsreels, official and of obligatory projection in cinemas, held an information monopoly during the Francoist dictatorship (1943-1975) in Spain. The NO-DO was used as an instrument of indoctrination and legitimation, building a discourse based on the regime's needs and interests. In this study, we examined newsreels on medical subjects related to vaccine-preventable diseases. A majority of reports centred on poliomyelitis, and two differentiated periods could be defined, coinciding with the evolution of the Franco regime's foreign policy. The first period reflected the regime's era of isolation and referred to polio as a foreign disease, with the NO-DO showing the US initiatives to fight against it, as it had become the scientific model to follow. Subsequently, the ambiguities of the news related to the disease reflected the dictatorship's refusal to confront the epidemic suffered by the Spanish population until the vaccination campaigns began in 1963. Even then, the consequences that the negligent management of the disease had for many families were concealed. Meanwhile, the image of a modernized country concerned about national public health was legitimized."
