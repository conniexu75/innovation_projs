https://openalex.org/W2547418311,"The β-haemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassaemia, are caused by mutations in the β-globin (HBB) gene and affect millions of people worldwide. Ex vivo gene correction in patient-derived haematopoietic stem cells followed by autologous transplantation could be used to cure β-haemoglobinopathies. Here we present a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system that combines Cas9 ribonucleoproteins and adeno-associated viral vector delivery of a homologous donor to achieve homologous recombination at the HBB gene in haematopoietic stem cells. Notably, we devise an enrichment model to purify a population of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with more than 90% targeted integration. We also show efficient correction of the Glu6Val mutation responsible for sickle cell disease by using patient-derived stem and progenitor cells that, after differentiation into erythrocytes, express adult β-globin (HbA) messenger RNA, which confirms intact transcriptional regulation of edited HBB alleles. Collectively, these preclinical studies outline a CRISPR-based methodology for targeting haematopoietic stem cells by homologous recombination at the HBB locus to advance the development of next-generation therapies for β-haemoglobinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2555180552,"Functional analysis of a clinical microbiome facilitates the elucidation of mechanisms by which microbiome perturbation can cause a phenotypic change in the patient. The direct approach for the analysis of the functional capacity of the microbiome is via shotgun metagenomics. An inexpensive method to estimate the functional capacity of a microbial community is through collecting 16S rRNA gene profiles then indirectly inferring the abundance of functional genes. This inference approach has been implemented in the PICRUSt and Tax4Fun software tools. However, those tools have important limitations since they rely on outdated functional databases and uncertain phylogenetic trees and require very specific data pre-processing protocols. Here we introduce Piphillin, a straightforward algorithm independent of any proposed phylogenetic tree, leveraging contemporary functional databases and not obliged to any singular data pre-processing protocol. When all three inference tools were evaluated against actual shotgun metagenomics, Piphillin was superior in predicting gene composition in human clinical samples compared to both PICRUSt and Tax4Fun (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) and Piphillin's ability to predict disease associations with specific gene orthologs exhibited a 15% increase in balanced accuracy compared to PICRUSt. From laboratory animal samples, no performance advantage was observed for any one of the tools over the others and for environmental samples all produced unsatisfactory predictions. Our results demonstrate that functional inference using the direct method implemented in Piphillin is preferable for clinical biospecimens. Piphillin is publicly available for academic use at http://secondgenome.com/Piphillin."
https://openalex.org/W2548414910,"Professional phagocytes (such as macrophages) and non-professional phagocytes (such as epithelial cells) clear billions of apoptotic cells and particles on a daily basis. Although professional and non-professional macrophages reside in proximity in most tissues, whether they communicate with each other during cell clearance, and how this might affect inflammation, is not known. Here we show that macrophages, through the release of a soluble growth factor and microvesicles, alter the type of particles engulfed by non-professional phagocytes and influence their inflammatory response. During phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or in response to inflammation-associated cytokines, macrophages released insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The binding of IGF-1 to its receptor on non-professional phagocytes redirected their phagocytosis, such that uptake of larger apoptotic cells was reduced whereas engulfment of microvesicles was increased. IGF-1 did not alter engulfment by macrophages. Macrophages also released microvesicles, whose uptake by epithelial cells was enhanced by IGF-1 and led to decreased inflammatory responses by epithelial cells. Consistent with these observations, deletion of IGF-1 receptor in airway epithelial cells led to exacerbated lung inflammation after allergen exposure. These genetic and functional studies reveal that IGF-1- and microvesicle-dependent communication between macrophages and epithelial cells can critically influence the magnitude of tissue inflammation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2557217611,"Tendon is a mechanical tissue that transmits forces generated by muscle to bone in order to allow body motion. The molecular pathways that sense mechanical forces during tendon formation, homeostasis and repair are not known. EGR1 is a mechanosensitive transcription factor involved in tendon formation, homeostasis and repair. We hypothesized that EGR1 senses mechanical signals to promote tendon gene expression.Using in vitro and in vivo models, we show that the expression of Egr1 and tendon genes is downregulated in 3D-engineered tendons made of mesenchymal stem cells when tension is released as well as in tendon homeostasis and healing when mechanical signals are reduced. We further demonstrate that EGR1 overexpression prevents tendon gene downregulation in 3D-engineered tendons when tension is released. Lastly, ultrasound and microbubbles mediated EGR1 overexpression prevents the downregulation of tendon gene expression during tendon healing in reduced load conditions.These results show that Egr1 expression is sensitive to mechanical signals in tendon cells. Moreover, EGR1 overexpression prevents the downregulation of tendon gene expression in the absence of mechanical signals in 3D-engineered tendons and tendon healing. These results show that EGR1 induces a transcriptional response downstream of mechanical signals in tendon cells and open new avenues to use EGR1 to promote tendon healing in reduced load conditions."

Methods PolymP-nActive nanoparticles were zinc or calcium loaded. Biomimetic calcium phosphate precipitation on polymeric particles was assessed after 7 days immersion in simulated body fluid, by scanning electron microscopy attached to an energy dispersive analysis system. Amorphous mineral deposition was probed by X-ray diffraction. Cell viability analysis was performed using oral mucosa fibroblasts by: 1) quantifying the liberated deoxyribonucleic acid from dead cells, 2) detecting the amount of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme released by cells with damaged membranes, and 3) by examining the cytoplasmic esterase function and cell membranes integrity with a fluorescence-based method using the Live/Dead commercial kit. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results Precipitation of calcium and phosphate on the nanoparticles surfaces was observed in calcium-loaded nanoparticles. Non-loaded nanoparticles were found to be non-toxic in all the assays, calcium and zinc-loaded particles presented a dose dependent but very low cytotoxic effect. Conclusions The ability of calcium-loaded nanoparticles to promote precipitation of calcium phosphate deposits, together with their observed non-toxicity may offer new strategies for periodontal disease treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2557013195,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen in humans and causes serious problems due to antibiotic resistance. We investigated the antimicrobial effect of glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) and its derivatives against 50 clinical S. aureus strains, including 18 methicillin-resistant strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GRA, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, disodium succinoyl glycyrrhetinate (GR-SU), stearyl glycyrrhetinate and glycyrrhetinyl stearate were evaluated against various S. aureus strains. Additionally, we investigated the bactericidal effects of GRA and GR-SU against two specific S. aureus strains. DNA microarray analysis was also performed to clarify the mechanism underlying the antibacterial activity of GR-SU. We detected the antimicrobial activities of five agents against S. aureus strains. GRA and GR-SU showed strong antibacterial activities compared to the other three agents tested. At a higher concentration (above 2x MIC), GRA and GR-SU showed bactericidal activity, whereas at a concentration of 1x MIC, they showed a bacteriostatic effect. Additionally, GRA and GR-SU exhibited a synergistic effect with gentamicin. The expression of a large number of genes (including transporters) and metabolic factors (carbohydrates and amino acids) was altered by the addition of GR-SU, suggesting that the inhibition of these metabolic processes may influence the degree of the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids. In fact, the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids was increased in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU. GRA and GR-SU exhibited strong antibacterial activity against several S. aureus strains, including MRSA. This activity may be partly due to the inhibition of several pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2551840051,"Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) is a diluent monomer used pervasively in dental composite resins. Through hydrolytic degradation of the composites in the oral cavity it yields a hydrophilic biodegradation product, triethylene glycol (TEG), which has been shown to promote the growth of Streptococcus mutans, a dominant cariogenic bacterium. Previously it was shown that TEG up-regulated gtfB, an important gene contributing to polysaccharide synthesis function in biofilms. However, molecular mechanisms related to TEG's effect on bacterial function remained poorly understood. In the present study, S. mutans UA159 was incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of TEG at pH 5.5 and 7.0. Quantitative real-time PCR, proteomics analysis, and glucosyltransferase enzyme (GTF) activity measurements were employed to identify the bacterial phenotypic response to TEG. A S. mutans vicK isogenic mutant (SMΔvicK1) and its associated complemented strain (SMΔvicK1C), an important regulatory gene for biofilm-associated genes, were used to determine if this signaling pathway was involved in modulation of the S. mutans virulence-associated genes. Extracted proteins from S. mutans biofilms grown in the presence and absence of TEG were subjected to mass spectrometry for protein identification, characterization and quantification. TEG up-regulated gtfB/C, gbpB, comC, comD and comE more significantly in biofilms at cariogenic pH (5.5) and defined concentrations. Differential response of the vicK knock-out (SMΔvicK1) and complemented strains (SMΔvicK1C) implicated this signalling pathway in TEG-modulated cellular responses. TEG resulted in increased GTF enzyme activity, responsible for synthesizing insoluble glucans involved in the formation of cariogenic biofilms. As well, TEG increased protein abundance related to biofilm formation, carbohydrate transport, acid tolerance, and stress-response. Proteomics data was consistent with gene expression findings for the selected genes. These findings demonstrate a mechanistic pathway by which TEG derived from commercial resin materials in the oral cavity promote S. mutans pathogenicity, which is typically associated with secondary caries."

https://openalex.org/W2554497406,"4T1 metastatic breast cancer model have been widely used to study stage IV human breast cancer. However, the frequent inoculation of a large number of cells, gives rise to fast growing tumors, as well as to a surprisingly low metastatic take rate. The present work aimed at establishing the conditions enabling high metastatic take rate of the triple-negative murine 4T1 syngeneic breast cancer model. An 87% 4T1 tumor incidence was observed when as few as 500 cancer cells were implanted. 4T1 cancer cells colonized primarily the lungs with 100% efficiency, and distant lesions were also commonly identified in the mesentery and pancreas. The drastic reduction of the number of inoculated cells resulted in increased tumor doubling times and decreased specific growth rates, following a Gompertzian tumor expansion. The established conditions for the 4T1 mouse model were further validated in a therapeutic study with peguilated liposomal doxorubicin, in clinical used in the setting of metastatic breast cancer. Inoculated cell density was proven to be a key methodological aspect towards the reproducible development of macrometastases in the 4T1 mouse model and a more reliable pre-clinical assessment of antimetastatic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2555699546,"SMA is characterised by progressive motor and respiratory muscle weakness. We aimed to verify if in SMA children 1)each form is characterized by specific ventilatory and thoraco-abdominal pattern(VTAp) during quiet breathing(QB); 2)VTAp is affected by salbutamol therapy, currently suggested as standard treatment, or by the natural history(NH) of SMA; 3)the severity of global motor impairment linearly correlates with VTAp.VTAp was analysed on 32 SMA type I (SMA1,the most severe form), 51 type II (SMA2,the moderate), 8 type III (SMA3,the mildest) and 20 healthy (HC) using opto-electronic plethysmography. Spirometry, cough and motor function were measured in a subgroup of patients.In SMA1, a normal ventilation is obtained in supine position by rapid and shallow breathing with paradoxical ribcage motion. In SMA2, ventilation is within a normal range in seated position due to an increased respiratory rate(p<0.05) with reduced tidal volume(p<0.05) secondary to a poor contribution of pulmonary ribcage(%ΔVRC,P, p<0.001). Salbutamol therapy had no effect on VTAp during QB(p>0.05) while tachypnea occurred in type I NH. A linear correlation(p<0.001) was found between motor function scales and VTAp.A negative or reduced %ΔVRC,P, indicative of ribcage muscle weakness, is a distinctive feature of SMA1 and SMA2 since infancy. Its quantitative assessment represents a non-invasive, non-volitional index that can be obtained in all children, even uncollaborative, and provides useful information on the action of ribcage muscles that are known to be affected by the disease.Low values of motor function scales indicate impairment of motor but also of respiratory function."
https://openalex.org/W2551700726,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor system and cognitive and behavioral functions. Due to these impairments, PD patients also have problems in using the computer. However, using computers and the Internet could help these patients to overcome social isolation and enhance information search. Specifically, avatars (defined as virtual representations of humans) are increasingly used in online environments to enhance human-computer interaction by simulating face-to-face interaction. Our laboratory experiment investigated how PD patients behave in a trust game played with human and avatar counterparts, and we compared this behavior to the behavior of age, income, education and gender matched healthy controls. The results of our study show that PD patients trust avatar faces significantly more than human faces. Moreover, there was no significant difference between initial trust of PD patients and healthy controls in avatar faces, while PD patients trusted human faces significantly less than healthy controls. Our data suggests that PD patients’ interaction with avatars may constitute an effective way of communication in situations in which trust is required (e.g., a physician recommends intake of medication). We discuss the implications of these results for several areas of human-computer interaction and neurological research."
https://openalex.org/W2557085828,"The precise mechanism underlying the conversion of normal prion protein (PrPC) into abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) remains unclear. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), an in vitro technique used for amplifying PrPSc, results in PrPSc replication that preserves the strain-specific characteristics of the input PrPSc; thus, PMCA mimics the process of in vivo PrPSc replication. Previous work has demonstrated that in PMCA, nucleic acids are critical for PrPSc amplification, but little information has been reported on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) participation in PrPSc replication in vitro. Here, we investigated whether GAGs play a role in the faithful replication of PrPSc by using a modified PMCA performed with baculovirus-derived recombinant PrP (Bac-PrP) as a substrate. The addition of heparan sulfate (HS) or its analog heparin (HP) restored the conversion efficiency in PMCA that was inhibited through nucleic acid depletion. Moreover, the PMCA products obtained under these conditions were infectious and preserved the properties of the input PrPSc. These data suggest that HS and HP play the same role as nucleic acids in facilitating faithful replication of prions in PMCA. Furthermore, we showed that HP binds to both Bac-PrP and Bac-PrPSc through the sulfated groups present on HP and that the N-terminal domain of Bac-PrPSc might potentially not be involved in the binding to HP. These results suggest that the interaction of GAGs such as HS and HP with PrPC and/or PrPSc through their sulfate groups is critical for the faithful replication of prions."

https://openalex.org/W2556112725,"Neurons innervating the airways contribute to airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a hallmark feature of asthma. Several observations suggested that acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), neuronal cation channels activated by protons, might contribute to AHR. For example, ASICs are found in vagal sensory neurons that innervate airways, and asthmatic airways can become acidic. Moreover, airway acidification activates ASIC currents and depolarizes neurons innervating airways. We found ASIC1a protein in vagal ganglia neurons, but not airway epithelium or smooth muscle. We induced AHR by sensitizing mice to ovalbumin and found that ASIC1a-/- mice failed to exhibit AHR despite a robust inflammatory response. Loss of ASIC1a also decreased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of substance P, a sensory neuropeptide secreted from vagal sensory neurons that contributes to AHR. These findings suggest that ASIC1a is an important mediator of AHR and raise the possibility that inhibiting ASIC channels might be beneficial in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2552386391,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) are in close contact with blood vessels. SMC phenotypes can be altered during pathological vascular remodeling. However, how SMC phenotypes affect EC properties remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that PDGF-BB-induced synthetic SMCs suppressed EC proliferation and migration while exhibiting increased expression of anti-angiogenic factors, such as endostatin, and decreased pro-angiogenic factors, including CXC motif ligand 1 (CXCL1). Cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a CTP synthase inhibitor that has been reported previously to inhibit SMC proliferation and injury-induced neointima formation, induced SMC redifferentiation. Interestingly, CPEC-conditioned SMC culture medium promoted EC proliferation and migration because of an increase in CXCL1 along with decreased endostatin production in SMCs. Addition of recombinant endostatin protein or blockade of CXCL1 with a neutralizing antibody suppressed the EC proliferation and migration induced by CPEC-conditioned SMC medium. Mechanistically, CPEC functions as a cytosine derivate to stimulate adenosine receptors A1 and A2a, which further activate downstream cAMP and Akt signaling, leading to the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein and, consequently, SMC redifferentiation. These data provided proof of a novel concept that synthetic SMC exhibits an anti-angiogenic SMC phenotype, whereas contractile SMC shows a pro-angiogenic phenotype. CPEC appears to be a potent stimulator for switching the anti-angiogenic SMC phenotype to the pro-angiogenic phenotype, which may be essential for CPEC to accelerate re-endothelialization for vascular repair during injury-induced vascular wall remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2552813273,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of supplementation with the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve M-16V on the maturation of the intestinal and circulating immune system during suckling. In order to achieve this purpose, neonatal Lewis rats were supplemented with the probiotic strain from the 6th to the 18th day of life. The animals were weighed during the study, and faecal samples were obtained and evaluated daily. On day 19, rats were euthanized and intestinal wash samples, mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells, splenocytes and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were obtained. The probiotic supplementation in early life did not modify the growth curve and did not enhance the systemic immune maturation. However, it increased the proportion of cells bearing TLR4 in the MLN and IEL, and enhanced the percentage of the integrin αEβ7+ and CD62L+ cells in the MLN and that of the integrin αEβ7+ cells in the IEL, suggesting an enhancement of the homing process of naïve T lymphocytes to the MLN, and the retention of activated lymphocytes in the intraepithelial compartment. Interestingly, B. breve M-16V enhanced the intestinal IgA synthesis. In conclusion, supplementation with the probiotic strain B. breve M-16V during suckling improves the development of mucosal immunity in early life."

https://openalex.org/W2549558270,"Mediator plays an integral role in activation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. A key step in activation is binding of Mediator to Pol II to form the Mediator-Pol II holoenzyme. Here, we exploit a combination of biochemistry and macromolecular EM to investigate holoenzyme assembly. We identify a subset of human Mediator head module subunits that bind Pol II independent of other subunits and thus probably contribute to a major Pol II binding site. In addition, we show that binding of human Mediator to Pol II depends on the integrity of a conserved in the middle module MED21-MED7 heterodimer. Point mutations in the hinge region leave core Mediator intact but lead to increased disorder of the middle module and markedly reduced affinity for Pol II. These findings highlight the importance of Mediator conformation for holoenzyme assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2551072283,"Huntington´s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease resulting from an expanded polyglutamine sequence (poly-Q) in the protein huntingtin (HTT). Various studies report atrophy and metabolic pathology of skeletal muscle in HD and suggest as part of the process a fast-to-slow fiber type transition that may be caused by the pathological changes in central motor control or/and by mutant HTT in the muscle tissue itself. To investigate muscle pathology in HD, we used R6/2 mice, a common animal model for a rapidly progressing variant of the disease expressing exon 1 of the mutant human gene. We investigated alterations in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), a typical fast-twitch muscle, and the soleus (SOL), a slow-twitch muscle. We focussed on mechanographic measurements of excised muscles using single and repetitive electrical stimulation and on the expression of the various myosin isoforms (heavy and light chains) using dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole muscle and single fiber preparations. In EDL of R6/2, the functional tests showed a left shift of the force-frequency relation and decrease in specific force. Moreover, the estimated relative contribution of the fastest myosin isoform MyHC IIb decreased, whereas the contribution of the slower MyHC IIx isoform increased. An additional change occurred in the alkali MyLC forms showing a decrease in 3f and an increase in 1f level. In SOL, a shift from fast MyHC IIa to the slow isoform I was detectable in male R6/2 mice only, and there was no evidence of isoform interconversion in the MyLC pattern. These alterations point to a partial remodeling of the contractile apparatus of R6/2 mice towards a slower contractile phenotype, predominantly in fast glycolytic fibers."

To identify anesthetic binding sites in an extrasynaptic GABAAR, we photolabeled human α4β3δ GABAARs purified in detergent with [3H]azietomidate and a barbiturate, [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB, photoreactive anesthetics that bind with high selectivity to distinct but homologous intersubunit binding sites in the transmembrane domain of synaptic α1β3γ2 GABAARs.

GABAARs, which are the target of many drugs, among them benzodiazepines and general anesthetics, are heteropentamers, and drug action often depends on the subunit composition. For example, at synaptic receptors, which commonly have a subunit composition of (α)2(β)2γ, arranged βαβαγ counterclockwise when viewed from the synaptic or extracellular side of the receptor, benzodiazepines act in the extracellular domain between α+-γ− subunits at a site homologous to the GABA binding sites at the two β+-α− subunit interfaces (Fig. 1) (1.Sigel E.

Whereas etomidate and R-mTFD-MPAB bind with high selectivity to their sites, propofol, pentobarbital, and other barbiturates bind with much less selectivity to these two classes of sites. The in vivo mechanism of action of etomidate has been firmly linked to the GABAAR. Heterologously expressed GABAARs that have an N256M mutation on the M2 helix of the β3 subunit (β+ surface of the interface) are relatively insensitive to etomidate (12.Belelli D. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Wafford K. Whiting P.J. The interaction of the general anesthetic etomidate with the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor is influenced by a single amino acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11031-11036Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and sleep times in knock-in mice bearing the same mutation are much shorter than in wild-type mice (13.Jurd R. Arras M.

General anesthetic actions in vivo strongly attenuated by a point mutation in the GABAA receptor β3 subunit.FASEB J. 2003; 17: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Azietomidate causes normal anesthesia in wild-type mice with the same potency as etomidate, and its action is similarly attenuated in the knock-in mouse (14.Liao M. Sonner J.M. Husain S.S. Miller K.W. Jurd R. Rudolph U. Eger 2nd, E.I. R(+) etomidate and the photoactivable R(+) azietomidate have comparable anesthetic activity in wild-type mice and comparably decreased activity in mice with a N265M point mutation in the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor β3 subunit.Anesth. Analg. 2005; 101 (table of contents): 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). R-mTFD-MPAB also causes general anesthesia in mice and is equally potent in wild-type and N256M knock-in mice (15.Amlong C.A. Perkins M.G. Houle T.T. Miller K.W. Pearce R.A.

Analg. 2016; 123: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), consistent with the location of its binding sites at the β− subunit interfaces. The contrasting subunit-selective actions of these two agents raise questions about the mechanism of general anesthesia itself, because there are 19 known GABA subunits, and which of the possible combinations occur in vivo is not yet fully defined. The state of anesthesia involves many behavioral components (16.Patel P.M. Patel H.H. Roth D. General anesthetics and therapeutic gases.in: Brunton L. Chabner B. Knollman B. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Experimental Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York2011: 527-564Google Scholar), so subunit-selective general anesthetics might be associated with specific subsets of the behavioral impairments experienced during anesthesia (17.Drexler B.

Anaesth. 2011; 58: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are the relative contributions of phasic (synaptic) and tonic (extrasynaptic) inhibition actions (18.Farrant M. Nusser Z.

In this work, we photolabeled detergent-solubilized, purified heterologous α4β3δ GABAARs with [3H]azietomidate and [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB. Two distinct high affinity anesthetic sites were identified: 1) [3H]azietomidate photolabeling established that azietomidate and etomidate bind to a β3+-α4− interface site that does not bind R-mTFD-MPAB with high affinity; and 2) [3H]azietomidate and [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB share a common binding site with etomidate at a β3− subunit interface.

In contrast to α1β3γ2 GABAARs, which bound [3H]muscimol with similar affinity in membrane-bound (Keq = 50 nm) and purified (Keq = 80 nm) states (33.Dostalova Z. Zhou X. Liu A. Zhang X. Zhang Y.

When extracted materials from in-gel tryptic digests of these bands were characterized by LC/MS/MS (Table 2), fragments of the GABAAR α4 subunit were most enriched in the 72 kDa band, consistent with the expected mobility of the mature subunit (58 kDa + 3 N-linked glycosylations). Fragments from the β3 subunit were concentrated in the 62 and 58 kDa bands, as found for β3 subunit from expressed α1β3γ2 GABAARs (11.Chiara D.C. Jayakar S.S. Zhou X. Zhang X. Savechenkov P.Y.

Fragments from the δ subunit were broadly distributed in the 62, 58, and 54 kDa bands, with α4 subunit fragments also recovered from the 54 kDa band. However, in contrast to the recovery of α4 subunit fragments from the 72 kDa gel band, for the 54 kDa band, no fragments were recovered from the α4 cytoplasmic domain beginning about 30 amino acids after the end of the M3 helix (data not shown). This result suggests that the 54 kDa band contains an N-terminal fragment of the α4 subunit containing the M1–M3 helices that was probably produced by proteolytic cleavage during receptor purification. The major component in the 78 kDa band was identified as the chaperone heat shock 70-kDa protein 1A (HSP70-1).TABLE 2LC/MS/MS identification of major peptides in α4β3δ GABAAR SDS-polyacrylamide gel bandsGel bandProtein (gene name)Peptides detectedMS/MS scansAverage intensityCoverage%78 kDaHSPA1A689111,450,00070PRMT540166597,00048GABRA427127393,00046LMNB12965253,0004872 kDaGABRA4571,005756,00055GABRD1560209,00029IGF2BP11742173,00031ABCD31736118,0002362 kDaGABRD29487924,00038GABRB333282723,00041GABRA432127500,00045TUBA1A24118336,0004658 kDaGABRB3353041,970,00040GABRD274211,400,00039TUBA1A34272956,00061GABRA428115712,00042TUBB2A47476655,0005954 kDaGABRA4261401,180,00041GABRD25393892,00040GABRB31552639,00030DDX471331176,00035 Open table in a new tab When material eluted from the 72 kDa band was characterized by Edman degradation, the primary sequence identified (XXLNXXPGQNQXXXXL …) matched a region near the predicted N terminus of the human α4 GABAAR subunit (VCLNESPGQNQKEEKL …). Multiple amino acids were detected at similar levels at each cycle of Edman degradation of the 62- and 58-kDa samples, which precluded de novo identification of the subunits present. Sequence analysis of material from the 54 kDa band identified a primary sequence (XNDIXXYKXD …) matching the N terminus region of the FLAG-tagged human δ GABAAR subunit sequence (MNDIGDYKDDDDK …, with the underline denoting the FLAG peptide sequence). The N termini of the α4 and δ subunits identified by Edman degradation are those predicted to be the N termini of the mature subunits by the signal sequence cleavage site prediction program P-signal (34.Petersen T.N. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 785-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (7117) Google Scholar). No N-terminal sequence was detected from the 78-kDa material, consistent with the fact that the N-terminal alanine of 70-kDa heat shock protein is acetylated (35.Gauci S. Helbig A.O. Slijper M. Krijgsveld J. Heck A.J.R. Mohammed S. Lys-N and trypsin cover complementary parts of the phosphoproteome in a refined SCX-based approach.Anal.

When 3H incorporation was determined by fluorography after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lanes 2–7), 3H incorporation was highest in the 58/62 kDa gel region for both photoreactive anesthetics. The 72 kDa band (α4) was labeled prominently only by [3H]azietomidate, and that photolabeling was inhibitable by etomidate but not by R-mTFD-MPAB. [3H]Azietomidate photolabeling in the 54/58/62 kDa gel bands was inhibited to a greater extent by etomidate than by R-mTFD-MPAB, and, conversely, [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB photolabeling of 58/62 kDa gel bands was inhibited to a greater extent by R-mTFD-MPAB than by etomidate. These findings suggested that 1) there is an etomidate/azietomidate binding site associated with the α4 subunit that does not bind R-mTFD-MPAB with high affinity; 2) azietomidate, etomidate, and R-mTFD-MPAB share a common binding site associated with the 58/62 kDa gel band; and 3) there may be an R-mTFD-MPAB binding site associated with the 58/62 kDa gel band that does not bind etomidate. To further characterize the pharmacological specificity of [3H]azietomidate and [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB incorporation at the subunit level, photolabelings were performed on an analytical scale in the presence of various concentrations of etomidate, R-mTFD-MPAB, the neuroactive steroid alphaxalone, or DS2, with 3H incorporation into the gel bands quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Fig. 3). Etomidate inhibited [3H]azietomidate photoincorporation into the 72 kDa (α4) and 58/62 kDa bands with IC50 values of ∼15 μm, with high concentrations producing maximal inhibition of subunit photolabeling by 80 and 60%, respectively. Etomidate also inhibited [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB photolabeling in the 58/62 kDa bands with similar potency. R-mTFD-MPAB inhibited [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB photolabeling in the 58/62 kDa bands with an IC50 of 2 μm and a maximal inhibition of 75%. R-mTFD-MPAB also inhibited [3H]azietomidate photolabeling in the 58/62 kDa bands with similar potency, but it inhibited [3H]azietomidate labeling in the 72 kDa (α4) band only at the highest concentration tested (60 μm, ∼30% inhibition). As seen for [3H]azietomidate and [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB photolabeling of α1β3γ2 GABAARs (11.Chiara D.C. Jayakar S.S. Zhou X. Zhang X. Savechenkov P.Y. Bruzik K.S. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B. Specificity of intersubunit general anesthetic-binding sites in the transmembrane domain of the human α1β3γ2 γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 19343-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), in the absence of GABA, the neuroactive steroid alphaxalone at concentrations up to 30 μm potentiated photoincorporation into the GABAAR subunit bands, maximally by ∼50%. This result establishes that alphaxalone does not bind to the sites in the purified α4β3δ GABAAR photolabeled by [3H]azietomidate or [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB but that there is positive allosteric linkage between alphaxalone and azietomidate/R-mTFD-MPAB binding. At concentrations up to 30 μm, DS2 had little or no effect on photolabeling by [3H]azietomidate or [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB in the presence of GABA. To provide an initial characterization of the locations of photolabeled amino acids, we fractionated by reversed phase HPLC (rpHPLC) EndoLys-C digests of subunit bands isolated from α4β3δ GABAARs photolabeled with [3H]azietomidate or [3H]R-mTFD-MPAB (Fig. 4). For both photoreactive anesthetics, the digests of the 58/62 kDa band (β3 and δ subunits) contained peaks of 3H in hydrophobic fractions (∼55 and 70% organic solvent) where fragments beginning at the N termini of the βM3 and βM1 helices are known to elute (36.Jayakar S.S.

For the 72 kDa band (α4) labeled by [3H]azietomidate, the 3H eluted in two peaks, a broad hydrophobic peak (55% organic solvent), which for digests of α1 subunits contains fragments beginning at the N termini of the M1 and M3 helices, and a peak at 40% organic solvent, where fragments from the α1 subunit extracellular domain elute (36.Jayakar S.S.

For the 54 kDa band, for each drug, there were peaks of 3H at 40, 55, and 70% organic solvent, corresponding to the peaks seen in either of the higher molecular weight gel bands. Aliquots were sequenced of unfractionated EndoLys-C digests from the 72 and 58/62 kDa gel bands from GABAARs photolabeled with [3H]azietomidate in the absence and presence of non-radioactive etomidate (Fig. 5). For the 72 kDa band, there was a major peak of etomidate-inhibitable 3H release in cycle 14 (Fig. 5A). For the digest from the 58/62 kDa band (Fig. 5B), there were peaks of etomidate-inhibitable 3H release in cycles 7 and 12 (pharmacologically specific photolabeling) and peaks of 3H release in cycles 3 and 19 that were not inhibited by etomidate (nonspecific labeling). The 72 kDa gel band digest will contain all possible α4 subunit proteolytic fragments, including fragments beginning near the N termini of the M1–M4 helices. For the 58/62 kDa band, digests will include fragments beginning near the N termini of the M1, M3, and M4 helices of the β3 and δ subunits (Fig. 5C). However, the etomidate-inhibitable peak of 3H release in cycle 14 for the 72 kDa band digest occurs in the cycle predicted to contain α4Met-269, the residue homologous to α1Met-236 in the α1 subunit M1 helix that was photolabeled by [3H]azietomidate (8.Li G.-D.

Seven wax compound classes were detected that had previously not been reported, and their structures were elucidated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of various derivatives. Six of the classes were identified as series of homologs differing by two methylene units, while the seventh was a homologous series with homologs with single methylene unit differences. In the waxes of flag leaf blades, secondary alcohols (predominantly C27 and C33), primary/secondary diols (predominantly C28) and esters of primary/secondary diols (predominantly C50, combining C28 diol with C22 acid) were found, all sharing similar secondary hydroxyl group positions at and around C-12 or ω-12. 7- and 8-hydroxy-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), 7- and 8-oxo-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), and 4-alkylbutan-4-olides (predominantly C28) were found both in flag leaf and peduncle wax mixtures. Finally, a series of even- and odd-numbered alkane homologs was identified in both leaf and peduncle waxes, with an internal methyl branch preferentially on C-11 and C-13 of homologs with even total carbon number and on C-12 of odd-numbered homologs. Biosynthetic pathways are suggested for all compounds, based on common structural features and matching chain length profiles with other wheat wax compound classes."

However, to date, it is unknown whether these inhibitors have side effects on bone structures. Here, we report that inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins may suppress chondrocyte differentiation and restrain bone growth. We generated a luciferase reporter system using the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 in which the luciferase gene was driven by the promoter of Col2a1, an elementary collagen of the chondrocyte. The Col2a1-luciferase ATDC5 system was used for rapidly screening both activators and repressors of human collagen Col2a1 gene expression, and we found that BET bromodomain inhibitors reduce the Col2a1-luciferase. Consistent with the luciferase assay, BET inhibitors decrease the expression of Col2a1. Furthermore, we constructed a zebrafish line in which the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression was driven by col2a1 promoter. The transgenic (col2a1-EGFP) zebrafish line demonstrated that BET inhibitors I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 may affect EGFP expression in zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 may affect chondrocyte differentiation in vitro and inhibit zebrafish growth in vivo. Mechanistic analysis revealed that BET inhibitors influenced the depletion of RNA polymerase II from the Col2a1 promoter.

A list of drugs, such as I-BET151, I-BET762, PFI-1, and (+)-JQ1, were discovered to target BET proteins and block the interaction between BET proteins and acetyl-lysine of histones (2.Filippakopoulos P.

BET proteins and BET inhibitors have been reported to be involved in a variety of biological processes. Pharmacological inhibition of BET proteins lowers the expression of key transcription factors such as oncogene c-MYC (8.Delmore J.E. Issa G.C. Lemieux M.E. Rahl P.B. Shi J. Jacobs H.M. Kastritis E.

Meanwhile, potent BET inhibitors have been identified as showing antitumor efficacy in a number of preclinical cancer models in recent years, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, melanoma, and gastric cancer (15.Fu L.L.

This led to clinical studies focusing mostly on the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. As a result of these studies, the first encouraging signs of efficacy have already been reported (17.Jung M. Gelato K.A. Fernández-Montalván A. Siegel S. Haendler B. Targeting BET bromodomains for cancer treatment.Epigenomics. 2015; 7: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies showed that BET inhibitors also control neuronal differentiation and cause an autism-like syndrome (18.Sullivan J.M. Badimon A. Schaefer U. Ayata P. Gray J. Chung C.W. von Schimmelmann M. Zhang F. Garton N. Smithers N. Lewis H. Tarakhovsky A. Prinjha R.K. Schaefer A. Autism-like syndrome is induced by pharmacological suppression of BET proteins in young mice.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, BET inhibitors were not examined extensively in these studies to determine their side effects on skeletal bone structures. The long bone is mainly formed through endochondral bone formation, which starts with the formation of a cartilage template from condensed mesenchymal cells. The chondrocytes of the cartilage template proliferate axially and subsequently undergo hypertrophy and expansion in cellular volume (19.Mackie E.J. Tatarczuch L. Mirams M. The skeleton: a multi-functional complex organ. The growth plate chondrocyte and endochondral ossification.J. Endocrinol. 2011; 211: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition to cartilage development, reports show that the chondrocytes secrete a variety of collagen proteins (20.Seghatoleslami M.R. Lichtler A.C. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Clark S.H. Mack K. Rowe D.W. Differential regulation of COL2A1 expression in developing and mature chondrocytes.Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Type II and X collagens (Col2a1 and Col10a1) contribute to chondrocyte maintenance and proliferation (20.Seghatoleslami M.R. Lichtler A.C. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Clark S.H. Mack K. Rowe D.W. Differential regulation of COL2A1 expression in developing and mature chondrocytes.Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21.Bianco P. Cancedda F.D. Riminucci M. Cancedda R. Bone formation via cartilage models: the “borderline” chondrocyte.Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Hypertrophic chondrocytes will then switch from the synthesis of the cartilage-characteristic collagens to the synthesis of type I collagen (Col1a1), an osteoblast-characteristic collagen that organizes a mineralizing bone matrix (20.Seghatoleslami M.R. Lichtler A.C. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Clark S.H. Mack K. Rowe D.W.

Cancedda R. Bone formation via cartilage models: the “borderline” chondrocyte.Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To further examine the underlying mechanisms for chondrocyte proliferation and growth inhibition, we established a chondrogenic ATDC5 cell line with the Col2a1 promoter (Col2a1-luc ATDC5 system) and screened a list of epigenetic compounds. Strikingly, six different BET inhibitors were shown to reduce Col2a1-luc, consistent with the decrease of Col2a1 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, we found that BET inhibitors blocked the differentiation of chondrocyte culture. Consistent with this, BET inhibitors I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 could induce retardation of the growth of zebrafish. Taken together, these data suggest that the Col2a1-luc ATDC5 system may be used to screen chondrogenic factors. Furthermore, these data suggest that anticarcinogenic BET inhibitors may potentially injure chondrocytes and the bones of patients. Type II collagen is the specific and major matrix protein of cartilage. The Col2a1 promoter has been used to identify the molecules related to chondrogenesis (22.Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. Three high mobility group-like sequences within a 48-base pair enhancer of the Col2a1 gene are required for cartilage-specific expression in vivo.J. Biol.

To explore novel activators or repressors of chondrogenic differentiation, we generated an ATDC5 cell line that includes the 3-kb human Col2a1 promoter ligated to the open reading frame of firefly luciferase (Fig. 1A). We checked the responses of Col2a1-luc to the heterocyclic molecule kartogenin (KGN) and transcriptional factor SOX9, which have been widely recognized to promote the expression of Col2a1 and chondrocyte differentiation (24.Johnson K.

Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. SOX9 directly regulates the type-II collagen gene.Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports (24.Johnson K. Zhu S. Tremblay M.S. Payette J.N. Wang J. Bouchez L.C. Meeusen S. Althage A. Cho C.Y. Wu X. Schultz P.G. A stem cell-based approach to cartilage repair.Science. 2012; 336: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 25.Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. SOX9 directly regulates the type-II collagen gene.Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), both KGN and SOX9 increased Col2a1 promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that the Col2a1-luc ATDC5 system could be used to screen chondrogenic activators or repressors. Epigenetic factors (i.e. chromatin modifiers) regulate normal and disease processes and are mediated in part by the methylation status of DNA as well as by chemical modifications of histones, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (26.Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8036) Google Scholar). Chondrogenic processes are also influenced by epigenetic regulation, such as methylation of Lys-27 residues on histone H3 (27.Yapp C. Carr A.J. Price A. Oppermann U. Snelling S.J. H3K27me3 demethylases regulate in vitro chondrogenesis and chondrocyte activity in osteoarthritis.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2016; 18: 158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To uncover more epigenetic regulators, we screened a collection of 38 chemicals involved in epigenetic regulations using the Col2a1-luc ATDC5 system (Table 1). After 48-h treatment in 10 μm final concentration of BET inhibitors, we found that a battery of epigenetic inhibitors decreased luciferase activities of Col2a1 promoter (Fig. 2A). Among them, all BET inhibitors, including bromosporine, I-BET-762, RVX208, I-BET151, PFI-1, and (+)-JQ1, could significantly suppress the luciferase activity of the Col2a1 promoter (Fig. 2A) compared with the non-response of the promoter of a soybean translation elongation factor EF1α (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1List of 38 epigenetic compounds screenedCategoryNo.Product nameCAS no.Catalog no.TargetsDNA methyltransferase1Azacitidine320-67-2S1782DNA methyltransferase2Lomeguatrib192441-08-0S8056DNA methyltransferase35-Aza-2-deoxycytidineGR-3452353-33-5DNA Me-transferase inhibitor4Decitabine2353-33-5S1200DNA Methyltransferase5ZebularineGR-3443690-10-6DNA Me-transferase inhibitor6Zebularine3690-10-6S7113DNA Methyltransferase7RG10848208-26-0S2821Transferase, DNA MethyltransferaseEpigenetic reader domain8UNC12151415800-43-9S7088Epigenetic reader domain9SGC-CBP30N/AS7256Epigenetic reader domain10BromosporineN/AS7233Epigenetic reader domain11I-BET-7621260907-17-2S7189Epigenetic reader domain12RVX-2081044870-39-4S7295Epigenetic reader domain13I-BET1511300031-49-5S2780Epigenetic reader domain14PFI-11403764-72-6S1216Epigenetic reader domain15(+)-JQ11268524-70-4S7110Epigenetic reader domainHistone methyltransferase16EPZ56761380288-87-8S7062Histone methyltransferase17SGC 0946N/AS7079Histone methyltransferase18EPZ-64381403254-99-8S7128Histone methyltransferase193-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNeP)102052-95-9S7120Histone methyltransferase20EPZ004777 HCl1380316-03-9S7032Histone methyltransferase21MM-1021417329-24-8S7265Histone methyltransferase22Entacapone130929-57-6S3147Histone methyltransferase23EPZ0047771338466-77-5S7353Histone methyltransferase24EPZ0056871396772-26-1S7004Histone methyltransferaseHistone demethylases25GSK J4 HCl1373423-53-0S7070Histone demethylases26Tranylcypromine (2-PCPA) HCl4548-34-9S4246Histone demethylases27JIB-04199596-05-9S7281Histone demethylases28OG-L0021357302-64-7S7237Histone demethylases29TranylcypromineEI-21713492-01-8Lysine demethylase inhibitor302,4-Pyridinedicarboxylic acidA-280499-80-9Histone demethylase inhibitorHistone acetyltransferase31CTPB420–033586976-24-1HAT inhibitor32GarcinolGR-34378824-30-3HAT inhibitor33Butyrolactone 3270-411778649-18-6HAT inhibitor34C646328968-36-1S7152Histone acetyltransferase35Anacardic acid270-381N/AHAT inhibitorHIF36IOX2931398-72-0S2919HIF37FG-4592808118-40-3S1007HIF382-Methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2)362-07-2S1233HIF Open table in a new tab Consistent with the luciferase activity result, the RNA levels of Col2a1 were also significantly reduced in cells treated with BET inhibitors compared with vehicle alone (DMSO) (Fig. 2C). Consistently, we discovered that BET inhibitors decreased Col2a1 expression in mesenchymal progenitor cell line C3H/10T1/2 (C3H10) (Fig. 2, D–F) and primary chondrocytes (Fig. 2, G–I). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration and cytotoxicity concentration were unequal for different BET inhibitors. To lower the impact of cell cytotoxicity of the various BET inhibitors, we further examined the effects of five BET inhibitors (I-BET-762, RVX208, I-BET151, PFI-1, and (+)-JQ1) on Col2a1 expression at various doses. We performed treatment with five BET inhibitors at gradient concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 5 μm. As shown in Fig. 3, A–E (ATDC5) and F–J (C3H10), all of the BET inhibitors were capable of dose-dependently decreasing the luciferase activity of the Col2a1 promoter. Consistent with this, the expression levels of Col2a1, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, were dose-dependently reduced by various BET inhibitors (Fig. 3, K–O (ATDC5) and P–T (primary chondrocytes)). BET bromodomain inhibition results in the suppression of Col2a1, which is one of the most essential collagens expressed during cartilage maintenance and differentiation. We hypothesized that BET inhibitors may also play fundamental roles in chondrocyte proliferation and development. To test our hypothesis, we isolated chondrocytes from the articular cartilage of 3-day-old wild-type mice and examined the effects of BET bromodomain inhibition on the expression of chondrocyte marker genes. Total RNA and protein were collected from the cultured chondrocytes that were treated with I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 at final concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 5 μm (I-BET151) and 0.2, 0.5, and 1 μm (+)-JQ1) for 72 h. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we observed a progressive transcription suppression of Col2a1, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (Adamts5), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) (Fig. 4, A–F). However, the key transcriptional factor of chondrogenesis, Sox9, showed no obvious response to the BET bromodomain inhibition (data not shown). We also examined the protein levels of different chondrocyte marker genes after I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, G and H, immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that both BET151 and (+)-JQ1 may lead to decreased protein levels of COL2A1, ADAMTS5, and MMP3, correlating with RNA level inhibition. These data indicated that both I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 treatments may have suppressive effects on chondrogenesis. To further characterize the efficacy of inhibiting BET proteins in chondrogenic differentiation, we examined the effect of I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 by using the chondrocyte micromass culture system. Inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins induced a remarkable decrease in matrix accumulation, which was monitored by Alcian blue staining after 7 days in micromass culture (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, both I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 strongly suppressed the expression of chondrogenesis-related genes, such as Col2a1, Adamts5, and Mmp3 (Fig. 5, B–D). Consistently, the chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10 and ATDC5 cells was inhibited by I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 as well (Fig. 5, E and F). Next, we examined the effects of BET inhibitors on ex vivo mouse articular cartilage cultures. Articular cartilage of distal femora was isolated from newborn mice and cultured in chondrogenic differential medium. I-BET151 at 5 μm or (+)-JQ1 at 0.5 μm was added to the culture medium with an equal amount of DMSO as the control. After 1 week of culture, we observed that both I-BET151 and JQ1 could suppress the growth of cartilage as the size of the I-BET151 and JQ1 treatment group was significantly smaller than the DMSO control group (Fig. 5, G–J). We examined the cartilage by positive safranin O staining and found that both I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 can inhibit the hypertrophy of chondrocytes as determined by the size of the chondrocytes following treatment (Fig. 5, G and H). BET inhibitors are capable of blocking the interaction of acetylated lysine with BET proteins, which could regulate gene transcription driven by Pol II (28.Zhang W. Prakash C. Sum C. Gong Y. Li Y. Kwok J.J. Thiessen N. Pettersson S. Jones S.J. Knapp S. Yang H. Chin K.C. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) regulates RNA polymerase II serine 2 phosphorylation in human CD4+ T cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 43137-43155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). First, we detected that the protein level of Pol II was not impacted by BET inhibitor treatment (Fig. 6A). We next examined whether BET inhibitors could affect the recruitment of Pol II to the Col2a1 promoter. For the 2.5-kb promoter upstream of the transcription start site of mouse Col2a1, we analyzed four loci (Fig. 6B, primers 1–4). DNA was purified after chromatin immunoprecipitation with Pol II antibody in primary chondrocytes treated with DMSO, I-BET151, or (+)-JQ1 for 72 h. The relative amount of promoter-associated Pol II was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR followed by normalization with the IgG sample. We observed that Pol II associates with the Col2a1 promoter, especially DNA fragments close to the transcription start site (Fig. 6C). In addition, the association between Pol II and the Col2a1 promoter was arrested by BET bromodomain inhibition by I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that the recruitment of Pol II to the Col2a1 promoter was interrupted by BET inhibitors. Zebrafish is a good, widely used model in developmental and functional studies of bone and cartilage (29.Fisher S. Jagadeeswaran P. Halpern M.E. Radiographic analysis of zebrafish skeletal defects.Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine whether BET inhibitors could influence Col2a1 as well as animal growth in vivo, we next examined the effects of BET inhibitors on zebrafish. We generated a transgenic zebrafish line harboring a col2a1 promoter-EGFP transgene (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, the EGFP fluorescence could be detected at 1 day postfertilization (dpf) and was further enhanced at 2 dpf. The EGFP fluorescence localized at the vertebrae, which contain collagen 2-positive chondrocytes. We incubated 12-h postfertilization embryos with different doses of I-BET151 (1, 5, and 10 μm) and (+)-JQ1 (0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm) for 36 h. As shown in Fig. 7, C and D, 10 μm I-BET151 and 1 μm (+)-JQ1 induced serious malformations in the zebrafish. In addition, both I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 led to decreased EGFP fluorescence compared with the vehicle alone (DMSO), indicating that BET inhibitors could decrease col2a1 expression in vivo (Fig. 7, C and D). Prior research studies have demonstrated that long bones are formed through endochondral ossification of chondrocytes in which col2a1 is one of the most requisite matrix collagens (30.Wei X. Hu M. Mishina Y. Liu F. Developmental regulation of the growth plate and cranial synchondrosis.J. Dent. Res. 2016; 95: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins may also affect the growth of the organism. To test this hypothesis, we incubated 2-dpf embryos with I-BET151 (1 and 5 μm) and (+)-JQ1 (0.1 and 0.5 μm) for 2 weeks and measured the body length of the zebrafish following 2 weeks of cultivation. As shown in Fig. 7, E and F, zebrafish treated with I-BET151 at both 1 and 5 μm developed a specified amount of atrophy compared with vehicle alone (DMSO). However, I-BET151 at high concentrations (10 μm) impacted zebrafish viability (Fig. 7G). Consistently, we also observed that 0.5 μm (+)-JQ1 suppressed the length extension of the zebrafish, whereas 0.1 μm (+)-JQ1 showed no obvious functions (Fig. 7, H–J). Next, we characterized the whole mount skeleton of zebrafish by alizarin red and Alcian blue staining at 3 weeks old and observed similar shortened body length (Fig. 7, K and L). To analyze the bone growth restriction, we measured the length of centrum 15 of caudal vertebrae as a representative and observed the shorter vertebral bodies in I-BET151 (both 1 and 5 μm)- and (+)-JQ1 (0.5 μm)-treated zebrafish, whereas 0.1 μm (+)-JQ1 showed no obvious functions (Fig. 7, M–P). To demonstrate that BET inhibitors also played fundamental roles in zebrafish chondrogenesis, we isolated total RNAs of tail fins from 3-week-old zebrafish under different treatments. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we observed a progressive transcription suppression of cartilage and bone marker genes, such as col2a1, adamts5, col1a1 (type I collagen), and runt-related transcription factor 2a and 2b (runx2a and runx2b) (Fig. 8, A–J). Consistent with this, the protein level of COL2A1 was reduced in paraffin sections of 3-week-old zebrafish treated with both I-BET151 and (+)-JQ1 (Fig. 8K). Taken together, our data suggest that BET inhibitors restrained chondrogenesis and differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we generated a Col2a1-luc ATDC5 system to identify activators or repressors of chondrogenic differentiation. We found that six BET inhibitors restrain the expression of Col2a1 and impede chondrogenesis as determined by micromass culture and ex vivo cartilage culture. We also established a Col2-EGFP transgenic zebrafish line and demonstrated that BET inhibitors can decrease Col2-EGFP expression. Consistently, BET inhibitors retard the growth of zebrafish in vivo. These data demonstrate that BET inhibitors could inhibit chondrogenic differentiation and restrain bone growth in vitro and in vivo. The BET subfamily of bromodomain-containing proteins is involved in a number of hematological and solid tumors (15.Fu L.L. Tian M. Li X. Li J.J. Huang J. Ouyang L. Zhang Y. Liu B.

https://openalex.org/W2556422890,"Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) are co-receptors for Wnt ligands. Upon ligand binding, LRP5/6 undergo glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)/casein kinase I (CKI)-mediated phosphorylation at multiple PPP(S/T)P motifs in the intracellular domain, which is essential for canonical Wnt signal transduction. On the other hand, in the Wnt-off state, the mitosis-specific CDK14-Cyclin Y kinase complex phosphorylates Ser-1490 of LRP5/6 at G2/M, thereby priming the receptor for Wnt-induced phosphorylation. However, it remains unclear how CDK14/Cyclin Y is recruited to LRP5/6 and whether there are other cofactors involved in this process. Previously, we identified Caprin-2 as a positive regulator of canonical Wnt signaling by promoting GSK3-depedent LRP5/6 phosphorylation upon Wnt stimulation. Here we uncovered that Caprin-2 positively regulates constitutive LRP5/6 Ser-1490 phosphorylation by complexing with CDK14/Cyclin Y. Caprin-2-mediated LRP5/6 phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent in a pattern similar to that of CDK14/Cyclin Y-dependent LRP5/6 phosphorylation. Moreover, knockdown of Caprin-2 disrupts not only the interaction between CDK14 and Cyclin Y but also the interaction between CDK14/Cyclin Y and LRP6. Overall, our findings revealed an unrecognized role of Caprin-2 in facilitating LRP5/6 constitutive phosphorylation at G2/M through forming a quaternary complex with CDK14, Cyclin Y, and LRP5/6."

Although their transport cycle is overall electroneutral, specific partial reactions are electrogenic. Here, we present an electrophysiological study of the PaNhaP Na+/H+ antiporter from Pyrococcus abyssi reconstituted into liposomes. Positive transient currents were recorded upon addition of Na+ to PaNhaP proteoliposomes, indicating a reaction where positive charge is rapidly displaced into the proteoliposomes with a rate constant of k >200 s−1. We attribute the recorded currents to an electrogenic reaction that includes Na+ binding and possibly occlusion. Subsequently, positive charge is transported out of the cell associated with H+ binding, so that the overall reaction is electroneutral. We show that the differences in pH profile and Na+ affinity of PaNhaP and the related MjNhaP1 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii can be attributed to an additional negatively charged glutamate residue in PaNhaP. The results are discussed in the context of the physiological function of PaNhaP and other microbial Na+/H+ exchangers.

Human CPAs, in particular the NHE (sodium proton exchanger) transporters, are of major interest because they are implicated in a number of serious pathologies and are important drug targets (1.Donowitz M.

So far, there is no detailed structural information on eukaryotic CPAs, but the structures of the Na+/H+ antiporter from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjNhaP1) (4.Paulino C. Wöhlert D. Kapotova E. Yildiz Ö. Kühlbrandt W. Structure and transport mechanism of the sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1.Elife. 2014; 3: e03583Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Pyrococcus abyssi (PaNhaP) (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have recently been determined. With their high sequence homology to human exchangers, especially in the ion-binding region (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), PaNhaP and MjNhaP1 serve as excellent model systems for identifying key residues and elucidating the transport mechanism of NHE transporters. In a recent study we demonstrated that the competition-based transport mechanism first proposed for the electrogenic CPA2 antiporter NhaA (EcNhaA) from Escherichia coli (6.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: an electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) also applies to the electroneutral CPA1 antiporter MjNhaP1 (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W.

Members of the CPA1 and CPA2 families share similarities in the 6-helix bundle that are essential for transport (4.Paulino C. Wöhlert D. Kapotova E. Yildiz Ö. Kühlbrandt W. Structure and transport mechanism of the sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1.Elife. 2014; 3: e03583Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, a major difference between members of the two subfamilies is the presence of a conserved Asn-Asp motif in the binding site of the CPA1 exchangers, whereas CPA2 exchangers have a conserved Asp-Asp motif in the same position (4.Paulino C. Wöhlert D. Kapotova E. Yildiz Ö. Kühlbrandt W. Structure and transport mechanism of the sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1.Elife. 2014; 3: e03583Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The additional negatively charged Asp residue in CPA2 is proposed to be responsible for the extra H+ that is transported by these exchangers compared with CPA1 (6.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: an electrophysiological study.J. Biol.

Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The striking feature of the model, in which H+ and Na+ ions compete for a common binding site, is that it is self-regulatory, ensuring that transport activity is switched off at extreme pH values to prevent excessive acidification or alkalinization of the cytoplasm (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8.Clinescu O. Fendler K. A universal mechanism for transport and regulation of CPA sodium proton exchangers.Biol. Chem. 2015; 396: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For an electrogenic antiporter such as EcNhaA, at least one electrogenic reaction is required per transport cycle. In the case of EcNhaA this reaction was seen to be the Na+ translocation step (6.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: an electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For an electroneutral exchanger like MjNhaP1, an electrogenic reaction is, in theory, not required. However, the study on MjNhaP1 revealed that this exchanger, although overall electroneutral, has at least two electrogenic transport steps, which we assigned to the translocation of the Na+ and H+ substrate ions across the membrane (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This enabled us to monitor the activity of the transporter by solid-supported membrane (SSM)-based electrophysiology, an experimental technique that is particularly appropriate for the characterization of prokaryotic membrane transporters (9.Bazzone A. Costa W.S. Braner M. Calinescu O. Hatahet L. Fendler K. Introduction to solid supported membrane based electrophysiology.J. Vis. Exp. 2013; 2013: e50230Google Scholar). The technique is better suited to the investigation of Na+/H+ exchangers than the more commonly used fluorescence dequenching as it allows better pH control and has an improved dynamic range for the measured activity (10.Clinescu O. Danner E. Böhm M. Hunte C. Fendler K. Species differences in bacterial NhaA Na+/H+ exchangers.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As we were able to identify electrogenic reactions in MjNhaP1, even though it is overall electroneutral, we were interested to find out whether they also exist in PaNhaP. Furthermore, because PaNhaP has an extra negatively charged residue (Glu-73) in the substrate binding site that has no homologue in MjNhaP1 (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we wanted to investigate the role of this residue in the transport mechanism of PaNhaP. We found that the competition-based transport mechanism that applies to EcNhaA and MjNhaP1 also describes the activity of PaNhaP. As in MjNhaP1, we uncovered electrogenic steps in the transport cycle of PaNhaP that effect the translocation of positive charge, both in the wild-type protein and in a mutant where Glu-73 was replaced by alanine. These electrogenic steps are attributable to the binding and possibly the occlusion of the Na+ substrate ion. Our results establish a model of substrate translocation and define the role of Glu-73 in PaNhaP. Proteoliposomes containing reconstituted PaNhaPWT were subjected to Na+ concentration jumps under conditions of symmetrical or asymmetrical pH (pH inside versus outside the proteoliposomes). We found that even though PaNhaP is overall electroneutral, transient currents were measurable in response to Na+ concentration jumps (Fig. 1). This suggests an electrogenic Na+ translocation step in the transport cycle of PaNhaP, as previously observed for the electroneutral MjNhaP1 and for the electrogenic EcNhaA (6.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: an electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as in MjNhaP1, the polarity of the recorded transients was positive, indicating that positive charge is displaced inside the proteoliposomes upon Na+ binding and/or translocation. The transient currents are dominated by the time dependence of the solution exchange process on the SSM surface. From the curve of the transient currents (Fig. 1) we estimate a rate constant of k > 200 s−1 (11.Garcia-Celma J.J. Ploch J. Smirnova I. Kaback H.R. Fendler K. Delineating electrogenic reactions during lactose/H+ symport.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 6115-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The displaced charge was calculated as 27 ± 5 pC, which is three times larger than in MjNhaP1 (9 ± 2 pC). It is interesting to compare this charge displacement to the value of 96 ± 19 pC estimated for translocation of one elementary charge in lactose permease (12.Garcia-Celma J.J. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. Fendler K. Electrophysiological characterization of LacY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7373-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although this charge varies to some extent with the sample preparation and the adsorption of proteoliposomes to the SSM, we can conclude that a significant fraction of one elementary charge is displaced upon a saturating Na+ concentration jump. Following concentration jumps of 50 mm Na+ (Fig. 1A), the recorded transient currents increased in amplitude with pH, reaching a plateau at pH 7 and above (Figs. 1A and 2A). Compared with the pH dependence of MjNhaP1 (Fig. 2A) (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) the transients recorded for PaNhaPWT increase more gradually with pH. Note that, as for MjNhaP1 (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the pH profile of the transient currents does not represent the pH profile of steady-state transport activity, as it only reports on a Na+-dependent partial reaction in the transport cycle. When transient currents were recorded at pH 9 using increasing jumps in Na+ concentration, the transient currents increased hyperbolically with the Na+ concentration (Figs. 1A and 2B). The apparent Na+ affinity of the transporter decreased with pH, indicating competition between Na+ and H+ (Fig. 2B). Na+ concentration jumps at asymmetrical pH revealed that the current amplitudes were independent of the internal pH, whereas they varied with external pH (Fig. 1, C and D). This is indicative of an early reaction in the transport cycle associated with Na+ binding. In particular, it shows that the currents do not depend on internal H+ binding or translocation to the outside. Positive transient currents were also recorded when PaNhaPE73A was subjected to Na+ concentration jumps. Compared with the wild-type, the slope of the pH dependence for PaNhaPE73A was steeper (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the pH dependence of the Na+ transients for PaNhaPE73A recorded after saturating (50 mm) Na+ concentration jumps was virtually identical to MjNhaP1. Thus, from a functional point of view, the most striking difference between PaNhaP and MjNhaP1 seems to be the presence or absence of Glu-73 in the substrate-binding site. Another effect of replacing Glu-73 by Ala in PaNhaP was a 10-fold reduction in the apparent affinity for Na+ at pH 9 in PaNhaPE73A, compared with PaNhaPWT (Fig. 2D). To complement our electrophysiological measurements, we assayed 22Na+ counterflow in WT PaNhaP proteoliposomes at pH 6 and 8 (Fig. 3). Whereas 22Na+ accumulated at pH 6, there was no 22Na+ uptake by the proteoliposomes at pH 8, indicating a lack of sodium exchange at elevated pH, where physiological Na+/H+ antiport by PaNhaP is down-regulated (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PaNhaP was solved at a resolution of 3.2 Å in the presence of Tl+ ions, which were identified in the binding site by their anomalous signal (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As Tl+ was shown to be transported by PaNhaP (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we asked whether Tl+ concentration jumps induce similar transient currents as corresponding changes in Na+ concentration. Following Tl+ concentration jumps on WT PaNhaP proteoliposomes, we measured positive transient currents, but with amplitudes comparable with those induced by Tl+ concentration jumps performed on “empty” liposomes, devoid of protein (data not shown). Therefore, to compare measurements performed on the same SSM sensor directly, we subjected PaNhaPWT proteoliposomes to 30 mm Tl+ concentration jumps in the presence or absence of 50 mm Na+, enough to saturate the transporter with Na+. The recorded transients (Fig. 4A) were subtracted and the Tl+-dependent current was recovered. We also tested whether the presence of Tl+ in the activating and non-activating solutions has any inhibitory effect on Na+ translocation. Indeed, Tl+ acted as a competitive inhibitor, as it reduced the amplitude of transient currents recorded for 10 mm Na+ concentration jumps (Fig. 4B) with a Ki of 30 mm at pH 8. Transient currents after a Na+ concentration jump are positive. The size (Table 1) and time dependence of the current is characteristic of a pre-steady state charge displacement, as indicated by the following considerations: 1) the current decays rapidly and its time dependence is virtually independent of the Na+ concentration; 2) the current is sensitive only to external pH and insensitive to internal pH. This finding is consistent with CPA1 Na+/H+ exchangers being electroneutral, as previously observed for MjNhaP1 (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction that results in the observed transient currents is rapid (k > 200 s−1) and displaces a significant fraction of one elementary charge.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters determined for cation and proton binding to PaNhaPWT and PaNhaPE73AImaxaImax was determined for 50 mm Na+ concentration jumps at pH 8 (PaNhaP) or 7.5 (MjNhaP1).Km,alkbKm,alk was determined for PaNhaP at pH 9 (Na+) or pH 8 (Tl+), and for MjNhaP1 at pH 7.5.

Open table in a new tab The time and substrate dependence of the positive charge displacement is similar to that in MjNhaP1 (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In MjNhaP1 this charge displacement was tentatively assigned to Na+ binding, followed by the conformational transition and the release of Na+ to the liposome interior, in the order Co + Na → CoNa → CiNa → Ci + Na (Fig. 7A). However, counterflow experiments with PaNhaP (Fig. 3) show that the complete Na+ translocation process as outlined above is slow (∼0.05 s−1) and absent at alkaline pH, where our currents are largest. We, therefore, attribute the observed electrogenic reaction to rapid Na+ binding. Because the process is electrogenic, simple binding to a surface-exposed Na+ binding site is unlikely. Rather, a subsequent conformational change that occludes the substrate ion may be responsible for the major part of the charge displacement. In the following we will refer to this reaction as electrogenic Na+ binding. The X-ray structure of PaNhaP shows that the two acidic side chains of Asp-159 and Glu-73 are directly involved in binding of the Tl+ ion, whereas Asp-130 coordinates the ion via a water molecule (Fig. 5). Our electrophysiological measurements are in agreement with this finding. A comparison with the putative Na+ binding site of MjNhaP1 is instructive. MjNhaP1 and related transporters lack Glu-73 (see sequence comparison in Fig. 5) and have a neutral side chain in this position. Compared with MjNhaP1, the Na+ binding activity of PaNhaP extends into the acidic pH range (Fig. 1) and the pH-dependent profile (Fig. 2A) decreases roughly linearly with pH. This would not be expected in a typical titration curve. When Glu-73 is removed, the pH profile of PaNhaP resembles that of MjNhaP1, which has an uncharged side chain in this position (Fig. 2C). This demonstrates that Glu-73 is responsible for the extended Na+ binding pH profile of PaNhaP. At the same time, the Na+ affinity of PaNhaPE73A is reduced to 10%, most likely due to weaker coordination of the substrate ion. Further support for this notion comes from the kinetic analysis. Because the observed transient currents represent Na+ binding, we analyzed the pH profile of PaNhaPWT in terms of a hypothetical kinetic model, which includes two H+ binding sites representing the Glu-73 and Asp-159 residues that directly coordinate the Na+ ion. Here we made the simplifying assumption that the same amount of charge is displaced when Na+ binds to the unprotonated or the singly protonated binding site (see kinetic model in Fig. 6A). A fit with the experimentally determined Na+ binding constants of 2.9 and 31 mm, respectively (Table 1), reproduces the pH profile of PaNhaP very well, yielding pK values 7.9 and 5.3 due to the two acidic side chains (Fig. 6A). Accordingly, the pH dependence of PaNhaPE73A can be fitted with a single pK of 6.8, which resembles that of MjNhaP1 (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Note that this kinetic model not only agrees with the pH profile but also with the Na+ dependence of PaNhaPWT and PaNhaPE73A (Fig. 6, B and D). In conclusion, functional measurements with Na+ as substrate cation are in close agreement with Tl+ binding observed in the crystal structure and show that two carboxylates, Glu-73 and Asp-159, are directly involved in binding the substrate ion. Furthermore, our measurements show that the additional carboxylate in the Na+ binding site of PaNhaP significantly increases the Na+ affinity and extends its Na+ binding capacity to the acidic pH range. This is most probably also the reason why the active pH range of PaNhaP is shifted to acidic pH (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) compared with MjNhaP1 (4.Paulino C. Wöhlert D. Kapotova E. Yildiz Ö. Kühlbrandt W. Structure and transport mechanism of the sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1.Elife. 2014; 3: e03583Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that Tl+ is transported by PaNhaP (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Likewise, transient currents were also obtained with Tl+ instead of Na+ (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the experiment in Fig. 4B shows that Na+ and Tl+ compete for the same binding site. We conclude that the Tl+ binding site in the X-ray structure is the same as that for Na+. There is a significant difference between Na+- and Tl+-induced currents. The amplitude of the Tl+ currents is roughly 10 times smaller than that of Na+ currents and the affinity of the PaNhaP cation binding site for Tl+ is 10-fold lower than for Na+. Both results indicate that the Tl+-bound state is different from the Na+-bound state. This may indicate incomplete occlusion of Tl+. Alternatively, Na+ binding may permit subsequent conformational transitions that could contribute to charge displacement that cannot take place in the Tl+-bound state. Using the kinetic model given in Fig. 7 we can calculate the activity profile of the PaNhaPWT Na+/H+ exchanger at physiological conditions as a function of the cytoplasmic pH from the kinetic parameters in Table 1. The pK of the binding site was approximated by the experimentally determined apparent pKapp and the Na+ binding constant by the experimentally determined Km,alk(Na+). This is a good approximation because, at the slow turnover rate of these exchangers, the transient currents correspond to electrogenic Na+ binding rather than transport. For comparison we also calculated the pH profile of MjNhaP1, another CPA1 Na+/H+ exchanger. Both P. abyssi and M. jannaschii were isolated from hydrothermal vents and grow optimally under conditions of high salinity (13.Erauso G. Reysenbach A.-L. Godfroy A. Meunier J.-R. Crump B. Partensky F. Baross J.A. Marteinsson V. Barbier G. Pace N.R. Prieur D. Pyrococcus abyssi sp. nov., a new hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent.Arch.

Methanococcus jannaschii sp. nov., an extremely thermophilic methanogen from a submarine hydrothermal vent.Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Therefore, the normal mode of transport for PaNhaP and MjNhaP1 will be import of Na+ and export of H+. This is the same as the role of the plasma membrane NHE eukaryotic exchangers that regulate Na+ import, coupled with alkalinization of the cell (15.Fuster D.G. Alexander R.T. Traditional and emerging roles for the SLC9 Na+/H+ exchangers.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). pH regulation should be, indeed, a main concern of the extremophiles P. abyssi and M. jannaschii, as they can encounter rather severe pH changes in their natural environment as a result of mixing between the acidic hydrothermal fluids with the slightly alkaline seawater (16.Prokofeva M.I. Kublanov I.V. Nercessian O. Tourova T.P. Kolganova T.V. Lebedinsky A.V. Bonch-Osmolovskaya E.A. Spring S. Jeanthon C. Cultivated anaerobic acidophilic/acidotolerant thermophiles from terrestrial and deep-sea hydrothermal habitats.Extremophiles. 2005; 9: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7B, the activity of CPA1 exchangers is maximal when the cytoplasmic pH drops below neutral and the transporter imports Na+ ions to increase the internal pH. Interestingly, the activity of PaNhaP is shifted toward the acidic range, which might indicate that P. abyssi is more prone to acidification than M. jannaschii, despite the fact that the optimum pH for growing P. abyssi is 6.8 (13.Erauso G. Reysenbach A.-L. Godfroy A. Meunier J.-R. Crump B. Partensky F. Baross J.A. Marteinsson V. Barbier G. Pace N.R. Prieur D. Pyrococcus abyssi sp. nov., a new hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent.Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 338-349Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar), whereas it is 6 for M. jannaschii (14.Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Methanococcus jannaschii sp. nov., an extremely thermophilic methanogen from a submarine hydrothermal vent.Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). An acidic shifted pK of PaNhaP would be in line with the metabolic difference between the two species. P. abyssi produces acidic compounds (including H2S) and CO2 as the end products of its metabolism (17.Cohen G.N. Barbe V. Flament D. Galperin M. Heilig R. Lecompte O. Poch O. Prieur D. Quérellou J. Ripp R. Thierry J.C. Van der Oost J. Weissenbach J. Zivanovic Y. Forterre P. An integrated analysis of the genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1495-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas M. jannaschii consumes CO2 in the process of methanogenesis (14.Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R.

A molecular and physiological survey of a diverse collection of hydrothermal vent Thermococcus and Pyrococcus isolates.Extremophiles. 2009; 13: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In theory, both CPA1 exchangers can also operate in reverse to export Na+ when the cytoplasmic pH shifts to the alkaline. However, under normal growth conditions, at an outside Na+ concentration of ∼0.5 m, this mode would be very slow because the Na+ concentration gradient that would have to be overcome is high. By comparison, the three NhaA CPA2 exchangers shown in Fig. 7B export Na+ against high concentration gradients by virtue of their much higher pK (thus favoring periplasmic H+ binding). Moreover, they are electrogenic (2 H+ imported for one Na+ ion exported), so that one net positive charge is imported into the cell, which is favored by the overall negative-inside membrane potential. In conclusion, a comparison of the investigated CPA1 and CPA2 Na+/H+ exchangers reveals an interesting self-regulating feature of both transporter families. The pK values of the different exchangers are carefully tuned to values that lead to down-regulation at neutral pH. Therefore, their activity would always drive the cytoplasmic pH into the desired neutral pH range (shown by the dashed arrows in Fig. 7). Note that this is true for CPA1 and CPA2 exchangers, even though they transport ions in opposite directions under physiological conditions. Once a neutral internal pH has been reached, they are inactive and no longer pose the risk of pH changes or excessive loss or accumulation of Na+. The synthetic gene for wild-type PaNhaP (PaNhaPWT) was cloned with a C-terminal cysteine protease domain fusion into the pET21a plasmid. The PaNhaP mutation Glu-73 to Ala (PaNhaPE73A) was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (19.Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Site-directed mutagenesis using double-stranded plasmid DNA templates.Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli C41-(DE3) cells and target proteins were purified as described (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were reconstituted at a lipid to protein ratio (w/w) of 4 into liposomes prepared from E. coli polar lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) as described (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological measurements were performed essentially as described (7.Clinescu O. Paulino C. Kühlbrandt W. Fendler K. Keeping it simple, transport mechanism and pH regulation in Na+/H+ exchangers.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13168-13176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of proteoliposome suspension were allowed to adsorb for at least 1 h to the SSM sensor on which an octadecanethiol/phospholipid hybrid bilayer had been formed. A single-solution exchange protocol was employed, in which non-activating or activating solutions flowed successively for 0.5 s over the SSM membrane. Solutions used for Na+ concentration jumps containing 50 mm MES, 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm Tris, 200 mm choline chloride, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol were titrated to the desired pH with Tris or HCl. In addition, non-activating solutions contained 100 mm choline chloride, whereas activating solutions contained x mm NaCl and (100 − x) mm choline chloride. Most concentration jump experiments were performed with a single-solution exchange protocol of the form: non-activating/activating/non-activating solution (20.Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology.Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), where the pH on both sides of the proteoliposome membrane was identical (symmetrical pH). For the double-solution exchange flow protocol (20.Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology.Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) the pH was varied independently inside and outside the proteoliposomes (asymmetrical pH). This required an additional resting solution, which was identical to the activation solution except for the pH (21.Bazzone A. Madej M.G. Kaback H.R. Fendler K. pH regulation of electrogenic sugar/H+ symport in MFS sugar permeases.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0156392Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Solutions to assess the inhibitory effect of Tl+ on Na+ concentration jumps contained 50 mm MES, 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm Tris, 200 mm KCH3COO, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2. Non-activating solutions contained in addition 100 mm KCH3COO, whereas activating solutions contained x mm NaCH3COO and (100 − x) mm KCH3COO. All solutions were supplemented with various concentrations (0–150 mm) of TlCH3COO. Tl+ measurements were performed at symmetrical pH 8. Solutions to assess the effect of Tl+ concentration jumps contained 50 mm MES, 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm Tris, 200 mm KCH3COO, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2. Non-activating solutions contained either an additional 100 mm KCH3COO or 50 mm NaCH3COO + 50 mm KCH3COO, whereas activating solutions contained 30 mm TlCH3COO and an additional 70 mm KCH3COO or 30 mm TlCH3COO + 20 mm KCH3COO + 50 mm NaCH3COO. Transient currents were also recorded for Na+ concentration jumps performed on empty liposomes that did not contain the reconstituted transporter. For Na+ concentration jumps, the amplitude of these currents was subtracted from the amplitude of currents measured on proteoliposomes. For counterflow measurements PaNhaPWTwas reconstituted as described (5.Wöhlert D. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. Structure and substrate ion binding in the sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP.Elife. 2014; 3: e03579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the following modification. The reconstitution buffer contained 10 mm tricholine citrate/Tris and 10 mm NaCl. Liposomes were diluted 1:100 in activity buffer (10 mm tricholine citrate/Tris, 2 mm MgSO4, 20 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 1 μCi/ml of 22Na) that was supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 500 μm. 200 μl of the sample was filtered on 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filters (GSWP02500, Millipore) that were subsequently washed with 3 ml of 22Na-free activity buffer. Filters were transferred to vials and overlaid with 4 ml of liquid scintillation mixture (Rotiszint, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for counting. Measurements were carried out at room temperature at pH 6 and 8 (same inside and outside pH). Empty liposomes were used as a control. For the kinetic models (FIGURE 6., FIGURE 7.) steady state analytical solutions were calculated using the software Mathcad (Parametric Technology Corp., Needham, MA). For the analytical solution of the kinetic model of Fig. 7, see Ref. 6.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K.

To investigate the role of Na+/H+ exchangers under physiological conditions, the transport activity was calculated using a kinetic model (Fig. 7A) and experimentally determined kinetic parameters. The relevant parameters for the calculation are compiled in Fig. 7. For the CPA2 NhaA-type Na+/H+ exchangers of Helicobacter pylori, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium, previously determined kinetic parameters were used (10.Clinescu O. Danner E. Böhm M. Hunte C.

For bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract (H. pylori, E. coli, and S. typhimurium) a Na+ concentration of 150 mm and pH 7.5 were taken as typical environmental conditions. The environment of H. pylori can be highly acidic. However, it was shown that the pH at the plasma membrane is maintained close to neutral pH by the urease system (22.Krulwich T.A. Sachs G. Padan E. Molecular aspects of bacterial pH sensing and homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The archaea M. jannaschii and P. abyssi colonize submarine hydrothermal vents where pH is typically slightly acidic. We assumed pH 6.5, which is an average value of optimal growth pH for M. jannaschii (14.Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S.

https://openalex.org/W2551624879,"Background Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of an economically important disease in swine. Since it has been shown that PRRSV and PRRSV specific antibodies can be detected in oral fluid, many different aspects have been studied to show that oral fluid could be a worthy alternative diagnostic sample to serum for monitoring and surveillance of this disease. Thorough field evaluations are however missing to convincingly show its usefulness under representative field conditions. Methodology Pen-based oral fluid samples and serum samples from all individual pigs in the corresponding pens were collected from post-weaning pigs of three different age categories in eight endemically PRRSV infected farms and one PRRSV free farm in Belgium. All samples were tested by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and ELISA to detect PRRSV RNA and PRRSV specific antibodies, respectively. Results While the relative specificity of PRRSV detection by qRT-PCR in pen-based oral fluid compared to serum collected from individual pigs was high in all age categories (>90%), the relative sensitivity decreased with the age of the pigs (89, 93 and 10% in 8-12w, 16-20w and 24-28w old pigs, respectively). The latter correlated with a lower percentage of PRRSV positive pigs in serum/pen in the different age categories (55, 29 and 6%, respectively). Irrespective of the age category, pen-based oral fluid samples were always found PCR positive when at least 30% of the individual pigs were positive in serum. PRRSV specific antibody detection in oral fluid by ELISA showed a 100% relative sensitivity to detection in serum since oral fluid samples were always positive as soon as one pig in the pen was positive in serum. On the other hand, two false positive oral fluid samples in 11 pens without serum positive pigs were found, resulting in a relative specificity of 82%. Indications are however present that the oral fluid result indicated the correct infection status but the absence of a golden standard test makes it difficult to define definitive test characteristics. Conclusions Overall it can be concluded that oral fluid seems to be a useful matrix for diagnosis of PRRSV under field conditions and that differences in kinetics of PRRSV and PRRSV specific antibody detection in oral fluid and serum of individual pigs can also be reflected in pen-based oral fluid results."
https://openalex.org/W2556032037,"Purposes To evaluate the usefulness of our original five questions in a medical interview for diagnosing discogenic low back pain (LBP), and to establish a support tool for diagnosing discogenic LBP. Materials and Methods The degenerative disc disease (DDD) group (n = 42) comprised patients diagnosed with discogenic LBP associated with DDD, on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging findings and response to analgesic discography (discoblock). The control group (n = 30) comprised patients with LBP due to a reason other than DDD. We selected patients from those who had been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and had undergone decompression surgery without fusion. Of them, those whose postoperative LBP was significantly decreased were included in the control group. We asked patients in both groups whether they experienced LBP after sitting too long, while standing after sitting too long, squirming in a chair after sitting too long, while washing one’s face, and in the standing position with flexion. We analyzed the usefulness of our five questions for diagnosing discogenic LBP, and performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to develop a diagnostic support tool. Results There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, except age, between the groups. There were significant differences between the groups for all five questions. In the age-adjusted analyses, the odds ratios of LBP after sitting too long, while standing after sitting too long, squirming in a chair after sitting too long, while washing one’s face, and in standing position with flexion were 10.5, 8.5, 4.0, 10.8, and 11.8, respectively. The integer scores were 11, 9, 4, 11, and 12, respectively, and the sum of the points of the five scores ranged from 0 to 47. Results of the ROC analysis were as follows: cut-off value, 31 points; area under the curve, 0.92302; sensitivity, 100%; and specificity, 71.4%. Conclusions All five questions were useful for diagnosing discogenic LBP. We established the scoring system as a support tool for diagnosing discogenic LBP."

The aim of the study was to introduce osteoarthritis (OA) in the GM by resecting the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR) according to Pond and Nuki, verified by histological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring as well as analysis of gene and protein expression.The eight included skeletally mature female GM were assessed after ACLR in the left and a sham operation in the right knee, which served as control. 26 weeks after surgery the knee joints were scanned using a 3-Tesla high-field MR tomography unit with a 3 T CP Large Flex Coil. Standard proton-density weighted fat saturated sequences in coronal and sagittal direction with a slice thickness of 3 mm were used. The MRI scans were assessed by two radiologists according to a modified WORMS-score, the X-rays of the knee joints by two evaluators. Osteochondral plugs with a diameter of 4mm were taken for histological examination from either the main loading zone or the macroscopic most degenerated parts of the tibia plateau or condyle respectively. The histological sections were blinded and scored by three experts according to Little et al. Gene expression analysis was performed from surrounding cartilage. Expression of adamts4, adamts5, acan, col1A1, col2, il-1ß, mmp1, mmp3, mmp13, vegf was determined by qRT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining (IH) of Col I and II was performed. IH was scored using a 4 point grading (0-no staining; 3-intense staining).Similar signs of OA were evident both in ACLR and sham operated knee joints with the histological scoring result of the ACLR joints with 6.48 ± 5.67 points and the sham joints with 6.86 ± 5.84 points (p = 0.7953) The MRI scoring yielded 0.34 ± 0.89 points for the ACLR and 0.03 ± 0.17 for the sham knee joints. There was no correlation between the histological and MRI scores (r = 0.10021). The gene expression profiles as well as the immunohistochemical findings showed no significant differences between ACLR and sham knee joints. In conclusion, both knee joints showed histological signs of OA after 26 weeks irrespective of whether the ACL was resected or not. As MRI results did not match the histological findings, MRI was obviously unsuitable to diagnose the OA in GM. The analysis of the expression patterns of the 10 genes could not shed light on the question, whether sham operation also induced cartilage erosion or if the degeneration was spontaneous. The modified Pond-Nuki model may be used with reservation in the adult minipig to induce an isolated osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2554762419,"Visinin-like protein 3 (VILIP-3) belongs to a family of Ca2+-myristoyl switch proteins that regulate signal transduction in the brain and retina. Here we analyze Ca2+ binding, characterize Ca2+-induced conformational changes, and determine the NMR structure of myristoylated VILIP-3. Three Ca2+ bind cooperatively to VILIP-3 at EF2, EF3 and EF4 (KD = 0.52 μM and Hill slope of 1.8). NMR assignments, mutagenesis and structural analysis indicate that the covalently attached myristoyl group is solvent exposed in Ca2+-bound VILIP-3, whereas Ca2+-free VILIP-3 contains a sequestered myristoyl group that interacts with protein residues (E26, Y64, V68), which are distinct from myristate contacts seen in other Ca2+-myristoyl switch proteins. The myristoyl group in VILIP-3 forms an unusual L-shaped structure that places the C14 methyl group inside a shallow protein groove, in contrast to the much deeper myristoyl binding pockets observed for recoverin, NCS-1 and GCAP1. Thus, the myristoylated VILIP-3 protein structure determined in this study is quite different from those of other known myristoyl switch proteins (recoverin, NCS-1, and GCAP1). We propose that myristoylation serves to fine tune the three-dimensional structures of neuronal calcium sensor proteins as a means of generating functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2554902345,"Chicken is recognized as an excellent model for studies of genetic mechanism of phenotypic and genomic evolution, with large effective population size and strong human-driven selection. In the present study, we performed Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) tests to identify significant core regions employing 600K SNP Chicken chip in an F2 population of 1,534 hens, which was derived from reciprocal crosses between White Leghorn and Dongxiang chicken. Results indicated that a total of 49,151 core regions with an average length of 9.79 Kb were identified, which occupied approximately 52.15% of genome across all autosomes, and 806 significant core regions attracted us mostly. Genes in candidate regions may experience positive selection and were considered to have possible influence on beneficial economic traits. A panel of genes including AASDHPPT, GDPD5, PAR3, SOX6, GPC1 and a signal pathway of AKT1 were detected with the most extreme P-values. Further enrichment analyses indicated that these genes were associated with immune function, sensory organ development and neurogenesis, and may have experienced positive selection in chicken. Moreover, some of core regions exactly overlapped with genes excavated in our previous GWAS, suggesting that these genes have undergone positive selection may affect egg production. Findings in our study could draw a comparatively integrate genome-wide map of selection signature in the chicken genome, and would be worthy for explicating the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic diversity in poultry breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2557139839,"Candida tropicalis is an important pathogen. Here we developed and evaluated a polymorphic multilocus microsatellite scheme employing novel genetic markers for genotyping of C. tropicalis. Using 10 isolates from 10 unique (separate) patients to screen over 4000 tandem repeats from the C. tropicalis genome (strain MYA-3404), six new candidate microsatellite loci (ctm1, ctm3, ctm8, ctm18, ctm24 and ctm26) were selected according to amplification success, observed polymorphisms and stability of flanking regions by preliminary testing. Two known microsatellite loci CT14 and URA3 were also studied. The 6-locus scheme was then tested against a set of 82 different isolates from 32 patients. Microsatellite genotypes of isolates from the same patient (two to five isolates per patient) were identical. The six loci produced eight to 17 allele types and identified 11 to 24 genotypes amongst 32 patients' isolates, achieving a discriminatory power (DP) of 0.76 to 0.97 (versus 0.78 for both CT14 and URA3 loci, respectively). Testing of a combination of only three loci, ctm1, ctm3 and ctm24, also achieved maximum typing efficiency (DP = 0.99, 29 genotypes). The microsatellite typing scheme had good correlation compared with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, although was slightly less discriminatory. The new six-locus microsatellite typing scheme is a potentially valuable tool for genotyping and investigating microevolution of C. tropicalis."
https://openalex.org/W2554554198,"Differentiated cells can be reprogrammed by transcription factors, and these factors that are responsible for successful reprogramming need to be further identified. Here, we show that the neuronal repressor RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is rich in porcine oocytes and requires for nuclear transfer (NT)-mediated reprogramming through inhibiting TGFβ signaling pathway. REST was dramatically degraded after oocyte activation, but the residual REST was incorporated into the transferred donor nuclei during reprogramming in NT embryos. Inhibition of REST function in oocytes compromised the development of NT embryos but not that of IVF and PA embryos. Bioinformation analysis of putative targets of REST indicated that REST might function on reprogramming in NT embryos by inhibiting TGFβ pathway. Further results showed that the developmental failure of REST-inhibited NT embryos could be rescued by treatment of SB431542, an inhibitor of TGFβ pathway. Thus, REST is a newly discovered transcription factor that is required for NT-mediated nuclear reprogramming."

https://openalex.org/W2556404863,"Amount of calling activity (calling effort) is a strong determinant of male mating success in species such as orthopterans and anurans that use acoustic communication in the context of mating behaviour. While many studies in crickets have investigated the determinants of calling effort, patterns of variability in male calling effort in natural choruses remain largely unexplored. Within-individual variability in calling activity across multiple nights of calling can influence female mate search and mate choice strategies. Moreover, calling site fidelity across multiple nights of calling can also affect the female mate sampling strategy. We therefore investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of acoustic signaling behaviour in a wild population of the field cricket species Plebeiogryllus guttiventris. We first studied the consistency of calling activity by quantifying variation in male calling effort across multiple nights of calling using repeatability analysis. Callers were inconsistent in their calling effort across nights and did not optimize nightly calling effort to increase their total number of nights spent calling. We also estimated calling site fidelity of males across multiple nights by quantifying movement of callers. Callers frequently changed their calling sites across calling nights with substantial displacement but without any significant directionality. Finally, we investigated trade-offs between within-night calling effort and energetically expensive calling song features such as call intensity and chirp rate. Calling effort was not correlated with any of the calling song features, suggesting that energetically expensive song features do not constrain male calling effort. The two key features of signaling behaviour, calling effort and call intensity, which determine the duration and spatial coverage of the sexual signal, are therefore uncorrelated and function independently."
