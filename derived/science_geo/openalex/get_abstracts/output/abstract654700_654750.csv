https://openalex.org/W3035833355,"Accurate, automated extraction of clinical stroke information from unstructured text has several important applications. ICD-9/10 codes can misclassify ischemic stroke events and do not distinguish acuity or location. Expeditious, accurate data extraction could provide considerable improvement in identifying stroke in large datasets, triaging critical clinical reports, and quality improvement efforts. In this study, we developed and report a comprehensive framework studying the performance of simple and complex stroke-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to determine presence, location, and acuity of ischemic stroke from radiographic text. We collected 60,564 Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiology reports from 17,864 patients from two large academic medical centers. We used standard techniques to featurize unstructured text and developed neurovascular specific word GloVe embeddings. We trained various binary classification algorithms to identify stroke presence, location, and acuity using 75% of 1,359 expert-labeled reports. We validated our methods internally on the remaining 25% of reports and externally on 500 radiology reports from an entirely separate academic institution. In our internal population, GloVe word embeddings paired with deep learning (Recurrent Neural Networks) had the best discrimination of all methods for our three tasks (AUCs of 0.96, 0.98, 0.93 respectively). Simpler NLP approaches (Bag of Words) performed best with interpretable algorithms (Logistic Regression) for identifying ischemic stroke (AUC of 0.95), MCA location (AUC 0.96), and acuity (AUC of 0.90). Similarly, GloVe and Recurrent Neural Networks (AUC 0.92, 0.89, 0.93) generalized better in our external test set than BOW and Logistic Regression for stroke presence, location and acuity, respectively (AUC 0.89, 0.86, 0.80). Our study demonstrates a comprehensive assessment of NLP techniques for unstructured radiographic text. Our findings are suggestive that NLP/ML methods can be used to discriminate stroke features from large data cohorts for both clinical and research-related investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3036113449,"The aim of the ACE-Obesity Policy study was to assess the economic credentials of a suite of obesity prevention policies across multiple sectors and areas of governance for the Australian setting. The study aimed to place the cost-effectiveness results within a broad decision-making context by providing an assessment of the key considerations for policy implementation. The Assessing Cost-Effectiveness (ACE) approach to priority-setting was used. Systematic literature reviews were undertaken to assess the evidence of intervention effectiveness on body mass index and/or physical activity for selected interventions. A standardised evaluation framework was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of each intervention compared to a ‘no intervention’ comparator, from a limited societal perspective. A multi-state life table Markov cohort model was used to estimate the long-term health impacts (quantified as health adjusted life years (HALYs)) and health care cost-savings resulting from each intervention. In addition to the technical cost-effectiveness results, qualitative assessments of implementation considerations were undertaken. All 16 interventions evaluated were found to be cost-effective (using a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD50,000 per HALY gained). Eleven interventions were dominant (health promoting and cost-saving). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the non-dominant interventions ranged from AUD1,728 to 28,703 per HALY gained. Regulatory interventions tended to rank higher on their cost-effectiveness results, driven by lower implementation costs. However, the program-based policy interventions were generally based on higher quality evidence of intervention effectiveness. This comparative analysis of the economic credentials of obesity prevention policies for Australia indicates that there are a broad range of policies that are likely to be cost-effective, although policy options vary in strength of evidence for effectiveness, affordability, feasibility, acceptability to stakeholders, equity impact and sustainability. Implementation of these policies will require sustained co-ordination across jurisdictions and multiple government sectors in order to generate the predicted health benefits for the Australian population."
https://openalex.org/W3035944395,"Although falls in older people are a major public health problem globally, to date there are scarce reports on socioeconomic risk factors for falls. The aim of the present study was to investigate the epidemiology of fall, its associated socioeconomic risk factors and relative importance among community-dwelling Korean elderly. Secondary analysis of national survey data with 31,684 community-dwelling Korean elderly was performed. Eleven socioeconomic factors (age, gender, household type, marital status, education level, current occupation, past occupation, income, wealth, number of children, and relationship satisfaction) were selected for analysing their associations with the epidemiology of fall through complex sample analysis and logistic regressions. Results showed that 15.9%~25.1% of community-dwelling Korean elderly experienced fall yearly. The groups with significantly higher fall risks were identified as older aged, being female, not married or widowed, less educated, unemployed, and having lower relationship satisfaction. Gender (adjusted odds ratio-AOR = 1.548) and relationship satisfaction (AOR = 1.276) were the utmost important fall risk factors, indicating being older female with lower relationship satisfaction were the foremost socioeconomic characteristics for risk of falling. These findings could contribute to better understanding of the socioeconomic fall risk profiles among Korean elderly and effective strategies for fall prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3036523679,"Background Communication and shared decision-making (SDM) are essential to patient-centered care. Hospital-based palliative care with patients with limited health literacy (LHL) poses particular demands on communication. In this context, patients’ emotions and vulnerable condition impact their skills to obtain, understand, process and apply information about health and healthcare even more. If healthcare providers (HCPs) meet these demands, it could enhance communication. In this study, HCPs were interviewed and asked for their strategies, barriers and suggestions for improvement regarding communication and SDM with LHL patients in hospital-based palliative care. Methods A qualitative interview study was conducted in 2018 in four Dutch hospitals with 17 HCPs—11 physicians and 6 nurses. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results In general HCPs recognized limited literacy as a concept, however, they did not recognize limited health literacy. Regarding SDM some HCPs were strong advocates, others did not believe in SDM as a concept and perceived it as unfeasible. Furthermore, five themes, acting as either strategies, barriers or suggestions for improvement emerged from the interviews: 1) time management; 2) HCPs’ communication skills; 3) information tailoring; 4) characteristics of patients and significant others; 5) the content of the medical information. Conclusions According to HCPs, more time to communicate with their patients could resolve the most prominent barriers emerged from this study. Further research should investigate the organizational possibilities for this and the actual effectiveness of additional time on effective communication and SDM. Additionally, more awareness for the concept of LHL is needed as a precondition for recognizing LHL. Furthermore, future research should be directed towards opportunities for tailoring communication, and the extent to which limited knowledge and complex information affect communication and SDM. This study provides first insights into perspectives of HCPs, indicating directions for research on communication, SDM and LHL in hospital-based palliative care."
https://openalex.org/W3036738576,"Bacterial blight (BB) and fungal blast diseases are the major biotic constraints that limit rice productivity. To sustain yield improvement in rice, it is necessary to developed yield potential of the rice varieties by incorporation of biotic stress resistance genes. Tellahamsa is a well-adapted popular high yielding rice variety in Telangana state, India. However, the variety is highly susceptible to BB and blast. In this study, simultaneous stepwise transfer of genes through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) strategy was used to introgress two major BB (Xa21 and xa13) and two major blast resistance genes (Pi54 and Pi1) into Tellahamsa. In each generation (from F1 to ICF3) foreground selection was done using gene-specific markers viz., pTA248 (Xa21), xa13prom (xa13), Pi54MAS (Pi54) and RM224 (Pi1). Two independent BC2F1 lines of Tellahamsa/ISM (Cross-I) and Tellahamsa/NLR145 (Cross-II) possessing 92% and 94% recurrent parent genome (RPG) respectively were intercrossed to develop ICF1-ICF3 generations. These gene pyramided lines were evaluated for key agro-morphological traits, quality, and resistance against blast at three different hotspot locations as well as BB at two locations. Two ICF3 gene pyramided lines viz., TH-625-159 and TH-625-491 possessing four genes exhibited a high level of resistance to BB and blast. In the future, these improved Tellahamsa lines could be developed as mega varieties for different agro-climatic zones and also as potential donors for different pre-breeding rice research."
https://openalex.org/W3036854050,"Male development, fertility, and lifelong health are all androgen-dependent. Approximately 95% of circulating testosterone is synthesized by the testis and the final step in this canonical pathway is controlled by the activity of the hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase-17-beta-3 (HSD17B3). To determine the role of HSD17B3 in testosterone production and androgenization during male development and function we have characterized a mouse model lacking HSD17B3. The data reveal that developmental masculinization and fertility are normal in mutant males. Ablation of HSD17B3 inhibits hyperstimulation of testosterone production by hCG, although basal testosterone levels are maintained despite the absence of HSD17B3. Reintroduction of HSD17B3 via gene-delivery to Sertoli cells in adulthood partially rescues the adult phenotype, showing that, as in development, different cell-types in the testis are able to work together to produce testosterone. Together, these data show that HS17B3 acts as a rate-limiting-step for the maximum level of testosterone production by the testis but does not control basal testosterone production. Measurement of other enzymes able to convert androstenedione to testosterone identifies HSD17B12 as a candidate enzyme capable of driving basal testosterone production in the testis. Together, these findings expand our understanding of testosterone production in males."
https://openalex.org/W3036205598,"Psychobiotics correspond to a class of probiotics, mainly of the genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, capable of producing neuroactive substances, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin, which exert effects on the brain-gut axis. Evidence suggests that psychobiotics can have a beneficial effect on mood, anxiety and cognition. The present study evaluated the effects of chronic administration of two new strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. plantarum 286 (Lp 286) and L. plantarum 81 (Lp 81) isolated from the fermentation of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) and cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum), respectively, on cognitive, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in male Swiss mice. Different groups of animals were administered (oral gavage) solutions of vehicle (0.85% saline plus 15% skim milk), Lp 286 (109/0.1 ml CFU) or Lp 81 (109/0.1 ml CFU) for 30 days, and animals were tested for general locomotor activity, depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test, and learning/memory and anxiety-like behavior in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task. Treatment with the strains Lp 286 and Lp 81 did not interfere with locomotor activity or learning and memory. The Lp 286 strain exerted anti-depressant- and anxiolytic-like effects under our experimental conditions. Our findings add to the current body of evidence suggesting that probiotics from the genus Lactobacillus may exert psychobiotic potential and introduce a new strain, Lp 286, as a potential candidate in the prevention or as therapeutic adjuvant in the treatment of mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3036977614,"Sanguinarine is a bioactive compound as a quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloid from plant of the Macleaya cordata, Papaveraceae family. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary sanguinarine supplementation on growth performance, serum biochemistry parameters, intestinal mucosal morphology and gut microbiome in yellow feathered broilers. Two hundred and seventy 1-d-old female broilers were randomly assigned to 3 treatments ① Basal diet (NG); ② Basal diet containing bacitracin methylene disalicylate (50mg/Kg diet) (ANT); ③ Basal diet containing sanguinarine (0.7 mg/ kg of feed) (SAG). The statistical results showed that dietary sanguinarine supplementation enhanced growth performance and decreased glucose, uric acid as well as urea nitrogen levels of broilers at 28d of age (P<0.05). The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that sanguinarine significantly decreased the species from the phyla Bacteroidetes, and increased the species from phyla Firmicutes. Moreover, dietary sanguinarine supplementation improved mucosal morphology to achieve higher ratio of intestinal villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05), and decreased the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-4 in jejunum mucosal. This study demonstrated that sanguinarine supplementation in the diet of yellow feathered broilers improved intestinal morphology and microbiota community structure to promote growth performance on 1-28d."
https://openalex.org/W3035844002,"The benefits of inhaling hydrogen gas (H2) have been widely reported but its pharmacokinetics have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. We developed a new experimental system in pigs to closely evaluate the process by which H2 is absorbed in the lungs, enters the bloodstream, and is distributed, metabolized, and excreted. We inserted and secured catheters into the carotid artery (CA), portal vein (PV), and supra-hepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) to allow repeated blood sampling and performed bilateral thoracotomy to collapse the lungs. Then, using a hydrogen-absorbing alloy canister, we filled the lungs to the maximum inspiratory level with 100% H2. The pig was maintained for 30 seconds without resuming breathing, as if they were holding their breath. We collected blood from the three intravascular catheters after 0, 3, 10, 30, and 60 minutes and measured H2 concentration by gas chromatography. H2 concentration in the CA peaked immediately after breath holding; 3 min later, it dropped to 1/40 of the peak value. Peak H2 concentrations in the PV and IVC were 40% and 14% of that in the CA, respectively. However, H2 concentration decay in the PV and IVC (half-life: 310 s and 350 s, respectively) was slower than in the CA (half-life: 92 s). At 10 min, H2 concentration was significantly higher in venous blood than in arterial blood. At 60 min, H2 was detected in the portal blood at a concentration of 6.9–53 nL/mL higher than at steady state, and in the SVC 14–29 nL/mL higher than at steady state. In contrast, H2 concentration in the CA decreased to steady state levels. This is the first report showing that inhaled H2 is transported to the whole body by advection diffusion and metabolized dynamically."
https://openalex.org/W3036775917,"Synaptic plasticity is the cellular basis of learning and memory. When animals learn a novel motor skill, synaptic modifications are induced in the primary motor cortex (M1), and new postsynaptic dendritic spines relevant to motor memory are formed in the early stage of learning. However, it is poorly understood how presynaptic axonal boutons are formed, eliminated, and maintained during motor learning, and whether long-range corticocortical and thalamocortical axonal boutons show distinct structural changes during learning. In this study, we conducted two-photon imaging of presynaptic boutons of long-range axons in layer 1 (L1) of the mouse M1 during the 7-day learning of an accelerating rotarod task. The training-period-averaged rate of formation of boutons on axons projecting from the secondary motor cortical area increased, while the average rate of elimination of those from the motor thalamus (thalamic boutons) decreased. In particular, the elimination rate of thalamic boutons during days 4–7 was lower than that in untrained mice, and the fraction of pre-existing thalamic boutons that survived until day 7 was higher than that in untrained mice. Our results suggest that the late stabilization of thalamic boutons in M1 contributes to motor skill learning."
https://openalex.org/W3035839517,"Representatives of the marine dinophyte family Amphidomataceae produce lipophilic phycotoxins called azaspiracids (AZA) which may cause azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP) in humans after consumption of contaminated seafood. Three of the four known toxigenic species are observed frequently in the eastern North Atlantic. In 2018, a research survey was performed to strengthen knowledge on the distribution and abundance of toxigenic Amphidomataceae and their respective toxins in Irish coastal waters and in the North Sea. Species-specific quantification of the three toxigenic species (Azadinium spinosum, Azadinium poporum and Amphidoma languida) was based on recently developed qPCR assays, whose performance was successfully validated and tested with specificity tests and spike experiments. The multi-method approach of on-board live microscopy, qPCR assays and chemical AZA-analysis revealed the presence of Amphidomataceae in the North Atlantic including the three targeted toxigenic species and their respective AZA analogues (AZA-1, -2, -33, -38, -39). Azadinium spinosum was detected at the majority of Irish stations with a peak density of 8.3 x 104 cells L-1 and AZA (AZA-1, -2, -33) abundances up to 1,274 pg L-1. Amphidoma languida was also present at most Irish stations but appeared in highest abundance in a bloom at a central North Sea station with a density of 1.2 x 105 cells L-1 and an AZA (AZA-38, -39) abundances of 618 pg L-1. Azadinium poporum was detected sporadically at the Irish south coast and North Sea and was rather low in abundance during this study. The results confirmed the wide distribution and frequent occurrence of the target species in the North Atlantic area and revealed, for the first time, bloom abundances of toxigenic Amphidomataceae in this area. This emphasizes the importance of future studies and monitoring of amphidomatacean species and their respective AZA analogues in the North Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W3036071919,"Genomic prediction (GP) is expected to become a powerful technology for accelerating the genetic improvement of complex crop traits. Several GP models have been proposed to enhance their applications in plant breeding, including environmental effects and genotype-by-environment interactions (G×E). In this study, we proposed a two-step model for plant biomass prediction wherein environmental information and growth-related traits were considered. First, the growth-related traits were predicted by GP. Second, the biomass was predicted from the GP-predicted values and environmental data using machine learning or crop growth modeling. We applied the model to a 2-year-old field trial dataset of recombinant inbred lines of japonica rice and evaluated the prediction accuracy with training and testing data by cross-validation performed over two years. Therefore, the proposed model achieved an equivalent or a higher correlation between the observed and predicted values (0.53 and 0.65 for each year, respectively) than the model in which biomass was directly predicted by GP (0.40 and 0.65 for each year, respectively). This result indicated that including growth-related traits enhanced accuracy of biomass prediction. Our findings are expected to contribute to the spread of the use of GP in crop breeding by enabling more precise prediction of environmental effects on crop traits."
https://openalex.org/W3036365623,"Geobacter spp. enrichment biofilms were cultivated in batch using one-chamber and two-chamber bioelectrochemical reactors. Time-resolved substrate quantification was performed to derive physiological parameters as well as incremental coulombic efficiency (i.e., coulombic efficiency during one batch cycle, here every 6h) during early stage biofilm development. The results of one-chamber reactors revealed an intermediate acetate increase putatively due to the presence of acetogens. Total coulombic efficiencies of two-chamber reactors were considerable lower (19.6±8.3% and 49.3±13.2% for 1st and 2nd batch cycle, respectively) compared to usually reported values of mature Geobacter spp. enrichment biofilms presumably reflecting energetic requirements for biomass production (i.e., cells and extracellular polymeric substances) during early stages of biofilm development. The incremental coulombic efficiency exhibits considerable changes during batch cycles indicating shifts between phases of maximizing metabolic rates and maximizing biomass yield. Analysis based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics yielded maximum substrate uptake rates (vmax,Ac, vmax,I) and half-saturation concentration coefficients (KM,Ac,KM,I) based on acetate uptake or current production, respectively. The latter is usually reported in literature but neglects energy demands for biofilm growth and maintenance as well as acetate and electron storage. From 1st to 2nd batch cycle, vmax,Ac and KM,Ac, decreased from 0.0042–0.0051 mmol Ac− h−1 cm−2 to 0.0031–0.0037 mmol Ac− h−1 cm−2 and 1.02–2.61 mM Ac− to 0.28–0.42 mM Ac−, respectively. Furthermore, differences between KM,Ac/KM,I and vmax,Ac/vmax,I were observed providing insights into the physiology of Geobacter spp. enrichment biofilms. Notably, KM,I considerably scattered while vmax,Ac/vmax,I and KM,Ac remained rather stable indicating that acetate transport within biofilm only marginally affects reaction rates. The observed data variation mandates the requirement of a more detailed analysis with an improved experimental system, e.g., using flow conditions and a comparison with Geobacter spp. pure cultures."
https://openalex.org/W3035938467,"The slow afterhyperpolarising current, sIAHP, is a Ca2+-dependent current that plays an important role in the late phase of spike frequency adaptation. sIAHP is activated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, while the contribution of calcium from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores, released by calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), is controversial in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Three types of ryanodine receptors (RyR1-3) are expressed in the hippocampus, with RyR3 showing a predominant expression in CA1 neurons. We investigated the specific role of CICR, and particularly of its RyR3-mediated component, in the regulation of the sIAHP amplitude and time course, and the activity-dependent potentiation of the sIAHP in rat and mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here we report that enhancement of CICR by caffeine led to an increase in sIAHP amplitude, while inhibition of CICR by ryanodine caused a small, but significant reduction of sIAHP. Inhibition of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores by ryanodine or depletion by the SERCA pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid caused a substantial attenuation in the sIAHP activity-dependent potentiation in both rat and mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. Neurons from mice lacking RyR3 receptors exhibited a sIAHP with features undistinguishable from wild-type neurons, which was similarly reduced by ryanodine. However, the lack of RyR3 receptors led to a faster and reduced activity-dependent potentiation of sIAHP. We conclude that ryanodine receptor-mediated CICR contributes both to the amplitude of the sIAHP at steady state and its activity-dependent potentiation in rat and mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In particular, we show that RyR3 receptors play an essential and specific role in shaping the activity-dependent potentiation of the sIAHP. The modulation of activity-dependent potentiation of sIAHP by RyR3-mediated CICR contributes to plasticity of intrinsic neuronal excitability and is likely to play a critical role in higher cognitive functions, such as learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W3036941872,"Cyclin Dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9) associates with Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Domain (BET) proteins to promote transcriptional elongation by phosphorylation of serine 2 of RNAP II C-terminal domain. We examined the therapeutic potential of selective CDK9 inhibitors (AZD 4573 and MC180295) against human multiple myeloma cells in vitro. Short-hairpin RNA silencing of CDK9 in Multiple Myeloma (MM) cell lines reduced cell viability compared to control cells showing the dependency of MM cells on CDK9. In order to explore synergy with the CDK9 inhibitor, proteolysis targeting chimeric molecule (PROTAC) ARV 825 was added. This latter drug causes ubiquitination of BET proteins resulting in their rapid and efficient degradation. Combination treatment of MM cells with ARV 825 and AZD 4573 markedly reduced their protein expression of BRD 2, BRD 4, MYC and phosphorylated RNA pol II as compared to each single agent alone. Combination treatment synergistically inhibited multiple myeloma cells both in vitro and in vivo with insignificant weight loss. The combination also resulted in marked increase of apoptotic cells at low dose compared to single agent alone. Taken together, our studies show for the first time that the combination of a BET PROTAC (ARV 825) plus AZD 4573 (CDK9 inhibitor) is effective against MM cells."
https://openalex.org/W3036055552,"Introduction Research on research is key to enhancing efficacy in trial methodology. Clinical trials involving women during pregnancy and childbirth are limited, with a paucity of data guiding evidence-based practice. Following a prioritisation exercise that highlighted the top-ten unanswered recruitment questions, this qualitative evidence synthesis was designed specifically to focus on the barriers and enablers for clinicians/healthcare professionals in helping conduct randomised trials within the context of recruitment during pregnancy and childbirth. Methods The synthesis was undertaken using Thomas and Harden’s three stage thematic synthesis method and reported following the ENTREQ guidelines. Using a pre-determined SPIDER strategy, we conducted a comprehensive search of databases; Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and grey searches for records until January 2019. We included all reports of qualitative data on recruiter’s experiences, perceptions, views of recruiting women during pregnancy and childbirth to clinical trials. Altogether 13,401 records were screened, resulting in 31 full-text reviews, of which five were eligible for inclusion. Quality was appraised using CASP. Data were extracted onto a specifically defined form. We used thematic synthesis to identify descriptive and analytical themes, and to interpret and generate theory. Confidence was assessed using GRADE-CERQual. The review protocol is publicly available (OSF https://osf.io/g4dt9/). Results Five papers (representing four individual studies) from two different countries were included. All studies focused on the experiences of trial recruiters in the maternity setting. We identified four analytical themes; Recruitment through a clinician’s lens, Recruiters judgement on acceptability, From protocol to recruiters lived experience, Framing recruitment in context. These were linked by an overarching theme combining beliefs and power. Conclusion The overarching theme combining beliefs and power links the experiences and perceptions of recruiters. This synthesis shows a gap between the trial design study protocol and the recruiter’s lived experience. Strategies such as collaborative trial design, mitigating gatekeeping behaviours, and training may support recruiters in their endeavour."
https://openalex.org/W3036176956,"The purpose of this cohort study is to compare newborn hearing screening (NHS) results between healthy newborns and neonates who were admitted to the neonate intensive care unit (NICU) for more than 5 days based on the national database for 9 years. Ultimately, we've tried to analyze the associated factors necessary to manage the national NHS program according to the group, which would help to establish policy to effectively detect and support hearing impaired children and which would help to control qualities.The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) introduced a nationwide coupon-mediated program for the low-income class since 2009. The coupon consisted of two parts, the screening part and the confirming parts with the same unique number, and the MHW supported the cost of one screening test and one diagnostic auditory brainstem response (ABR) test for infants who did not pass from the screening test. We have analyzed the screening test performing rate, the referral rate according to the screening methods or institutions, the prevalence of hearing loss, and the average age of hearing loss diagnosis. Hearing loss was defined as any hearing impairment either unilateral or bilateral with the hearing threshold ≥ 40 dB nHL on the diagnostic ABR test, irrespective of its etiology.A total of 524,371 newborns were enrolled in the study, and 506,634 (96.6%) neonates were in the ""well-baby group (WBG)"", while 17,737 (3.4%) were in the ""high-risk group (HRG)"". The referral rate of the screening test was 1.5% in average, 1.3% in the WBG, and 7.5% in the HRG. The referral rates varied according to the screening methods and screening institutions. The adjusted prevalence of HL was 5.6/1,000 in average, 4.6/1,000 in the WBC, and 28.8/1,000 in the HRG. The screening tests were performed 4.3 ± 6.7 days after birth and the diagnostic tests were done 62.7 ± 37.5 days after birth in WBG. In HRG, dates were 17.7 ± 19.3 days and 97.6 ± 51.4 days, respectively.The prevalence of hearing loss in infants who were hospitalized in NICU for more than 5 days was about seven times higher than that in healthy newborns. However, different referral rates were noted depending on both institutions and the screening methods. These differences need to be addressed in order to improve our program and ensure that all neonates with hearing loss, especially neonates with high risk factor, are detected and appropriately referred for the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3036247449,"Age-reading of fish otoliths (ear stones) is important for the sustainable management of fish resources. However, the procedure is challenging and requires experienced readers to carefully examine annual growth zones. In a recent study, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been demonstrated to perform reasonably well on automatically predicting fish age from otolith images. In the present study, we carefully investigate the prediction rule learned by such neural networks to provide insight into the features that identify certain fish age ranges. For this purpose, a recent technique for visualizing and analyzing the predictions of the neural networks was applied to different versions of the otolith images. The results indicate that supplementary knowledge about the internal structure improves the results for the youngest age groups, compared to using only the contour shape attribute of the otolith. However, the contour shape and size attributes are, in general, sufficient for older age groups. In addition, within specific age ranges we find that the network tends to focus on particular areas of the otoliths and that the most discriminating factors seem to be related to the central part and the outer edge of the otolith. Explaining age predictions from otolith images as done in this study will hopefully help build confidence in the potential of deep learning algorithms for automatic age prediction, as well as improve the quality of the age estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3036900124,"If a laboratory animal survives an experiment without lasting compromised welfare, its future must be negotiated. Rehoming may be a consideration. This paper reports on research findings that provide an indication of the uptake of animal rehoming by UK facilities and the associated moral, ethical, practical and regulatory considerations that inform decisions to rehome or not. This research addresses a widely acknowledged gap in the literature to understand both the numbers, and types of animals rehomed from UK research facilities, as well as the main motivations for engaging in the practice, and the barriers for those facilities not currently rehoming. From the ~160 UK research facilities in the UK, 41 facilities completed the questionnaire, giving a response rate of approximately 25%. Results suggest rehoming occurs routinely, yet the numbers are small; just 2322 animals are known to have been rehomed between 2015-2017. At least 1 in 10 facilities are rehoming. There exists a clear preference for the rehoming of some species (mainly cats, dogs and horses) over others (rodents, agricultural animals and primates). Indeed, although 94.15% of species kept in laboratories are rodents, they make up under a fifth (19.14%) of all animals known to be rehomed between 2015-2017. The primary motivation for rehoming is to boost staff morale and promote a positive ethical profile for the facility. Barriers include concern for the animal's welfare following rehoming, high scientific demand for animals that leaves few to be rehomed, and, finally, certain animals (mainly those genetically modified) are simply unsuited to rehoming. The findings of this research will support facilities choosing to rehome, as well as those that are not currently engaging in the practice. By promoting the practice, the benefits to rehoming in terms of improving laboratory animal's quality of life, helping facility staff to overcome the moral stress of killing, and addressing public concern regarding the fate of laboratory animals, can be attained. It is only once an understanding of rehoming from the perspective of UK research facilities has been ascertained, that appropriate policy and support can be provided."
https://openalex.org/W3036942184,"Recently DNA sequencing analysis has played a vital role in the unambiguous diagnosis of clinically suspected patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a monogenic, X-linked, recessive, degenerative pediatric neuromuscular disorder affecting males, invariably leading to fatal cardiopulmonary failure. Early and precise diagnosis of the disease is an essential part of an effective disease management strategy as care guidelines and prevention through counseling need to be initiated at the earliest particularly since therapies are now available for a subset of patients. In this manuscript we report the DMD gene mutational profiles of 961 clinically suspected male DMD patients, 99% of whom were unrelated. We utilized a molecular diagnostic approach which is cost-effective for most patients and follows a systematic process that sequentially involves identification of hotspot deletions using mPCR, large deletions and duplications using MLPA and small insertions/ deletions and point mutations using an NGS muscular dystrophy gene panel. Pathogenic DMD gene mutations were identified in 84% of patients. Our data compared well with the frequencies and distribution of deletions and duplications reported in the DMD gene in other published studies. We also describe a number of rare in-frame mutations, which appeared to be enriched in the 5' proximal hotspot region of the DMD gene. Furthermore, we identified a family with a rare non-contiguous deletion mutation in the DMD gene where three males were affected and two females were deemed carriers. A subset of patients with mutations in the DMD gene who are likely to benefit therapeutically from new FDA and EMA approved drugs were found in our cohort. Given that the burden of care for DMD patients invariably falls on the mothers, particularly in rural India, effective genetic counseling followed by carrier screening is crucial for prevention of this disorder. We analyzed the carrier status of consented female relatives of 463 probands to gauge the percentage of patients with familial disease. Our analysis revealed 43.7% of mothers with DMD gene mutations. Our comprehensive efforts, involving complete genetic testing coupled with compassionate genetic counseling provided to DMD patients and their families, are intended to improve the quality of life of DMD patients and to empower carrier females to make informed reproductive choices to impede the propagation of this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W3036536530,"Osteocytes, the bone cells embedded in the mineralized matrix, control bone modeling, and remodeling through direct contact with adjacent cells and via paracrine and endocrine factors that affect cells in the bone marrow microenvironment or distant organs. Osteocytes express numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and thus mice lacking the stimulatory subunit of G-protein (Gsα) in osteocytes (Dmp1-GsαKO mice) have abnormal myelopoiesis, osteopenia, and reduced adipose tissue. We previously reported that the severe osteopenia and the changes in adipose tissue present in these mice were mediated by increased sclerostin, which suppress osteoblast functions and promote browning of white adipocytes. Inversely, the myeloproliferation was driven by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and administration of neutralizing antibodies against G-CSF only partially restored the myeloproliferation, suggesting that additional osteocyte-derived factors might be involved. We hypothesized that osteocytes secrete Gsα-dependent factor(s) which regulate the myeloid cells proliferation. To identify osteocyte-secreted proteins, we used the osteocytic cell line Ocy454 expressing or lacking Gsα expression (Ocy454-Gsαcont and Ocy454-GsαKO) to delineate the osteocyte “secretome” and its regulation by Gsα. Here we reported that factors secreted by osteocytes increased the number of myeloid colonies and promoted macrophage proliferation. The proliferation of myeloid cells was further promoted by osteocytes lacking Gsα expression. Myeloid cells can differentiate into bone-resorbing osteoclasts, therefore, we hypothesized that osteocyte-secreted factors might also regulate osteoclastogenesis in a Gsα-dependent manner. Conditioned medium (CM) from Ocy454 (both Gsαcont and GsαKO) significanlty increased the proliferation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) and, at the same time, inhibited their differentiation into mature osteoclasts via a Gsα-dependent mechanism. Proteomics analysis of CM from Ocy454 Gsαcont and GsαKO cells identified neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) and granulin (Grn) as osteocytic-secreted proteins upregulated in Ocy454-GsαKO cells compared to Ocy454-Gsαcont, whereas semaphorin3A was significantly suppressed. Treatment of Ocy454-Gsαcont cells with recombinant proteins or knockdown of Nrp-1 and Grn in Ocy454-GsαKO cells partially rescued the inhibition of osteoclasts, demonstrating that osteocytes control osteoclasts differentiation through Nrp-1 and Grn which are regulated by Gsα signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3036710933,"Background The ribcage and diaphragm are mechanical barriers for laparoscopic access during hepatectomy. Here, we introduce the varied application of intercostal trans-diaphragmatic ports during laparoscopic hepatectomy, and describe the management of intercostal ports with key technical points. Methods From January 2013 to December 2017, 180 patients underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy. In 32 of these patients (17.8%), intercostal ports (31 right and one left) were applied, and we analyzed the feasibility and safety of intercostal ports during laparoscopic hepatectomy. Results The main tumor location was segment VII and VIII (78%). The major type of laparoscopic hepatectomy was partial hepatectomy (91%). In the majority of cases (66%) the number and size of intercostal trocars was a single 5-mm port. The median operative time and blood loss were 232 min and 50 mL, respectively. A chest drain was placed via the hole of the intercostal port on the chest wall in two cases (6.3%). The median duration of the post-operative hospital stay was 6 days. There was no conversion, and a pure laparoscopic hepatectomy was achieved in all cases. There was no mortality. As for complications due to the application of intercostal ports, an asymptomatic pneumothorax was detected in only one case, and it was cured by conservative treatment. Conclusions The ribcage and diaphragm could be overcome as barriers to laparoscopic access by the placement of intercostal ports with minimal access during laparoscopic hepatectomy. The use of an intercostal port and proper management allows for a feasible approach and safe resection during laparoscopic hepatectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3036370668,"Background Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses are increasingly important public health problems. Burning vegetation, leaves, and other plant products have been shown to be effective mosquito repellents for their vector, Aedes spp., but there has been scant research on whether firewood cooking smoke in households influences mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases. About 2.9 billion people worldwide use biomass fuel for household cooking and heating, resulting in an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually from household air pollution (HAP)-related diseases. Global health agencies now encourage households to transition from biomass to clean fuels, but it is unclear whether such interventions may actually increase risk for mosquito-borne diseases. This retrospective case-control study evaluated associations between arboviral infections and cooking with firewood in Santa Rosa, Guatemala. Method Vigilancia Integrada Comunitaria (VICo) was a prospective public health surveillance system for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of diarrheal, neurological, respiratory, and febrile illnesses in hospitals and clinics in the department of Santa Rosa, Guatemala. Enrolled VICo in-patients and out-patients during 2011–2018 were interviewed using standardized questionnaires on demographics and household characteristics. Blood and stool specimens were collected and tested to identify the etiologies presenting symptoms. Cases were defined as laboratory-positive for dengue, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections. Controls were laboratory-positive for bacterial and viral diarrheal illnesses (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, or astrovirus). Cooking with firewood, kitchen location, stove type, and firewood cooking frequency were the independent exposure variables. Logistic regression models were used to analyze unadjusted and adjusted associations between arboviral infections and exposures of interest. Result There were 311 arboviral cases and 1,239 diarrheal controls. Arboviral infections were inversely associated with cooking with firewood in the main house (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08–0.57), cooking with firewood on an open hearth (AOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33–0.78), and cooking with firewood ≥5 times per week (AOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36–0.81), adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status index, number of people per household, community population density, community elevation, recruitment location, season, and admission year. Conclusion Several primary determinants of HAP exposure were inversely associated with arboviral infections. Additional studies are needed to understand whether interventions to reduce HAP might actually increase risk for mosquito-borne infectious diseases, which would warrant improved education and mosquito control efforts in conjunction with fuel interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3036442232,"In early life and around weaning, pigs are at risk of developing infectious diseases which compromise animal welfare and have major economic consequences for the pig industry. A promising strategy to enhance resistance against infectious diseases is immunomodulation by feed additives. To assess the immune stimulating potential of feed additives in vitro, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were used. These cells play a central role in the innate and adaptive immune system and are the first cells encountered by antigens that pass the epithelial barrier. Two different feed additives were tested on dendritic cells cultured from fresh and cryopreserved bone marrow cells; a widely used commercial feed additive based on yeast-derived β-glucans and the gram-negative probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917. E. coli Nissle 1917, but not β-glucans, induced a dose-dependent upregulation of the cell maturation marker CD80/86, whereas both feed additives induced a dose-dependent production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10. Furthermore, E. coli Nissle 1917 consistently induced higher levels of cytokine production than β-glucans. These immunomodulatory responses could be assessed by fresh as well as cryopreserved in vitro cultured porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that both β-glucans and E. coli Nissle 1917 are able to enhance dendritic cell maturation, but in a differential manner. A more mature dendritic cell phenotype could contribute to a more efficient response to infections. Moreover, both fresh and cryopreserved bone marrow-derived dendritic cells can be used as in vitro pre-screening tools which enable an evidence based prediction of the potential immune stimulating effects of different feed additives."
https://openalex.org/W3036978204,"The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has been the primary target for the development of a protective vaccine against infection. The extensive N-linked glycosylation on Env is an important consideration as it may affect efficacy, stability, and expression yields. The expression host has been shown to influence the extent and type of glycosylation that decorates the protein target. Here, we report the glycosylation profile of the candidate subtype C immunogen CO6980v0c22 gp145, which is currently in Phase I clinical trials, produced in two different host cells: CHO-K1 and Expi293F. The amino acid sequence for both glycoproteins was confirmed to be identical by peptide mass fingerprinting. However, the isoelectric point of the proteins differed; 4.5-5.5 and 6.0-7.0 for gp145 produced in CHO-K1 and Expi293F, respectively. These differences in pI were eliminated by enzymatic treatment with sialidase, indicating a large difference in the incorporation of sialic acid between hosts. This dramatic difference in the number of sialylated glycans between hosts was confirmed by analysis of PNGase F-released glycans using MALDI-ToF MS. These differences in glycosylation, however, did not greatly translate into differences in antibody recognition. Biosensor assays showed that gp145 produced in CHO-K1 had similar affinity toward the broadly neutralizing antibodies, 2G12 and PG16, as the gp145 produced in Expi293F. Additionally, both immunogens showed the same reactivity against plasma of HIV-infected patients. Taken together, these results support the notion that there are sizeable differences in the glycosylation of Env depending on the expression host. How these differences translate to vaccine efficacy remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W3036237091,"When looking at a speaking person, the analysis of facial kinematics contributes to language discrimination and to the decoding of the time flow of visual speech. To disentangle these two factors, we investigated behavioural and fMRI responses to familiar and unfamiliar languages when observing speech gestures with natural or reversed kinematics. Twenty Italian volunteers viewed silent video-clips of speech shown as recorded (Forward, biological motion) or reversed in time (Backward, non-biological motion), in Italian (familiar language) or Arabic (non-familiar language). fMRI revealed that language (Italian/Arabic) and time-rendering (Forward/Backward) modulated distinct areas in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, suggesting that visual speech analysis begins in this region, earlier than previously thought. Left premotor ventral (superior subdivision) and dorsal areas were preferentially activated with the familiar language independently of time-rendering, challenging the view that the role of these regions in speech processing is purely articulatory. The left premotor ventral region in the frontal operculum, thought to include part of the Broca’s area, responded to the natural familiar language, consistent with the hypothesis of motor simulation of speech gestures."
https://openalex.org/W3036475477,"Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease, affecting up to 3% of the global population. Accumulating evidence suggests that the complement system is involved in its pathogenesis. Our previous study revealed that the C5a/C5aR1 pathway is crucial for disease development. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. To explore potential mechanisms, psoriatic skin lesions and histological changes were assessed following imiquimod (IMQ) cream treatment. Inflammatory cytokine expression was tested by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were used to identify inflammatory cell infiltration and interleukin (IL-17A) IL-17A expression. A C5aR1 antagonist (C5aR1a) and PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) were used for blocking experiments (both in vivo and in vitro) to explore the mechanism. C5a/C5aR1-pathway inhibition significantly attenuated psoriasis-like skin lesions with decreased epidermal hyperplasia, downregulated type 17-related inflammatory gene expression, and reduced IL-17A-producing γδ-T cell responses. Mechanistically, C5a/C5aR1 promoted the latter phenotype via PI3K-Akt signaling. Consistently, C5aR1 deficiency clearly ameliorated IMQ-induced chronic psoriasiform dermatitis, with a significant decrease in IL-17A expression. Finally, blocking C5aR1 signaling further decreased psoriasiform skin inflammation in IL-17-deficient mice. Results suggest that C5a/C5aR1 mediates experimental psoriasis and skin inflammation by upregulating IL-17A expression from γδ-T cells. Blocking C5a/C5aR1/IL-17A axis is expected to be a promising strategy for psoriasis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3036483391,"Aging in mammals is the gradual decline of an organism's physical, mental, and physiological capacity. Aging leads to increased risk for disease and eventually to death. Here, we show that Brd2 haploinsufficiency (Brd2+/-) extends lifespan and increases healthspan in C57B6/J mice. In Brd2+/- mice, longevity is increased by 23% (p<0.0001), and, relative to wildtype animals (Brd2+/+), cancer incidence is reduced by 43% (p<0.001). In addition, relative to age-matched wildtype mice, Brd2 heterozygotes show healthier aging including: improved grooming, extended period of fertility, and lack of age-related decline in kidney function and morphology. Our data support a role for haploinsufficiency of Brd2 in promoting healthy aging. We hypothesize that Brd2 affects aging by protecting against the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage. Given the recent advances in the development of BET inhibitors, our research provides impetus to test drugs that target BRD2 as a way to understand and treat/prevent age-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3036540735,"Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental condition causing reduced vision, for which programmes of whole population child vision screening exist throughout the world. There is an ongoing debate about the value of screening due to the lack of evidence about meaningful functional impacts of amblyopia. Our objective was to determine whether amblyopia is associated with school readiness and early cognitive performance.Data from the prospective Millennium Cohort Study of children born in the United Kingdom in 2000-01 and followed-up to age 7 years (n = 13,967). Using parental self-report on eye conditions and treatment coded by clinical reviewers, participants were grouped into no eye conditions, strabismus alone, refractive amblyopia, or strabismic/mixed (refractive plus strabismic) amblyopia. The outcomes were poor school readiness using Bracken School Readiness Assessment <25th percentile (age 3); and cognitive tests and their age-related trajectories using British Ability Scale II Naming Vocabulary (ages 3/5) and Pattern Construction (ages 5/7). Multivariable analyses showed that compared to children without any eye conditions, only those with strabismic/mixed amblyopia had an increased risk of poor school readiness (OR = 2.04, 95%CI 1.09-3.82). Small differences in mean scores for NV and PC of children with amblyopia (all types) compared to those without any eye condition were not clinically significant (>10 points) irrespective of whether treatment had already started. The age-related cognitive trajectories of children with amblyopia did not differ from those without any eye conditions for either NV (p = 0.62) or PC (p = 0.51). These associations are at population rather than individual level, so it might be that some individuals with amblyopia did experience significant adverse outcomes that are not captured by summary statistics.Amblyopia is not significantly associated with adverse cognitive performance and trajectories in early schooling and there is no evidence that this is due to a mediating effect of treatment. Although amblyopia combined with strabismus is associated with poor school readiness, this is not translated into poor cognitive performance. These novel findings may explain the lack of association reported between amblyopia and educational outcomes in adult life and suggest that the impact of amblyopia on education is not of itself a justification for whole population child vision screening aimed at detecting this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3036660684,"The leading cause of death in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is right ventricular (RV) failure. The tumor suppressor p53 has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and remodeling but its role in RV hypertrophy (RVH) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pharmacological activation of p53 by Quinacrine affects RV remodeling and function in the pulmonary artery banding (PAB) model of compensated RVH in mice. The effects of p53 activation on cellular functions were studied in isolated cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells (ECs). The expression of p53 was examined both on human RV tissues from patients with compensated and decompensated RVH and in mouse RV tissues early and late after the PAB. As compared to control human RVs, there was no change in p53 expression in compensated RVH, while a marked upregulation was found in decompensated RVH. Similarly, in comparison to SHAM-operated mice, unaltered RV p53 expression 7 days after PAB, was markedly induced 21 days after the PAB. Quinacrine induced p53 accumulation did not further deteriorate RV function at day 7 after PAB. Quinacrine administration did not increase EC death, neither diminished EC number and capillary density in RV tissues. No major impact on the expression of markers of sarcomere organization, fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolism and respiration was noted in Quinacrine-treated PAB mice. p53 accumulation modulated the expression of Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and Glucose Transporter (Glut1) in mouse RVs and in adult cardiomyocytes. We conclude that early p53 activation in PAB-induced RVH does not cause substantial detrimental effects on right ventricular remodeling and function."
https://openalex.org/W3036717500,"Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notorious for its associated skeletal muscle wasting (SMW) and mortality. Currently, the relationships between PDAC, SMW, and survival are poorly understood. Thus, there is great need for a faithful small animal model with quantitative longitudinal outcome measures that recapitulate clinical PDAC, to define SMW onset and assess progression. Therefore, we aimed to validate dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as a longitudinal measure of lean mass, and demonstrate its utility to quantify SMW in the KCKO murine model of PDAC. Methods In vivo body composition of: 1) untreated mice at 5, 8, 12, 18, and 22 weeks of age (n = 4) and 2) a cohort of mice with (n = 5) and without PDAC (n = 5), was determined via DEXA and lean mass of the lower hind limbs was predicted via a region of interest analysis by two-independent observers. Total body weight was determined. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were weighed and processed for histomorphometry immediately post-mortem. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using ANOVA and Student’s t-tests. Linear regression models and correlation analysis were used to measure the association between TA and DEXA mass, and reproducibility of DEXA was quantified via the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Lean mass in growing untreated mice determined by DEXA correlated with TA mass (r2 = 0.94; p <0.0001) and body weight (r2 = 0.89; p <0.0001). DEXA measurements were highly reproducible between observers (ICC = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89–0.98). DEXA and TA mass also correlated in the PDAC cohort (r2 = 0.76; p <0.0001). Significant SMW in tumor-bearing mice was detected within 38 days of implantation, by DEXA, TA mass, and histomorphometry. Conclusions DEXA is a longitudinal outcome measure of lean mass in mice. The KCKO syngeneic model is a bona fide model of PDAC associated SMW that can be quantified with longitudinal DEXA."
https://openalex.org/W3036922229,"This study's primary goal was based on the fact that since 15 June 2009 it has been mandatory to register regulatory trials running in India with Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI). Were all such trials, registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG) after 2009, that included India as a location, also registered with CTRI? We first had to determine how to correctly identify a trial that was registered in both the registries, but that lacked the relevant secondary ID. Therefore the secondary goal of this study was to identify the best method to do this.We used a control set of 1013 trials that cross-referenced a record in the other registry. We used two algorithms to-in a blinded fashion-identify CTRI matches for the 1013 CTG records. 80% of the predictions were correct. Using the same methodology, we identified matches for the CTG trials without known CTRI matches. We then used a logistic regression model to predict which of these matches were correct.(i) 3664 CTG records listed India as a location, but did not list any CTRI ID, and were not identified by any CTRI records either. (ii) The best single field to find a CTRI match for a CTG trial was the title field. (iii) Between 50 and 300 of 581 relevant CTG trials were not registered with CTRI.This is the first study to use hidden duplicates to determine that the law on trial registration has been broken (in India). Similar studies need to be done for trials run in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W3036944398,"Pain is evolutionarily hardwired to signal potential danger and threat. It has been proposed that altered pain-related associative learning processes, i.e., emotional or fear conditioning, might contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Pain in or near the face plays a special role in pain perception and processing, especially with regard to increased pain-related fear and unpleasantness. However, differences in pain-related learning mechanisms between the face and other body parts have not yet been investigated. Here, we examined body-site specific differences in associative emotional conditioning using electrical stimuli applied to the face and the hand. Acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of cue-pain associations were assessed in a 2-day emotional conditioning paradigm using a within-subject design. Data of 34 healthy subjects revealed higher fear of face pain as compared to hand pain. During acquisition, face pain (as compared to hand pain) led to a steeper increase in pain-related negative emotions in response to conditioned stimuli (CS) as assessed using valence ratings. While no significant differences between both conditions were observed during the extinction phase, a reinstatement effect for face but not for hand pain was revealed on the descriptive level and contingency awareness was higher for face pain compared to hand pain. Our results indicate a stronger propensity to acquire cue-pain-associations for face compared to hand pain, which might also be reinstated more easily. These differences in learning and resultant pain-related emotions might play an important role in the chronification and high prevalence of chronic facial pain and stress the evolutionary significance of pain in the head and face."
https://openalex.org/W3036078990,"Comparison of human mRNA microarray results from tumor-associated and normal cervical fibroblasts revealed significant TFPI2 downregulation in tumor-associated fibroblasts isolated from cervical cancer, indicating that TFPI2 downregulation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism of TFPI2 downregulation in tumor-associated fibroblasts and tumor cells.In vitro models of monocultures and co-cultures were established with tumor cells and fibroblasts to explore the changes of TFPI-2 expression and epigenetic modifications of the TFPI2 gene.The TFPI2 gene was hypermethylated only in tumor cells. Reduction of TFPI-2 protein levels in tumor-associated fibroblasts, although the gene was not methylated, suggested alternative regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, such as inhibition by microRNAs. The expression pattern of miR-23a, a gene thought to inhibit TFPI2 translation, showed changes strongly correlated to detected TFPI-2 protein alterations. Transfections with miR-23a mimics resulted in a decrease of TFPI-2 protein expression whereas miR-23a inhibitors increased the TFPI-2 amount. Due to downregulation of miR-23a expression by HPV in cancer cells, TFPI2 was silenced by promoter methylation. In contrary, miR-23a was active in HPV-free fibroblasts and inactivated TFPI2.These results indicate dual epigenetic inhibition of TFPI2 on the transcription level by promoter methylation in cancer cells and on the translation level by miR-23a in tumor-associated fibroblasts. As a consequence, inactivation of the TFPI2 gene plays a strategic role in the progression of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3036540111,"This study aimed to assess changes in epidemiological estimates and treatment needed when initial caries lesions are included in a population-based survey of preschool children. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a Brazilian municipality, collecting data of preschool children in 16 health centers. Caries detection used the merged codes (epi-codes) for ICDAS/ICCMS. An option for treatment, according to ICCMS, was chosen during the examination. Caries experience (dmft/dmfs) and prevalence were estimated considering three thresholds (A- initial, moderate, and severe lesions, B- only moderate and severe lesions and C- severe lesions). Incremental need for non-operative care was also verified. The sample consisted of 663 children aged 2–4 years (response rate of 99.85%). Including initial lesions, a 2-fold increase in dmft was observed (A: 3.36, B: 1.02, p<0.001). With the inclusion, the caries prevalence increased to 75% compared to threshold B only (28%). The majority (76%) of children who required any intervention (56%) should be scheduled for non-operative care. We suggest that including initial caries lesions in an epidemiological survey may significantly impact assessment of population caries experience."
https://openalex.org/W3036849358,"When clothes are worn and washed, they emit fibres into the ecosystem via discharges of sewage that have been linked to the global dispersion of clothing fibres. Facilities that treat sewage divert some fibres from sewage effluent to sludge, but no current methods of filtration eliminate their environmental release. While filters for washing-machines are sold to consumers with the argument they will reduce the emissions of fibres from clothes to the environment, there is insufficient scientific peer-reviewed evidence assessing their ability to retain fibres from washed clothes and reduce environmental contamination. To improve our understanding and develop more realistic methods to assess the efficiency of filters, we washed replicate cotton and polyester garments in replicate domestic front-loaded washing-machines with and without replicate filters (micro- and milli-meter-sized pores), and then quantified the masses of the fibres retained by the filters and those released in the effluent. Here we show micrometer-sized filters significantly reduced the mass of cotton by 67% (F2,6 = 11.69, P<0.01) compared to effluent from appliances with no filters, whilst filters in general reduced polyester fibres in their effluent by more than 65% (micrometer-sized pores) and 74% (millimeter-sized pores) compared to effluent from appliances with no filters (F2,12 = 5.20, P<0.05). While filters with micrometer-sized pores caught larger masses and total proportions of fibres than filters with millimeter-sized pores, the differences were only significant for the total proportions of cotton (t = 4.799 df = 4, P<0.01). For tests with garments of either types of polymer, the filtered effluent still contained up to a third of the original masses of fibres released from the garments. Given the diversity of clothes, polymers, appliances and filters currently sold to consumers, our work shows the value of increasing the rigour (e.g. more levels of replication) when testing filters and the need for further studies that test an even greater diversity of materials and methods in order to meet the growing demand for knowledge from governments, industry and the public."
https://openalex.org/W3036850635,"In the area of genetic epidemiology, studies of the genotype-phenotype associations have made significant contributions to human complicated trait genetics. These studies depend on specialized statistical methods for uncover the association between traits and genetic variants, both common and rare variants. Often, in analyzing such studies, potentially confounding factors, such as social and environmental conditions, are required to be involved. Multiple linear regression is the most widely used type of regression analysis when the outcome of interest is quantitative traits. Many statistical tests for identifying genotype-phenotype associations using linear regression rely on the assumption that the traits (or the residuals) of the regression follow a normal distribution. In genomic research, the rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) is one of the most popular approaches to reach normally distributed traits (or normally distributed residuals). Many researchers believe that applying the INT to the non-normality of the traits (or the non-normality of the residuals) is required for valid inference, because the phenotypic (or residual) outliers and non-normality have the significant influence on both the type I error rate control and statistical power, especially under the situation in rare-variant association testing procedures. Here we propose a test for exploring the association of the rare variant with the quantitative trait by using a fully adjusted full-stage INT. Using simulations we show that the fully adjusted full-stage INT is more appropriate than the existing INT methods, such as the fully adjusted two-stage INT and the INT-based omnibus test, in testing genotype-phenotype associations with rare variants, especially when genotypes are uncorrelated with covariates. The fully adjusted full-stage INT retains the advantages of the fully adjusted two-stage INT and ameliorates the problems of the fully adjusted two-stage INT for analysis of rare variants under non-normality of the trait. We also present theoretical results on these desirable properties. In addition, the two available methods with non-normal traits, the quantile/median regression method and the Yeo-Johnson power transformation, are also included in simulations for comparison with these desirable properties."

We investigated the prevalence of reported nut allergy between populations with different cultural attitudes to nuts during pregnancy and infancy. We conducted a survey to investigate the relationship between cultural differences in the consumption of nuts during pregnancy, breastfeeding and exposure to nuts in early childhood against the reported prevalence of nut allergy between three populations: Libyan, UK Libyan and a general UK population. The survey was administered to a representative sample of UK and Libyan parents with children aged between 3 and 16 years who were asked to report prevalence of nut allergy and to describe the factors that might affect this such as cultural behaviours and diet. A total of 1,123 parents responded. Nut allergy was defined as an allergic reaction that required medical treatment. The reported rates of nut allergy showed a significant difference in nut allergy between the Libyan populations and the general UK population with an increased odds ratio of nut allergy of ~10 when comparing the Native Libyan population to the UK population. The UK Libyan population reported the same low rate of allergic reactions as the Libyan population which were both significantly lower than the UK population (p < .0001). The Libyan populations showed significant differences from the UK population in exposure to nuts during pregnancy, breastfeeding and early infancy. The development of peanut and almond allergy through tolerance induction could be prevented by frequent and early ingestion of a moderate quantity of nuts during infancy and by maternal ingestion during pregnancy or lactation."

The aims of this study are to compare maximum mouth opening (MMO), temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), cervical and shoulder active range of motion (AROM) and strength, and swallowing difficulty between survivors of head and neck cancer (sHNC) and healthy matched controls (HMC) and to examine the correlations between these outcomes in sHNC.Thirty-two sHNC and 32 HMC participated on the study. MMO, TMD, cervical and shoulder AROM, cervical and shoulder strength, the SPADI shoulder pain and disability indices, the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) score, swallowing difficulty as determined using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and the location of disturbances in swallowing, were recorded.MMO and cervical and shoulder AROM and strength were significantly lower in sHNC, whereas FAI, SPADI score, EAT-10 and VAS were higher. The MMO, TMD, cervical and shoulder AROM, and cervical shoulder strength values showed significant correlations (some direct, others inverse) with one another. Swallowing difficulty was inversely associated with the MMO, cervical AROM and shoulder strength.Compared with controls, sHNC present smaller MMO, lower cervical and shoulder AROM, lower cervical and shoulder strength and higher perception of TMD, shoulder pain and disability and swallowing difficulty. sHNC suffer impaired swallowing related to lower MMO, presence of TMD, cervical AROM and shoulder strength values. Improving these variables via physiotherapy may reduce the difficulty in swallowing experienced by some sHNC."
https://openalex.org/W3036948014,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most malignant form of primary liver cancer, is the fourth most prevalent cause of cancer mortality globally. It was recently discovered that the dietary fermentable fiber, inulin, can reprogram the murine liver to favor HCC development in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Determining the molecular pathways that are either over expressed or repressed during inulin-induced HCC would provide a platform of potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, we have combined analysis of the novel inulin-induced HCC murine model and human HCC samples to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatic transcriptome profiling revealed that there were 674 DEGs in HCC mice compared to mice safeguarded from HCC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis uncovered enrichment in ECM-receptor interaction, steroid hormone biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, focal adhesion and protein digestion and absorption during inulin-induced HCC. Tandem mass tag based quantitative, multiplexed proteomic analysis delineated 57 differentially expressed proteins, where the over-expressed proteins were associated with cell adhesion molecules, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation and ECM-receptor interaction. After obtaining the human orthologs of the mouse genes, we did a comparison analysis to level 3 RNA-seq data found in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, corresponding to human HCC (n = 361) and healthy liver (n = 50) samples. Out of the 549 up-regulated and 68 down-regulated human orthologs identified, 142 genes (137 significantly over-expressed and 5 significantly under-expressed) were associated with human HCC. Using univariate survival analysis, we found 27 over-expressed genes involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell division that were associated with poor HCC patient survival. Overall, the genetic and proteomics signatures highlight potential underlying mechanisms in inulin-induced HCC and support that this murine HCC model is human relevant."
https://openalex.org/W3035804629,"In 2017, UNAIDS estimated that 140,000 children aged 0-14 years are living with HIV in Nigeria, but only 35% have been diagnosed and are receiving antiretroviral therapy. Children are tested primarily in outpatient clinics, which show low HIV-positive rates. To demonstrate efficient facility-based HIV testing among children aged 0-14 years, we evaluated pediatric HIV-positivity rates in points of service in select health facilities in Nigeria.We conducted a retrospective analysis of HIV testing and case identification among children aged 0-14 years at all points of service at nine purposively sampled hospitals (November 2016-March 2017). Points of service included family index testing, pediatric outpatient department (POPD), tuberculosis (TB) clinics, immunization clinics, and pediatric inpatient ward. Eligibility for testing at POPD was done using a screening tool while all children with unknown status were eligible for HIV test at other points of service. The main outcome was HIV positivity rates stratified by the testing point of service and by age group. Predictors of an HIV-positive result were assessed using logistic regression. All analyses were done using Stata 15 statistical software.Of 2,180 children seen at all facility points of service with unknown HIV status, 1,822 (83.6%) were tested for HIV, of whom 43 (2.4%) tested HIV positive. The numbers of children tested by age group were <1 years = 230 (12.6%); 1-4 years = 752 (41.3%); 5-9 years = 520 (28.5%); and 10-14 years = 320 (17.6%). The number of children tested by point of service were POPD = 906 (49.7%); family index testing = 693 (38.0%); pediatric inpatient ward = 192 (10.5%); immunization clinic = 16 (0.9%); and TB clinic = 15 (0.8%). HIV positivity rates by point of service were TB clinic = 6.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.9-35.2%); pediatric inpatient ward = 4.7% (95%CI: 2.5-8.8%); family index testing = 3.5% (95%CI: 2.3-5.1%); POPD = 1.0% (95%CI: 0.5-1.9%); and immunization clinic = 0%. The percentage contribution to total HIV positive children found by point of services was: family index testing = 55.8% (95%CI: 40.9-69.8%); POPD = 20.9% (95%CI: 11.3-35.6%); inpatient ward = 20.9 (95%CI: 11.3-35.6%) and TB Clinic = 2.3% (95%CI: 0.3-14.8%). Compared with the POPD, the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for finding an HIV positive child by point of service were TB clinic = 7.2 (95% CI: 0.9-60.9); pediatric inpatient ward = 4.9 (95% CI: 1.9-12.8); and family index testing = 3.7 (95% CI: 1.5-8.8). HIV-positivity rates did not significantly differ by age group.In Nigeria, to improve facility-based HIV positivity rates among children aged 0-14 years, an increased focus on HIV testing among children seeking care in pediatric inpatient wards, through family index testing, and perhaps TB clinics is appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W3036081520,"Tendon injuries are common and have a high incidence of re-rupture that can cause loss of functionality. Therapies with adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) and the microcurrent (low-intensity electrical stimulation) application present promising effects on the tissue repair. We analyzed the expression of genes and the participation of some molecules potentially involved in the structural recovery of the Achilles tendon of rats, in response to the application of both therapies, isolated and combined. The tendons were distributed in five groups: normal (N), transected (T), transected and ASC (C) or microcurrent (M) or with ASC, and microcurrent (MC). Microcurrent therapy was beneficial for tendon repair, as it was observed a statistically significant increase in the organization of the collagen fibers, with involvement of the TNC, CTGF, FN, FMDO, and COL3A1 genes as well as PCNA, IL-10, and TNF-α. ASC therapy significantly increased the TNC and FMDO genes expression with no changes in the molecular organization of collagen. With the association of therapies, a significant greater collagen fibers organization was observed with involvement of the FMOD gene. The therapies did not affect the expression of COL1A1, SMAD2, SMAD3, MKX, and EGR1 genes, nor did they influence the amount of collagen I and III, caspase-3, tenomodulin (Tnmd), and hydroxyproline. In conclusion, the application of the microcurrent isolated or associated with ASC increased the organization of the collagen fibers, which can result in a greater biomechanical resistance in relation to the tendons treated only with ASC. Future studies will be needed to demonstrate the biological effects of these therapies on the functional recovery of injured tendons."
https://openalex.org/W3036881231,"The Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is one of the few genes consistently overexpressed in the aging brain, and in most neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Its functions include metabolism regulation, myelin management, neuroprotection, and longevity regulation. Knowledge of endogenous regulatory mechanisms controlling brain disease-triggered ApoD expression is relevant if we want to boost pharmacologically its neuroprotecting potential. In addition to classical transcriptional control, Lipocalins have a remarkable variability in mRNA 5'UTR-dependent translation efficiency. Using bioinformatic analyses, we uncover strong selective pressures preserving ApoD 5'UTR properties, indicating unexpected functional conservation. PCR amplifications demonstrate the production of five 5'UTR variants (A-E) in mouse ApoD, with diverse expression levels across tissues and developmental stages. Importantly, Variant E is specifically expressed in the oxidative stress-challenged brain. Predictive analyses of 5'UTR secondary structures and enrichment in elements restraining translation, point to Variant E as a tight regulator of ApoD expression. We find two genomic regions conserved in human and mouse ApoD: a canonical (α) promoter region and a previously unknown region upstream of Variant E that could function as an alternative mouse promoter (β). Luciferase assays demonstrate that both α and β promoter regions can drive expression in cultured mouse astrocytes, and that Promoter β activity responds proportionally to incremental doses of the oxidative stress generator Paraquat. We postulate that Promoter β works in association with Variant E 5'UTR as a regulatory tandem that organizes ApoD gene expression in the nervous system in response to oxidative stress, the most common factor in aging and neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3036090648,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how the biological media which are in contact with silicone oil play a role in the silicone emulsification process. Commercially available Oxane 1300 silicone oil and potential hydrophilic phases of the emulsions in the eye (porcine aqueous humor, porcine vitreous and balanced salt solution) were investigated separately and in a mixture or emulsions by means of surface tension, rheological, zeta potential measurements and microscopic investigation. The surface tension of biological media (vitreous and aqueous humor) was significantly lower than that of non-biological media, especially in the case of aqueous humor, which indicates a remarkable emulsification tendency with these phases. The biological media are able to form both oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, which can be observed in the clinical practice as well. It was established that the vitreous has a more expressed emulsification ability compared with the aqueous humor because smaller and more stable droplets can form with silicon oil when the vitreous is still there. It can be concluded that the vitreous has a higher impact on emulsification than the aqueous medium, which can predict that the vitreous remaining after vitrectomy has a key role in emulsion formation in the eye with silicone oil endotamponade."
https://openalex.org/W3036410781,"In meat processing, antimicrobial treatment applied during slaughter and deboning may not control pathogens and spoilage organisms during subsequent transportation and storage. ""Functional Ice"" (FICE), an innovation over traditional ice, was investigated for its effects on food safety, shelf life, and quality of raw poultry thigh meat during refrigerated storage. FICE was prepared by freezing aqueous solutions of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) (2.5% and 5% w/v) and sodium lactate-sodium diacetate (SL-SD) (1% and 2.5% v/v). Potable water was used to prepare ice for the control treatment. Thigh meat inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium (108 CFU/sample) was placed in FICE treatments, stored at 4 °C and sampled at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h (n = 375). Weight pick-up was recorded for the uninoculated thighs. Additionally, shelf life and quality were evaluated for 8 days on tray-packed thighs that were stored in FICE treatments for 48 h (STPP 5%, and SL-SD 2.5%). Differences among treatments were determined using ANOVA with LSMeans (p ≤ 0.05). Results indicated that inoculated thighs stored in individual STPP 5%, and SL-SD 2.5% treatments lead to a significant reduction in Salmonella Typhimurium compared to the control (p ≤ 0.05) after 48 h of storage. FICE treated thighs showed higher yields, lower cook loss, and an extended shelf life of 1-2 days, without any color changes. FICE has the potential to improve food safety and shelf life while improving the yields and quality during storage and transportation of raw poultry meat."
https://openalex.org/W3036118922,"A variety of wearable monitors are available for objectively assessing physical activity but there is a lack of established values for the activity intensity of MotionWatch8 (MW8) and a similar lack of studies on comparability across devices. Our study aimed to establish activity intensity cutpoints for the MW8 accelerometer in children, which are necessary to determine whether they are meeting physical activity guidelines.Children (n = 39, ages 9-13 years) were asked to wear two different accelerometers (MW8 and ActiGraph) simultaneously on the same dominant wrist as they performed different activities designed to mimic activities of variable intensity that a child might perform in a free-living environment. Linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess sensitivity and specificity of the identified MW8 intensity cutpoints compared to established ActiGraph cutpoints.Mean values for each activity were positively correlated using the MW8 and ActiGraph monitors (r = 0.85, p<0.001). The optimal cutpoints for differentiating sedentary from light physical activity, light from moderate, and moderate from vigorous activity were ≤32 counts, ≥ 371.5 counts, and ≥ 859.5 counts per 30 seconds, respectively.Our study demonstrated the ability of MW8 to discriminate different intensity activities and provided the first cutoff values for researchers using the MW8 to measure physical activity patterns among children."
https://openalex.org/W3036177923,"Inspired by the mechanistic correlations between superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and lipid metabolism, the associations of SOD1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with circulating lipid levels were explored. In 2621 Chinese Han adults, randomly recruited from a health examination center without organic diseases, cancers, and pregnancy, three tag SNPs, rs4998557, rs1041740, and rs17880487 selected by Haploview software were genotyped with a probe-based real-time quantitative PCR method. In both genders, most parameters of the dyslipidemia adults were inferior (P < 0.001) to those of the non-dyslipidemia adults, and genotype frequencies of rs4998557 and rs17880487 were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the normal and abnormal subgroups of total cholesterol (TC) or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). Adjusted for confounding factors, logistic regression analyses revealed that in males rs4998557A, rs1041740T, and rs17880487T reduced the risk of high TC and/or LDLC (P < 0.05), and rs4998557A and rs17880487T increased the risk of low HDLC (P < 0.05); but in females, none of the SNPs had associations with any of the lipid parameters (P > 0.05). Conclusively, characterized by a sexual dimorphism, the SOD1 polymorphisms were associated with the lipid disorders in the adult males but not females of the Chinese Han population."
https://openalex.org/W3036341352,"The stability of the ecosystems depends on the dynamics of the prey community, but changes in the composition and abundance of prey species are poorly understood, especially in open ocean ecosystems. We used neon flying squid Ommastrephes bartramii, an active top predator, as a biological sampler to investigate the dynamics of the prey community in the southwestern part of the Western Subarctic Gyre in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Squid were collected monthly from July to November 2016. There were no significant differences among months in stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) in the digestive gland, a fast turnover organ reflecting recent dietary information. Similar findings were obtained from analyses of isotopic niche width and fatty acid profiles. The potential influence of the environment (monthly mean sea surface temperature, SST, and chlorophyll-a, Chl-a) on the prey community was examined with SST and Chl-a both varying significantly among sampling months. We found little evidence for significant effects of SST and Chl-a on the isotopic values, nor on the fatty acid profiles except for 20:4n6 and 24:1n9. These lines of evidence indicate that the prey community in the southwestern part of the gyre remains stable, with little evidence for systematic changes at the community level. This study provides a novel understanding of the dynamics of the prey community and highlights the use of top predators to study the trophic dynamics of an oceanic system where a long-term scientific survey is unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W3036664927,"Several areas, such as physical and health sciences, require the use of matrices as fundamental tools for solving various problems. Matrices are used in real-life contexts, such as control, automation, and optimization, wherein results are expected to improve with increase of computational precision. However, special attention should be paid to ill-conditioned matrices, which can produce unstable systems; an inadequate handling of precision might worsen results since the solution found for data with errors might be too far from the one for data without errors besides increasing other costs in hardware resources and critical paths. In this paper, we make a wake-up call, using 2 × 2 matrices to show how ill-conditioning and precision can affect system design (resources, cost, etc.). We first demonstrate some examples of real-life problems where ill-conditioning is present in matrices obtained from the discretization of the operational equations (ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard) that model these problems. If these matrices are not handled appropriately (i.e., if ill-conditioning is not considered), large errors can result in the computed solutions to the systems of equations in the presence of errors. Furthermore, we illustrate the generated effect in the calculation of the inverse of an ill-conditioned matrix when its elements are approximated by truncation. We present two case studies to illustrate the effects on calculation errors caused by increasing or reducing precision to s digits. To illustrate the costs, we implemented the adjoint matrix inversion algorithm on different field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), namely, Spartan-7, Artix-7, Kintex-7, and Virtex-7, using the full-unrolling hardware technique. The implemented architecture is useful for analyzing trade-offs when precision is increased; this also helps analyze performance, efficiency, and energy consumption. By means of a detailed description of the trade-offs among these metrics, concerning precision and ill-conditioning, we conclude that the need for resources seems to grow not linearly when precision is increased. We also conclude that, if error is to be reduced below a certain threshold, it is necessary to determine an optimal precision point. Otherwise, the system becomes more sensitive to measurement errors and a better alternative would be to choose precision carefully, and/or to apply regularization or preconditioning methods, which would also reduce the resources required."
