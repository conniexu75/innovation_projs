We studied the ability of a variety of receptors to interact with Gα15 and Gα16 by cotransfecting receptors and G-protein α-subunits in COS-7 cells. Activation of β2 adrenergic and muscarinic M2 receptors in cells expressing the receptors alone or together with Gαq, Gα11, or Gα14 led to a very small stimulation of endogenous phospholipase C. However, when the receptors were coexpressed with Gα15 and Gα16, addition of appropriate ligands caused a severalfold increase in inositol phosphate production which was time- and dose-dependent. A similar activation of phospholipase C was observed when several other receptors which were previously shown to couple to members of the Gi and Gs family were coexpressed with Gα15. In addition, stimulation of inositol phosphate formation via receptors naturally coupled to phospholipase C was enhanced by cotransfection of Gα15 and Gα16. These data demonstrate that Gα15 and Gα16 are unique in that they can be activated by a wide variety of G-protein-coupled receptors. The ability of Gα15 and Gα16 to bypass the selectivity of receptor G-protein interaction can be a useful tool to understand the mechanism of receptor-induced G-protein activation. In addition, the promiscuous behavior of Gα15 and Gα16 toward receptors may be helpful in finding ligands corresponding to orphan receptors whose signaling properties are unknown.

A wide variety of hormones and neurotransmitters regulate cellular functions by binding to transmembranous receptors which couple to and activate heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins).1( 1The abbreviations used are: G-proteinheterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumfMLPN-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanineC5aactive cleavage product of the complement factor 55-HT5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)U4661911α,9α-epoxymethano-PGH2.) Receptor-activated G-proteins then regulate different cellular effectors, such as specific enzymes and ion channels(1Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Sixteen mammalian genes encoding G-protein α-subunits, which define the individual G-proteins, have been identified, and they have been grouped into four families, Gαs, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα16, according to sequence homologies(5Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Many of the factors which determine the specificity of G-protein-mediated signal transduction are still unknown. Nonetheless, the selective coupling of an activated receptor to a distinct pattern of G-proteins is regarded as an important requirement to achieve accurate signal transduction. For example, receptors which upon activation lead to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase primarily couple to Gs, whereas the receptor-mediated pertussis toxin-insensitive activation of phospholipase C is due to the coupling of receptors to members of the Gq family(6Taussig R.

The Gq family consists of five members whose α-subunits show different expression patterns. Whereas Gαq and Gα11, which are 88% identical, seem to be almost ubiquitously expressed and are primarily responsible for coupling receptors in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner to phospholipase C β-isoforms(7Rhee S.G.

The human Gα16 and its murine counterpart Gα15 are only expressed in a subset of hematopoietic cells(10Wilkie T. Scherle P. Strathmann M. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gα15 and Gα16, which are 85% identical, have been placed into the Gq family since their sequences show the highest similarity toward Gαq (57%). All five members of the Gαq family share functional properties, i.e. they can regulate the β-isoforms of phospholipase C (12-14). Purified Gαq, Gα11, and Gα16 indistinguishably activate different isoforms of phospholipase C-β in a reconstituted system(15Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C.

Recent data, however, demonstrate that receptors for interleukin 8 and C5a interact selectively with G16 but not with Gq and G11(17Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I.

In the present study, we show that a wide variety of structurally and functionally different receptors couple to G15 and G16 but not to other members of the Gq family, indicating that G15 and G16 are unique, i.e. they possess the ability to nonselectively couple a large variety of receptors to phospholipase C. Carbachol, isoproterenol, dopamine, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, thrombin, serotonin, [Arg8]vasopressin, [D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin, 11α,9α-epoxymethano-PGH2 (U46619), and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe were from Sigma. CGS-21680 was from RBI (Natick, MA) and 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro 20-1724) was from Life Technologies, Inc. COS-7 cells were cultured as described(13Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells per well and grown overnight. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.4 μg of DNA mixed with 2 μl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 0.25 ml of Opti-MEM was added to each well. In cotransfection experiments with two different plasmids, 0.2 μg of each plasmid was added. In control experiments, the total amount of DNA was maintained constant by adding DNA from a vector encoding β-galactosidase. After 5 h at 37°C, 0.25 ml of DMEM containing 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum was added to each well. About 24 h after transfection, cells were labeled for 20-24 h with 120 pmol of myo-[2-3H]inositol (758.5 GBq/mmol; Du Pont NEN) per well as described(13Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 10 min at 37°C with 0.25 ml of inositol-free DMEM containing 10 mM LiCl. Thereafter, medium was aspirated, and the indicated agents were added in DMEM containing 10 mM LiCl. Inositol phosphate formation was stopped after 20 min by removing the medium and adding 0.2 ml of 10 mM ice-cold formic acid. After keeping the samples on ice for 20 min, 0.45 ml of 10 mM NH4OH was added, and the whole sample was loaded onto a column containing 0.75 ml of anion exchange resin (AG 1-X8; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 5 mM borax and 60 mM sodium formate. Total inositol phosphates were then separated and measured as described(20Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If not stated otherwise, measurements were done in triplicate representing three independently transfected wells. For determination of cAMP levels, cells were grown and transfected in 24-well plates as described. 48 h after transfection, cells were preincubated for 15 min with DMEM containing 300 μM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 20 μM 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro 20-1724). Thereafter, medium was replaced by DMEM containing both phosphodiesterase inhibitors and the indicated concentrations of ligands. At the end of this treatment (20- min incubation time), the reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium and addition of 150 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Samples were kept for 10 min on ice, and 90 μl of 1 M Tris (pH 9.8) was added to neutralize the sample. cAMP was determined by the competitive binding assay(21Gilman A.G. Murad F. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Farndale R.W. Allan L.M. Martin B.R. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 75-103Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of the sample were incubated for 2 h with 2 pmol of [8-3H]cAMP (925 Gbq/mmol; Amersham) and 62.5 μg of cAMP-dependent protein kinase purified from porcine heart (Sigma) in a final volume of 200 μl at 4°C. Thereafter, 100 μl of 4% (w/v) charcoal in 5 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added, and samples were immediately centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g. To determine the amount of [8-3H]cAMP bound to the binding protein, supernatants were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Each experiment was calibrated by running a set of cAMP standards along with the unknown test sample. For the standard samples, the log of total counts/min bound was plotted versus the log of total cAMP per sample (labeled plus unlabeled), and the amount of cAMP in the test sample was calculated from the resulting standard curve(21Gilman A.G. Murad F. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Assays were done in triplicate representing three independently transfected wells. cDNAs corresponding to G-protein α-subunits Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, and Gα16 were carried by the cytomegalovirus vector pCIS(12Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16044-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase construct inserted into pCIS was used as a transfection control. cDNAs encoding the human muscarinic M2, the human β2 adrenergic, the murine 5-HT1A, and the human thrombin receptors were in the vector pCIS. The human dopamine D1A construct was in pCMV5 (23), the rat μ opioid receptor and the human adenosine A2A receptor encoding cDNAs were in pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), the human vasopressin V2 receptor and the human fMLP receptor cDNAs were in the vector pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen), the human 5-HT1A receptor construct was in pSVL (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), the cDNA encoding the human vasopressin V1A receptor was carried by the pcD3 vector(24), and the human thromboxane A2 receptor cDNA was in pCDM8 (Invitrogen). In order to study the interaction of different receptors and G-proteins of the Gq family, cDNA clones encoding receptors and G-protein α-subunits were transiently cotransfected into COS-7 cells, and inositol phosphate production in response to receptor ligands was measured. First, we tested the β2 adrenergic and the M2 muscarinic receptor, which have been shown to couple primarily to Gs and Gi/o, respectively (25-28), to determine if they can mediate ligand-dependent inositol phosphate production in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1). When both receptors were expressed alone, there was a slight increase in the inositol phosphate production in response to the respective ligands. In the case of the muscarinic M2 receptor, this increase could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin and is presumably mediated by βg-subunits of Gi(29Sternweis P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of G-protein α-subunits Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14, all of which have been shown to be expressed at high levels and to mediate receptor-dependent phospholipase C activation in COS cells (12, 13, 17, 19, 20), slightly increased the basal inositol phosphate production, but had no effect on the ligand-dependent increase in inositol phosphate formation. In contrast, ligand-dependent inositol phosphate production was severalfold enhanced when both receptors were cotransfected with Gα15 and Gα16 (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows that the β2 adrenergic or the M2 muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in inositol phosphate production in cells cotransfected with Gα15 or Gα16 was linear with time for at least 30 min. Isoproterenol- and carbachol-induced inositol phosphate formation in cells transiently expressing Gα15 or Gα16 and the corresponding receptors was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3). Half-maximal and maximal effects of carbachol were observed at concentrations of 0.1 and 1-10 μM, whereas isoproterenol-stimulated inositol phosphate production was half-maximal and maximal at concentrations of 0.3 and 10 μM, respectively. We then tested the ability of isoproterenol and carbachol to stimulate inositol phosphate formation in the presence of Gα15 and Gα16 in order to test if the ligand concentration dependence was in the same range as the dosage required to regulate the natural effector target of their respective receptors. Therefore, in a set of parallel experiments we measured the effect of increasing concentrations of both ligands on the cellular cAMP content in COS-7 cells transfected with the β2 or the M2 receptor cDNAs. Isoproterenol induced an increase in the intracellular cAMP content in cells expressing the β2 receptor, and the extent of this effect was slightly increased in cells coexpressing Gαs. In order to study the M2 receptor-mediated decrease in intracellular cAMP, cells were cotransfected with the muscarinic M2 receptor and the β2 adrenergic receptor. When cAMP levels were increased through the stimulation of the β2 receptor, a carbachol-dependent decrease of the cAMP content could be observed. In both cases, effects mediated by the β2 and the M2 receptor were dose-dependent and occurred with a very similar dose-response relationship as the Gα15/Gα16-dependent stimulation of phospholipase C via both receptors (Fig. 3). This shows that the activated β2 and the M2 receptor regulated the intracellular cAMP content in COS-7 cells with a very similar efficacy as they induced inositol phosphate formation when cotransfected with Gα15 and Gα16 into COS-7 cells.Figure 3:Accumulation of inositol phosphates and cAMP in COS-7 cells transfected with the β2 adrenergic or M2 muscarinic receptor cDNAs. A and C, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the β2 adrenergic (A) or the M2 muscarinic receptor (C) and cDNAs encoding β-galactosidase (●, lz) or α-subunits of the Gαq family, Gαq (Δ, αq), Gα11 ( , α11), Gα14 (○, α14), Gα15 (○, α15), and Gα16 (■, α16) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then incubated with the indicated concentrations of isoproterenol (A) and carbachol (C), and the ligand-dependent inositol phosphate formation was determined as described. B, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the β2 adrenergic receptor and β-galactosidase (●, lz) or Gαs (2A, αs). Cells were incubated at increasing concentrations of isoproterenol for 20 min, and cellular cAMP content was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the the β2 adrenergic and M2 muscarinic receptor (0.2 μg of each per well). Transfected cells were incubated with 2 μM isoproterenol and the indicated concentrations of carbachol (abscissa) for 20 min, and the carbachol-induced decrease in cellular cAMP content was measured as described. Basal cAMP levels (in the absence of any ligand) were 1.2 ± 0.2 pmol per well. Values are mean values ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further determine the spectrum of receptors able to activate G15 and G16, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with cDNAs of a variety of different receptors alone or together with Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, or Gα16. We then measured the effect of increasing agonist concentrations on inositol phosphate formation. Fig. 4 shows the results obtained with three receptors which are naturally coupled to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, the vasopressin V2, the dopamine D1A, and the adenosine A2A receptor(23Dearry A.

When these receptors were expressed alone, a small dose-dependent increase in the inositol phosphate formation could be observed. In cells coexpressing the receptors and Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14, the ligand-dependent inositol phosphate production was the same as in cells transfected with the receptors alone. However, when the vasopressin V2, the dopamine D1A, and the adenosine A2A receptors were coexpressed with Gα15 or Gα16, the ligand-dependent inositol phosphate formation increased severalfold. We then tested the ability of Gα15 and Gα16 to couple receptors, which activate Gi and Go proteins, to the production of inositol phosphates (Fig. 5). The μ opioid receptor, the 5-HT1A receptor, and the fMLP receptor, which have been shown to activate G-proteins of the Gi family(33Laugwitz K.L. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Schultz G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Breyer R.M. Schütz W. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also mediated a small increase in the formation of inositol phosphates when expressed alone. No significant increase in the ligand-dependent inositol phosphate formation was observed when the receptors were coexpressed with Gαq or Gα11. Coexpression of the fMLP or the 5-HT1A receptor but not the μ opioid receptor and Gα14 slightly increased the ligand-dependent inositol phosphate production. Ligand-induced release of inositol phosphates was again markedly increased when the receptors were coexpressed with Gα15 and Gα16, indicating that the receptors can couple to Gα15 and Gα16, but not to Gαq or Gα11. To prove that receptors which activate phospholipase C in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner by coupling to Gαq/11 can also activate Gα15 and Gα16, we expressed the thrombin, the thromboxane A2, the vasopressin V1A, and the 5-HT1A receptors(24Morel A. O'Carroll A.-M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 36Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of cotransfected Gαq family members on the inositol phosphate formation mediated by phospholipase C-linked receptors is much weaker, as the receptors can interact with endogenous Gαq and Gα11. Nevertheless, the tested phospholipase C-coupled receptors mediated the stimulation of inositol phosphate production, and the ligand-dependent portion could be significantly increased when the receptors were coexpressed with Gαq family members, including Gα15 and Gα16. Thus, different receptors which couple to Gs, Gi, and Gq family members can be functionally linked to endogenous phospholipase C when coexpressed with Gα15 and Gα16 in COS cells, indicating that they all activate Gα15 and Gα16. In this paper, we demonstrate that Gα15 and Gα16 are capable of coupling a variety of receptors to the stimulation of inositol phosphate formation when coexpressed with the receptor in COS-7 cells. Receptors which are not linked to a pertussis toxin-insensitive regulation of phospholipase C under physiological conditions mediated little increase in inositol phosphate formation when expressed alone. This increase was not altered by coexpression of Gαq and Gα11. In some cases, coexpression of Gα14 led to a slight increase of the basal ligand-dependent inositol phosphate formation (Fig. 5). All receptors tested gained the ability to mediate a severalfold increase in the inositol phosphate production when they were coexpressed with Gα15 and Gα16, indicating that they functionally interacted with Gα15 and Gα16. In addition, the inositol phosphate formation mediated by several receptors which are physiologically linked to phospholipase C in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner, could be increased by coexpression of Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, and Gα16. Thus, these receptors were able to act through all the transfected Gα subunits. The receptors shown to activate Gα15 and Gα16 represent a wide spectrum of structurally and functionally different ligand binding proteins, demonstrating that Gα15 and Gα16 can be activated by a wide variety of receptors which serve very different functions under physiological conditions. This appears to be a unique feature of Gα15; other G-proteins usually are selectively activated by a defined spectrum of receptors. A certain degree of specificity in the receptor G-protein interaction is regarded as a prerequisite for proper signal transduction. Thus, a G-protein which can nonselectively link functionally different receptors in a given cell to the same effector would be thought to produce inappropriate signaling and block specific intracellular information processing pathways. However, Gα15 and Gα16 exhibit very restricted expression patterns. Expression has only been shown in a subset of hematopoietic cells, and especially at premature stages in different cell lineages(11Amatruda T.T. Steele D. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Therefore, coupling of most of the tested receptors to Gα15 and Gα16 in the COS cell system is presumably without direct physiological significance, since many of these receptors and Gα15 and Gα16 may not be coexpressed in vivo. The chemokine receptors for C5a and interleukin 8 have been shown to activate Gα16, but not Gαq and Gα11(17Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Buhl A.M. Eisfelder B.J. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Russell M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they are known to be expressed in mature cells of the immune system, especially in leukocytes. Therefore, they have been implicated in the physiological regulation of Gα15 activity. Whereas chemokine receptors for interleukin 8, C5a, and fMLP can undoubtedly couple to Gα15 and Gα16 (17-19, Fig. 5), our current work indicates that this ability is not restricted to this receptor class, but rather due to the unique properties of Gα15. In addition, expression of chemokine receptors and Gα15 seems to be regulated in a reciprocal manner during leukocyte development. For example, in undifferentiated HL-60 cells which express high levels of Gα16, chemokine receptors are absent or at low levels, whereas chemokine receptor expression increases and the expression of Gα16 dramatically decreases during differentiation of HL-60 cells(11Amatruda T.T.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The effects of chemokine receptors in myeloid cells are mainly pertussis toxin-sensitive(43Vanek M. Hawkins L.D. Gusovsky F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 832-839PubMed Google Scholar, 44Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 45Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar), indicating that they are mediated by Gi-type G-proteins. Recently it has been shown that the fMLP receptor primarily functions through pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins even when stably expressed in undifferentiated HL-60 cells where Gα16 is present(46Prossnitz E.R. Qehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5704-5715PubMed Google Scholar). Chemokine receptors probably interact with Gα15 and Gα16 under some conditions in vivo; it is, however, tempting to speculate that the main receptors physiologically coupled to Gα15 and Gα16 are still to be identified. They might be involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells, and Gα15 may allow the coupling of diverse receptors to the stimulation of phospholipase C. Since a variety of receptors can activate Gα15 and Gα16 while being unable to activate Gαq and Gα11, the question arises of which structural determinants of Gα15 and Gα16 are responsible for their ability to become activated by many different receptors. The carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acids of Gα15 and Gα16 are most divergent from Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14(9Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10Wilkie T. Scherle P. Strathmann M. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This region includes the very carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit which has been shown to affect receptor specificity(47Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 48Dratz E.A. Furstenau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gα15 and Gα16 possess a unique insert of several amino acids including different charged residues between helix α4 and helix α5 which are just adjacent to a region homologous to residues 311-329 of transducin(10Wilkie T. Scherle P. Strathmann M. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Amatruda T.T. Steele D. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc.

This region of transducin has also been implicated in the interaction with receptor(50Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, the situation appears to be more complicated as shown by a recent study in which different chimeras between Gα11 and Gα16 were examined for their ability to interact with the C5a receptor, which couples to Gα16 but not to Gα11(51Lee C.H. Katz A. Simon M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 218-223PubMed Google Scholar). This study suggests that the carboxyl-terminal 133 amino acids of Gα16 do not alone account for its ability to interact with the C5a receptor, and that multiple regions of Gα16 are responsible for the functional difference between Gα11 and Gα16, including a segment which comprises residues 220-240 of Gα16. Thus, there are obviously many domains of Gα15 and Gα16 which directly or indirectly may affect the structure of G-protein and in this way may modulate the specificity of receptor G-protein interaction. The fact that Gα15 and Gα16 interact with a wide variety of receptors can be useful for understanding the molecular details of the receptor G-protein interaction, once more structural data pertaining to receptors and different G-protein α-subunits are available. In addition, Gα15 promiscuity may facilitate the examination of orphan receptors whose ligands and signal transduction properties are unknown. Cotransfection of orphan receptors and Gα15 or Gα16 into COS cells and subsequent determination of phospholipase C activity can be a way to search for ligands independent of the physiological signaling properties of the receptor.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging method that measures relative cerebral blood flow was used to identify a distributed, overlapping pattern of hand movement representation within the posterior precentral gyrus, which contains M1. The observed pattern resembles those reported in nonhuman primates and differs from a somatotopically organized plan typically used to portray human motor cortex organization. Finger and wrist movements activated a wide expanse of the posterior precentral gyrus, and representations for different finger movements overlapped each other and the wrist representation. Multiple sites of activation occurred in the precentral gyrus for all movements. The overlapping representations may mediate motor and cognitive functions requiring coordinated neural processing for finger and wrist actions rather than discrete control implied by somatotopic maps."

In this study, the intracellular location of cPLA2 was determined using immunofluorescence microscopy and immuno-gold electron microscopy. In nonstimulated cells, cPLA2 is distributed throughout the cytosol and is excluded from the nucleoplasm. Following cell activation with calcium ionophore, most of the cPLA2 translocates to the nuclear envelope, and the enzyme remains there during the entire period that ionophore is present. With IgE/antigen stimulation for 5 min, approximately 20-30% of the cPLA2 translocates to the nuclear envelope, and after 30 min of stimulation, most of the enzyme returns to the cytosol. Measurement of intracellular calcium using the dye Fura-2/AM shows that the level of calcium rises immediately after antigen is added, remains high for about 30 s, and then declines back to resting levels. Activation with calcium ionophore produces a 10-fold larger release of arachidonate than does stimulation with IgE/antigen. Thus, the results suggest that the extent of membrane binding of cPLA2 correlates with the release of arachidonate and that the site of arachidonate liberation is the nuclear envelope where many of the enzymes that oxygenate this fatty acid are located.

All of these results suggest the cPLA2 plays a role in signal-mediated release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids for the genesis of eicosanoids, and thus cPLA2 may be a good target for antiinflammatory therapeutics. Mast cells contain cPLA2(34Murakami M. Kudo I. Umeda M. Matsuzawa A. Takeda M. Komada M. Fujimori Y. Takahashi K. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and two additional phospholipases A2. One is a 14-kDa enzyme of the type II variety that is secreted from activated mast cells(34Murakami M. Kudo I. Umeda M. Matsuzawa A. Takeda M. Komada M. Fujimori Y. Takahashi K. Inoue K. J. Biochem.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is a 30-kDa enzyme that prefers phosphatidylserine(34Murakami M. Kudo I. Umeda M. Matsuzawa A. Takeda M. Komada M. Fujimori Y. Takahashi K. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The role of these enzymes in mast cell function is being clarified. Inhibitors of the 14-kDa enzyme cause suppression of histamine release, suggesting that this enzyme is a component of the mediator release pathway(34Murakami M. Kudo I. Umeda M. Matsuzawa A. Takeda M. Komada M. Fujimori Y. Takahashi K. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of purified 14-kDa phospholipase A2 to mast cells leads to histamine release(36Murakami M. Hara N. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5675-5684PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the 14-kDa enzyme in eicosanoid generation in mast cells is controversial. One report indicates that addition of exogeneous mast cell type II 14-kDa phospholipase A2 to mast cells does not lead to PGD2 production(36Murakami M. Hara N. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5675-5684PubMed Google Scholar), while another group provides evidence that addition of the 14-kDa phospholipase A2 from cobra venom leads to arachidonate liberation and production of cyclooxygenase products(35Fonteh A.N. Bass D.A. Marshall L.A. Seeds M. Samet J.M. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar). These differences are likely due to the different affinities of 14-kDa phospholipases A2 for mast cell membranes. The role of mast cell cPLA2 in arachidonate liberation is not clear, but recent studies show that this enzyme becomes phosphorylated in response to IgE cross-linking(37Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 796-803PubMed Google Scholar, 38Currie S. Roberts E.F. Spaethe S.M. Roehm N.W. Kramer R.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In platelets, cPLA2 becomes phosphorylated in response to stimulation with thrombin(22Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and studies with potent cPLA2 inhibitors provide strong evidence for the role of this enzyme in arachidonic acid liberation(39Bartoli F.

Antisense RNA technology has been used to show that cPLA2 is involved in eicosanoid generation in monocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide and platelet-activating factor(41Roshak A.

No role for the phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A2 in mast cell function has been reported. In this report, studies are presented showing that cPLA2 in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3.1) is located mainly in the cytosol in unactivated cells, and this enzyme translocates to the nuclear envelope in response to stimulation with calcium ionophore or IgE/antigen. The results suggests that cPLA2 is involved in the release of at least some of the arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid of activated mast cells. Recombinant human cPLA2 was prepared from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described(42Trimble L.A. Street I.P. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Weech P.K.

Media also contained penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone (JHR Biosciences). Adherent cells were routinely dislodged by treatment with trypsin/EDTA solution except as noted below. For all studies described in this report, cells were grown to approximately 50% confluence as described above. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes containing multi-well glass slides (10 wells/slide, Cell Line Associates, Inc., Newfield, NJ). Washing and fixation of cells in dishes were carried out by adding the appropriate solution to the cells (10 ml/10-cm dish), and after the desired time the solution was removed by aspiration followed by the immediate addition of the next solution. For stimulation with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Sigma), cells were first washed three times with Hank's BSS with CaCl2 (Life Technologies, Inc., 14025-019). Washed cells were covered with 10 ml of Hank's BSS with CaCl2 and stimulated by addition of A21387 (final concentration 10 μM, 5 mM stock solution in Me2SO, control cells were treated with Me2SO only). Cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then fixed as described below. Cells were fixed by covering the multi-well slides in the dishes with 10 ml of freshly prepared 2% formaldehyde (Aldrich, 25,254-9) in PBS and incubating for 20 min at 37°C. All subsequent steps were done at ambient temperature. The multi-well slides were removed from the dishes and washed twice with PBS (5 min/wash in Coplin jars), and then permeabilized for 5 min in a Coplin jar containing freshly prepared 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS. Cells were washed five times with PBS (5 min/wash in Coplin jars). The slides were removed from the Coplin jars and placed on a stack of moist paper towels inside of a plastic basin fitted with an air-tight lid. The lid was kept closed except during the brief manipulation of the samples. The liquid between the wells on the slide was carefully removed by wiping with a paper towel. PBS was periodically applied to the wells with a pipette so that the wells did not become dry. The liquid in the wells was removed with a pipette, and then 3% BSA in PBS (10 μl) was applied to each well with a pipette. After 15 min, R11683 antiserum (10 μl of serum diluted 1000-fold with 3% BSA in PBS) was applied to each well. Controls were carried out in which either the same volume of preimmune serum was used or serum was omitted. After 2 h the cells were washed four times with PBS (5 min/wash in Coplin jars). Liquid was removed between the wells, and the cells were treated with 3% BSA in PBS as described above. FITC-conjugated anti-IgG F(ab′)2 antiserum (10 μl of serum diluted 300-fold with 3% BSA in PBS) was applied to each well. After 1 h, the cells were washed four times with PBS (5 min/wash in Coplin jars), in some cases the nuclei were stained (see below), and coverslips were mounted over the wells using Citifluor mounting solution (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). As an additional control, a 20-μl portion of R11683 antisera (diluted 500-fold in PBS with 3% BSA, approximately 0.6 μg of IgG) was mixed with an equal volume of purified cPLA2 (0.5 μg/μl in PBS). After 30 min at room temperature the mixture was applied to the wells containing fixed cells as described above. To stain nuclei, cells were processed as described above. Just prior to mounting coverslips, the wells were treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml in PBS containing 3% BSA, Molecular Probes) for 1 min. The cells were washed four times in PBS (5 min/wash in Coplin jars) and coverslips were mounted as above. Slides were immediately viewed by microscopy or wrapped with aluminum foil and stored at 4°C for up to 24 h prior to microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out with a Nikon Microphot-FXA epifluorescence microscope (300 × magnification, oil immersion). Cells were observed with either a fluorescein filter (excitation 480 nm, barrier 535 nm) or a rhodamine filter (Nikon DM580 filter; excitation 546 nm, barrier 590 nm) depending on the dye probe used. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was carried out with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser scanning microscope using the 488 line of a krypton/argon laser (for viewing fluorescein) and a 60 × objective lens. For electron microscopy, cells were grown in 12-well plastic dishes as described above. Stimulation with A23187 was carried out as described above. For stimulation with DNP-HSA, cells were first primed by adding anti-DNP IgE (final concentration 0.5 μg/ml, obtained as a generous gift from Professor B. A. Helm, or purchased from Sigma) directly to the culture medium, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 12-24 h. Cells were washed three times with pre-warmed RBL-BSS (1 liter contains 8.67 g of NaCl, 0.365 g of KCl, 1.64 g of D-sorbitol, 0.6 g of K2HPO4, 0.14 g of KH2PO4, 4.83 g of HEPES, pH 7.40) containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mM CaCl2. Cells were covered with the same solution, and DNP-HSA was added (final concentration 100 ng/ml, 3 mg/ml stock solution, obtained as a generous gift from Professor B. A. Helm). Cells were incubated at 37°C for various times, and then fixed. Cells were processed as described for fluorescence microspopy (using 2 ml of solutions per well) up to and including the washing steps following the treatment with anti-cPLA2 antisera (R11683 antiserum was used at a dilution of 150-fold rather than the 1000-fold dilution used for fluorescence microscopy). At this stage, the prepared cells were covered with PBS, the dish covers were sealed to the dishes by wrapping with Parafilm, and the dishes kept at 4°C in an air-tight container for up to 1 week. The cells were then processed for electron microscopy. PBS was removed from the wells, and the cells were covered with anti-rabbit IgG-labeled 15-nm gold particles (Janssen Life Science Products, Olen, Belgium, diluted 10-fold in PBS). After 16 h at 4°C, the fluid was removed, and the cells were covered with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 20°C. The cells were washed several times with PBS, and then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in water (Ted Pella, Inc.), dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Medcast (Ted Pella, Inc.) The samples were cut by a diamond knife at an oblique angle of 30°. Sections were stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then viewed with a JEOL 100B electron microscope at 60 kV as described previously(43Chi E.Y. Henderson W.R. Klebanoff S.J. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 579-585PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize mitochondria, cells were grown on multi-well slides. Mitotracker (Molecular Probes) was added to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 25 nM. After incubation at 37°C for 15-45 min, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed as described above. Coverslips were mounted with Citifluor as described above, and the cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy using the rhodamine filter. To visualize the Golgi apparatus, cells were grown on multi-well slides. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were covered with PBS containing 40 μM C5-DMB-ceramide (Molecular Probes) and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. Cells were washed with PBS, and coverslips were mounted with Citifluor as described above. Cells were viewed immediately by fluorescence microscopy using the fluorescein filter. To visualize tubulin, cells were prepared as described above for cPLA2 visualization except that the anti-tubulin antiserum was used (1:250 dilution). Arachidonate Release-Cells were grown in 12-well plates as described above. To each well was added 0.25 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid (60-100 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), and to some of the wells was added anti-DNP IgE (final concentration 0.5 μg/ml). Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Cells that were to be treated with Ca2+ ionophore were washed three times with prewarmed Hank's BSS containing 0.1% BSA, and those that were to be treated with DNP-HSA were washed with prewarmed RBL-BSS containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mM CaCl2. Cells were stimulated with A23187 or DNP-HSA as described above. Cells were incubated at 37°C for variable times, and then the culture media above the cells was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. After centrifugation of the samples to remove small amounts of dislodged cells (20 s at 16,000 × g), 90% of the supernatants were transferred to scintillation vials. To the wells containing the remaining adherent cells was added 1 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1 by volume). This extract was transferred to the microcentrifuge tubes containing small amounts of pelleted cells, and after brief mixing with a vortexer, the samples were transferred to scintillation vials. Scintillation fluid was added to all samples, and the samples were analyzed by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS 1801 counter. Release of radiolabeled arachidonic acid is expressed as the percentage of the total cellular radiolabeled arachidonate released into the culture medium for each culture well. Increase in intracellular Ca2+ was measured essentially as described(44Bingham B.R. Monk P.N. Helm B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a 75-cm2 flask as described above, and primed with anti-DNP IgE as described above. Nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (5-10 ml/flask, Sigma catalog number C-5789) was added, and after 10-15 min the cells were dislodged by banging the plate several times against the lab bench. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at a density of 2 × 106/ml in BSS. Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 2 μM, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 20 min with periodic swirling. Cells were washed three times with BSS containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma A-7906) and resuspended to a density of 1 × 106/ml in BSS containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mM CaCl2. Cells were kept on ice and in the dark for up to 2 h. Cell suspension (0.33 ml) was transferred to a 1-ml fluorescence cuvette containing 0.66 ml of BSS, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM CaCl2. The sample was equilibrated in a thermostated holder to 21°C and stirred with a small Teflon stir bar. Fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 340 nm and emission at 490 nm. Other additives are described in the legend to Fig. 3. β-Hexosaminidase Release-Essentially the procedure of Tanaka et al.(45Tanaka Y. Takagaki Y. Nishimune T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1991; 39: 2072-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was followed. Cells were grown in 12-well plates. Cells were treated with anti-DNP IgE, washed, and stimulated with DNP-HSA as described above. After 5 or 15 min at 37°C, aliquots of culture media (200 μl) were removed and added to an assay mixture (900 μl) consisting of 4 mMp-nitrophenyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma) in 40 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of 0.2 M glycine, pH 10.5. The amount of product was determined by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm using a calibration curve prepared by adding known amounts of p-nitrophenol to the assay mixture. Cells were grown in 15-cm culture dishes, the media was aspirated, and cells were scraped into 4 ml of RBL-BSS. Cells from three plates were pooled, and the suspension was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature in a Sorvall RC-5 centrifuge using an SS-34 rotor. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of RBL-BSS containing 1 mM CaCl2, and divided among 4 tubes. Five μl of a 2 mM Me2SO solution of A23187 was added to two of the tubes, and 5 μl of Me2SO was added to the remaining tubes. After 5 min at room temperature, the cells were spun down and resuspended in 250 μl of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and either 10 mM EGTA or 0.2 mM EGTA plus 0.3 mM CaCl2. After 20 min on ice, 3 volumes of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and either 10 mM EGTA or 0.2 mM EGTA and 0.3 mM CaCl2 was added, and the cells were immediately homogenized using a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer with a loose fitting pestle (Kontes, B pestle). Greater than 95% of the cells were lysed after 15-20 vigorous strokes, based on trypan blue exclusion. The lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of buffer (low speed pellet fraction). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of buffer (high speed pellet fraction). Under microscopic examination using either trypan blue or Diff-Quik Stain (Baxter), the low speed pellet contained crude nuclei, while the high speed pellet and high speed supernatant (cytosolic fraction) contained no visible nuclei. Cellular fractions were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Equal volumes of cell fractions were thawed and applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE minigel. cPLA2 was detected by immunoblot analysis as described below. Analysis of cell extracts by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting was carried out essentially as described(24Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and washed twice with PBS. Cells were scrapped into 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, v/v, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 20 μM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM tetradsodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 3 μMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4; protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added fresh from frozen stocks. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged (10 min at 13,000 × g) for 10 min. The protein concentration in the supernatant was estimated using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), Laemmli sample buffer containing dithiothreitol was added, and 8 μg of protein was loaded on each lane of a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Laemmli, Bio-Rad"

The binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the VEGF receptors of endothelial cells, and the heparin-dependent binding of 125I-VEGF165 to a soluble extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor KDR/flk-1, were inhibited by the angiogenesis inhibitor platelet factor-4 (PF4). In contrast, PF4 was not able to inhibit the binding of VEGF121, a VEGF isoform which lacks a heparin binding capacity, to the VEGF receptors of the cells or to KDR/flk-1. These results indicate that PF4 may inhibit VEGF165 binding to VEGF receptors by disrupting the interaction of VEGF165 with cell surface heparan sulfates. Since PF4 mutants lacking a heparin binding ability retain their anti-angiogenic activity, alternative inhibitory mechanisms were also examined. 125I-PF4 bound with high affinity (Kd 5 × 10−9M) to VEGF165-coated wells. The binding of 125I-PF4 to the VEGF165-coated wells was inhibited by several types of heparin binding proteins, including unlabeled PF4 and unlabeled VEGF165. The binding was not inhibited by proteins which lack a heparin binding capacity, nor was it inhibited by VEGF121. Heparinase did not inhibit the binding of 125I-PF4 to VEGF165, indicating that heparin-like molecules are not required. These experiments suggest that PF4 can bind to heparin binding proteins such as VEGF165 leading to an inhibition of their receptor binding ability. In agreement with these results, we have observed that PF4 inhibits efficiently the VEGF165 induced proliferation of vascular endothelial cells.

A similar enhancement in detection thresholds was obtained when observers imagined the previously perceived masks. Imagery-induced facilitation was detected for as long as 5 minutes after observation of the masks by the targeted eye. These results indicated the existence of a low-level (monocular) memory that stores the sensory trace for several minutes and enables reactivation of early representations by higher processes. This memory, with its iconic nature, may subserve the interface between mental images and percepts."

https://openalex.org/W1977032555,"Ferritin is a ubiquitously distributed iron-binding protein that plays a key role in cellular iron homeostasis. It is composed of two subunits, termed H (heavy or heart) and L (light or liver). In fibroblasts and other cells, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) specifically induces synthesis of the ferritin H subunit. Using nuclear run-off assays, we demonstrate that this TNF-dependent increase in ferritin H is mediated by a selective increase in ferritin H transcription. Transfection of murine fibroblasts with chimeric genes containing the 5′-flanking region of murine ferritin H fused to the human growth hormone reporter gene reveals that the cis-acting element that mediates this response is located ∼4.8 kilobases distal to the start site of transcription. Deletion analyses delimit the TNF-responsive region to a 40-nucleotide sequence located between nucleotides −4776 and −4736, which we term FER-2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and site-specific mutations indicate that this region contains two independent elements: one contains a sequence that binds a member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors, and a second contains a novel sequence that partially conforms to the NF-κB consensus sequence and may bind a different member of the NF-κB/Rel transcription factor family. Thus, effects of an inflammatory cytokine on ferritin are mediated by a family of transcription factors responsive to oxidative stress.

Ferritin is a 24-subunit protein whose major role is to mediate iron storage and homeostasis. The subunits may be of several types, generally H (heavy or heart) or L (light or liver). Although there is a significant degree of conservation between these two subunits at the level of amino acid sequence, ferritin H and L subunits are encoded by different genes (1Jain S.K.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)1( 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factor-αILinterleukinkbkilobase(s)hGHhuman growth hormonentnucleotide(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay.) is a cytokine derived primarily from macrophages and T cells whose synthesis is triggered by a variety of immunological insults. TNF plays an important role in numerous host responses, including septic shock, cachexia, vascular leakage syndrome, and other systemic manifestations of disease (see Refs. 6 and 7 for review). Previous experiments have demonstrated that the cytokines TNF and interleukin-1α selectively increase ferritin H mRNA and protein in a variety of mesenchymal cell lines(8Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Miller L.L. Miller S.C. Torti S.V. Tsuji Y.

Given the pivotal role of these cytokines in the response to infection, inflammation, and malignancy, this observation suggested the possibility that cytokines might also impinge on some of the changes in iron metabolism that characterize these responses. Here we report that TNF acts at a transcriptional level to induce ferritin H. Using chimeric genes containing the murine ferritin promoter fused to a reporter gene, we demonstrate that TNF targets a specific region in the ferritin H promoter ∼4.8 kilobases 5′ to the ferritin H transcriptional start site.

NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in the cellular response to stress. NF-κB was originally described as a factor binding to the sequence 5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′ of the immunoglobulin κ light chain enhancer in B cells(11Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Since then, numerous studies have shown that p50 (NF-κB1) and p65 (RelA), the proteins that compose the NF-κB dimer, belong to the larger NF-κB/Rel family of proteins. Members of this family have been found to be capable of forming multiple homo- and heterodimers with differing DNA sequence-binding specificities and transcriptional activating properties (for review, see Ref. 12). In most cell types, NF-κB exists in the cytoplasm bound to its inhibitor, IκB. Translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus with subsequent activation of transcription occurs in response to a variety of stimuli, including TNF (for review, see Ref. 13). In this report, we describe the identification of the TNF-responsive region in the murine ferritin H 5′-flanking region, which we term FER-2. This region contains two closely spaced sequences between nucleotides −4776 and −4736 that are required for maximal induction of transcription in response to TNF. Both of these sequences were found to possess nuclear protein-binding properties characteristic of NF-κB. Approximately 5 × 107 NIH3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were treated with 1000 units/ml TNF (Perkin-Elmer) for 7 h. Nuclei were collected from TNF-treated and control cells essentially as described(14Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Begley D.A. Mitchell B.S. Alizadeh B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4104-4108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the addition of 40 units of RNasin (Promega) to the nuclei, nuclear transcription activity was measured as the incorporation of [32P]UTP into RNA transcripts elongated in vitro(14Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Begley D.A. Mitchell B.S. Alizadeh B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4104-4108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After ethanol precipitation, nuclear RNA was resuspended in H2O, and an aliquot was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting. Equal counts of control and TNF-treated labeled RNAs were added to hybridization buffer (5 × Denhardt's solution, 4 × SSC, 50% formamide) and used to hybridize filters containing immobilized cDNAs. cDNAs used were β-actin(15Gunning P.

The filters were baked at 80°C and prehybridized at 37°C overnight. Hybridization was carried out for 2-3 days at 37°C, followed by washing of filters in 0.1% SDS, 2 × SSC at 55°C. If necessary, filters were subsequently washed as described above with the addition of 5 μg/ml RNase A at 37°C. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Deletions of the −5.6 ferritin H/growth hormone reporter construct, which contains ∼5.6 kb of murine ferritin H 5′-flanking region ligated to hGH(16Beaumont C. Seyhan A.

An internal EcoRI fragment from nt −4477 to −941 was removed from −5.6 ferritin H/growth hormone by EcoRI digestion and religation. A fragment containing the region from nt −5300 to the EcoRI site at nt −4477 was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 5′-primer was 5′-GGTTCCCAGAGGCGCAGA-3′, and the 3′-primer was 5′-CCTTGGAGTGAAGTTGATGC-3′. Following the addition of EcoRI linkers and digestion with EcoRI, the fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of a construct containing 941 nt of ferritin H 5′-flanking sequence (construct −0.9; see below for details). Construction was similar to that of −5.3Δ3.5, but PCR synthesis was primed from approximately −5.1 kb utilizing the 5′-primer 5′-GGCTTGGCACGAAGCACCT-3′. -5.6Δ3.5 was digested with XbaI to remove the region between −5.6 and −4.8 kb. A 2-nt mutation was introduced at nt −4749 and −4750 (GGGAATCCC to GTTAATCCC) by using oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations to prime synthesis of PCR fragments upstream and downstream from the site of mutation. The two resulting fragments (nt −4819 to −4736 and nt −4755 to −4471) were then melted, annealed, and extended by PCR. This resulted in a fragment from −4.8 to −4.5 kb that was cloned into the −0.9 construct. A fragment representing sequence from nt −4701 to −4471 was synthesized by PCR. The 5′-primer used was 5′-CCCATTTTCACCCAGCCTTC-3′. EcoRI linkers were added, and the fragment was digested with EcoRI prior to ligation into the EcoRI site of the −0.9 construct. A fragment representing sequence from nt −4591 to −4471 was synthesized by PCR. The 5′-primer used was 5′-CGCACTGTCTGGCACGCACC-3′. Following the addition of EcoRI linkers and digestion with EcoRI, the fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of the −0.9 construct. The EcoRI fragment between nt −4477 and −941 was isolated by restriction digestion and gel purification and cloned into −4.8Δ3.5. The EcoRI fragment from nt −4477 to −941 was isolated as described above and cloned into the −0.9 construct. -5.6Δ3.5 was digested with EcoRI, followed by the addition of XbaI linkers to blunted EcoRI ends, subsequent XbaI digestion, and religation. Fragments representing sequence between nt −4471 and −4739 (p6), nt −4471 and −4751 (p7), and nt −4776 and −4471 were synthesized by PCR, digested with EcoRI, and ligated into the EcoRI site of the −0.9 construct. The respective 5′-primers used were 5′-TATAGAATTCTTTTGCAACACTGGCTGTTT-3′, 5′-TATAGAATTCGGGAATCCCATCCTTTTGCA-3′, and 5′-TATAGAATTCATCAGAATTTCCAGCACACT-3′. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown in 150-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). For transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and washed again in phosphate-buffered saline. After cells were counted and centrifuged for collection, they were resuspended in electroporation buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM dextrose) such that ∼1 × 107 cells were present in 0.6 ml of electroporation buffer. 1 × 107 cells were transferred to each electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), and 40 μg of CsCl-purified plasmid DNA was mixed into each cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 300-330 mV and 960 microfarads on a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The contents of each cuvette were then plated into two to three 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Following attachment, cells were refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum. When transfected cells approached confluence, they were treated with TNF (1000 units/ml) for 12 or 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in guanidium isothiocyanate. Total RNA was collected by ultracentrifugation through 5.7 M CsCl. RNA probe labeled with [32P]CTP (>400 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) was synthesized using T7 polymerase (Promega), and the protection assay was carried out essentially as described(17Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). The probe used spanned the junction between ferritin H and hGH and included the region of ferritin H from nt −225 to +86 and the HindIII-DraIII fragment of hGH (see Fig. 2). Hybridization of 10 μg of total RNA to ∼1 × 106 cpm of RNA probe was carried out in 80% formamide at 56°C for 14-18 h. Samples were then treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 2 μg/ml RNase T1 (both from Sigma) for 30 min at 30°C, and the products were separated on a 7% denaturing urea-acrylamide gel. Bands were excised from dried gels and counted in a scintillation counter or, in some experiments, scanned by densitometry. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al.(18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were isolated from NIH3T3 cells treated with or without 1000 units/ml TNF for 4 h. Cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) and broken by Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in low-salt buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.02 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), followed by the addition of high-salt buffer (same as low-salt buffer but with 1.2 M KCl) in dropwise fashion. The nuclear extract was collected and dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. Protein concentrations were ascertained using Bio-Rad reagent, and extracts were frozen at −80°C. The protocol described by Sen and Baltimore (11Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar) was followed with modifications. Briefly, nuclear extracts (15 μg) from control and TNF-treated cells were incubated with 20,000-50,000 cpm of radiolabeled oligonucleotides for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 7-8 μl of the buffer against which the nuclear extracts had been dialyzed (see above). In some cases, the following double-stranded unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added to the mixture: NF-κB (5′-GATCGAGGGGACTTTCCCTAGC-3′; Stratagene) or glucocorticoid-responsive element (5′-GATCAGAACACAGTGTTCTCTA-3′; Stratagene). In addition, some samples received antibody to the p65 NF-κB protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-ferritin antibody (negative control; Dako Corp.). Incubated samples were electrophoresed on a 5% native acrylamide gel and fixed in 10% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid; and the gel was vacuum-dried before exposure. Oligonucleotides used in EMSA were as follows: F/f(NF-κB), 5′-CTCGGGGAATCCCATCCTTT-3′ and 3′-CCCTTAGGGTAGGAAA-5′; F/f(NF-κB)TT, 5′-CTCGGTTAATCCCATCCTTT-3′ and 3′-CAATTAGGGTAGGAAA-5′; and E/e, 5′-TACACTTGCAAATATCAGAATTTCCAGCACACTTCTCG-3′ and 3′-GAACGTTTATAGTCTTAAAGGTCGT-GTGAAGAGC-5′. After heating and annealing overnight, the double-stranded oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled (ICN) with the appropriate nucleotides by fill-in reaction. Treatment of a variety of mesenchymal cell lines with the cytokine TNF increases levels of ferritin H mRNA in the absence of any effect on ferritin L(8Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To determine whether this results from increased transcription of the ferritin H gene, we measured transcription of ferritin H in the presence and absence of TNF using a nuclear run-off assay(14Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Begley D.A. Mitchell B.S. Alizadeh B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4104-4108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, NIH3T3 cells treated for 7 h with TNF demonstrated increased transcription of the ferritin H gene. Interleukin-6, a gene previously reported to be transcriptionally activated by TNF (19) and which was used as a positive control, was activated by TNF in these experiments as well; in contrast, transcription of β-actin and ferritin L, genes whose steady-state mRNA levels are not altered by TNF treatment(8Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Miller L.L. Miller S.C. Torti S.V. Tsuji Y. Torti F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), was not affected by TNF. Quantitation of results from several experiments demonstrated an ∼3-fold increase in ferritin H transcription in response to TNF. Thus, TNF-mediated increases in ferritin H mRNA result from TNF-dependent increases in ferritin H transcription. To determine which regions of the ferritin H gene are responsible for TNF-dependent increases in transcription, chimeric genes that fused the 5′-flanking region of the murine ferritin H gene to the hGH reporter gene were constructed. These fusion genes were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and their response to TNF was assessed using an RNase protection assay that enabled the simultaneous detection of the transfected gene and endogenous ferritin H(16Beaumont C. Seyhan A. Yachou A.K. Grandchamp B. Jones R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20281-20288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that a reporter gene containing ∼5.6 kb of ferritin H 5′-regulatory sequence fused to hGH could be regulated by TNF (Fig. 2A) (data not shown). Deletion of a large internal EcoRI fragment from this construct, which removed a 3.5-kb region from nt −4477 to −941, did not diminish TNF responsiveness (Fig. 2A). Using this −5.6Δ3.5 construct as a backbone, several additional deletion mutants that removed progressively larger regions from the 5′-end of the ferritin H/hGH gene were constructed and tested for their ability to be regulated by TNF. Fig. 2B shows representative RNase protection assays from these experiments; results of multiple experiments are quantitated in Fig. 2C. These experiments demonstrated that TNF induced transcription of the parental construct −5.6Δ3.5 as well as the deletion mutants −5.3Δ3.5, −5.1Δ3.5, and −4.8Δ3.5. These mutants, which deleted 352, 553, and 855 nt from the 5′-end of the parental construct, respectively, exhibited a 4-7-fold induction in expression of the transfected gene, a level remarkably similar to the 4.5-6-fold induction observed with the endogenous gene. In contrast, the −4.7Δ3.5, −4.6Δ3.5, and −0.9 deletion mutants exhibited a marked reduction in ability to respond to TNF, although measurement of endogenous ferritin H performed in the same samples indicated that TNF responsiveness of the endogenous gene was completely retained. These deletion studies indicate that the TNF-responsive region resides within an ∼100-nt region located between 4.8 and 4.7 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. To verify that these deletion mutants, which contained a large internal deletion not present in the endogenous gene, accurately recapitulated regulatory responses exhibited by the intact ferritin H promoter, chimeric ferritin genes that preserved the entire 5′-flanking region, including the internal 3.5-kb region from nt −4477 to −941, were also constructed. These were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and their response to TNF treatment was compared with that of the endogenous gene. Quantitation of multiple experiments is shown in Fig. 3. These experiments demonstrated that a transfected gene containing 4.8 kb of 5′-flanking sequence (−4.8) responded to 12 h (Fig. 3) or 24 h (data not shown) of TNF treatment to the same extent as the endogenous gene. Consistent with the results presented above, deletion of an additional 300 nt of 5′-flanking sequence (−4.5) resulted in the loss of TNF responsiveness. Thus, the region of the ferritin promoter necessary for responsiveness to TNF lies ∼4.8 kb distal to the start site of ferritin H transcription. To probe further into the nature of regulatory elements present in the TNF-responsive region of the ferritin H promoter, the 118-nt region between −4.8 and −4.7 kb was sequenced. As shown in Fig. 4A, sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of the sequence 5′-GGGGAATCCC-3′ between nt −4752 and −4743. This conforms very closely to a consensus sequence that binds the NF-κB family of transcription factors (GGGRNNYYCC, where R = purine nucleotide, Y = pyrimidine nucleotide, and N = nucleotide)(13Grilli M. Chiu J. Lenardo M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). No other sequences with obvious similarity to binding sites for known transcription factors were identified in this region. To test whether this region of the ferritin promoter could in fact serve as a functional binding site for NF-κB transcription factor(s), an EMSA was performed. As shown in Fig. 4B, EMSA revealed that the region of the ferritin H promoter defined by the F/f(NF-κB) oligonucleotide (nt −4755 to −4736) is able to bind nuclear factors and that this binding increases dramatically in TNF-treated extracts. Furthermore, binding is specifically competed by unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain NF-κB motif (5′… GGGACTTTCC … 3′), but not by DNA of an irrelevant sequence (the glucocorticoid-responsive element). These results indicate that the region of the ferritin H promoter defined by the F/f(NF-κB) oligonucleotide can bind an NF-κB-like factor and that the presence or activity of this factor is augmented upon exposure to TNF. To further assess the relationship between factor(s) binding to this region of the ferritin promoter and NF-κB, their immunological cross-reactivity was assessed. Radiolabeled F/f(NF-κB) was incubated with nuclear extracts from TNF-treated cells in the presence of a polyclonal antibody to the p65 subunit of NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 4B, the inclusion of this antibody inhibited the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes and in addition resulted in the appearance of higher mobility complexes. When a negative control antibody was used, no change in the EMSA banding pattern or signal intensity was observed. These findings indicate that a protein recognized by anti-NF-κB antibody can bind to a sequence located between nt −4755 and −4736 of the ferritin H promoter. To verify that DNA sequence requirements for binding of factors to the region of the ferritin promoter defined by the F/f(NF-κB) oligonucleotide were similar to those exhibited by members of the NF-κB family, a double-stranded oligonucleotide that incorporated a 2-base pair mutation in the F/f(NF-κB) oligonucleotide was synthesized: 5′-CTCGGGGAATCCCATCCTTT-3′ was changed to 5′-CTCGGTTAATCCCATCCTTT-3′. This GG-to-TT mutation abolishes binding of an NF-κB-like factor to the major histocompatibility class II-associated invariant chain gene(20Pessara U. Koch N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4146-4154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When this mutant oligonucleotide, F/f(NF-κB)TT, was radiolabeled and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, it failed to bind to nuclear proteins as compared with the wild-type F/f(NF-κB) sequence (Fig. 5). Thus, a mutation known to inhibit the binding of NF-κB inhibits the ability of nuclear extracts to bind to a target sequence in the ferritin H promoter. To determine whether the NF-κB site defined by EMSA affects transcription of ferritin H in vivo, a mutated chimeric gene was constructed that contained a specific mutation in this NF-κB site. Starting with the TNF-responsive construct −4.8Δ3.5, two nucleotide changes that substituted TT for GG at nucleotides −4749 and −4750 were introduced. These mutations were chosen based on their ability to render F/f(NF-κB)TT nonfunctional in vitro (Fig. 5). This mutated gene was then introduced into cells by transfection, and its response to TNF was compared with a gene containing the wild-type sequence. As shown in Fig. 6B, the mutated construct −4.8Δ3.5TT was unable to respond to TNF to the same extent as −4.8Δ3.5. When the results of three independent experiments were quantitated, construct −4.8Δ3.5TT demonstrated an ∼2-fold reduction in response to TNF, as shown in Fig. 6C. Similar results were observed when GG-to-TT mutations were introduced at nt −4749 and −4750 of a construct containing the entire 4.8 kb of ferritin 5′-flanking sequence (data not shown). Thus, the intact promoter, as well as the 4.8Δ3.5 ferritin H promoter, requires a functional NF-κB sequence for maximal response to TNF. As shown in Fig. 6, the GG-to-TT mutations at nucleotides −4749 and −4750 of construct −4.8Δ3.5TT did not fully inhibit the ability of the transfected construct to respond to TNF. Quantitation of these results (Fig. 6C) suggested that regulatory elements in addition to the NF-κB recognition site at nt −4751 to −4742 might be present. To explore which additional sequences within the TNF-responsive region of ferritin H might be required for full responsiveness to TNF, additional gel shift assays were performed using a series of overlapping oligonucleotides spanning the 118-nt TNF-responsive region. Of these, only one oligonucleotide demonstrated differential binding to nuclear factors when extracts from control and TNF-treated cells were compared (data not shown). The sequence of this oligonucleotide, termed E/e, is shown in Fig. 7A. It contains a reverse-orientation sequence (5′-GGAAATTC-3′) with considerable similarity to a NF-κB recognition motif. The E/e oligonucleotide overlaps F/f(NF-κB) by 4 nt, but does not contain the NF-κB consensus sequence present in the F/f(NF-κB) oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 7B, treatment of cells with TNF (lanes 6-10) induced the ability of proteins present in nuclear extracts to bind the E/e oligonucleotide. These proteins could not be detected in the absence of TNF treatment (Fig. 7B, lanes 1-5). Furthermore, binding of labeled E/e oligonucleotide could be competed by unlabeled DNA containing the mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain NF-κB motif, suggesting that although it does not contain a canonical NF-κB consensus sequence, it can nevertheless bind a member of the NF-κB family. This conclusion was supported by the observation that the appearance of the shifted band was specifically blocked by the addition of antibody to the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 7B, lane9). Therefore, the results of EMSA are consistent with a role for two NF-κB transcriptional elements in the regulation of ferritin H expression by TNF. To further define the contribution of these elements of the ferritin H promoter to the TNF-dependent regulation of ferritin H in vivo, three additional deletions corresponding to critical regions defined by the E/e and F/f(NF-κB) oligonucleotides were constructed and fused to the hGH reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 8, these constructs contained both, one, or none of the putative NF-κB elements within this 118-nt region; they were termed p8 (−4.776Δ3.5), p7 (−4.751Δ3.5), and p6 (−4.739Δ3.5), respectively. These deletion mutants were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and their responsiveness to TNF was tested using an RNase protection assay. As seen in Fig. 8(B and C), construct p6 did not significantly respond to TNF treatment, consistent with previous experiments indic"

RNA was isolated from mid-fetal (early-elastogenic), neonatal (peak tropoelastin expression), and adult (very low tropoelastin expression) rat lungs and reverse transcribed, and the cDNA was amplified with intron specific primers. A weak hybridization signal for tropoelastin pre-mRNA was seen in mid-fetal samples, and paralleling the increase in steady-state mRNA levels, a strong signal for pre-mRNA was detected in neonatal samples, indicating transcriptional regulation. Stimulation of fetal lung tropoelastin expression by maternal administration of dexamethasone also led to an increase in pre-mRNA levels. However, signal for tropoelastin pre-mRNA in adult samples was equal to that detected in neonatal samples, even though mRNA levels had dropped about 80-fold. Persistence of tropoelastin transcription in adult tissue was also seen in cell culture models and was verified by nuclear runoff assay. In addition, an RT-PCR assay for α1 (I) procollagen pre-mRNA accurately revealed the known transcriptional regulation of this gene. Our results demonstrate that the induction and maintenance of elastogenesis is controlled by a transcriptional mechanism, whereas, the cessation of tropoelastin expression is controlled by a post-transcriptional mechanism."

However, extraction of porcine brain membranes with detergent and subsequent chromatography with SP-Sepharose revealed a large peak of Arf-sensitive PLD activity.

To further define the mechanism of drug action, interactions between ellipticine (an intercalative drug with clinical relevance) and yeast topoisomerase II were characterized. By utilizing a yeast genetic system, topoisomerase II was identified as the primary cellular target of the drug. Furthermore, ellipticine did not inhibit enzyme-mediated DNA religation, suggesting that it stimulates DNA breakage by enhancing the forward rate of cleavage. Finally, ellipticine binding to DNA, topoisomerase II, and the enzyme∙DNA complex was assessed by steady-state and frequency domain fluorescence spectroscopy. As determined by changes in fluorescence intensity and emission maximum wavelength, and by lifetime analysis, only the protonated species of ellipticine bound to a double-stranded 40-mer oligonucleotide containing a topoisomerase II cleavage site (KD≈ 65 nM). In contrast, predominantly deprotonated ellipticine bound to the enzyme∙DNA complex (KD≈ 1.5 μM) or to the enzyme in the absence of nucleic acids (KD≈ 160 nM).

https://openalex.org/W2132342067,"Phospholipase D, which has been extracted from porcine brain membranes and chromatographically enriched 100-fold, was activated better by impure preparations of Arf than by purified or recombinant Arf. Examination of brain cytosol with this enriched preparation of PLD activity revealed at least three stimulatory components. One of these is Arf or the first cytoplasmic factor. A second peak of PLD-stimulating activity (cytoplasmic factor II, CFII) was resolved from Arf by anion exchange and gel filtration. This CFII can be further separated into multiple activities by chromatography with heparin-agarose. The activities were differentiated by their stimulatory properties as measured in the absence or presence of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgS) alone and in the presence of added Arf and GTPgS.While all of the CFII pools stimulated PLD activity to some degree and showed synergistic activation when administered in conjunction with Arf, they could be classified into two groups with distinct behavior. When used together, pools from the two respective groups showed synergistic activation of PLD. The first set of pools contained the RhoA monomeric G protein. Recombinant RhoA was used to show that it could indeed activate this enriched PLD activity and act synergistically with Arf proteins. A related monomeric G protein, Cdc42, was also effective. The second set of CFII pools were devoid of RhoA and, in contrast to the first group, demonstrated significant stimulating activity in the absence of guanine nucleotides.These data indicate that the PLD activity from brain can be modulated by several cytosolic factors and that Arf-sensitive PLD may represent a complex activity that can be regulated in an interactive fashion by a variety of cellular signaling events.

A second peak of PLD-stimulating activity (cytoplasmic factor II, CFII) was resolved from Arf by anion exchange and gel filtration. This CFII can be further separated into multiple activities by chromatography with heparin-agarose. The activities were differentiated by their stimulatory properties as measured in the absence or presence of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgS) alone and in the presence of added Arf and GTPgS. While all of the CFII pools stimulated PLD activity to some degree and showed synergistic activation when administered in conjunction with Arf, they could be classified into two groups with distinct behavior. When used together, pools from the two respective groups showed synergistic activation of PLD. The first set of pools contained the RhoA monomeric G protein. Recombinant RhoA was used to show that it could indeed activate this enriched PLD activity and act synergistically with Arf proteins. A related monomeric G protein, Cdc42, was also effective. The second set of CFII pools were devoid of RhoA and, in contrast to the first group, demonstrated significant stimulating activity in the absence of guanine nucleotides. These data indicate that the PLD activity from brain can be modulated by several cytosolic factors and that Arf-sensitive PLD may represent a complex activity that can be regulated in an interactive fashion by a variety of cellular signaling events."

INTRODUCTIONBence Jones proteins are monoclonal antibody light chains found in the urine of approximately 60% of multiple myeloma patients(1Jones H.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol.

The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of these tumors are not understood fully. Light chain aggregation has been advanced as one of the causes of tissue damage, particularly involving the kidney(3Myatt E.A. Westholm F.A. Weiss D.T. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3034-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The antibodies produced by tumor cells in multiple myeloma are described to bind certain antigens, including determinants found in carbohydrates (4) and autoantigens expressed by neuronal cells(5Jonsson V.

These findings have raised the possibility that antigen recognition by the tumor cell antibody products may contribute to the pathophysiology of multiple myeloma.Some antibodies possess catalytic activities similar to those of enzymes(7Paul S.

Jacquemart F. Ermonval M. Scand. J. Immunol. 1994; 39: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of one of these antibodies has been localized to an active site in the light chain subunit(13Sun M. Gao Q.-S. Li L. Paul S. J.

McIlwain T.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1991; 44: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Nelson M. Brown R.D. Gibson J. Joshua D.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 81: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), at which even low level catalytic activity may be biologically important. Here, we describe evidence for peptidase activity attributable to the variable domain in a majority of light chains isolated from myeloma patients. This observation indicates that catalysis by antibody subunits is not a rare phenomenon and suggests a possible link between antibody catalysis and the pathophysiology of multiple myeloma.MATERIALS AND METHODSBence Jones Proteins and VLFragmentsMonoclonal κ and λ light chains were purified from the urine of 21 myeloma patients with multiple myeloma as described previously(17Solomon A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 101-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recombinant VL domains (rREC, rLEN, rREI) were expressed in Escherichia coli from synthetic genes and purified as in Ref. 18. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses in the absence or presence of 20 mM 2-mercaptoethanol was on Phast gradient gels (8-25%; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Each of the 21 light chain preparations contained a 50-kDa dimer band and a 25-kDa monomer band (Fig. 1). The disulfide bond in the dimer was reduced in mercaptoethanol, producing a single 25-kDa monomer band. A single 12.5 kDa band was observed in the two VL preparations. Gel filtration of light chain and VL was in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, pH 6.5 (Sigma) on a Superose-12 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia). The column fractions were renatured by dialysis against 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM glycine, 0.025% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.7, for 2 days with four buffer changes using a Life Technologies, Inc. multiwell dialysis device (final guanidine concentration < 1 nM, assuming equilibration across the dialysis membrane).Catalysis AssaysLight chains were incubated with peptide-MCA1( 1The abbreviations used are: MCAmethylcoumarinamideVIPvasoactive intestinal polypeptideVLvariable domain of light chainBoct-butyloxycarbonyl.) conjugates (Peptides International or Sigma) in 50 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM glycine, 0.025% Tween 20, pH 7.7, in 96-well plates (MicroFluor W, Dynatech) at 37°C in a humidified incubator. Hydrolysis of peptide-MCA substrates was determined as the fluorescence of the aminomethylcoumarin leaving group (λem 460 nm, λex 370 nm) using a plate reader (Perkin Elmer LS50 fluorimeter). Product concentrations were computed by comparison of the fluorescence yield with aminomethylcoumarin (Peptides International) measured in identical volumes (18.3 fluorescence units/μM/50 μl). Background fluorescence measured in wells containing the substrate in diluent was generally less than 20 fluorescence units and was subtracted from values observed in the presence of catalyst. [Tyr10-125I]VIP prepared as in (19Mody R.K. Tramontano A. Paul S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 44: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was incubated with light chains at 37°C in 200 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM glycine, 0.025% Tween 20, pH 7.7, for 6 h, and peptide hydrolysis was estimated by measuring the radioactivity soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Estimates of peptide breakdown by this method are essentially identical to those obtained by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography separation of intact and degraded fragments(20Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16128-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin was from bovine pancreas (3× crystallized, 3080 units/mg; U. S. Biochemical Corp). Initial rate data at varying substrate concentration were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis to the Michaelis-Menten-Henri equation (v = (Vmax[S])/(Km+ [S])) (Enzfitter, Elsevier-Biosoft). Since the catalyst concentration in some assays was in the range of the low end of VIP substrate concentrations analyzed, kinetic constants were also computed by a graphing routine as described in Ref. 21, which eliminates errors due to substrate depletion effects. The Ks and kcat values estimated by this method were essentially identical (<10% difference) to the kinetic constants reported (see I).RESULTSVIP and Peptide-MCA CleavageTwenty-one myeloma light chains and three VL domains were initially screened for proteolytic activity using radiodiodinated VIP as substrate, a 28-amino acid neuropeptide previously shown to serve as a target for catalytic antibodies(7Paul S. Volle D.J. Beach C.M. Johnson D.R. Powell M.J. Massey R.J. Science. 1989; 244: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 14Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Tyutyulkova S. Webster D. Rees A. Tramontano A. Massey R. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32389-32393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four light chains and one recombinant VL preparation hydrolyzed radiolabeled VIP (Table I). Further screening was performed using a panel of five peptide-MCA conjugates. Cleavage of the amide bond linking an amino acid with the terminal coumarin moiety in these conjugates serves as a surrogate for peptide bond hydrolysis, permitting rapid measurement of protease activity(22Sarath G. De La Motte R.S. Wagner F.W. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 25-55Google Scholar). Arg-MCA- and Lys-MCA-containing substrates were employed in the screening assays because recombinant anti-VIP light chains, thyroglobulin-specific autoantibodies, and polyclonal IgG preparations have previously been shown to display pronounced preference for cleavage at bonds containing basic amino acids(10Li L. Kaveri S. Tyutyulkova S. Kazatchkine M. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3328-3332Google Scholar, 14Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Tyutyulkova S. Webster D. Rees A. Tramontano A. Massey R. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32389-32393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A majority of the light chains (76%) and one VL preparation displayed detectable hydrolytic activity with one or more peptide-MCA substrates (). Wide variations were evident in the levels of hydrolysis of different substrates by individual light chains and of individual substrates by different light chains. The greatest frequency of hydrolysis was observed with Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA as substrate. Four light chain preparations displayed detectable hydrolysis of all five peptide-MCA substrates, and two displayed hydrolysis of four substrates.Table I:Peptidase activity of Bence Jones protein and recombinant VLfragment Open table in a new tab Cleavage of 10 additional MCA-conjugates of varying lengths and containing uncharged, acidic, or aromatic residues at the scissile bond by two light chains was measured (Table II). The activity of one of these light chains (Bence Jones protein B6) was comparatively indiscriminate, in that there was detectable cleavage at Ala-MCA, Phe-MCA, Met-MCA, Arg-MCA, and Lys-MCA bonds. Even single amino acid-MCA conjugates were cleaved by this light chain, but with increasing chain length, the activity acquired preference for Arg- and Lys-containing bonds. The second light chain (Bence Jones protein RHY) displayed essentially no hydrolysis of substrates containing MCA linked to uncharged, acidic, or aromatic amino acids. These observations indicate preferential cleavage at basic residue-MCA bonds by the light chains and a variable influence of N-terminal flanking residues in catalysis by the two light chains.Table II:Cleavage of various peptide-methylcoumarinamide substrates by two Bence Jones proteins, B6 and RHY Open table in a new tab KineticsThe initial rate data obtained at increasing substrate concentrations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 2). The Km for light chain-catalyzed hydrolysis for the peptide-MCA substrates ranged from 15-290 μM (Table III), values in the same range as those observed for conventional proteases. In contrast to the peptide-MCA substrates, VIP hydrolysis by both catalyst preparations examined was notable for low Km values, suggesting comparatively high affinity recognition of this substrate. In comparison, the Km for trypsin-catalyzed VIP hydrolysis, estimated by methods identical to those employed here, is approximately 3 orders of magnitude greater(14Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Tyutyulkova S. Webster D. Rees A. Tramontano A. Massey R. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32389-32393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the low Km values, the kinetic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of the VIP-hydrolyzing light chains approach those of conventional proteases. Apparent turnover numbers of the light chain (kcat) are in the same range or higher than of acyltransferase antibodies raised by immunization with presumed transition state analogs (for review, see Ref. 23). The hydrolysis of Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA and Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA by the same light chain (B6) was characterized by kinetic parameters that varied over 1 order of magnitude, confirming the conclusion that residues flanking the scissile bond (P2, P3, P4) play a role in substrate recognition.Figure 2:Initial rate data for VIP hydrolysis by rREC VL fragment (A) and Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA hydrolysis by Bence Jones protein B6 (B) fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

The VIP-hydrolyzing specific activities of fractions spanning the 12.5 kDa optical density peak of a VL preparation (Fig. 3A) were essentially identical (fractions 46-48, 3.6 × 103, 3.8 × 103, and 3.8 × 103 cpm hydrolyzed/μg of protein/6 h), suggesting catalyst homogeneity. Gel filtration of B6 light chain yielded two optical density peaks corresponding to the disulfide-linked dimer and monomer components (Fig. 3B). Most of the peptide-MCA activity in the renatured column fractions was associated with the monomer peak. Rechromatography of the monomer and dimer yielded peptide-MCA-hydrolyzing activity peaks that tracked exactly with the optical density peaks (Fig. 3C). The specific activities of fractions spanning the width of the dimer and monomer peaks were essentially constant (upperpanel, fractions 21-23: 29.4, 31.8, and 27.5 units ΔF/μg of protein/20 h, respectively; lowerpanel, fractions 24-26: 1.4 × 103, 1.5 × 103 and 1.5 × 103 units ΔF/μg of protein/20 h, respectively).Figure 3:Gel filtration of light chain and VL fragment catalytic activity.

These light chains were judged to be pure on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of a reducing agent. The gel filtration experiments furnish direct proof that the light chain itself is responsible for the observed activity since noncovalent complexation of adventitious proteins with the light chains would be precluded in the strong denaturant employed for chromatography. The expression of VIP-hydrolyzing activity in the 12.5 kDa peak of a recombinant VL fragment shows that the activity is attributable to the variable domain. This conclusion is supported by observations that many but not all light chains possess the activity, and that different light chains show varying activity levels and distinct specificity profiles.The presence of basic residues in the peptide substrates appears to favor expression of light chain catalytic activity. However, the sequence requirements are not uniformly stringent, and one light chain even hydrolyzed single amino acid-MCA conjugates. Recognition of the MCA conjugates by the light chains does not appear analogous, therefore, to typical high affinity binding interactions between antibodies and polypeptide antigens, which can involve extensive contacts at >15 residues(24Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Sheriff S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by observations of high micromolar Km values for the peptide-MCA hydrolysis reaction. Ks estimates, obtained as in Ref. 21, are close to the Km values, suggesting poor binding to the ground state of the substrate. Light chain and VL fragment catalyzed hydrolyses of VIP, on the other hand, was characterized by lower Km values, indicating comparatively high affinity recognition of the VIP ground state. VIP binding autoantibodies are found in healthy individuals (25Paul S. Heinz-Erian P. Said S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and patients with asthma(26Paul S. Said S.I. Thompson A.B. Volle D.J. Agrawal D.K. Foda H. De La Rocha S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1989; 23: 133-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The apparent specialization of certain catalytic light chains for binding and hydrolysis of an autologous peptide like VIP is consistent with recognition of other autoantigens by myeloma proteins(4Cisar J. Kabat E.A. Dorner M.M. Liao J. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Jonsson V. Schroder H.D. Trojaborg T.S. Jensen E. Hippe E. Hansen M. J. Intern.

Scand. 1988; 223: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The second feature distinguishing the peptide-MCA substrates and VIP is the frequency with which light chain hydrolytic activity was encountered. Seventeen proteins hydrolyzed the peptide-MCA substrates, whereas only five displayed VIP-hydrolyzing activity. This may reflect differences in structural requirements for cleavage of small versus large peptide substrates, as has been described for trypsin(27Noda Y. Fujiwara K. Yamamoto K. Fukuno T. Segawa S. Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For instance, the greater flexibility of small peptides may permit productive contact with the catalytic site, whereas comparatively rigid conformations found in larger molecules may make potential scissile bond inaccessible.Catalysis has been assumed to be a rare property of antibody subunits. Our finding that 17 of 24 light chains and VL fragments tested possess detectable proteolytic activity suggests that this may not be an uncommon phenomenon. There is no association evident between the observed catalytic activity and light chain isotype (κ or λ) or VL subgroup (). Taken together, the high frequency of catalysis and apparent low affinity recognition of structurally different peptide-MCA substrates suggest the presence of conserved structural components of the catalytic site in different light chains. Alternatively, these results may be explained by a tendency toward de novo development of catalytic activity during sequence diversification of light chain variable regions. The identities of amino acids responsible for the activity and the contributions of germ line inheritance, V-J gene rearrangement, and somatic mutation mechanisms in catalysis by different light chains are not yet known. A catalytic triad of Ser27a, His93, and Asp1 residues (Kabat numbering) in spatial arrangement similar to that of the active site of subtilisin has been identified in an anti-VIP light chain by molecular modeling(14Gao Q.-S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32389-32393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis experiments support the role of Ser27a and His93 as essential catalytic residues.2( 2Q.-S. Gao, M. Sun, and S. Paul (1995), abstract to be presented at the 9th International Congress of Immunology, San Fransisco, California, July 23-29, 1995.) Erhan and Greller (29Erhan S. Greller L.D. Nature. 1974; 251: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have previously noted a significant sequence similarity between the first complementarity determining region of certain Bence Jones proteins and the active site region in serine proteases.Light chains dimers serve as models for the antibody combining site (30, 31). In the instance of one light chain studied in detail (B6), the monomer form displayed substantially greater hydrolytic activity than the dimer. Thus, formation of an antibody-like site does not appear to be a prerequisite for catalytically productive substrate contact. This conclusion is relevant to potential intracellular expression of catalytic activity by light chains, wherein a reducing environment is likely to favor the monomer form. The extracellular concentrations of light chains in patients with multiple myeloma can reach millimolar levels(15Tillyer C.R. Iqbal J. Raymond J. Gore M. McIlwain T.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1991; 44: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Nelson M. Brown R.D. Gibson J. Joshua D.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 81: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Many light chains are capable of cleavage of small protease substrates containing basic residues, and some are capable of cleavage of the larger polypeptide, VIP. These results provide a rationale for examination of light chain-catalyzed peptide breakdown as a pathophysiological mechanism in patients with multiple myeloma. The example of VIP-hydrolysis may be directly relevant to tumor cell activity in vivo because this peptide has been shown to regulate antibody and interleukin synthesis by lymphocytes(32Kimata H.

INTRODUCTIONBence Jones proteins are monoclonal antibody light chains found in the urine of approximately 60% of multiple myeloma patients(1Jones H.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol.

Here, we describe evidence for peptidase activity attributable to the variable domain in a majority of light chains isolated from myeloma patients. This observation indicates that catalysis by antibody subunits is not a rare phenomenon and suggests a possible link between antibody catalysis and the pathophysiology of multiple myeloma."

In this study we investigated the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperone calnexin in AChR subunit folding and assembly. We have shown that calnexin interacts with nascent AChR α-subunits (AChR-α) in muscle cell cultures and in COS cells transfected with mouse AChR-α. In chick muscle cells maximal association of labeled α-subunits with calnexin was observed immediately after a 15-min pulse with [35S]methionine/cysteine and subsequently declined with a t of approximately 20 min. The decrease in association with calnexin was concomitant with the folding of the α-subunit to achieve conformational maturation shortly before assembly. Brefeldin A did not inhibit AChR subunit assembly or the dissociation of calnexin from the assembling subunits, confirming that the ER is the site of AChR assembly and that calnexin dissociation is not affected under conditions in which the exit of assembled AChR from the ER is blocked. These results indicate that calnexin participates directly in the molecular events that lead to AChR assembly.

Many of the cell surface proteins that participate in transmembrane signaling, including the ligand-gated ion channel family, are structural oligomers formed by intracellular assembly of polypeptide subunits. This assembly process typically takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1( 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptorMHCmajor histocompatibility complexBgtbungarotoxinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediummAbmonoclonal antibodyBFAbrefeldin ABiPimmunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein.)

The muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a ligand-gated membrane ion channel that mediates neuromuscular synaptic transmission upon binding the neurotransmitter acetylcholine released by the motor neuron. This binding alters the conformation of the receptor causing increased cation permeability and consequent membrane depolarization(4Galzi J.L. Revah F. Bessis A. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The AChRs are 250-kDa pentameric complexes of four discrete AChR subunits in the stoichiometry α2βgd, with each subunit encoded by a different gene and translated from a separate mRNA (for reviews see Refs. 6 and 7).

Studies utilizing cultured muscle cells expressing AChR have shown in pulse-chase experiments that an interval of between 15 and 45 min separates the synthesis of AChR subunits from their subsequent assembly into AChR pentamers(9Merlie J.P.

During this interval AChR subunits have been shown to undergo several post-translational modifications such as N-linked core glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, fatty acid acylation, and phosphorylation (for reviews see Refs. 8 and 11). The use of transfected cell lines has made it possible to address various aspects of subunit maturation and assembly, including the order in which the subunits are assembled (12Blount P. Merlie J.P.

Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for the assembly of AChR in a precise stoichiometry and order of subunits are poorly understood. The role of the ER lumen in maintaining a unique microenvironment that can mediate correct folding of newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins and bring about the assembly of multimeric proteins is now well documented. A related feature is the capacity to prevent the export of misfolded protein products and unassembled subunits by their selective retention in the ER(1Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Recent studies have characterized in increasing detail the contributions to these functions of a number of ER resident molecular chaperones, proteins that interact with newly synthesized polypeptide chains to prevent aggregation and misfolding and possibly to mediate specific oligomerization events (for reviews see Refs. 17-20). Calnexin, an ER chaperone that is itself a transmembrane protein(21Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol.

Together these studies suggest a causal relationship between association with calnexin and oligomerization of multisubunit proteins. In the present study we show that nascent AChR α-subunit (AChR-α) forms complexes with calnexin in the ER of cultured muscle cells and COS cells transfected with mouse AChR-α. In muscle cells this association is transient with conformationally mature subunits undergoing dissociation from calnexin. Our results indicate that transient interaction with calnexin is an early post-translational event in AChR biogenesis, contributing to the folding and assembly of AChR subunits in the ER.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were from Sigma. Muscle primary cultures were prepared from breast muscle of 12-day-old chick embryos as described previously(10Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol.

Cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 2% chick embryo extract at 37°C in an atmosphere of 92% air, 8% CO2. COS cells (African green monkey kidney cells, CRL 1650, American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Anti-chick AChR-α antibody and anti-chick AChR d-subunit (AChR-d) antibody were raised in rabbits against the respective subunits purified on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from denervated chick leg muscle and were shown to be noncross-reactive(10Ross A.F.

The monoclonal antibody mAb 61, which recognizes mouse AChR-α, was provided by Dr. Jon Lindstrom. Anti-calnexin antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly conserved stretch near the COOH terminus (amino acids 487-505) of calnexin(32Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A.

Full-length cDNA coding for the mouse AChR-α (provided by Dr. Jim Boulter) was subcloned into the pRc/CMV expression vector (Invitrogen), which contains a simian virus 40 origin and is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfection of COS cells for transient expression of AChR-α was carried out by DNA-calcium phosphate precipitation(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, 60-mm dishes of cells at 30-50% confluence were incubated for 6-16 h at 37°C with 5 μg of the α-subunit expression vector in a mixture containing CaCl2 and HEPES-buffered saline solution. Cultures were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 1 more day before cells were harvested. AChR on intact muscle cells was monitored by the binding of 125I-α-Bgt as described previously(10Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Prives J.M. Fulton A.B. Penman S. Daniels M.P. Christian C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cultures were washed once with DMEM and incubated with 125I-α-Bgt (10-8M) in DMEM containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. At the end of this period, cultures were washed five times with 3-ml volumes of DMEM to remove unbound toxin. Cells were solubilized in 1 N NaOH containing 1% Triton X-100, and labeling was quantitated by g-counting. Cultures were methionine-depleted by incubation with methionine-free DMEM for 1 h and then labeled at 37°C with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Tran35S-label; for specific activities see figure legends) in methionine-free DMEM for the specified time. In the pulse-chase experiments, chase was performed by washing cells once with DMEM followed by incubation in DMEM supplemented with 5 mML-methionine. Cells were harvested as follows. Cultures were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and extracted for 30 min at 4°C in HBS buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide) supplemented with 2% sodium cholate. Alternatively, cells were harvested exactly as above, except that instead of HBS cholate, the lysis buffer was STE (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Clarification of the extracts was achieved by centrifugation for 30 min in the microcentrifuge at 4°C. The clarified supernatants were incubated at 4°C with the specified antiserum for 3 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added, and incubation at 4°C was continued for a further 1 h. When mAb 61 was used as the first antibody, rabbit anti-rat antisera preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose were used in the second incubation. The precipitates were washed five times with the specified detergent-containing buffer and suspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer(36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 min in a boiling water bath, the beads were centrifuged, and the supernatants were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive bands were visualized by radiofluorography and quantitated by densitometry or PhosphorImaging. In Fig. 6, each data point is an average of measurements from three separate experiments ± S.D. Sequential immunoprecipitations were carried out as described by Ou et al.(37Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 36: 771-776Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin or anti-α antibody, proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads under denaturing conditions by suspending in 50 μl of HBS containing 1% SDS and heating at 75°C for 10 min. The supernatants were then diluted with 1 ml of HBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and precipitated with the second antibody. Where specified, elution was carried out under nondenaturing conditions by incubating the precipitates twice sequentially with 0.5 ml of HBS containing 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. We have shown earlier that the assembly into oligomeric AChR of [35S]methionine-labeled α-subunit can be monitored accurately in pulse-chase experiments by its coprecipitation with antiserum specific for the d-subunit and noncross-reactive with α-subunit(10Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These measurements revealed that AChR assembly in chick muscle cells is initiated 15-30 min after subunit biosynthesis and is completed within the next 60 min(10Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the object of our present study was to determine the contribution of the ER resident protein calnexin to AChR assembly, we first ascertained that assembly takes place in the ER of cultured chick myotubes. For this purpose, we measured the effects on AChR biogenesis of BFA, an antiviral antibiotic that blocks the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and cell surface while causing vesiculation of Golgi cisternae and Golgi-ER fusion (for review see Ref. 38). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, cultured myotubes were pulse labeled with Tran35S-label for 15 min and then incubated for the specified intervals in chase medium either in the absence or presence of BFA (1 μg/ml). AChR assembly was monitored by coimmunoprecipitation of labeled α-subunit with anti-d antibody. The appearance of AChR on the external surface of muscle cells was monitored by labeling intact cells with the AChR ligand α-Bgt and subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-α-Bgt antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the newly synthesized α-subunit is clearly discernible as a 40-kDa band upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of Triton X-100 extracts of radiolabeled cultures that have been immunoprecipitated with anti-α antibody (lane 1). Under these conditions, in which cultures were extracted and immunoprecipitated immediately after the 15-min pulse, only a minimal amount of α-subunit is precipitated with anti-d antibody, reflecting the low level of assembly at this early time point (lane 2, also see Fig. 5B). However, after a 90-min chase period a major proportion of the labeled α-subunit has undergone assembly and is consequently coprecipitated with anti-d antibody (lane 3). We have previously observed that AChR assembly in chick muscle cells is highly efficient, with practically all nascent α-subunit being chased into oligomeric complexes under these experimental conditions(10Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted by ourselves (10Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others(39Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the d-subunit, which migrates at 55 kDa, is difficult to resolve in [35S]methionine-labeled preparations because of its high susceptibility to proteolysis and nonspecific backgrounds in this region of the gel. Therefore, d-subunit could not be identified as a distinct band in this figure. At the end of a 3-h chase period the radiolabeled assembled α-subunits have been transported to the cell surface, and can now be precipitated from α-Bgt surface-labeled cultures with anti-α-Bgt antibody (Fig. 1, lane 5). Treatment of cultures with BFA completely abolished the transport of pulse-labeled AChR to the cell surface (lane 6) but had no effect on the assembly of labeled α-subunit with d-subunit in the same cultures (lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that AChR assembly in chick myotubes takes place within a BFA-insensitive compartment, likely the ER. Our subsequent experiments focused on investigating the interactions within the ER which contribute to AChR subunit folding and assembly.Figure 5:Panel A, time course of maturation of nascent AChR-α. Cultured muscle cells were pulse labeled with Tran35S-label (200 μCi/ml, 15 min) and chased for the indicated times. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods,” using nonimmune serum (lane 1) or mAb 35, a conformation-sensitive antibody that selectively recognizes folded AChR-α (lanes 2-6). Panel B, time course of assembly of nascent AChR-α with AChR-d. Cultured muscle cells were pulse labeled and chased exactly as described in panel A.

To investigate the possibility that calnexin participates in AChR subunit folding and assembly, we first determined if recently synthesized AChR subunits are bound to calnexin. Cultured chick muscle cells were labeled with Tran35S-label for 1 h, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antisera under conditions shown to preserve the interaction between calnexin and associated proteins(37Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 36: 771-776Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar), resulting in the presence in the precipitate of a large number of labeled proteins (not shown). The anti-calnexin immunoprecipitate was then solubilized by incubating the protein A-Sepharose beads in SDS-containing buffer and reimmunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibody. Radiolabeled calnexin is prominent, migrating as a doublet at ~90 kDa (Fig. 2A, from left, first lane), consistent with the migration pattern observed by others(40Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde A.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the solubilized anti-calnexin immunoprecipitate was reimmunoprecipitated with anti-α-subunit antibody, labeled α-subunit was clearly resolved (Fig. 2A, fourth lane). For comparison, the fifth lane of Fig. 2A shows the result of the immunoprecipitation of these cells using the anti-α-subunit antibody twice in sequence. Together, these immunoprecipitations indicate that a measurable amount of the AChR-α synthesized by chick muscle cells during the labeling period becomes physically associated with calnexin. We repeated these measurements with COS cells transfected with mouse AChR-α. In contrast to muscle cell cultures, which express all four AChR subunits and transport assembled AChR to the cell surface, the COS cells expressed only the one transfected subunit, which does not assemble into pentameric AChR and is restricted to the ER (41).2( 2W. Chang and J. M. Prives, unpublished observations.) As shown in Fig. 2B, in these cells a portion of the AChR-α is coimmunoprecipitated by antibody directed against calnexin, comparable to the results obtained with the myotubes. These results show that calnexin and α-subunit association is not a phenomenon specific to muscle cells, nor is it restricted to α-subunit that is undergoing assembly into pentameric AChR. To confirm the specificity of the association of calnexin with α subunit, this interaction was also investigated using an alternative order of sequential immunoprecipitations, and the results are shown in Fig. 3A. To visualize calnexin associated with α-subunit, cells were metabolically labeled for 15 h and then extracted and immunoprecipitated first with anti-α antibody and then with anti-calnexin antibody (lane 3). The long labeling period was utilized since calnexin is relatively stable with a metabolic t > 24 h(20Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Under these conditions calnexin coimmunoprecipitated by anti-α antibody was clearly visible (though constituting only a small fraction of total cellular calnexin; compare lanes 2 and 3). When the monoclonal antibody mAb 35, which selectively recognizes conformationally mature α-subunit(31Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used instead of anti-α antibody in the first immunoprecipitation, the amount of calnexin precipitated was not significantly above background (lane 4). These data showed that anti-α antibody, which recognizes unfolded as well as folded AChR-α, was more effective than mAb 35 in precipitating α-subunit-calnexin complexes, suggesting that calnexin does not bind appreciably to folded α. To verify this finding, the sequential immunoprecipitations were repeated but this time with anti-calnexin antibody followed by mAb 35. To preserve the mAb 35 epitope, α-subunit coprecipitated with calnexin was resolubilized under nondenaturing conditions using Triton X-100. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, a readily detectable amount of radiolabeled α-subunit was precipitated with anti-calnexin followed by anti-α antibody (third lane), whereas only a trace of α-subunit was precipitated with anti-calnexin followed by mAb 35 (fourth lane). Since under these conditions both anti-chick α-subunit antibody and mAb 35 were equally efficient in immunoprecipitating mature α-subunit in assembled AChR (data not shown), these results support the idea that calnexin preferentially associates with unfolded α-subunit that has not acquired mAb 35 epitope. We next measured the time course of the interaction of α-subunit with calnexin in the context of subunit folding and assembly. For this purpose cultures were labeled for 15 min with Tran35S-label and then chased in DMEM supplemented with 5 mML-methionine for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. Shown in Fig. 4A (lanes 3-6) are the results of sequential anti-calnexin, anti-α immunoprecipitations after increasing chase intervals. The maximal levels of radiolabeled α-subunit associated with calnexin were evident immediately after the 15-min pulse period (Fig. 4A, lane 3) and could be seen to decrease rapidly in a time-dependent manner during the chase period (Fig. 4A, lanes 4-6). Scanning densitometry and PhosphorImager measurements showed that the α-subunit band precipitated by anti-calnexin antibody at the end of the pulse period consistently contained 10-20% of the radioactivity found in a similar band precipitated by anti-AChR-α antibody twice sequentially. Titration of radiolabeled calnexin precipitated with increasing amounts of anti-calnexin antibody (not shown) revealed that the amount of anti-calnexin antibody used in these experiments was sufficient for precipitation of approximately 20% of the total cellular calnexin. Taking this into account, as well as the weak nature of calnexin binding to substrate proteins which may lead to some dissociation upon cell lysis, it is likely that a major proportion of nascent AChR-α undergoes transient association with calnexin in the ER of chick myotubes. Fig. 4B shows the rate at which AChR-α dissociates from calnexin in myotubes as measured in pulse-chase experiments. When plotted semilogarithmically this rate can be fitted by a straight line, characteristic of first-order kinetics. As calculated from this curve the initial half-time of dissociation of calnexin from newly synthesized AChR-α is 20 ± 2 min. The finding that α-subunit-calnexin complexes exist transiently led us to investigate the temporal relationship between AChR-α-calnexin dissociation and the two major developmental changes that the α-subunit undergoes in the ER of myotubes: conformational maturation and assembly. The folding of AChR-α was measured by the ability of this subunit to be recognized by the conformation-specific antibody mAb 35(31Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the amount of labeled α-subunit precipitated by mAb 35 increases as a function of chase time (lanes 2-6), reflecting the fact that nascent α-subunits in chick myotubes undergo time-dependent post-translational changes leading to conformational maturation. The same experimental approach was used to measure the time course of α-subunit assembly with d-subunit. Muscle cultures were pulse labeled with Tran35S-label and then chased for the specified intervals. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-chick AChR-a antibody. Fig. 5B shows the time-dependent increase in the amount of 35S-labeled α-subunit coimmunoprecipitated with anti-d subunit antibody (lanes 2-6). To verify that this rise reflects increased AChR subunit assembly, we determined that the amount of labeled α-subunit directly immunoprecipitated by anti-α antibody does not change with increasing chase times (Fig. 5C). The results shown thus far indicate that in the ER of cultured muscle cells nascent α-subunits participate in three separate processes: the reversible interaction with calnexin, folding leading to conformational maturation, and assembly with other subunits. The temporal sequence of these events is shown in Fig. 6. The association of nascent α-subunit with calnexin is the first of these processes, occurring immediately after biosynthesis. This association is transient and is followed by the relatively rapid dissociation of the calnexin-α-subunit complex (Fig. 4). Also, the results suggest that under these experimental conditions folding precedes assembly by an interval of 10-20 min. As can be seen in Fig. 6, after a 30-min chase interval approximately 70% of the α-subunit has dissociated from calnexin, 65% has achieved conformational maturation, but only about 35% has undergone assembly. These measurements indicate that the conformational maturation of the α-subunit occurs concomitantly with the dissociation of the calnexin-α-subunit complex, whereas assembly of α- with a-subunits occurs only after the α-subunit has dissociated from calnexin. To investigate further the relationship between α-subunit interaction with calnexin on the one hand and AChR assembly and exit from the ER on the other, we tested the possibility that calnexin-α-subunit dissociation is a consequence of the exit of the assembled AChR from the ER. Muscle cells were pulse labeled for 15 min and then chased for the specified intervals and immunoprecipitated sequentially with anti-calnexin antibody followed by anti-chick AChR-α antibody. In this experiment, the chase medium contained BFA, which does not affect AChR assembly but prevents the transport of newly assembled receptors out of the ER to the cell surface (Fig. 1). As can be seen in Fig. 7, BFA treatment did not alter the rate of calnexin dissociation from the α-subunit. Thus, the dissociation of the calnexin-α-subunit complex is not dependent on the transport of the subunit from the ER, similar to findings reported for MHC class I-calnexin complex dissociation(22Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this study we found that the ER-resident molecular chaperone calnexin forms complexes with newly synthesized AChR-α in cultured chick muscle cells as well as in COS cells transfected with mouse AChR-α. Using pulse-chase analysis we observed that nascent α-subunits associate with calnexin immediately or soon after their synthesis, before the folding of the subunits into a mature conformation takes place. These complexes are transient; shortly after complex formation the α-subunit dissociates from calnexin with a half-time of approximately 20 min. A comparison of the kinetics of α-subunit-calnexin dissociation with those of α-subunit folding and subsequent assembly indicates that α-subunits remain associated with calnexin during the process of conformational maturation. The onset of AChR assembly occurs only after a major proportion of calnexin has dissociated from α-subunits. Thus, calnexin appears to be directly involved in the folding rather than in the assembly of AChR-α. However, it is important to note that our measurements of the time course of AChR assembly detected only high affinity interactions between α- and a-subunits, and these might be preceded by weak interactions that take place in the presence of calnexin. In this respect the interaction of calnexin with AChR appears to be different from the interaction of calnexin with several other oligomeric membrane proteins where the kinetics support the possibility that calnexin physically mediates oligomerization. Degen and Williams (22) reported that calnexin remains complexed with the heavy chain of MHC class I during the assembly of this oligomeric membrane protein and dissociates only after other components have been assembled into the complex. Similarly, calnexin was found to remain associated with MHC class II complexes throughout the assembly process(25Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dissociation of calnexin was observed to be concomitant with the assembly of oligomers in the cases of T cell receptors (26David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and integrins(29Lenter M. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been documented that in both MHC class I complexes (22Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and T cell receptors (26David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the absence of one of the subunits prevented assembly of the oligomers and dissociation of calnexin. The apparent “early” dissociation of calnexin from AChR-α as compared with MHC class I complexes and T cell receptors could reflect the possibility that whereas the assembly of the immunological receptors takes place in the ER, the assembly of AChR might not be completed until after the subunits have been transported from the ER to the Golgi. If the later stages of AChR assembly occur in the Golgi apparatus, the direct participation of calnexin would not be anticipated since the chaperone is apparently restricted to the ER by means of a COOH-terminal ER retention motif(27Rajapopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 42Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The results of our experiments utilizing BFA do not support the possibility that the Golgi apparatus is the site of AChR assembly. BFA causes disruption of the Golgi apparatus (43Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) and was shown to abolish the assembly of connexin, a multisubunit surface membrane protein that undergoes assembly in the Golgi apparatus(3Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the present study BFA treatment that totally blocked transport of AChR between ER and cell surface had no effect on AChR subunit assembly. Likewise, we found that the kinetics of calnexin dissociation from AChR-α were not altered by the BFA treatment. Together these results strongly indicate that the ER is the site of AChR assembly and that dissociation of calnexin-α subunit complexes is not due to the transport of AChR out of the ER. This complements earlier evidence, based on subcellular fractionation (13Blount P. McHardy M.S. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and susceptibility to endoglycosidase digestion (41), which pointed to the ER as the site of AChR assembly in mouse muscle cell lines. Several considerations support the possibility that in chick muscle cells calnexin interacts with α subunits that are destined to assemble. According to our current results, calnexin in these cells forms complexes with the major proportion of newly made α-subunits. It is unlikely that this large pool of calnexin-bound α-subunits represents a nonassembling population of α, since AChR oligomerization in chick myotubes appears to be highly efficient with practically all nascent α-subunits undergoing assembly(10Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both the transient nature of α-subunit-calnexin complexes and the timing of their dissociation suggest that the complexes represent intermediates in AChR subunit folding and assembly. These conclusions are summarized in the model shown in Fig. 8, which incorporates calnexin association-dissociation into the sequence of events leading to AChR assembly. According to the scheme, the existence of the transient calnexin-subunit complexes occurs during the lag time between subunit biosynthesis and assembly. During this interval calnexin may both prevent nonproductive aggregation and mediate correct folding of the subunits. Calnexin is the second ER molecular chaperone shown to complex with AChR subunits. BiP, a soluble ER molecular chaperone that forms transient complexes with several nascent proteins and more stable complexes with misfolded proteins(44Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 45Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 46Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), was recently reported to bind to AChR subunits expressed in the muscle-like cell line BC3H1, transfected fibroblasts(47Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), C2 mouse myotubes, and transfected COS cells(48Forsayeth J.R. Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As in the present case of calnexin, BiP selectively binds to unassembled α-subunits and does not bind to conformationally mature or assembled AChR-α. However, the kinetics of the high affinity association of α-subunit with BiP are completely different from those of calnexin-α-interaction. The formation of BiP-α-subunit complexes has been reported to occur with a time course that is slower than folding and assembly. Moreover, the amount of α-subunit stably associated with BiP was observed to increase during chase times of up to 6 h(48Forsayeth J.R. Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These differences in kinetics suggest that BiP and calnexin play distinct roles in AChR biogenesis. Whereas BiP forms complexes with subunits that are misfolded and unable to assemble(48Forsayeth J.R. Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), our data are consistent with the possibility that calnexin facilitates the correct folding of AChR subunits. Although it is possible that BiP also complexes with AChR subunits en route to assembly by means of reversible, low affinity binding, such interactions have not been described. Recently it has been proposed that the unassembled monomer of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein can bind to both BiP and calnexin(28Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 42Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 49Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), indicating that the participation of both of these chaperones in the biogenesis of membrane oligomers may be a more general phenomenon. Calnexin may constitute a part of the ER quality control mechanism by forming complexes with nascent subunits and selectively releasing correctly folded subunits while irreversibly misfolded subunits are complexed with BiP and eventually get degraded. In the case of the AChR there is evidence that ER quality control mechanisms may operate not only at the level of subunit folding but also at subsequent levels of assembly and postassembly. For instance, a C2 muscle cell subline has been described in which a fully assembled variant form of AChR does not exit the ER(41Gu Y. Ralston E. Murphy-Erdosh C. Black R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 10: 729-738Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 50Gu Y. Black R.A. Ring G. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11952-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2024149807,"In a recent study (Goltz, J. S., Wolkoff, A. W., Novikoff, P. M., Stockert, R. J., and Satir, P.(1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 7026-7030), we found that ligand- and receptor-containing endocytic vesicles bind to endogenous microtubules in vitro after 60 min of receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialo-orosomucoid. In the presence of ATP, ligand-containing endocytic vesicles are released from microtubules, while those containing receptor are not. We hypothesized that cytoplasmic dynein may associate with ligand-containing, but not receptor-containing, domains of endocytic vesicles and might be involved in the movement of ligand-containing vesicles along microtubules during sorting of ligand from receptor. Direct evidence in support of this hypothesis has been obtained in the present study. Binding of ligand-containing vesicles to microtubules correlates highly (p < 0.001) with binding of dynein, but not kinesin, under a variety of conditions. Binding of receptor-containing vesicles to microtubules is independent of both cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin binding. Tight association of cytoplasmic dynein with a population of ligand-containing vesicles is seen directly by immunoprecipitation. These results support the view that in receptor-mediated endocytosis, ligand-containing vesicles become bound to microtubules by cytoplasmic dynein. While receptor domains of endosomes remain attached to microtubules in an ATP-independent manner, ligand-containing domains might be moved away toward pericentrosomal lysosomes by this motor molecule.

Treatment of cells with cytoskeletal inhibitors, such as nocodazole or colchicine, inhibits segregation (4Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J.

In particular, it was found that microtubule (MT) inhibitors markedly delayed segregation of ligand and receptor into functionally discrete endosomal compartments. Based on these initial observations, we hypothesized that interaction of specific populations of late endocytic vesicles with a polarized network of microtubules in hepatocytes might be important in establishing their vectorial movement(11Goltz J.S.

Although cytoplasmic dynein, a MT-activated ATPase that has been implicated in centripetal (minus end-directed) movement of vesicles and organelles along MTs (12-21), was suggested as a possible linking protein that could provide a vectorial force sufficient for ligand-receptor segregation, evidence for its association with components of the endocytic pathway, based largely on light microscopy immunofluorescent studies, was tenuous. receptor-mediated endocytosis asialo-orosomucoid microtubule intermediate chain head chain fluorescein isothiocyanate adenosine 5′-(β,g-methylene)triphosphate adenosine −5′(β,g-imino)triphosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Tris-buffered saline serum-free medium. In a recent study, we found that ligand- and receptor-containing endocytic vesicles bind to stabilized endogenous MTs in vitro after 60 min of RME of ASOR(11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, ligand-containing endocytic vesicles are released from MTs, while those containing receptor are not(11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Several proteins, including cytoplasmic dynein, associate with MTs and are released by ATP addition, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Based on this preliminary information, we hypothesized that cytoplasmic dynein may associate with ligand-containing, but not receptor-containing, domains of endocytic vesicles and might be involved in the movement of ligand-containing vesicles along MTs during sorting of ligand from receptor. Direct evidence in support of this hypothesis has been obtained in the present study. Earlier methods (11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been modified to quantify endocytic vesicles and cytoplasmic dynein that bind to MTs in the presence of nucleotides. In some experiments, we have also quantified MT-bound kinesin, the plus-directed motor protein that may mediate anterograde organelle transport(18Schliwa M. Shimizu T. Vale R.D. Euteneuer U. J.

Binding of ligand-containing vesicles correlates highly with binding of dynein, but not kinesin, to MTs under a variety of conditions. Binding of receptor-containing vesicles is independent of both cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin binding. Most importantly, tight association of cytoplasmic dynein with a population of ligand-containing vesicles derived from a defined initiation of RME can now be demonstrated directly by immunoprecipitation. ASOR was prepared from human orosomucoid (Sigma) by neuraminidase digestion (4Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 357-381Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and was labeled with 125I by a chloramine-T method to a specific activity of 10,000-13,000 cpm/ng(4Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 357-381Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-chicken embryo tubulin antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-74-kDa cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (IC) antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-130-kDa kinesin head chain (HC) antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase, goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated to peroxidase, goat anti-mouse IgM-agarose, and mouse IgM (MOPC-104E) were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse IgG1 conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Cy3 and goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated to FITC, Cy3, or Cy5 were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab. Inc.

ATP, ADP, AMP, AMP-PCP, AMP-PNP, GTP, CTP, adenosine, and vanadate were purchased from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Taxol (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored as a 1 mM stock solution at −20°C. Rat hepatocytes were isolated from 200-250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) after perfusion of the liver with collagenase (Type IV, Sigma) and were cultured overnight as we have previously described(3Harford J. Wolkoff A.W. Ashwell G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1824-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J.

Invest. 1985; 76: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy studies, hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated coverslips as previously described(28Wolkoff A.W. Sosiak A. Greenblatt H. Van Renswoude J. Stockert R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At various times, hepatocytes were permeabilized in MEPS buffer (5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM EGTA, 35 mM K125 PIPES, and 0.2 M sucrose, pH 7.1), containing 0.1 M GTP and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min at 37°C, and subsequently fixed in a 0.25% glutaraldehyde/MEPS mixture for 5 min at 37°C. After washing, the permeabilized cells were exposed either to mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody or anti-74-kDa dynein IC overnight at 0°C and then rinsed and exposed to either FITC- or Cy3- labeled secondary antibody against mouse IgG1 for localization of microtubules or either FITC- or Cy3-labeled secondary antibody against mouse IgM for localization of dynein. Controls for nonspecific fluorescence binding of secondary antibodies were performed. In some experiments, continuous wave endocytosis of Texas Red-ASOR was established, and fluorescent endosomes and MTs were colocalized. The preparations were examined with a confocal fluorescent microscope (Bio-Rad 600) equipped with a krypton/argon laser at the appropriate wavelengths. Several optical sections of permeabilized cells were scanned for three-dimensional reconstruction. Cells were washed with serum-free medium (SFM), preincubated for 60 min at 37°C, and then incubated for 60 min at 4°C with 125I-ASOR (1.25 μg) in 3 ml of SFM to saturate cell surface receptors(4Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 357-381Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with SFM at 4°C to remove unbound ligand and were incubated at 37°C for 60 min to initiate a synchronous single wave of RME. Cells were harvested into MEPS buffer (1.5 ml per 5 dishes) containing protease inhibitors (2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml N-α-benzoyl-L-arginine methyl ester, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and 1 mM dithiothreitol(29Dabora S.L. Sheetz M.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After cells were homogenized by 20 strokes in a tight Dounce on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ´ g for 10 min at 4°C. This supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 ´ g for 20 min at 4°C(11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The supernatant (crude cytosolic extract) was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with 20 μM taxol to polymerize endogenous tubulin. Following an additional timed incubation at 37°C with or without various concentrations of ATP, the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 ´ g for 30 min at 4°C to sediment MTs and associated endocytic vesicles and proteins. In some experiments, 40,000 ´ g supernatants were kept at 4°C for 60 min without taxol addition prior to centrifugation at 16,000 ´ g. In other experiments, various nucleotides, adenosine, and vanadate were used instead of ATP. The pellet was dissolved in 0.5 ml of sample buffer, consisting of 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8(28Wolkoff A.W. Sosiak A. Greenblatt H. Van Renswoude J. Stockert R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All nucleotides and adenosine were dissolved in MEPS buffer and adjusted to pH 7.1 with NaOH just before use. A small aliquot of the supernatant was used for protein determination according to Lowry et al.(30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet dissolved in sample buffer was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 6-18 h at −70°C. The amount of 125I-ASOR bound to MTs was estimated by densitometric analysis of autoradiograms using an UltraScan XL scanner (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden). Following 5, 7.5, or 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose paper (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA) in a Trans-Blot SD Cell (Bio-Rad) at 200 mA for 1 h. After transfer, the nitrocellulose sheet was soaked for 1 h in 3% nonfat dry milk in 0.15 M NaCl containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (TBS), followed by 1 h of shaking in rabbit anti-chicken embryo tubulin antibody (diluted 1:50 in 3.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3 in TBS), rabbit anti-rat asialoglycoprotein receptor antibody (diluted 1:100), rabbit anti-calf brain cytoplasmic dynein antibody (diluted 1:500), or mouse anti-130-kDa kinesin HC antibody (diluted 1:500). Each sheet was washed for 1 h in 1% Tween 20 in TBS and was agitated gently for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (diluted 1:1,000 in TBS) or anti-mouse IgM conjugated to peroxidase (diluted 1:1,000), as appropriate, followed by washing three times in 1% Tween 20 in TBS. IBI Enzygraphic™ Web (International Biotechnologies, Inc., New Haven, CT) was used for colorimetric detection of peroxidase-linked probes. All procedures were performed at room temperature. The amount of tubulin, receptor, cytoplasmic dynein, or kinesin in the MT pellet was estimated by densitometric analysis of each immunoblot using an UltraScan XL scanner. Following a 60-min single wave of RME of 125I-ASOR, the 40,000 ´ g supernatant of hepatocytes was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with 20 μM taxol for MT polymerization. After an additional 30-min incubation at 37°C with 10 mM ATP to release cytoplasmic dynein and endocytic vesicles from MTs, the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 ´ g for 30 min at 4°C. This supernatant (tubulin free) was collected and incubated overnight at 4°C with monoclonal anti-74-kDa cytoplasmic dynein IC antibody, 130-kDa anti-kinesin HC antibody, or non-immune IgM. After addition of secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgM)-agarose beads, each mixture was incubated at 4°C for 4 h. After low speed centrifugation, the pellet was washed four times in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM EDTA. The pellet was heated at 90°C for 10 min in 200 μl of sample buffer and was subjected to SDS-PAGE and radioautography to detect ligand or immunoblot to detect receptor. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance. Correlations between either cytoplasmic dynein or kinesin and endocytic vesicles containing either ligand or receptor bound to MTs in the presence of various nucleotides were tested by linear regression analysis. Using confocal microscopy, we have confirmed earlier observations (11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that following RME, ligand-containing endosomes are found in linear arrays that lie in close association parallel to hepatocyte MTs in situ (data not shown). We have now shown that cytoplasmic dynein colocalizes with MTs in these cells (Fig. 1). Cytoplasmic dynein, as seen in Fig. 1b, is abundant in hepatocytes. Under the conditions of permeabilization in the absence of ATP, the major localization is clearly coincident (Fig. 1c) with the microtubular cytoskeleton (Fig. 1a). When primary antibody against cytoplasmic dynein is omitted, only background fluorescence that is not coincident (Fig. 1f) with MTs (Fig. 1d) is still seen (Fig. 1e). We have modified our previous qualitative assay (11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to develop an assay to quantify the association of cytoplasmic dynein and ligand-containing endosomes in vitro. The zero time points in each panel in Fig. 2 represent aliquots of 40,000 ´ g supernatant, which were kept at 4°C for 60 min without taxol addition prior to centrifugation at 16,000 ´ g. Under this condition, there was no recovery of tubulin, dynein, ligand, receptor, or kinesin (Fig. 2). This indicates that in the absence of microtubules, there is no sedimentation of endocytic vesicles at 16,000 ´ g. Although GTP hydrolysis is needed to promote the assembly of tubulin(32Stewart R.J. Farrell K.W. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6489-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33O'Brien E.T. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4148-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), there was little difference in tubulin recovery in the MT pellets from crude cytosolic extracts incubated in 20 μM taxol at 37°C (34) with or without 1 mM GTP (data not shown). We therefore polymerized MTs in the presence of taxol but not GTP as described above. Formation of polymerized MTs from endogenous tubulin during incubation at 37°C with 20 μM taxol was linear for 30 min, after which a plateau was reached (Fig. 2a). Virtually all initially soluble tubulin was recovered in this pellet. In a preliminary experiment, immediate addition of 5 mM ATP to the incubation mixture reduced the amount of tubulin in the MT pellet (data not shown). However, addition of ATP after a 30-min preincubation with taxol had no effect on the recovery of MTs in the pellet (Fig. 2a). The amount of tubulin in the MT pellet increased linearly with the protein concentration of hepatic crude cytosolic extract from 1.8 to 7.2 mg/ml. We therefore chose 30 min of preincubation with 20 μM taxol, 30 min of additional incubation with or without 5 mM ATP, and 4-6 mg/ml of hepatic crude extract protein concentration as the optimal assay conditions. During incubation at 37°C, binding of cytoplasmic dynein to MTs increased for 90 min and then plateaued when approximately 50% of initially soluble dynein pelleted with MTs (Fig. 2b). Binding of ligand-containing endocytic vesicles to MTs paralleled that of cytoplasmic dynein (Fig. 2c). In contrast, binding of receptor-containing vesicles to MTs reached a plateau within 30 min when 80% or more of receptor pelleted with MTs (Fig. 2d), similar to results for MT polymerization. Only a small percent of total soluble kinesin associated with MTs prepared under these conditions (Fig. 2e). Addition of 5 mM ATP after a 30-min preincubation with taxol resulted in inhibition of binding of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin to MTs. Binding of ligand-containing endocytic vesicles was also inhibited, but there was no effect of ATP on binding of receptor-containing vesicles (Fig. 2, b-e). Upon addition for 30 min of increasing concentrations of ATP (0.5-10 mM), binding of ligand-containing vesicles to MTs was reduced in parallel to binding of cytoplasmic dynein and also to kinesin, while binding of receptor-containing vesicles to MTs was unchanged (Fig. 3a). Under these conditions, there was no effect on recovery of tubulin in the MT pellet (Fig. 3a). Double-reciprocal plots of the fractional inhibition of binding of cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and ligand-containing vesicles versus [ATP] to MTs were linear (Fig. 4). The apparent values for Ki and maximal inhibition of binding to MTs are shown in Table I.Figure 4:Inhibition by ATP of binding of cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and ligand-containing vesicles to MTs. Data here correspond to data in Fig. 3 and are presented as a double reciprocal plot of the percent inhibition of MT binding versus [ATP]. The apparent values for K and maximal inhibition of binding to MTs are shown in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I:Analysis of inhibition by ATP of binding of cytoplasmic dynein and ligand-containing endocytic vesicles to MTs Open table in a new tab The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP was substituted for ATP in the previous experiment (Fig. 3b). With increasing concentrations of AMP-PNP, binding of cytoplasmic dynein and ligand-containing vesicles to MTs still decreased in parallel, while binding of receptor-containing vesicles to MTs and recovery of tubulin in the MT pellet remained unchanged. In contrast to results with ATP, binding of kinesin to MTs did not change in the presence of AMP-PNP. The effects of 5 mM concentrations of nucleotides and adenosine and 50 μM vanadate on binding of cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and endocytic vesicles to MTs are summarized in Table II. None of the agents affected either receptor-containing vesicles bound to MTs or MT polymerization as measured by percent recovered in the pellet. GTP reduced binding of cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and ligand-containing vesicles to MTs only slightly less effectively than did ATP. CTP also reduced binding of cytoplasmic dynein and ligand-containing vesicles to MTs but had no significant effect on binding of kinesin. ADP, and to a lesser extent AMP, reduced binding of cytoplasmic dynein and ligand-containing vesicles to MTs. However, utilizing 32P nuclear magnetic resonance(35Jelicks L.A. Gupta R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H903-H909PubMed Google Scholar), we found that ADP was converted rapidly to ATP in the hepatic extract, probably by myokinase activity. AMP-PCP, adenosine, and vanadate had no effect on binding of ligand-containing vesicles or cytoplasmic dynein.Table II:The effects of nucleotides on binding to microtubules of cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and ligand- or receptor-containing endocytic vesicles and on the recovery of tubulin in the microtubule pellet Open table in a new tab When data for all nucleotides were considered, high correlation was found between MT binding of ligand-containing vesicles and cytoplasmic dynein (r = 0.77, n = 62, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5a). In contrast, MT binding of cytoplasmic dynein did not correlate with binding of receptor-containing vesicles (r = 0.06, n = 62, p > 0.6) (Fig. 5b). There was no correlation between MT binding of kinesin and that of endocytic vesicles containing either ligand (r = 0.25, n = 13, p > 0.4) or receptor (r = 0.15, n = 13, p > 0.6) (Fig. 5, c and d). To demonstrate directly that cytoplasmic dynein is bound to ligand-containing vesicles after RME, MTs were polymerized, and 10 mM ATP was added for 30 min as above. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibodies directed against the 74-kDa cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain coupled to anti-IgM-agarose beads. Controls utilized isotype-specific non-immune IgM. In additional studies, immunoprecipitation was performed utilizing a monoclonal antibody to the 130-kDa kinesin heavy chain. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for content of receptor and dynein by immunoblot. Ligand in the immunoprecipitate was quantified by radioautography. As seen in the toppanel of Fig. 6, cytoplasmic dynein, which is present in the initial ATP-containing supernatant, is not immunoprecipitated with non-immune IgM. However, dynein is quantitatively immunoprecipitated by the anti-dynein antibody. Both heavy chains and intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein have been identified in the immunoprecipitate. As anticipated, ligand-containing vesicles are also found in the supernatant. Immunoprecipitation with anti-dynein, but not control antibodies, precipitated approximately 15% of the total ligand from the supernatant. Immunoprecipitation of ligand-containing vesicles by kinesin antibodies was <1%. In confirmation of our results showing that receptor is not released from the MT pellet in the presence of ATP, there was no detectable receptor in the initial ATP-containing supernatant, nor was any seen in the dynein or kinesin immunoprecipitates. A number of investigators have described a requirement for MTs in receptor-mediated endocytosis(4Wolkoff A.W. Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 357-381Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Kolset S.O. Tolleshaug H. Berg T. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 122: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Oka J.A. Weigel P.H.

Blain P.L. Park J.H.Y. Tuma D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G129-G137PubMed Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for this requirement has been unclear. In an earlier study(11Goltz J.S. Wolkoff A.W. Novikoff P.M. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we presented evidence that ligand- and receptor-containing endocytic vesicles bind to stabilized endogenous MTs in vitro. In the presence of ATP, ligand-containing but not receptor-containing vesicles were released from MTs. We suggested that cytoplasmic dynein might functionally link the ligand-containing vesicles to the MTs so as to produce the firm attachment in the absence of ATP and release when ATP was added. Preliminary evidence was presented that ATP simultaneously released cytoplasmic dynein and ligand-containing vesicles from MTs. The present study quantitates and extends our previous findings and, further, presents direct evidence that cytoplasmic dynein binds to ligand-containing vesicles after RME. As previously suggested, this motor molecule could provide the force that is necessary for ligand-receptor segregation and/or for transport of ligand-containing vesicles to lysosomes. MTs are polarized with a plus (fast growing) end oriented toward the cell periphery and a minus (slow growing) end oriented toward a MT-organizing center or centrosome(36Euteneuer U. McIntosh J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Brinkley B.R. Annu. Rev.

Previous immunolocalization studies demonstrated association of endosomes and lysosomes with MTs (40Matteoni R. Kreis T.E. J.

Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 125-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have confirmed by electron and confocal microscopy that ligand-containing endocytic vesicles are associated with hepatocyte MTs. We now demonstrate by co-immunolocalization that in the absence of ATP, MTs in these hepatocytes become abundantly coated with cytoplasmic dynein. Some minor, nonspecific background fluorescence was present, but the procedure that we used for fixation and permeabilization of cells removed cytosolic proteins, including virtually all dynein not bound to MTs. The hepatocyte is known to have a high concentration of cytoplasmic dynein. The abundant distribution of cytoplasmic dynein along MTs in the absence of ATP before homogenization of the cells, the demonstration of its presence in the supernatant after homogenization and ATP addition, and the demonstration by immunoprecipitation that it is also bound to ligand-containing endocytic vesicles strongly support our hypothesis that cytoplasmic dynein is the ATP-sensitive link between ligand-containing endosomes and MTs that could function as the motor that moves endocytic vesicles toward lysosomes. Several different hypotheses of how sorting occurs have been proposed (11, 41-43). Maxfield and colleagues(41Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in studies of the transferrin receptor performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, described a sorting endosome with which early endosomes fuse and from which receptor is recycled. Eventually, this sorting endosome, enriched in ligand and depleted of receptors, “matures” and fuses with lysosomes. These findings are similar to those described in video microscopic studies of A431 cells following endocytosis of gold-labeled antibodies to the transferrin receptor(42Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Net centripetal movement of endosomes toward the juxtanuclear area was seen. From this area, small gold-containing vesicles were observed to pinch off and migrate toward the cell periphery. Disruption of MTs with nocodazole reduced both the juxtanuclear accumulation of endocytic vesicles and separation of recycling vesicles. Alternatively, Hopkins and colleagues (43Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Miller K. Nature. 1990; 346: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) have studied Hep-2 cells, where the sorting endosome forms an extensive array of tubular cisternae. In this case, receptor may remain tacked to microtubules, while multivesicular bodies containing dissociated ligand move along the cisterns in a polar manner. We have suggested that the early endosome itself may be a sorting compartment in cultured hepatocytes from which ligand-containing vesicles bud in succession, while receptor domains cap and are carried back to the cell surface (11). Although the morphological details and perhaps the timing of sorting vary with cell types, all of the models are consistent with our current observations that suggest that endosomal maturation is MT-based and that ligand movement toward lysosomes is driven by cytoplasmic dynein. The binding of dynein and ligand-containing endosomes to MTs is reduced in parallel in the presence of ATP and other nucleotides (). Consistent with these results are previous observations of Collins and Vallee(31Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), who compared the rates of hydrolysis of several different nucleotides by cytoplasmic dynein that had been prepared from rat liver and testis. CTP, TTP, and UTP were the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrates, followed by GTP, ITP, and ATP(31Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although the relative affinity of cytoplasmic dynein for CTP was much lower than that for ATP (31). Only ATP, however, supports force production(14Paschal B.M. Valle R.B. Nature. 1987; 330: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and only ATP would be expected to be present in cytosol in physiologically sufficient concentrations. The persistence of ATP in our incubation mixtures for up to 2 h is probably due to the presence of regenerating enzymes, perhaps myokinase, in the hepatic cytosolic extract. Although the ligand-containing vesicles that have been released from MTs by ATP can be immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using antibodies to cytoplasmic dynein, these vesicles were not precipitated in control studies using non-immune antibodies or antibodies against kinesin. As seen in Fig. 6, although most dynein is immunoprecipitated, only approximately 15% of ligand was recovered in the immunoprecipitate. This may be due to the low probability that cytoplasmic dynein attached to MTs is associated with a specific ligand-containing vesicle population, to dissociation of dynein upon release from vesicles to which it had been bound, or to the possibility that cytoplasmic dynein associates with ligand-containing vesicles only through part of the endocytic pathway. It would be interesting to know whether the percentage of dynein associated with ligand-containing vesicles changes with different assay times and conditions. We know little as yet regarding the mechanism of binding of cytoplasmic dynein to ligand-containing vesicles. The dynactin complex (44Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P.

Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) copurifies with liver cytoplasmic dynein and might serve as a “bridge” between vesicles and dynein. This possibility is being investigated. In our studies, only a relatively small proportion (less than 10%) of available kinesin bound to MTs. This binding was reduced significantly in the presence of ATP or GTP. However, binding was slightly increased in the presence of AMP-PNP, although both cytoplasmic dynein and ligand binding fell (). These results are consistent with previous reports that kinesin has both ATPase and GTPase activities, is released from MTs in the presence of ATP (47Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 317: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 48Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but remains bound to MTs strongly in the presence of AMP-PNP(49Lasek R.J. Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 316: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This suggests that the kinesin binds to MTs independently of ligand-containing vesicles, such that the vesicles do not attach to MTs by kinesin, a conclusion supported by our immunoprecipitation results. Although it has been hypothesized that kinesin may be involved in the recycling of receptor to the cell surface after segregation, we found no association of kinesin with receptor-containing endocytic vesicles. However, since the amount of available kinesin associated with stabilized endogenous MTs is so small, it may be that factors necessary for this binding (23Schroer T.A. Schnapp B.J. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) are lacking in the assay conditions used in our studies. Our current observations are consistent with two models, as diagrammed in Fig. 7. In these models, either before (a) or after (b) segregation of receptor-containing domains, the mature ligand-containing endosome is attached to and moves along a MT toward the centrosomally placed lysosomes via cytoplasmic dynein. Whether cytoplasmic dynein actually provides the force necessary for fission of the segregating endosomal vesicle is an important issue that is currently under investigation. Data, corresponding to Fig. 4, represent means ± S.E. (number of studies). Following 30 min of incubation at 37°C with 20 μM taxol to polymerize endogenous tubulin, 5 mM of each nucleotide or 50 μM vanadate was added. After an additional 30 min of incubation at 37°C, the incubation mixture was centrifuged to sediment microtubules. Content of ligand- or receptor-containing endocytic vesicles, cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and tubulin in the microtubule-pellet was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are expressed as a percent of results obtained in the absence of nucleotides.

M., Gaba, V., Mattoo, A. K. and Edelman, M. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 2865-2869). We have tested this hypothesis by constructing a deletion mutant (delta 226-233) of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in which residues 226-233 of the D1 polypeptide, containing the PEST-like sequence, have been removed. The resulting mutant, delta PEST, is able to grow photoautotrophically and give light-saturated rates of oxygen at wild type levels. However electron transfer on the acceptor side of the complex is perturbed. Analysis of cells by thermoluminescence and by monitoring the decay in quantum yield of variable fluorescence following saturating flash excitation indicates that Q-B, but not Q-A, is destabilized in this mutant. Electron transfer on the donor side of photosystem two remains largely unchanged in the mutant. Turnover of the D1 polypeptide as examined by pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine was enhanced in the delta PEST mutant compared to strain TC31 which is the wild type control. We conclude that the PEST sequence is not absolutely required for turnover of the D1 polypeptide in vivo although deletion of residues 226-233 does have an effect on the redox equilibrium between QA and QB."
https://openalex.org/W2072958806,"The formation of oxysterols in cultured human fibroblasts and their physiological roles as intracellular regulators of cholesterol production have been investigated. In the presence of low density lipoproteins (LDL) normal fibroblasts converted LDL cholesterol to the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol in quantities apparently sufficient to down-regulate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The production of 27-hydroxycholesterol started 3-8 h after the addition of LDL to the incubation medium, and during this time the activity of HMG-CoA reductase decreased by 73%. Formation of other biologically active oxysterols such as 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol was not observed. When 27-hydroxylation of LDL cholesterol in mitochondria was selectively prevented by treating normal fibroblasts with cyclosporin A or by using fibroblasts genetically lacking sterol 27-hydroxylase, the suppressive effect of LDL on HMG-CoA reductase was reduced by a factor of about 10. In the absence of LDL or when the fibroblasts lacked LDL-receptors, the cells did not produce detectable amounts of 27-hydroxycholesterol, and HMG-CoA reductase was up-regulated. The results provide strong evidence that 27-hydroxycholesterol is an important intracellular mediator between LDL and the suppression of HMG-CoA reductase in human fibroblasts. The mitochondrial uptake/metabolism of LDL cholesterol seems to be a biologically important extension of the LDL pathway in human cells, since the mitochondrial products of LDL cholesterol may regulate cholesterol homeostasis or be precursors of steroid hormones or bile acids. This pathway, which has now been demonstrated in fibroblasts, may link together the two 22-year-old observations that LDL as well as oxysterols can down-regulate HMG-CoA reductase in cells."

Using pure CTP synthetase as a substrate, protein kinase C activity was dose- and time-dependent and required calcium, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine for full activation. Protein kinase C activity was also dependent on the concentration of CTP synthetase. Protein kinase C phosphorylated CTP synthetase on serine and threonine residues <i>in vitro</i> whereas the enzyme was primarily phosphorylated on serine residues <i>in vivo</i>. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis of CTP synthetase phosphorylated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> indicated that the enzyme was phosphorylated on more than one site. Most of the phosphopeptides derived from CTP synthetase phosphorylated <i>in vivo</i> were the same as those derived from CTP synthetase phosphorylated by protein kinase C <i>in vitro</i>. The stoichiometry of the phosphorylation of native CTP synthetase was 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme whereas the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation of alkaline phosphatase-treated CTP synthetase was 2.2 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme. This indicated that CTP synthetase was purified in a phosphorylated state. Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase resulted in a 3-fold activation in enzyme activity whereas alkaline phosphatase treatment of CTP synthetase resulted in a 5-fold decrease in enzyme activity.

STAT3-containing complexes were identified by “supershift” assay using 1 μg of rabbit antibodies against STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To determine G-CSFR-gp130 protein expression, 20 μl of whole cell lysate from 5 ´ 105 transfected cells was mixed with 25 μl of SDS buffer and electrophoresed in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore), incubated with sheep anti-human G-CSFR (provided by Dr. D. J. Tweardy), and processed for chemiluminescent reaction according to the supplier (DuPont NEN). The chimeric G-CSFR-gp130 receptor form was used to define the signaling reactions initiated by the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 independently of the resident receptor subunits for IL-6-type cytokines(13Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Baumann H. Gearing D. Ziegler S.F. J.

Transfection of G-CSFR-gp130 with full-length or progressively truncated cytoplasmic domains into H-35 cells allowed the mapping of the regions required for gene activation via two characteristic elements, IL-6RE and HRRE (Fig. 1). G-CSFR-gp130(133) was the minimal construct generating a significant transcriptional response via IL-6RE. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal box 3 repeated motifs b, c, and d (Fig. 1) diminished the magnitude of regulation 2-fold. Removal of residues 133-109, containing the box 3a sequence, eliminated all detectable IL-6RE response. However, regulation via HRRE by the same receptors was maintained. The HRRE response decreased to 5-10% only after removal of box 2 and was lost with deletion of box 1. To identify whether gene regulation by the G-CSFR-gp130 is correlated with the ability to activate STAT proteins, the receptors were transfected into L-cells. This cell type has a higher transfection efficiency than H-35 cells, thus yielding a receptor protein expression detectable by Western blotting activation of endogenous STAT proteins(19Morella K.K. Lai C.-F. Kumaki S. Kumaki N. Wang Y. Bluman E.M. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Giri J. Gearing D.P. Cosman D. Ziegler S.F. Tweardy D.J. Campos S.P. Baumann H. J. Biol.

Wild-type G-CSFR-gp130(277) mediated a G-CSF-specific activation of STAT proteins producing a SIF complex that comigrated on EMSA with SIF-A induced by the endogenous IL-6R (Fig. 2A). STAT3 contributed essentially to all DNA-binding activity detected by EMSA as shown by an antibody-mediated supershift assay (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Correlation of STAT protein activation and transcriptional regulation through the IL-6RE. A, activation of STAT protein in L-cells. The G-CSFR-gp130 receptor forms indicated at the top (3 μg/ml) were transfected into L-cells. Subcultures were treated for 15 min with or without G-CSF, extracted, and analyzed by EMSA.

The extract from G-CSFR-gp130(133wt)-transfected and G-CSF-treated culture from A was analyzed by EMSA with or without inclusion of anti-STAT3 antibodies in the binding reaction.

The patterns show the characteristic two forms of the mature chimeric G-CSFR proteins. D, gene regulating activities of the G-CSFR-gp130 receptor forms. The receptors indicated at the top were cotransfected into H-35 cells together with either Hp(IL-6RE)-CAT or HRRE-CAT. Subcultures were treated with G-CSF, and the effects on the CAT activities relative to control cells were determined. The relative changes are given above the autoradiograms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) G-CSFR-gp130(133) was 3 times less active than the full-length form (Fig. 2A). Deletion to residue 109 abrogated detectable STAT protein activation. The functionally relevant sequence within the 133-residue form was determined by mutation. The Y125A mutant box 3 (M3) abolished STAT activation (Fig. 2A) but did not affect receptor protein expression as demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). By contrast, the M3 mutation in full-length gp130(277) did not influence STAT activation (Fig. 2A). Thus, the repeated box 3 motifs (b, c, and d) were functionally redundant(14Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Gene-regulatory function of the receptor mutants was tested in H-35 cells (Fig. 2D). The M3 mutation in gp130(133) inactivated the regulation of the IL-6RE-CAT gene but not of the HRRE-CAT gene. The P14/16A mutant box 1 (M1) abolished all signaling function of gp130(133), i.e. activation of STAT proteins in L-cells and transcriptional regulation of IL-6RE- and HRRE-CAT genes in H-35 cells, even though the M1 protein was abundantly expressed in transfected L-cells (data not shown; see also Fig. 4C below). If active STAT proteins cause transcriptional regulation, a change in their cellular concentration should entail a corresponding change in the transcriptional activity of IL-6RE-containing genes. To assess whether G-CSFR-gp130 could activate excess amounts of ectopically expressed STAT proteins and thus prominently alter the intracellular concentrations of active STAT proteins, expression vectors for G-CSFR-gp130s forms and for rat STAT1 and STAT3 were cotransfected into COS-1 cells (Fig. 3A). COS-1 cells were used because of high expression of transfected vectors and the low level contribution of endogenous STATs, hence permitting clear demonstration of the specificity of STAT protein activation. Transfected G-CSFR-gp130 alone produced a minor increase of the endogenous SIF-C protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3A). Transfected rat STAT1 and 3 were strongly activated, producing rat SIF-C and SIF-A complexes, respectively, which showed different mobilities from the corresponding endogenous SIF complexes (Fig. 3A). Inclusion of JAK2 caused two notable effects: an increase in basal level of activated STAT3 (Fig. 3A) or STAT1 (not shown), and a further induction following G-CSF treatment. Excess levels of JAK2 were capable of increasing basal levels of activated STATs even in the absence of ligand-receptor interaction. This JAK2-mediated, receptor-dependent activation of STAT3 did not require box 3. In fact, box 1 was sufficient, as demonstrated by the data obtained with G-CSFR-gp130(40) (Fig. 3A). The resulting intensities of SIF complexes exceeded by a factor of 1,000-10,000 those achieved in COS cells not supplemented with STAT proteins. TYK2 has been noted to interact with gp130(8Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellagrini A. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether TYK2 was also effective in activating STAT proteins (Fig. 3B). In the absence of any transfected kinase, the box 3-specific activation of coexpressed rat STAT3 by G-CSFR-gp130(133) was detectable, probably mediated by the resident COS cell kinases. Overexpressed TYK2, like JAK2, promoted a several hundred-fold increase of STAT3 activation independently of agonist treatment and presence of box 3. Neither TYK2 nor JAK2 was effective with transfected G-CSFR-gp130(133M1), suggesting that the kinase action was linked to box 1 element in agreement with the published observations for other hematopoietin receptors(4Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 5Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

Longmore G.D. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6523-6530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The prominent activation of ectopically expressed STAT proteins provided the experimental condition to assess the link between activation of STAT proteins and transcriptional induction of genes. G-CSFR-gp130(133) and STAT proteins were introduced into L- and H-35 cells and their effects on cotransfected IL-6RE-CAT gene determined (Fig. 4, A and B). Although a prominent STAT1 and −3 activation was achieved in L-cells (Fig. 4A), the IL-6RE response after 24 h G-CSF treatment was not appreciably elevated above the control culture. JAK2 alone raised basal activity 2-fold and enhanced the G-CSF effect severalfold. Surprisingly, the combination of JAK2 and the STATs did not increase transcription proportionally to the STAT protein activity. Similar signal reconstitution in H-35 cells (Fig. 4B) confirmed the findings made with L-cells and revealed additional important features. 1) Transfected STATs and/or JAKs had no significant effect on action of the endogenous IL-6R or transfected G-CSFR-gp130(133wt); 2) G-CSFR-gp130(133M1) was inactive under all conditions; 3) G-CSFR-gp130(133M3) produced a 2-5-fold transcriptional stimulation through IL-6RE in the presence of overexpressed STAT3, JAK2, or TYK2. However, even under optimal reconstitution conditions, the box 3-deficient G-CSFR-gp130 yielded a maximal IL-6RE response that was only a fraction of that obtained with the wild-type G-CSFR-gp130(133). The data from Fig. 4(A and B) indicate that transcriptional regulation through IL-6RE by gp130 was not strictly correlated with relative amounts of activated STATs. We hypothesize that an additional regulatory factor (or factors) is activated by gp130(133), probably by the action of receptor-associated kinase(s). This factor could not be experimentally identified by binding to SIE or IL-6RE (Fig. 2A; data not shown) and thus was termed “SIF-independent gene regulator” or “SIG.” Evidence for a functional entity such as SIG in hepatoma cells was provided by the box 3- and STAT3-independent transcriptional regulation through HRRE (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, A and D). The HRRE signal was, however, dependent on box 1, suggesting that box 1-interacting JAKs may act as potential mediators of that hypothetical signal pathway. The relatively low HRRE regulating activity of G-CSFR-gp130(40) conceivably was due to reduced association with and/or activation of JAKs. Overexpression of JAK2 (Fig. 3, A and B) or TYK2 (data not shown) clearly rectified this inefficient kinase action. Furthermore, cotransfection of the G-CSFR-gp130(40) with JAK2 yielded a 20-fold increase in transcription through HRRE that was independent of cotransfected STAT3 (Fig. 4C). This study illustrates that gp130, like other hematopoietin receptors (4, 5, 12), can activate various STAT proteins. The prominence of this response and the specificity of STAT-3 for DNA sequences related regulation of genes by IL-6 have led to a model proposing STAT-3 to function as both signal transducers and activators of transcription(4Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 5Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). However, the data of this study indicate that STAT3 does not act as sole activator of transcription and that other activities controlled by gp130, such as the hypothetical SIG, are likely involved. Contributing activities may include the action of serine kinase noted to enhance DNA binding of STAT proteins(23Matsuda T. Hirano T. Blood. 1994; 83: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lütticken C. Coffer P. Yuan J. Schwartz C. Caldenhoven E. Schindler C. Kruijer W. Heinrich P.C. Horn F.

Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Moreover, the current model of the JAK-STAT pathway from receptor to the regulated gene will need modifications based on the two observations that 1) STAT activation does not strictly depend on phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor molecule(26Wang Y.-D. Wong K. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7021-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and 2) regulation of the prototypical IL-6-responsive α-fibrinogen gene does not appear to involve STAT3(27Liu Z.

For this purpose, the activation intermediate factors IXα and IXaα were purified after cleavage of the Arg145-Ala146 and Arg180-Val181 bonds, respectively. These intermediates were compared for a number of functional properties with factor IXaβ, which is cleaved at both positions. Factor IXaα was equal to factor IXaβ in hydrolyzing the synthetic substrate CH3SO2-Leu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (kcat/Km≈ 120 s-1M-1) but was less efficient in factor X activation. Factor IXα was incapable of generating factor Xa but displayed reactivity toward p-nitrophenol p-guanidinobenzoate and the peptide substrate. The catalytic efficiency, however, was 4-fold lower compared with factor IXaα and factor IXaβ. Factor IXα and factor IXaβ had similar affinity for the inhibitor benzamidine (Ki≈ 2.5 mM), and amidolytic activity of both species was inhibited by Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone and antithrombin III. Unlike factor IXaβ, factor IXα was unable to form SDS stable complexes with antithrombin III. Moreover, inhibition of factor IXaβ and factor IXα by Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone followed distinct pathways, because factor IXα was inhibited in a nonirreversible manner and displayed only minor incorporation of the dansylated inhibitor into its catalytic site. These data demonstrate that the catalytic site of factor IXα differs from that of the fully activated factor IXaβ. Factor IX and its derivatives were also compared with regard to complex assembly with factor VIII in direct binding studies employing the immobilized factor VIII light chain. Factor IXα and factor IXaβ displayed a 30-fold higher affinity for the factor VIII light chain (Kd≈ 12 nM) than the factor IX zymogen. Factor IXaα showed lower affinity (Kd≈ 50 nM) than factor IXα and factor IXaβ, which may explain the lower efficiency of factor X activation by factor IXaα. Collectively, our data indicate that cleavage of the Arg180-Val181 bond develops full amidolytic activity but results in suboptimal binding to the factor VIII light chain. With regard to cleavage of the Arg145-Ala146 bond, we have demonstrated that this results in the transition of the factor IX zymogen into an enzyme that lacks proteolytic activity. Moreover, the same cleavage fully exposes the binding site for the factor VIII light chain, suggesting that cleavage of the Arg145-Ala146 bond serves a previously unrecognized role in the assembly of the factor IX-factor VIII complex.

This domain contains several glutamic acid residues that have been carboxylated to yield Gla(4DiScipio R.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The presence of Gla residues allows this region to bind metal ions (5Sperling R. Furie B.C. Blumenstein M. Keyt B. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3898-3906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for surface binding at platelets and endothelial cells(6Cheung W.-F. Hamaguchi N. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20529-20531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rawala-Sheikh R. Ahmad S.S. Monroe D.M. Roberts H.R. Walsh P.N. Blood. 1992; 79: 398-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adjacent to the Gla domain a region is located that shares homology with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (8). This region consists of two distinct EGF-like domains, which are important for FIX function. The first EGF-like domain contains a single calcium binding site(8Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second EGF-like domain is connected to the activation peptide, a segment that is liberated during zymogen activation(9DiScipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Finally, the carboxyl-terminal portion comprises the trypsin-like serine protease domain, which contains a single metal ion binding site (10Bajaj S.P. Sabharwal A.K. Gorka J. Birktoft J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the catalytic centre of FIX(11Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to most serine proteases, FIX requires two cleavages to yield full enzymatic activity(2DiScipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 12Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol.

Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4508-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Dependent on the sequence of cleavage, FIX activation can follow two distinct pathways. Physiological activators first cleave the Arg145-Ala146 bond, resulting in the transient activation intermediate FIXα. So far, FIXα has been characterized as being enzymatically inactive(16Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11317-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is underscored by the notion that FIXα lacks clotting activity(12Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4508-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage at the amino terminus of the protease domain (i.e. position Arg180) then results in the active enzyme FIXaβ. The nonphysiological activator isolated from Russell's viper venom first cleaves at position Arg180(12Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting intermediate FIXaα displays proteolytic activity, although its clotting activity is just 20-50% of that of the enzyme FIXaβ(12Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Griffith M.J. Breitkreutz L. Trapp H. Brit E. Noyes C.M. Lundblad R.L. Roberts H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage of the Arg145-Ala146 bond then converts FIXaα into the fully active FIXaβ. Within the blood coagulation cascade, FIXaβ activates the zymogen factor X (FX) in a process that requires the presence of phospholipids, calcium ions, and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa)(18van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). During FX activation, FIXaβ is in complex with its protein cofactor FVIIIa(20Lamphear B. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction involves the FVIII light chain, which contains a high affinity binding site for FIXaβ(22Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complex formation with FVIIIa results in structural changes within the active site of FIXaβ(20Lamphear B. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal response requires the presence of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the FVIII heavy chain(20Lamphear B. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the FVIII heavy chain is involved in complex formation with FIXaβ as well. Optimal FX activation requires the two-step cleavage of FIX into FIXaβ, because point mutations at Arg145 or Arg180 are both associated with the bleeding disorder hemophilia B(23Roberts H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whereas cleavage of the Arg180-Val181 bond corresponds with the zymogen-activating site that FIX is sharing with many other serine protease precursors(24Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), cleavage of the Arg150-Ala146 bond is unique for FIX. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of cleavage of the Arg145-Ala153 bond in the activation of the FIX zymogen. For this purpose FIXα was compared with other FIX activation products with regard to a number of parameters that are associated with FIXa enzyme function. These included reactivity toward synthetic and natural substrates and inhibitors and interaction with the cofactor FVIII. This approach allowed us to establish that cleavage at Arg145 plays a major role in the assembly of the FIX-FVIII complex. Protein A-Sepharose CL4B and CNBr-Sepharose CL4B were from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Microtiter plates (Immulon) were from Dynatech (Plockingen, Germany) unless stated otherwise. Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (EGR-CK) and dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-CK) were from Calbiochem. CH3SO2-D-Leu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (CH3SO2-LGR-pNA), product name CBS 31.39, was from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France). Heparin (grade 1-A) was obtained from Sigma. p-Nitrophenol p-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) was from BDH Chemicals Ltd. (Poole, United Kingdom). The anti-FVIII antibodies CLB-CAg 12 and CLB-CAg 69 have been described previously(25Stel, H. V., 1984, Monoclonal Antibodies against Factor VIII-von Willebrand Factor. Ph.D. thesis, pp. 51-72, University of Amsterdam.Google Scholar, 26Leyte A. Mertens K. Distel B. Evers R.F. de Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Groenen-van Dooren M.M.C.L. de Bruin J. Pannekoek H. van Mourik J.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The murine anti-FIX antibodies CLB-FIX 10 and CLB-FIX 11 were obtained as outlined previously(22Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), employing a screening strategy based on binding to immobilized FIX in the presence or absence of calcium ions. Binding of CLB-FIX 10 to FIX was calcium-independent, whereas binding of CLB-FIX 11 was markedly enhanced in the presence of calcium ions. Both antibodies CLB-FIX 10 and CLB-FIX 11 strongly inhibit FIX activity (results not shown). The murine anti-FIX antibody CLB-FIX D4 has been described elsewhere(27Mertens, K., van Mourik, J. A., (March 17, 1994) International Patent Application, Patent Cooperation Treaty, Publication WO 94/05692.Google Scholar). This antibody is directed against the FIX sequence Asn136-Asp154, which comprises the Arg145-Ala146 activation site. By virtue of the location of its epitope, antibody CLB-FIX D4 distinguishes between intact FIX and cleaved FIX (i.e. FIXα and FIXaβ)(27Mertens, K., van Mourik, J. A., (March 17, 1994) International Patent Application, Patent Cooperation Treaty, Publication WO 94/05692.Google Scholar). All FIX antibodies used were from the IgG1k isotype. Monoclonal antibodies were purified from culture medium employing protein A-Sepharose as recommended by the manufacturer. Polyclonal antibodies against human FIX were obtained as described previously (22). Antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as described(28Nakane P.K. Kawaoi A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). The human FVIII light chain was purified as described(22Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FX was prepared as described(29Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The factor X-activating protein from Russell's viper venom was purified as described (30Kisiel W. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (2 mg/ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified factor XIa (FXIa) was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Purified Antithrombin III (ATIII), C1-inhibitor, and human serum albumin (HSA) were obtained from the Division of Products of our institute. Bovine serum albumin was from Miles Inc. Purified α1-antitrypsin and α2-antiplasmin were gifts from Dr. W. Wuillemin, Department of Autoimmune Diseases of our institute. All proteins used, including FIX and its activation products (see below) were homogeneous as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (see Figs. 3 and 5). Human FIX was purified from a concentrate of prothrombin, FIX, and FX (31Mertens K. Brit E. Giles A.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) obtained from the Division of Products of our institute. NaCl, benzamidine, and sodium citrate (pH 7.4) were added to the concentrate to final concentrations of 0.15 M, 0.01 M, and 0.02 M, respectively, and the mixture was subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography employing the anti-FIX antibody CLB-FIX D4 (5 mg/ml CNBr-Sepharose). After extensive washing with 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M benzamidine, 0.02 M sodium citrate (pH 7.4), FIX was eluted in a linear gradient (0-2 M KSCN). FIX-containing fractions were pooled and stored at −20°C in 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.4). The specific activity of the FIX preparations ranged between 300 and 350 units/mg. FIXaβ was prepared by incubating purified FIX (4 μM) with human FXIa (0.23 μM) for 2 h at 37°C in 0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.4). After the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (0.01 M final concentration), residual FIX and FIXα were removed from the incubation mixture by rechromatography on the CLB-FIX D4 affinity column. In this immunoaffinity step, FIXaβ and FXIa did not bind to the column, whereas FIX and FIXα remained bound (27). Finally, FIXaβ and FXIa were separated employing anion exchange chromatography as described previously(32Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1982; 47: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). FIXaβ was stored at −20°C in 50% glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.4). The FIXaβ preparations were more than 90% active as determined by active site titrations employing NPGB(33Byrne R. Link R.P. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5336-5341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FIXα was prepared by incubating purified FIX (4 μM) with human FXIa (16 nM) in the presence of 6.8 mM MnCl2 in 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.4). After incubation for 2 h at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and benzamidine (0.01 M final concentrations). Under these conditions, approximately 90% of FIX was converted into FIXα as judged by SDS-PAGE. FIXα was then separated from FIX and FXIa employing CLB-FIX D4 affinity chromatography. In this step FXIa and possible traces of FIXaβ passed through the column, while FIXα and residual FIX were bound. After extensive washing, FIX and FIXα were eluted separately in a linear gradient (0-3 M KSCN)(27Mertens, K., van Mourik, J. A., (March 17, 1994) International Patent Application, Patent Cooperation Treaty, Publication WO 94/05692.Google Scholar). The FIXα-containing fractions were pooled and stored at −20°C in 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.4). The position of cleavage in FIXα was assessed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis employing automated equipment (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK; Eurosequence, Groningen, the Netherlands). The resulting sequence, Ala-Glu-Thr-Val-Phe, corresponds with the five NH2-terminal amino acids of the FIXα activation peptide region, demonstrating that indeed cleavage had occurred at Arg145-Ala146 (11). The FIXα preparations were more than 95% active as determined by NPGB titration(33Byrne R. Link R.P. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5336-5341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FIXaα was prepared from purified FIX essentially as described (17Griffith M.J. Breitkreutz L. Trapp H. Brit E. Noyes C.M. Lundblad R.L. Roberts H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but modified in that the purified FX-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom instead of the crude snake venom was immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford using HSA as a standard(34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215990) Google Scholar). FIX activity was measured employing a commercially available chromogenic method (Baxter-DADE, Düdingen, Switzerland). Antigen concentrations of FIX or its derivatives were quantified by an immunological assay as described previously (22Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but modified in that immunopurified polyclonal anti-FIX antibodies were immobilized (0.2 μg/well) instead of monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 2. Dose-response curves were transformed by plotting logit absorbance versus log concentration and were linear between 0.07 and 7 nM. Within this range the coefficient of variation was approximately 5%. Antigen values were converted into molar concentrations using the purified FIX derivatives as standards. Molar concentrations were calculated from protein concentrations employing Mr = 57,000 for FIX, FIXα, and FIXaα and Mr = 45,000 for FIXaβ (2). In experiments in which FIXaβ or FIX was used as competitor for the binding of FIXα to the FVIII light chain, nonbound FIXα was assayed by a FIXα-specific assay employing the antibody CLB-FIX D4. Samples containing FIXα and FIX or FIXaβ were incubated with the immobilized antibody (0.5 μg/well) in 3 M NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 1% (w/v) HSA, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.2). After washing with 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.2), bound FIXα was detected employing peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-FIX IgG in the washing buffer. Under these conditions FIXα but not FIX or FIXaβ binds to the immobilized antibody CLB-FIX D4. Dose-response curves were transformed by plotting logit absorbance versus log concentration and were linear between 0.1 and 10 nM. The ability of FIX or its cleaved derivatives to activate FX was assayed essentially as described previously (35Donath M.J.S.H. Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) employing acetylated FX to prevent cleavage of the Arg145-Ala146 bond by the product FXa(16Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11317-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FX was acetylated according to Neuenschwander and Jesty(36Neuenschwander P. Jesty J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The modified FX zymogen had lost more than 95% of its biological activity, whereas amidolytic activity was fully maintained. Cleavage of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA by FIX or its derivatives was assayed in 0.2% (w/v) HSA, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.05 M Tris (pH 8.4). Substrate hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of a 2.5 mM solution of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA to a 50-μl sample in a microtiter plate (Costar, type flat bottom). Initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were measured at 37°C by monitoring absorbance at 405 nm in time. Kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis by FIX cleavage products were determined employing substrate concentrations between 0 and 15 mM at two different enzyme concentrations. Absorbance values were converted into molar concentrations using a molar extinction coefficient of 9.65 ´ 103M-1 cm-1 for p-nitroanilide and a pathlength of 0.35 cm for a 100-μl volume. The experimental data were fitted in the Michaelis-Menten equation using EnzFitter software (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) to obtain Km and kcat values. The binding of FIX or its cleaved derivatives to the immobilized FVIII light chain and calculation of binding parameters were performed as described(22Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the individual cleavages at Arg145 and Arg180 in human FIX was investigated with respect to the development of enzymatic activity. FIX and its cleaved derivatives were compared for their ability to activate FX in the presence of calcium ions, phospholipids, and FVIIIa. As expected, the enzyme FIXaβ efficiently activated FX under these conditions (Fig. 1A). FXa was also generated by the intermediate FIXaα, although at a lower rate than by FIXaβ. In contrast, both the intermediate FIXα and the FIX zymogen were incapable of activating FX. These data demonstrate that cleavage at Arg180 converts FIX into an active protease but that the additional cleavage at Arg145 develops full proteolytic activity. To investigate whether limited proteolysis of FIX had a similar effect on amidolytic activity, the reactivity of the zymogen FIX and its cleaved derivatives toward the synthetic substrate CH3SO2-LGR-pNA was tested. No substrate cleavage occurred in the presence of the FIX zymogen (Fig. 1B). In contrast, all cleaved forms of FIX, including the intermediate FIXα, were capable of hydrolyzing this synthetic substrate. The kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA by FIXaβ, FIXaα, and FIXα were determined. As listed in Table I, FIXaβ and FIXaα display similar catalytic efficiency. The catalytic efficiency of FIXα, however, appears to be 4-fold lower, which is mainly due to a decreased kcat. The possibility was considered that the lower catalytic efficiency could be due to FIXα being only partially active. However, active site titrations employing the active site titrant NPGB indicated that the extent of the p-nitrophenol burst corresponded to 90-95% of the protein concentrations of both the FIXα and FIXaβ preparations employed (see “Experimental Procedures”). It was noted that titration of FIXaβ requires about 4 min to reach completion(33Byrne R. Link R.P. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5336-5341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the p-nitrophenol burst lasts 7-8 min for FIXα (results not shown). This slight difference in reactivity toward NPGB was not further elaborated. Collectively, these results confirm that the zymogen FIX is an inactive species, whereas the enzyme FIXaβ displays activity toward FX, CH3SO2-LGR-pNA, and NPGB. With regard to the activation intermediates, FIXaα equals the enzyme FIXaβ in synthetic substrate hydrolysis but is less efficient in FX activation. FIXα, however, is extremely inefficient in generating FXa but at the same time hydrolyzes CH3SO2-LGR-pNA and reacts with the active site titrant NPGB. This demonstrates that cleavage at Arg145 converts the FIX zymogen into an enzymatic form that lacks proteolytic activity.Table I:Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA by FIXα, FIXaα, or FIXaβ Open table in a new tab Although the concentration of active sites was in good agreement with the protein concentrations of purified FIXaβ and FIXα, these experiments do not fully exclude the possibility that traces of other serine proteases could contribute to the observed CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis by FIXα or FIXaβ. Therefore, the effect of a number of serine protease inhibitors was tested. Amidolytic activity of FIXα or FIXaβ appeared to be unaffected by the presence of serine protease inhibitors including hirudin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin, α2-antiplasmin, and C1-inhibitor (data not shown). This demonstrates that the amidolytic activity is not likely to be associated with the presence of a variety of potential contaminants. In contrast, CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis was effectively inhibited in the presence of the monoclonal anti-FIX antibody CLB-FIX 10 (see Fig. 5). Control experiments demonstrated that this antibody does not inhibit CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis by thrombin, FXa, or FXIa. This strongly suggests that the observed CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis originates from the enzyme FIXaβ or the activation intermediate FIXα. Additional experiments were performed to determine the affinity of FIXα and FIXaβ for the inhibitor benzamidine. This reversible inhibitor is known to inhibit the various coagulation enzymes with Ki values ranging from 0.04 to 11 mM(37Pedersen A.H. Lund-Hansen T. Bisgaard-Frantzen H. Olsen F. Petersen L.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Geratz J.D. Stevens F.M. Polakoski K.L. Parrish R.F. Tidwell R.R. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1987; 164: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and as such could contribute to the identification of the active species in FIXα. Under the same experimental conditions as in Fig. 1B, FIXα inhibition proved to be similar to that of FIXaβ, with Ki values of 2.9 ± 0.3 and 2.0 ± 0.2 mM, respectively. These data demonstrate that FIXα and FIXaβ share similar inhibition characteristics by benzamidine. The enzymatic properties of FIXaβ and FIXα were examined in more detail using the synthetic serine protease inhibitor EGR-CK. Binding of EGR-CK to FIXα or FIXaβ was determined by continuously monitoring CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis by FIXα or FIXaβ in the presence of various concentrations of EGR-CK. As expected, substrate hydrolysis by FIXaβ displayed progress curves that are"

Angiotensin II markedly reduced the activity of these channels by shifting their activation curve toward positive voltage values. This inhibition of the channels resulted in a marked decrease of the cytosolic free calcium concentration maintained by potassium. This effect was abolished by losartan, a specific antagonist of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor. Hormone action on T-type channels appeared to be mediated by protein kinase C because 1) it was mimicked by phorbol ester and diacylglycerol, and 2) it was significantly reduced by decreasing protein kinase C activity with specific inhibitors such as chelerythrine chloride or a pseudosubstrate of the enzyme, as well as by protein kinase C down-regulation. Similarly, protein kinase C activation reduced the cytosolic calcium response to potassium and the steroidogenic action of this agonist.

https://openalex.org/W1995569625,"Abstract We studied the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC), the endogenous phosphorylation and presence in the membrane fraction of p47phox (the 47-kDa cytosolic component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase), and the O production in human adherent monocytes (HAMs). This was performed under phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or diacylglycerol stimulation after cell preincubation in the presence of either 13-methyltetradecanoate or arachidonate. At 3 nM and 30 μM, both fatty acids had enhancing and depressing effects, respectively, on PKC translocation and O production strictly depending on the PMA- or diacylglycerol-stimulated state of the cell. Endogenous phosphorylation and membrane presence of p47phox were markedly reinforced in PMA-stimulated HAMs in the presence as compared to the absence of 13-methyltetradecanoate. These results emphasize the fact that in intact cells the capacity of both FAs to potentiate or depress the HAM O production is mediated by a direct action on the PKC membrane translocation leading to a simultaneous endogenous phosphorylation and membrane translocation of p47phox. They confirm the recent findings (Kadri-Hassani, N., Leger, C. L., and Descomps, B.(1995) J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 11, 159-173) on the PKC-mediated, adherent monocyte-specific capacity of these fatty acids and others (with the exception of linear saturated fatty acids) to enhance the PMA-stimulated O production at nanomolar concentrations and to depress it at micromolar concentrations."

In mammalian cells, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)1( 1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme ATSHthyroid-stimulating hormone, thyrotropinCREcAMP-responsive elementCREBCRE binding proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyl transferasePKAprotein kinase AATFactivating transcription factorbpbase pair(s)MHCmajor histocompatibility complex.) reductase (mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase CoA-acylating, EC 1.1.1.34) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of mevalonic acid, the precursor common to many isoprenoids, including cholesterol (1). Because of its involvement in cholesterol biosynthesis, HMG-CoA reductase has become the target of many drugs aimed at lowering threatening levels of serum cholesterol(2Alberts A.W. Am. J. Cardiol. 1988; 62: 10J-15JAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). An additional interest in this enzyme has mounted in recent years, since mevalonate is also the precursor of the donor isoprenoids, farnesyl and geranyl-geranyl diphosphate, for a growing class of biologically relevant proteins, which include monomeric G proteins, most notably the product of the ras gene, p21, a key transducer of mitogenic signals(3Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar). As the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of mevalonate, the precursor of isoprenes, HMG-CoA reductase is, therefore, a critical regulator of cell proliferation in normal as well as in tumor cells(3Barbacid M.

However, we have reported that in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, HMG-CoA reductase is transcriptionally induced by thyrotropin (TSH), via cAMP(4Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TSH is the physiologic mitogen in FRTL-5 cells(13Ambesi-Impiombato, F. S., (August 26, 1986) U. S.

When starved of TSH, these cells become quiescent and develop a greater than 2-fold increase in total cholesterol, caused by the doubling of available low density lipoprotein receptors(15Bifulco M. Santillo M. Tedesco I. Zarrilli R. Laezza C. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19336-19342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TSH challenge increases HMG-CoA reductase gene expression, reduces low density lipoprotein receptor activity, decreases total cholesterol, and increases cholesterol biosynthesis(4Grieco D. Beg Z.H.

The TSH-induced increase in HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol biosynthesis precedes the TSH-induced increase in thymidine incorporation into DNA and cell doubling(4Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A.

The apparent paradox of a lower cholesterol content in an actively dividing cell population has been explained as follows. In order for FRTL-5 cells to proceed through the cell cycle, active isoprenoid synthesis is a mandatory requirement; the TSH-induced reduction in cholesterol content would maintain a high rate of HMG-CoA reductase synthesis(4Grieco D.

We have cloned and sequenced the promoter region of the rat gene in an effort to elucidate the mechanism by which TSH/cAMP act. Analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the HMG-CoA reductase gene revealed the octamer, 5′-TGACGTAG-3′, which is closely homologous to a consensus cAMP-responsive element (CRE)(16Montminy M.R.

In this study, we investigate the role of this CRE-like sequence and show that it is involved in both basal and TSH-induced HMG-CoA reductase gene expression in thyroid cells. We also show that the CRE-binding protein, CREB(17Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), modulates the reductase CRE. The data presented strongly support a direct cAMP regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription in thyroid cells, involving cis-acting CRE.

They were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere composed of 95% air and 5% CO2, in Coon's modified F-12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and a six-hormone mixture of TSH, insulin, hydrocortisone, transferrin, somatostatin, and glycil-L-histidyl-L-lysine acetate. The medium containing the complete mixture will be referred to as 6H. Depending on experimental needs, a similar mixture, but lacking TSH (referred to as 5H), was used. Unless otherwise stated, cells were provided fresh medium every 3 days. A FRTL-5 genomic library was screened with the XhoI-XbaI fragment (referred to as probe 5′) and the BstEII-XbaI fragment (referred to as probe 3′) of plasmid pRED-227 containing the full-length hamster HMG-CoA reductase cDNA(20Chin D.J.

The screening was accomplished using in situ plaque hybridization according to Maniatis(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For labeling of cDNA probes, random primed DNA labeling kits were used. The clone that hybridized only with probe 5′ was further characterized. Digestion of this clone with BamHI-EcoRI gave rise to three fragments that were transferred to nylon filters. The fragment that still hybridized with probe 5′, approximately 4.5 kilobase pairs, was further analyzed by restriction enzymes. This analysis revealed the presence of five PstI sites. The one positive PstI fragment was subcloned into M13-mp18 bacteriophage or pCAT plasmid for sequencing. Digestions of DNA with restriction endonucleases, electrophoresis on agarose gels, transfer of DNA fragments from gels to nylon filters, and hybridizations were performed using standard procedures(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA restriction fragments, cloned into M13-mp18 bacteriophage or pCAT-promoter plasmid, were sequenced by the method of Sanger(22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline without Mg2+ and Ca2+ at pH 7.4, harvested by scraping, and, after centrifugation at 500 ´ g, suspended in 5-pellet volumes of 0.3 M sucrose and 2% Tween 40 in buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). After freezing in liquid nitrogen, the cells were thawed and gently homogenized using hand homogenizer pestel B; the suspension was layered onto 1.5 M sucrose in buffer A and centrifuged at 25,000 ´ g in a swinging bucket rotor. Nuclei were washed with 0.3 M sucrose in buffer A, and nuclear proteins were extracted with 2.5 volumes of buffer B (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 ´ g for 1 h; the supernatant was dialyzed for 4 h at 4°C against buffer C (20 mM HEPES-KOH, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 30% glycerol), and precipitated materials were discarded by centrifigation at 25,000 ´ g for 15 min prior to use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously(25Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The 18-base pair (bp) RED CRE synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled with [g-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then purified on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. The nuclear extract (3 μg) was incubated for 20 min on ice in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 12.5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). Approximately 1.5 fmol of 32P-labeled probe (approximately 50,000 cpm) were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Where indicated, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were also added to the binding reaction as competitors and incubated with the extract for 20 min, prior the addition of labeled DNA. Protein-DNA complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide gels at 160 V in 1 ´ Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4°C. In experiments using antiserum to CREB or ATF-2, nuclear extracts were incubated with the antiserum or its control counterpart in the same buffer for 20 min on ice before adding the labeled probe and processing as above. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. The 765-nucleotide PstI fragment (from −323 to +442, see Fig. 1) (10Osborne T.F. Gil G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3380-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) spanning the entire reductase promoter was cloned into the pEMBL-8-CAT vector (26) upstream to the bacterial gene for CAT. Mutations of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter sequence were created by two-step, recombinant polymerase chain reaction methods(27Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). In the first step, two polymerase chain reaction products were generated using the 5′ or 3′ end of the final products and overlapping sequence containing the same mutation. The second step was performed using the overlapping polymerase chain reaction products as templates, and DNA sequences of the 5′ or 3′ end of the final products as primers. Amplified fragments were ligated to pCAT-promoter plasmid and sequenced to verify the predicted sequence. Similar to the wild-type HMG-CoA reductase promoter, the CRE-mutated reductase fragment (765 bp) was cloned into the pEMBL-8-CAT vector. pRSV-Luc was used as positive control to evaluate transfection efficiency(28de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). FRTL-5 cells were grown to 50-60% confluence and then shifted to 5H medium (without TSH) for 3-5 days. Transfection used a DEAE-dextran protocol(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Four hours before transfection, the 5H medium was changed. Then, medium was removed, and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37°C with 0.25 ml of DEAE-dextran (2 mg/ml) containing 20 μg of pEMBL-8-CAT under the control of wild-type or mutated HMG-CoA reductase promoter, and 2 μg of pRSV-Luc/dish was added to 4.75 ml of 5H medium containing no calf serum. After a 1-h incubation, medium was aspirated, and the cells were treated for 3 min with 2.5 ml of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated in 5H medium. After 24 h, medium was changed, and cells were exposed to either 5H medium (control) or 6H medium (TSH challenge), both in the presence or in the absence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25 μM) and mevalonate (0.8 mM). After 16-18 h, cells were harvested. Where indicated, forskolin (10 μM) was added to the cells during the last 6 h of incubation. CAT assays were performed as described previously(29Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad kit; recrystallized bovine serum albumin was the standard. A PstI fragment of 765 bp, a candidate to contain the complete rat reductase promoter, was sequenced. The fragment spans 323 nucleotides upstream and 442 nucleotides downstream of the major transcription start site, which is identical to the hamster promoter (Fig. 1). Comparison with the hamster sequence revealed nearly 90% homology in the region −283 to +14 (data not shown). Long stretches of identity included the sterol regulatory element 1 and the major transcription start site. Ninety-five nucleotides upstream of the major transcription start site we noticed an 8-nucleotide sequence closely homologous to a CRE. The first 6 nucleotides of this octamer are identical to a consensus CRE (Fig. 2). We questioned whether this element, if a functionally active CRE, could be involved in the direct cAMP regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription. We synthesized an 18-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide that includes the octamer identified as a potential CRE in the HMG-CoA reductase promoter (RED CRE). The CRE octamer was flanked 5′ by 6 bp and 3′ by 4 bp (Fig. 2). The oligonucleotide was end-labeled and used as a probe to detect protein-DNA complexes with FRTL-5 cell nuclear extracts. When reacted with extracts from either quiescent (5H) or chronically TSH-stimulated (6H) FRTL-5 cells, protein-DNA complexes were formed that gave rise to a broad retarded band in both cases (Fig. 2). We performed competition experiments using several synthetic oligonucleotides (Fig. 3A), which included wild-type or mutated CRE sequences. When we used the oligonucleotide containing the reductase CRE (self) as competitor, the retarded band was significantly reduced by a 50-fold excess, and abolished by a 500-fold excess of the unlabeled probe (Fig. 3B, lanes3-5, and Fig. 3C, lanes2-4). Oligonucleotides containing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I CRE (Fig. 3B, lanes6-8) and oligonucleotides containing either somatostatin CRE (Fig. 3C, lanes5-7) or TSH receptor CRE (Fig. 3C, lanes8-10) were as effective as the homologous RED CRE in preventing complex formation, whereas oligonucleotides with the CRE octamer deleted (ΔCRE) (Fig. 3B, lanes9-11) or mutated to a nonpalindromic sequence (NPCRE) (Fig. 3Clanes12-14) did not behave as competitors, even at a 500-fold excess concentration. The addition of an antibody to CREB, to the incubation mixture containing the end-labeled synthetic RED CRE and FRTL-5 nuclear extracts resulted in a supershift of the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4, lane3). In contrast, antisera to the trans-ATF-2 did not cause supershift (Fig. 4, lane4), nor did the preimmune serum (Fig. 4, lane5). The specificity of the reaction was further indicated by the ability of a 500-fold excess of the unlabeled RED CRE to eliminate the supershifted complex (Fig. 4, lane6) but not of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing identical flanking regions and a mutated CRE resembling the MHC Class I nonpalindromic CRE (data not shown). To address the question as to whether the stimulatory effect of TSH on HMG-CoA reductase gene expression involves CRE transactivation, we transfected FRTL-5 cells with a chimeric plasmid containing the coding sequence of the bacterial enzyme CAT linked to the rat PstI fragment (765 bp, between nucleotides −323 and +442, see Fig. 1), which comprised the HMG-CoA reductase promoter. Assays for CAT activity were performed in cells maintained in the absence or in the presence of TSH (1 ´ 10-9M) for 16-18 h, i.e. the time required for the maximal hormone-induced HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription, or treated with forskolin (10 μM) for 6 h. Separate sets of cells were also exposed to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25 μM) and mevalonate (0.8 mM). Fig. 5 shows that TSH exposure increased CAT activity and that forskolin (10 μM) mimicked the TSH effect; it also shows that the effects of TSH and forskolin were decreased, but not abated, when cells were exposed to 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonate. These results indicate that the rat HMG-CoA reductase promoter-CAT construct is sensitive to sterol feedback regulation and that the TSH/cAMP effect is measurable independent of sterol regulatory element-mediated repression. In order to prove that the reductase CRE octamer was involved in cAMP-mediated TSH or forskolin effects, experiments were performed using the same PstI fragment of the reductase promoter linked 5′ to the CAT gene but carrying the CRE octamer mutated from 5′-TGACGTAG-3′ to the nonpalindromic sequence, 5′-CGACACGA-3′ (Fig. 6). TSH or forskolin failed to increase CAT activity in FRTL-5 cells transfected with the CAT gene under the control of the mutated HMG-CoA reductase promoter. It should be noted that in cells maintained in the absence of TSH (control), CAT activity was still measurable (Figure 5:, Figure 6:); this activity is likely to be sustained by residual cAMP in TSH-starved cells. These findings indicate that the CRE plays a functional role in the TSH/cAMP regulation of HMG-CoA reductase transcription in FRTL-5 cells. In a previous report (4Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we showed that TSH, a specific mitogen and physiologic regulator for thyroid cells, induces HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. In these cells, TSH induction of reductase gene transcription precedes the increase of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation and is mediated by cAMP(4Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we have investigated the molecular basis for cAMP regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene expression, and show that an 8-nucleotide sequence within the reductase promoter is structurally and functionally homologous to a consensus CRE(16Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The rat reductase promoter is nearly 90% homologous with the hamster promoter between nucleotides −283 and +14 (see Fig. 1) and identical in long stretches of nucleotides, most notably around the major transcription start site and the sequence known as footprint 4, which is required for reductase gene transcription(6Osborne T.F. Gil G. Brown M.S. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This particular region includes the CRE-like octamer 5′-TGACGTAG-3′. We have focused on this sequence as a potential target for cAMP regulation and provide evidences indicating that it is indeed a functional CRE involved in TSH regulation of reductase gene expression. These can be summarized as follows. Oligonucleotides containing the CRE-like sequence and nuclear extracts from FRTL-5 cells formed specific protein-DNA complexes that reacted with antibodies to CREB but failed to react with antibodies to ATF-2 or preimmune serum(16Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 17Habener J.F. Mol.

TSH or forskolin could stimulate CAT activity in FRTL-5 cells in which the reporter gene was under the control of the reductase promoter. Stimulation was significant also under conditions of cholesterol/mevalonate down-regulation. In FRTL-5 cells transfected with a construct in which the reductase CRE was mutated to nonpalindromic sequence but was otherwise identical, TSH or forskolin failed to affect the activity of the reporter gene. Thus, in FRTL-5 cells, the HMG-CoA reductase gene is positively regulated by cAMP through modulation of a cis-acting element on its promoter, a process that has not been reported so far. The role of cAMP regulation of the reductase gene expression has never been addressed in detail. We have previously reported that in rat thyroid cells, cAMP has a key role in regulating sterol metabolism by down-regulating LDL receptor activity and inducing HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription. Studies on different cell lines should tell us whether this is a general phenomenon rather than a unique feature of thyroid epithelial cells; we suggest, at this point, that it may well be applicable to all cells where the cAMP signal plays a role in the growth process. The identification of a CRE-like sequence as a functional CRE in the reductase promoter indicates direct transcriptional activation through cAMP signaling; however, we are still unable to resolve quantitatively the contribution of cAMP-mediated cholesterol depletion(4Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bifulco M. Santillo M. Tedesco I. Zarrilli R. Laezza C. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19336-19342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since CAT assays on cells transfected with chimeric constructs of the reporter gene and the reductase promoter are affected by cholesterol and mevalonate incubation under conditions of high intracellular cAMP (see Fig. 5). In summary, this study has identified and characterized a CRE in the HMG-CoA reductase promoter and in FRTL-5 cells and has demonstrated that, at least in this particular cell line, the gene can be positively regulated by cAMP. The relevance of this regulatory mechanism, which has been ignored so far, is still a matter of investigation. We thank M. Berardone, F. D'Agnello, and F. Moscato for the art work."

In a previous work, LAM from the vaccine strain, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, was found to exhibit mannooligosaccharides at its arabinan nonreducing ends (ManLAM).

INTRODUCTIONMycobacterium tuberculosis infects one-third of the world's population, and tuberculosis remains the largest cause of mortality in the world from a single infectious agent(1Bloom B.R. Murray G.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). This emphasizes the need to understand the interaction of M. tuberculosis with host phagocytic cells and the immune system. However, little is known about the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.Lipoarabinomannan (LAM)1( 1The abbreviations used are: LAMlipoarabinomannanManLAMLAM with mannosyl units capping the arabinan endsAraLAMLAM with arabinofuranosyl terminiLMlipomannanPIMsphosphatidylinositol mannosidesBCGBacillus Calmette GuérinTMStrimethylsilylationHMBCheteronuclear multiple bond connectivity spectroscopyHMQCheteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopyHOHAHAhomonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopyROESYrotating frame nuclear Overhauser spectroscopyHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLSIMSliquid secondary ion mass spectrometryInsinositolGroglyceroltterminal.) is considered as a major antigen of mycobacterial cell walls, widely distributed within Mycobacterium species(2Daniel T.M. Kubica G.P. Wayne L.G. The Mycobacteria: A Sourcebook. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1984: 417-465Google Scholar). LAM from M. tuberculosis has been demonstrated to exhibit a wide variety of biological activities such as suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation (3), inhibition of g-interferon-mediated activation of murine macrophages(4Sibley L.D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and immunomodulation of a large array of macrophage cytokines(5Adams L.B. Fukutomi Y. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Abrams J.S. Lu S. Wang E. Yamamura M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. J.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar).LAM from M. tuberculosis is composed of a mannan core linked to a linear arabinan chain to which oligoarabinosyl side chains are attached(8Misaki A. Azuma I. Yamamura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 1759-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was established that most of these side chains of the LAM from the virulent strain (Erdman) of M. tuberculosis are capped with either mono-, di-, or trimannosyl residues. This LAM is termed mannosylated and named ManLAM(9Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. McNeil M. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This capping is missing from the LAM called AraLAM isolated from a rapidly growing strain of Mycobacterium, initially described as the avirulent strain of M. tuberculosis H37Ra(11Chatterjee D. Bozic C. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6960-9652Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Moreover, the reducing end of this AraLAM mannan core was found to be linked to a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor (12Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) similar to the mycobacterial phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannoside (PIM) structure.Some of the biological activities of LAM were shown to be related to characteristic structural features of these complex molecules. LAM treatment with mild alkali results in a decrease of its ability to suppress in vitro antigen-induced proliferation, g-interferon activation of macrophages(4Sibley L.D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cytokine release(6Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Abrams J.S. Lu S. Wang E. Yamamura M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). Acyl groups such as the fatty acids of the anchor but also the short fatty acids previously described (14Weber P.L. Gray G.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 74: 259-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Leopold K. Fischer W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) seem to be crucial to these biological properties. The Man-capping at the LAM nonreducing termini also results in significant functional differences in vitro which could have important consequences in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. AraLAM in vitro rapidly triggers tumor necrosis factor release from infected murine macrophages, thereby enhancing their bacteriostatic activity, whereas ManLAM from the virulent strain elicits low levels of tumor necrosis factor that would be too low to restrain the parasite's growth(5Adams L.B. Fukutomi Y. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Roach T.I.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J.

Moreno C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 94: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).We previously reported the global structure of LAM from Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) strain Pasteur, used throughout the world as a vaccine against tuberculosis(18Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that this LAM shares structural features with LAM from a virulent strain (H37Rv) of M. tuberculosis, since it is also capped by mannopyranosyl residues. Despite these data, ManLAM could still be considered as a virulence factor involved in mycobacterial invasion and/or survival in host cells. A more detailed structural definition of M. bovis BCG ManLAM was prevented by the considerable molecular heterogeneity of the fraction that was outlined during its molecular mass determination by matrix-assisted UV-laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The present study was undertaken in order to define a more accurate structure of the mannan core of the ManLAM from M. bovis BCG and, more particularly, to establish the presence of a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor at the reducing end of this molecule. Through the two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear scalar coupling NMR and mass spectrometry analysis of the mannan, we unequivocally assess the presence of one phosphate group on an oligosaccharide of 20 glycosidic units. Moreover, the molecular heterogeneity of this fraction was shown to be size- and charge-dependent, especially by the occurrence of non-, mono-, and even diphosphorylated populations. Minor structural units causing this heterogeneity may be at the origin of important functional differences.In view of the dependence of biological functions on structural difference, the implications of these structural observations in the role of ManLAM as a virulence factor will be discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSMild Acid HydrolysisThe dManLAM from M. bovis BCG strain Pasteur was purified as described previously (18Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was treated with 0.1 N HCl, 100°C, 15 min in order to specifically hydrolyze the arabinan chains. The hydrolysate was applied on a Bio-Gel P-4 or P-6 eluted with water, and samples were assayed by GC after hydrolysis and TMS derivatization.Separation of Mannans by HPLCMannan fractions obtained after Bio-Gel P-6 were separated by anion exchange HPLC using an analytical Carbopac PA1 (Dionex) column at neutral pH. Elution was performed using a gradient of sodium acetate (ACS Grade, Merck) in deionized water (18 MW) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Separation was monitored by pulsed amperometric detection (PAD II) (Dionex Corp.) after NaOH post-column addition. Using a two-split system, only 15% of the product was directed to the detector after addition of 300 μl min-1 of NaOH solution (500 mM), and the remaining 85% were collected. HPLC was conducted on a Gilson (Gilson, France) gradient system.MethylationMannans were O-methylated three times according to a modified (18Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek(19Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). Per-O-methylated products were hydrolyzed with 2 N trifluoroacetic acid at 110°C for 3 h, reduced with NaBH4, and peracetylated. The alditol acetates of methylated sugars were identified by GC/MS. Glycosidic linkage analysis was carried out according to Sweet et al.(20Sweet D.P. Shapiro R.H. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 40: 967-974Google Scholar).Chemical AnalysisQuantitative carbohydrate determinations were routinely carried out by GC analysis after hydrolysis (2 N trifluoroacetic acid at 110°C for 2 h) and TMS derivatization(18Venisse A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). myo-Inositol content was measured following acid hydrolysis (6 N HCl, 110°C, 18 h) and TMS derivatization. These conditions were proved to improve inositol recovery from inositol-1-P(21Roberts W.L. Kim B.H. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Glucitol was added as an internal standard prior to hydrolysis. Total phosphorus was determined after perchloric acid hydrolysis according the Bartlett procedure(22Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).GC and GC/MSRoutine gas chromatography (GC) was performed on alditol acetates and TMS derivatives of monosaccharides using a Girdel series 30 equipped with an OV-1 (0.3-μm film thickness, Spiral, Dijon, France) fused silica capillary column (25-m length ∙ 0.22-mm inside diameter). A temperature program from 100 to 280°C at a speed of 3°C/min was used.GC/MS was performed on a Hewlett-Packard MS engine using both EI and CI ionization modes.Mass Spectrometry LSIMSLSIMS was performed on a ZAB 2E mass spectrometer (VG analytical). Spectra were generated by a 35-kV cesium ion beam with an acceleration voltage of 8 kV. Thioglycerol and (thioglycerol + 1% acetic acid) were used as matrix for negative and positive mode spectra, respectively.NMR SpectroscopyNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer equipped with an Aspect X32 computer. Samples were repeatedly lyophilized in D2O for hydroxyl deuterium exchange and dissolved in D2O (Spin et Techniques, Paris, France, 99.96% purity) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in a 200 ∙ 5 mm 535-PP NMR tube. All spectra were recorded at 303 K.Power-gated 1H-decoupled phosphorus-31 (31P) spectra (202 MHz) was recorded with 25-kHz spectral width, a 17-μs 90° pulse, and 3 s of relaxation time. The 16K acquired complex points were zero-filled to 64K and processed after exponential multiplication (line broadening = 5 Hz). Phosphoric acid (85%) was used as the external standard (dP = 0.0).The homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn (HOHAHA) (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn.

Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3261) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded in the proton-detected mode with a Bruker 5-mm 1H-broad band tunable probe with reversal geometry. The 1H {31P} HMQC-HOHAHA was obtained according to Lerner's pulse sequence(30Lerner L. Bax A. J. Magnetic Res. 1986; 69: 375-380Google Scholar), and a GARP sequence (29Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magnetic Res. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) was used for 31P decoupling during acquisition.RESULTSChromatographic and Chemical AnalysisAfter an acid-catalyzed partial depolymerization of the deacylated molecule (dManLAM) we previously demonstrated that LAM from M. bovis BCG is mannosylated at its nonreducing ends(18Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ManLAM hydrolysate (0.1 N HCl, 15 min, 100°C) was applied to a Bio-Gel P4 column (data not shown) to separate the mono- and oligosaccharides from the nonhydrolyzed mannan (Ma). These mono- and oligosaccharides, arising from the arabinan domain, and the mannan core were identified from their monosaccharide composition routinely established by GC analysis after hydrolysis and TMS derivatization. The mannan core, eluted in the void volume, was predominantly composed of mannosyl units (Man) as expected and also of arabinosyl (Ara), inositol (Ins), and glycerol (Gro) units in small amounts. Moreover, 31P NMR analysis of Ma revealed one signal at 0.75 ppm, the chemical shift of which is not affected by pH in a range between pD = 6.8 and pD = 9.8, thus strongly suggesting the presence of a phosphodiester group.The Ma core was analyzed by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) in both negative and positive modes (Fig. 1, A and B). In the high mass range, the negative mode-mass spectrum (Fig. 1A) is dominated by the peak at m/z 3037.9. Two other signals were observed at m/z 3015.9 and m/z 2999.8 distant from the base peak by 22 and 38 atomic mass units, respectively. These mass differences agree with the presence of sodium and potassium, suggesting that these three peaks characterize one molecular species. Thus, the m/z 3037.9 pseudomolecular ion contained one Na+ and one K+ leading to the following structure (M + Na + K - 3H)-. In order to support this ion assignment, Ma was analyzed in negative mode-LSIMS with a matrix doped with KI (data not shown). As expected, the peak at m/z 3037.9 was missing, and the mass spectrum was dominated by one signal at m/z 3015.9 assigned to (M + K - 2H)-. The positive mode mass spectrum of Ma (Fig. 1B) showed abundant cationized molecular ions (M + Na + K - H)- at m/z 3039.6, supporting the previous interpretations. From all these data, the average molecular weight of M was established at 2978.4 Da. From this and from the Ma composition determined by GC analysis, we can propose that M, the major molecular species detected in Ma, was composed of 16 (Man, Ins), one Ara, one Gro, and two phosphates.Moreover, LSIMS analysis revealed two other sets of peaks down-shifted from M by 162 and 324 atomic mass units indicating the presence of two other molecular species, in lesser abundance, containing, respectively, one and two Man (or Ins) less than M. More interestingly, the high mass range of the positive mode-LSIMS spectrum shows two other sets of pseudomolecular ions at m/z 3561.5, 3539.4 and m/z 3399.3, 3377.2. The analogous ions were missing in the negative mode spectrum. Moreover, the mass difference between these ions and those assigned to M cannot be explained only by a different number of monosaccharide units.In order to fractionate the various molecular species revealed by the LSIMS analysis, the ManLAM hydrolysate was chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P6 column monitored by refractory index (Fig. 2). Fractions 1 and 2, namely Ma1 and Ma2, respectively, were of interest since they predominantly contained mannosyl residues. The remaining oligosaccharidic fractions, 3 to 6, showed higher Ara/Man ratios and arose from the nonreducing termini of the arabinan domain(18Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2:Bio-Gel P-6 chromatography of the dManLAM hydrolysate (0.1 N HCl, 15 min, 100°C) eluted with water.

Samples 1 and 2 contained a high percentage of mannosyl residues (called Ma1 and Ma2), while samples 3-6 contained a higher Ara/Man ratio.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The molecular homogeneity of Ma1 and Ma2 was then checked by ion exchange chromatography with an analytical Carbopac PA1 column using an HPLC device monitored by an amperometric detector (Fig. 3). Gradient of sodium acetate in water was used as solvents, and sodium hydroxide was added post-column for amperometry detection. 80% of the Ma1 fraction was eluted with a retention time of 4.5 min (peak II) during the isocratic elution with water while most of the Ma2 appeared as a single peak (I) in the void volume (3 min). Small quantities of materials were detected with the sodium acetate gradient, between 15 and 20 min. The separation on Carbopac at neutral pH was dependent on the charge-to-mass ratio of the oligosaccharides. These chromatographic studies revealed the relative homogeneity of each fraction and suggested that fraction Ma1 was predominantly composed of a more strongly charged mannan population than Ma2.Figure 3:Ion exchange HPLC profile (analytical column Carbopac PA1) of Ma1 (A) and Ma2 (B). The column was eluted for 10 min with water then with a gradient of 0.5 M sodium acetate in water for 20 min. The glycosidic samples were detected by amperometry as explained under “Materials and Methods.” In these conditions, a standard galactose sample was eluted in the void volume at 3 min while glucuronic acid and xylose-1-P were eluted in the gradient at 19 min and 25 min, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GC quantitative analysis established that Ma1 and Ma2 were composed by Aras and Mans in an approximate Ara/Man molar ratio of 1:20 and 2:20, respectively.

Finally, the phosphorus assay of each fraction indicated 0.7 mol of phosphorus/mol of Ma1 and 0.15 mol of phosphorus/mol of Ma2 (with an approximate molecular mass of 3000 Da for mannans).Methylation data (Table I) obtained with Ma1 and Ma2 were in agreement with those previously reported for the ManLAM (18Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where only mannopyranosyl and arabinofuranosyl ring forms were observed. Ma1 showed the presence of t-Manp and 2,6-linked Manp (40 and 35%, respectively) at twice the proportion of 6-linked Manp (16%). This latter unbranched Manp was found in lower proportions in Ma2 (9%), being 4-fold less abundant than 2,6-linked Manp (34%). Small amounts of t-Araf, 5-linked Araf, and 2-linked Manp residues were also present in both mannans. These data indicate that both mannans are highly branched.Table I:Methylation analysis of Ma1 and Ma2 from M. bovis BCG dManLAM Open table in a new tab Both fractions Ma1 and Ma2 were then analyzed by LSIMS, one-dimensional and two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear 1H-13C and 1H-31P NMR.LSIMS AnalysisThe high mass range of the positive mode-LSIMS spectrum of Ma1 (Fig. 4A) showed an intense peak at m/z 3539.3. The presence of two other signals of lower intensity at m/z 3517.5 and m/z 3555.9 separated by −22 atomic mass units and +16 atomic mass units, respectively, from the base peak, suggested that the signal at m/z 3539.3 corresponds to the cationized molecular ion (M1 + Na)+. Thus, the proton and potassium-containing molecular ions were assigned to the peaks at m/z 3517.5 and m/z 3555.9, respectively. Moreover, these assignments were supported by the negative mode mass spectrum (Fig. 4B), showing an intense peak at m/z 3515.5 attributed to the pseudomolecular ion (M1 - H)-. From these values, the M1 average molecular mass was determined at 3517.0 Da. From the molecular mass of M1 and the chemical composition of Ma1, we can propose that M1 is composed of 18 Manps, 2 Arafs, 1 Ins, 1 Gro, and 1 phosphate group. A second set of ions was observed in lower abundance in both spectra and characterized another molecular species in Ma1 containing one Manp less.Figure 4:LSIMS analysis of Ma1. A, positive mode LSIMS spectrum of Ma1 in a matrix of thioglycerol, 10% acetic acid. B, negative mode LSIMS spectrum of Ma1 in thioglycerol. Both spectra showed a second set of ions in lower abundance with a mass difference of −162 atomic mass units from the base peak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Despite our efforts, the Ma2 LSIMS analysis was unsuccessful. Positive and negative mass spectra were devoid of pseudomolecular ions in the expected mass range. Nevertheless, the absence of Ma2 pseudomolecular ions can be explained by the absence of phosphate groups in this molecule.We noted the absence, in the Ma1 and Ma2 LSIMS spectra, of the abundant pseudomolecular ion at m/z 3039.9 observed in the positive LSIMS spectrum of Ma and assigned to a mannan core with two phosphate groups.In order to define the Ma1 and Ma2 structures more precisely, they were analyzed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.NMR Studies of Ma1 and Ma2The Ma1 and Ma2 proton anomeric resonance regions (Fig. 5) are dominated by two signals at 5.06 and 5.14 ppm (denoted B and D). In both spectra, the resonance at 5.14 ppm appeared to form a complex signal with two near-resonances at 5.11 (C) and 5.15 ppm. Two weaker superimposed signals at 4.915 and 4.93 ppm (denoted A) were also common to both mannans. However, they differed in their relative integration value, which was lower in the case of Ma2 (reported in Fig. 5). The downfield resonance at 5.20 ppm (F) was also observed in both spectra but was of lower intensity in Ma2. It can be noticed that a weak signal at 5.18 ppm (E) was only present in Ma2.Figure 5:Expanded region of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra (d 4.3 to 5.2) of Ma1 (A) and Ma2 (B) anomeric protons are labeled A-F, as shown in Table I. The relative integration values are reported. Spectra were recorded over a spectral width of 5005 Hz using a 7-μs 90° pulse, 1.5 s of recycle delay and 1536 acquisitions of 1.63 s. Flame ionization detectors (16K) were zero-filled to 64K and multiplied by a exponential function (line broadening = 0.5 Hz) prior to Fourier transformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These anomeric protons and carbons were routinely assigned from the HMQC spectrum (not shown). The remaining protons and carbons of each spin system which characterize the units involved in Ma1 and Ma2 were partially attributed from the COSY (not shown), HOHAHA, HMQC, and HMBC spectra. The assignment of signals was also based on the chemical shifts of analogous compound NMR studies(18Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Allerhand A. Berman E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 2400-2412Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Kogan G. Pavliak V.

These values are summarized in Tables II and III.Table II:Assignment of some protons and carbons of both Ma1 and Ma2 glycosidic units, based upon the interpretation of HMQC, HMBC, and HOHAHA spectra and data from literature. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million and were measured in D2O. Open table in a new tab Table III:Assignment of inositol protons based upon their chemical shift and multiplicity and data from literature Open table in a new tab Starting from the downfield anomeric resonances D at 5.14 and 5.15 ppm, the cross-peak in the HMQC spectrum showed a correlation with an upfield anomeric carbon resonance at 100.89 ppm. The C-1 chemical shift of an α-D-Manp is described to be shifted upfield (Δ∙ = 2 ppm) while its H-1 is deshielded (Δd = 0.2 ppm) upon 2-O-substitution(34Cohen R.E. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4345-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, both the anomeric carbon and the D protons were attributed to a 2-O-linked α-Manp. This assignment was confirmed by the HMQC and HOHAHA spectra (Fig. 6) allowing the attribution of the C-2 resonance at 81.45 ppm and the H-2 resonances at 4.045 and 4.055 ppm. This downfield chemical shift of the C-2 resonance (Δd = 7 ppm) typified a 2-O-linked α-Manp. Moreover, the C-5 resonance was localized at 74.05 ppm owing to the (C-5,H-1) correlation observed by HMBC (Fig. 7). This chemical shift is shifted upfield from its normal range (Δd = 2 ppm) () and is in agreement with glycosylation in C-6. Thus, this spin system was attributed to the 2,6-di-O-linked α-Manp unit characterized by methylation analysis.Figure 6:Partial two-dimensional HOHAHA spectrum (d 3.6-4.2/d 4.85-5.23)"
https://openalex.org/W2050793927,"LAP/NF-IL6 is a member of the C/EBP family of transcriptional activators and has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the acute-phase response. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of the liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein (LAP) Ser-105 enhances the activation of LAP-dependent genes. To identify the region which is important for gene activation, a series of LAP mutants were constructed, and domain swapping experiments with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 were performed. These experiments point to an acidic region located between amino acids 21 and 105 of LAP/NF-IL6 which activates genes independent of the DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper of LAP/NF-IL6. Computer-assisted predictions reveal two regions, a helical and a hydrophobic region in the transactivation domain, which could be important in mediating the direct interaction with the basal machinery. Site-directed mutagenesis of acidic residues in both regions demonstrates that the hydrophobic region located between amino acids 85 and 95 is the likely motif for the interaction with the basal machinery.

For many genes cell type-specific expression has been shown to be regulated at the level of transcription. Most genes are controlled by several transcription factors which interact with cis-acting elements in the promoter or in remote enhancer regions. The interaction of transcription factors with their DNA recognition sites can enhance the frequency of transcription initiation. The increase in the rate of transcription is believed to be mediated by direct contact of the transcription factor with the transcription apparatus (basal machinery) after DNA binding(1Johnson P.F.

LAP, a member of the C/EBP family, interacts with cis-acting elements in the promoter region of the albumin gene and several other liver-specific genes(9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The albumin promoter consists of six cis-acting elements (A-F). The B- and D-sites are especially important as binding sites for transcription factors which determine hepatocyte-specific expression of the albumin gene(10Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). LAP shows strong affinity for the D-site of the albumin promoter and leads to stimulation of transcription in vivo and in vitro(3Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein liver inhibitory protein interleukin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cytomegalovirus cAMP-responsive element-binding protein CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein open reading frame phospho-CREB-binding protein. Besides LAP, two other transcription factors, C/EBP-α and DBP, bind to the D-site of the albumin promoter. All three proteins belong to the bZIP family of transcriptional activators(3Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 11Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L.

LAP and C/EBP-α have similar affinities toward the cognate DNA and show more than 71% homology in their DNA-binding domain and the adjacent α helix in the C-terminal part of the protein. The C-terminal part of the protein is responsible for dimerization in vivo and in vitro of the two proteins. Descombes et al.(3Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) postulated a model in which the interaction of different proteins at promoter sites may determine distinct functions in target gene transcription. According to this model the functional differences would be encoded in the different N-terminal region of the two transcription factors LAP and C/EBP-α. LAP/NF-IL6 has been implicated as a master regulator of the acute-phase response. Earlier data indicated that it might be involved in the induction of several cytokine genes such as IL6, IL8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, which include LAP recognition sites in their critical cis-acting elements(4Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 13Mukaida N. Shiroo M. Matsushima K.J.

Recent data of Tanaka et al.(15Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), in NF-IL6 deficient mice, raise doubt about the importance of NF-IL6 for induction of some of these genes. Further studies have to show whether the results of Tanaka et al.(15Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) observed in the transgenic mouse model do account for the in vivo situation. Homozygous LAP/NF-IL6-deficient transgenic mice might develop mechanisms during embryonal development, for example by other members of the C/EBP family, which may circumvent the loss of LAP/NF-IL6. Genes of the acute-phase response that share LAP/NF-IL6 recognition sites in their promoters have been named the class I of the acute phase genes(16Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), in contrast to the acute-phase class II genes, where binding sites for acute phase response factor have been described(17Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pelle Grinni S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F.

Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In response to environmental signals, modulation of target gene expression can be achieved through posttranscriptional modifications of transcriptional activators(19Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptional mechanisms have also been postulated to be important in the activation of genes with LAP recognition sites in their promoter. An IL6-dependent pathway leads to increased binding and transactivation of LAP (NF-IL6) (5). A direct pathway which may lead to the phosphorylation of LAP during IL6 induction has not been shown yet; however, LAP is a phosphoprotein in vivo. Different signal transduction pathways can induce LAP-mediated gene transcription, and cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of LAP is associated with the nuclear translocation of LAP in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells(20Metz R. Ziff E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We showed previously that stimulation of a protein kinase C pathway in HepG2 hepatoma cells increases the phosphorylation of Ser-105 which is located within the N-terminal region of LAP(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Next to LAP, a liver inhibitory protein (LIP) also exists in the liver and is translated from the same LAP mRNA, lacking the 145 N-terminal amino acids of LAP. The resulting truncated protein is found to bind the cognate DNA with higher affinity than LAP. As the N-terminal transactivation domain is deleted in LIP, binding results in a strong competitional inhibition of LAP mediated gene transcription(9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Additional LIP has been shown to antagonize the effect of LAP in blocking hepatoma cell proliferation(23Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides activating liver-specific gene transcription, the N-terminal part of the protein seems to be important in mediating the LAP-dependent cell cycle arrest in hepatoma cells. Here we demonstrate that an 84-amino acid-long domain in the N-terminal domain of LAP is sufficient to mediate activation of a LAP-dependent reporter gene construct. Deletion analysis and domain swapping show that the effect on transactivation mediated by this domain is independent of the basic DNA-binding domain and of the leucine zipper region. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection into HepG2 cells was carried out as described previously(2Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), with the exception of a calcium phosphate precipitation for only 5 h, followed by a 15% glycerol shock for 1 min. In experiments with the LAP deletion proteins, LAP-responsive CAT-reporter constructs, the D- or CRP-CAT vectors, were cotransfected. CAT assays were performed 48 h after transfection using thin layer chromatography for the separation of the reaction products(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Quantification of the CAT results was carried out with a Fuji Imager. In transfection experiments with the LAP/GAL4 fusion proteins the GAL4-responsive reporter 5 ´ GAL4-Luc was cotransfected. For luciferase activity cell extracts were prepared and measured as described before(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The pBS-LAP Δ21 construct (24Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was used for plasmid constructions. For site-directed mutagenesis the cDNA of pBS LAP Δ21 was used to prepare single stranded DNA in the Escherichia coli strain JM 109 using the helper phage M13 KO 7, according to Sambrook et al.(25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the mutagenesis kit from Amersham, according to the supplier's instructions. To obtain the 5′ deletion of LAP, restriction sites were introduced into the open reading frame (ORF) of LAP: LAP Δ 1-41, 5′- CGC GGC GCG GAC CGC CTT GGC CC −3′ (RsrII site); LAP Δ 1-63, 5′-CAG GTA GGG GCT CAT GAC GAT GGC GCG-3′ (BspHI site); LAP Δ1-75, 5′-GCG GCG AAG TCC TAG GCG GCG GG-3′ (AvrII site); LAP Δ1-104, 5′-CCG TAG TCG GAC CGC TTC TTG CTC G-3′ (RsrII site); LAP Δ1-121, 5′-GGG AAG CAG GCC TGC GGT GCG GC-3′ (StuI site); LAP Δ1-189, 5′-GGC GTC GGC GGG ACC CGG CGT CCC GGG-3′. For LAP Δ1-139 and LAP Δ1-152 natural sites BsiCI and NcoI, respectively, in the ORF were used to obtain the deletions. After introduction of the restriction sites in the ORF of LAP, constructs were further modified to obtain the deletions, while maintaining the ORF of LAP. To obtain the internal deletions of LAP, the same restriction sites were used, and DNA pieces were modified and religated. All the resulting constructs were sequenced and subcloned into a CMV-driven mammalian expression vector as described before(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To construct the GAL4 fusion proteins the NcoI-EcoRI fragment from the pBS LAP Δ21 construct containing the basic domain and the leucine zipper region of LAP was replaced by the BspHI-EcoRI fragment containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1-147) of a modified version of the pSG424 vector as described before(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The chimeric LAP-GAL4 reading frames were excised by HindIlI-EcoRI digestion and were cloned into the pSG424 vector from which the GAL4 DNA-binding domain was removed. To introduce the point mutations of the acidic residues in the activation domain of LAP the following primers were used: mutation codon 56 and/or 58, 5′-GGC GCG CT G/C GTG CT G/C GCC GAT GGC-3′; mutation codon 94 and/or 95, 5′-GCC GTA GT T/C GT T/C GGC GAA GAG-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 hepatoma cells using the Dignam C method as described previously(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For the gel retardation assays 2.5 μg of nuclear extracts were used. The binding reaction was performed for 20 min on ice. For binding assays where the LAP DNA-binding region was maintained an oligonucleotide spanning the D-site of the albumin promoter was used as a 32P-labeled probe. For gel shift experiments using the chimeric LAP-GAL4 proteins an oligonucleotide spanning the GAL4-binding site was used as a 32P-labeled probe. Free DNA and DNA∙protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (24Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the difference that the gel was run for 4 h at 300 V to get a better resolution of the different deletion mutants. Nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) in 1% SDS, 20% methanol, 400 mM glycine, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 4°C for 2 h at 200 mA. LAP Δ21 and the LAP deletions were analyzed by using polyclonal LAP antibodies(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham). Three different ATGs exist in the ORF of LAP. Only the second and the third ATG are efficiently used to translate the two different forms of LAP in the liver; LAP Δ21 and LIP (LAP Δ1-152). In contrast, the full-length LAP is not efficiently translated and has only a minor effect on transactivation of LAP-responsive reporter constructs compared with the LAP Δ21 protein(9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Therefore LAP Δ21 was used for deletion analysis to identify the transactivation domain of LAP. LIP has been shown to be a repressor of LAP, as it blocks transactivation of a LAP dependent reporter construct(9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). From these data we concluded that the transactivation domain should be in the 131 N-terminal amino acids (21-152) of LAP. These 132 N-terminal amino acids were further characterized by the introduction of restriction sites into the ORF of LAP to create a series of 5′ deletion mutants between LAP amino acid 21 and 153 (Fig. 1A). The mutant sequences were cloned into a CMV-driven mammalian expression vector. The effect on transactivation of the different N-terminal deletion mutants was investigated in cotransfection experiments with a LAP-responsive reporter plasmid (CRP-CAT). Interestingly, a deletion of the first 20 amino acid in the LAP construct LAP Δ1-41 had a tremendous effect on the activation of the reporter plasmid. Only around 10% of the CAT activity was detected compared with LAP Δ1-21 construct (Fig. 1A). A deletion of further 22 amino acids in LAP Δ1-63, and the other consecutive 5′ deletions, showed no increased activation of the reporter plasmid compared to the transfection of the reporter construct alone (Fig. 1A). The nuclear expression of all the N-terminal LAP deletion mutants was monitored by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts (Fig. 1B). All the constructs were well expressed in the nucleus. As deletion mutants could have an effect on the tertiary structure of the artificial protein and resulting in a reduction of DNA binding, gel shift experiments were performed with the same nuclear extracts as shown in the Western blot experiments. All the deletion proteins were found to bind the cognate DNA (data not shown). To exclude that differences in the expression of the proteins may influence the results shown in Fig. 1A, and because we showed that LAP has a strong squelching effect on gene activation(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), increasing amounts of the LAP expression constructs were cotransfected with a constant amount of the reporter plasmid. However only minor effects on the activation of the reporter plasmid could be observed, when increasing amounts of the LAP deletions LAP Δ1-63, LAP Δ1-75, LAP Δ1-104, LAP Δ1-121, LAP Δ1-139, and LAP Δ1-152 were used as these proteins did not activate the reporter plasmid over background level (data not shown). Like already shown for the LAP Δ1-21 protein(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the first LAP Δ1-41 mutation showed a similar kinetic on activation of the reporter construct as found for the wild type protein (data not shown). After we determined the N-terminal boundary of the activation domain of LAP, the following experiments were directed to find the C-terminal boundary of the activation domain. We created a series of internal LAP deletion mutants. Increasingly larger pieces were excised from the internal part of the protein beginning at the third ATG in the ORF. The 145 C-terminal amino acids, which code for the LIP protein and which contain the basic domain and the leucine zipper important for mediating DNA binding, were left unchanged. In the LAP Δ140-152, LAP Δ105-152, and LAP Δ64-152, 13, 47, and 90 amino acids, respectively, were deleted (Fig. 2A). The modified LAP proteins were cotransfected with the LAP-responsive reporter plasmid (CRP-CAT). Only a minor decrease in CAT activity was observed when the smallest deletion LAP Δ140-152 was cotransfected with the specific reporter plasmid. The deletion of further 34 amino acids in the mutant LAP Δ105-152 resulted in a reduction of nearly 40% activity of the wild type. Further excision of 41 amino acids in the LAP Δ64-152 construct resulted in a decline to background activity, detected when the reporter construct was used alone (Fig. 2A). In order to determine the significance of amino acids 105-152, we deleted amino acids 64-104 in the construct LAP Δ64-104 and cotransfected the CMV expression vector with the LAP-responsive reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2A no increase over background activity was observed when the LAP Δ64-104 construct was expressed. Therefore we concluded that the LAP amino acids 64-104 contain sequences which are important for mediating the transactivation of LAP. From our results obtained with the N-terminal and internal LAP deletion mutants we were confident that an important part of the LAP transactivation domain was located between the LAP amino acids 21-104. We speculate that the difference in activity between LAP Δ140-152 and LAP Δ105-152 could be due to changes in the tertiary structure of the mutant proteins, alternatively the amino acids between 105 and 140 are important to stabilize the region between amino acids 21 and 104. To exclude that an additional transactivation domain which may be repressed by other sequences is further 3′ of the third ATG in the LAP ORF, an additional deletion was constructed which leaves only 107 amino acids of the LAP molecule containing the important region for DNA binding (LAP Δ1-189). Like for the LAP Δ1-152 protein, no change in CAT activity was observed. As with the 5′ deletions, the internal deletions were also checked for protein expression by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B) and DNA binding by gel shift experiments, respectively (data not shown). For all the proteins, the expression in the Western blot analysis was in agreement with the effect on DNA binding in the gel shift experiments, except for the LAP Δ1-189 construct. A dramatic difference was observed between the nuclear expression of the protein and its strong shift in the gel shift experiment when compared with the other deletion proteins in the same experiment. At the present time we have two possible explanations for this discrepancy in the results. Either the polyclonal antibody directed toward the LAP protein shows a much lower affinity for these 107 C-terminal amino acids of the protein, or as shown for the LIP protein, which has a stronger affinity toward the cognate DNA(9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), further 3′ deletions have an even more dramatic effect on the DNA binding affinity of the protein. For many other transcription factors it has been shown that the different functional domains could be dissected and that these domains work independently from each other. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain of GAL4 is an ideal candidate; it has been mapped within the first 147 amino acids of the wild type protein. The truncated protein has been shown to translocate to the nucleus and is incapable of activating transcription in vivo. From earlier results we know that a chimeric LAP/GAL4 construct has the capacity to activate a GAL4-responsive reporter construct(21Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To further support our results in the mapping of the transactivation domain, we performed domain swapping experiments and tested whether the same effects on transactivation shown for the whole protein could be observed for the deletion series using only the N-terminal domain of LAP. In the following series of experiments the LAP DNA binding and leucine zipper domain corresponding to the coding sequences of the LAP protein were swapped versus the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4(1-147)). The resulting 5′ deletions of the chimeric proteins are demonstrated in Fig. 3A. As shown for the LAP protein, the chimeric LAP/GAL4 5′ deletions when cotransfected with a GAL4 reporter construct also showed a dramatic drop in LUC activity when the first 20 amino acids were deleted and no increase over background activity was observed when a further 22 amino acids were deleted (Fig. 3A). As demonstrated by gel shift experiments, all the proteins had a comparable affinity in DNA binding (Fig. 3B). Also the internal LAP deletion mutants were used to construct and express the chimeric LAP/GAL4 proteins (Fig. 4A). As shown for the internal LAP deletion mutants also, the chimeric LAP/GAL4 proteins point to a region between amino acids 22 and 104 which is important for transactivation (Fig. 4A). The gel shift experiment showed only minor differences in DNA binding between the different chimeric proteins (Fig. 4B). Interestingly a severalfold increase in activation of the GAL4 LUC reporter construct was observed when the LAP Δ105-152/GAL4 expression vector was cotransfected instead of the LAP Δ1-21/GAL4 expression vector (Fig. 4A). As both proteins have a comparable affinity in gel shift experiments toward the cognate DNA (Fig. 4B), this difference is very likely to be directly mediated by the transactivation domain of the LAP Δ105-152/GAL4 chimeric protein. These findings with the chimeric LAP/GAL4 proteins support our findings that the N-terminal 84 amino acids are responsible in mediating the effect on the expression of LAP-dependent genes. Distinct regions in the transactivation domains of transcription factors are known to mediate the activation of the dependent genes(27Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A characteristic feature of the transactivation domain of LAP is its acidic nature. It was shown for other transcription factors that acidic regions are important to interact with parts of the general RNA-polymerase machinery and to regulate gene transcription(30Lin Y-S. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 31Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Therefore we analyzed the transactivation domain of LAP between amino acids 21 and 105 for regions which could be important in mediating these protein-protein interactions. Computer-assisted prediction by Kyte and Doolittle (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) and by Deléage (33Deléage G. Tinland B. Roux B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for protein structure was performed to determine the possible regions, which could be important for the LAP transactivation domain. Two regions were found in the transactivation domain of LAP which could be interesting in mediating the activation of LAP-dependent genes (Fig. 5). The region between amino acids 38 and 63 was predicted by the algorithms to be helical, whereas the region between amino acids 85 and 95 contains several hydrophobic amino acids. From these computer-assisted predictions we wondered whether acidic amino acids in these two regions are important in mediating the activation of LAP-dependent genes. Therefore acidic amino acids in both regions were selected."
https://openalex.org/W2007346089,"We present a preliminary biochemical characterization of two simian virus 40 mutants that affect different T antigen replication functions. SV40 T antigen mutants dl1135 (Δ17-27 amino acids) and 5080 (P-L) have been studied extensively with regard to their ability to transform cells in culture and induce tumors in transgenic mice. Both mutants are defective for viral DNA replication in vivo. In order to assess in more detail the molecular basis for the in vivo replication defects of 5080 and dl1135, we expressed the mutant proteins using the baculovirus system and purified them by immunoaffinity chromatography. With each of the purified proteins, we examined some of the biochemical activities of T antigen required for replication, viz. ATPase, binding to the origin of replication (ori) and assembly on ori, DNA helicase and unwinding, and replication in in vitro assays. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the 5080 protein is defective for multiple biochemical activities including ATPase, helicase, ori-specific unwinding, and ATP-induced hexamerization. However, this mutant retains some sequence-specific DNA binding activity. In contrast, the dl1135 protein exhibited significant levels of activity in all assays, including the ability to drive SV40 DNA replication in vitro. Thus, dl1135 is one of several mutants with an altered amino-terminal domain which can replicate DNA in vitro, but not in vivo. Thus, while the 5080 mutation affects a T antigen enzymatic function directly required for viral DNA synthesis, dl1135 may alter an activity required to prepare the cell for viral replication.

Simian virus 40 (SV40) has been a useful model for the study of DNA replication and transcription as well as for better understanding the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The 708-amino-acid large tumor (T) antigen is the major regulator of productive and transforming infections(1DePamphilis M.C. Bradley M.K. Salzman N.P. The Papovaviridae. Vol. 1.

Many of the biochemical functions of T antigen have been mapped to specific domains of the polypeptide (Fig. 1)(1DePamphilis M.C. Bradley M.K. Salzman N.P. The Papovaviridae. Vol. 1.

These include: DNA binding (residues 131-259), ATPase/DNA helicase activity(302-627), and DNA polymerase α-primase binding (1-82; 260-517)(3Fanning E. Doefler W. Bohm P.

The first step in viral DNA synthesis is the sequence-specific binding of T antigen within the origin of replication. The region of the origin of replication contains three T antigen binding sites (site I, site II, and site III) in decreasing order of affinity(1DePamphilis M.C. Bradley M.K. Salzman N.P.

Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Site II, the core ori, is part of a 64-base pair sequence that is necessary and sufficient for viral DNA replication; site I and site III can stimulate viral replication(10Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B.

Biol. 1989; 9: 3593-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both site I and site II have pentameric 5′-GAGGC-3′ sequences, but in different arrangements. Additionally, site II has two other regions, a 15-base pair inverted repeat on the early side and a 17-base pair A/T-rich region on the late side, which are involved in ori melting and untwisting of the DNA helix, respectively(12Parsons R.

A monomer of T antigen can bind to one pentameric sequence in the absence of ATP, but ATP not only increases T antigen binding severalfold but it also induces a conformational change in T antigen such that 12 monomers of T antigen become organized into a two-lobed structure spanning the entire core ori(10Borowiec J.A.

The ability of T antigen to bind to and melt site II is regulated by phosphorylation (19-21). An intact zinc finger region, which maps between amino acid residues 302 and 320, is required for hexamer assembly on the origin and for melting of the origin DNA(22Loeber G. Stenger J.E. Ray S. Parsons R.E. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presynthesis complex consists of T antigen assembled as a double hexamer in the presence of ATP onto a site II duplex subsequently bound by replication protein A (RP-A), a mammalian single-stranded DNA binding protein(7Fanning E.

The mutant 5080 carries an amino acid substitution of P584L located within a stretch of hydrophobic residues near the carboxyl-terminal boundary of the ATPase/p53 binding domain.

The dl1135 mutant carries an in-frame deletion that results in the expression of a T antigen missing amino acids 17-27(29Pipas J.M. Peden K.W.C. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This mutant was of interest since it had been reported to be defective for both ATPase and sequence-specific DNA binding, activities thought not to require the amino-terminal domain(37Clark R. Peden K. Pipas J.M. Nathans D. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additionally, dl1135 is defective for transformation of some cell types although it retains the ability to complex with pRb and p53. The mutation appears to abolish a third transforming activity of T antigen that can functionally replace the adenovirus E1A 300K binding function (38). To investigate in more detail the molecular basis for the in vivo replication defects of 5080 and dl1135, we expressed both of the mutant proteins using the baculovirus system and purified them by immunoaffinity chromatography(39Lanford R.E.

Virology. 1988; 167: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Both wild-type (wt) and mutant T antigens were expressed in BTI-TN-5B1-4 (“High 5”) insect cells (Invitrogen). The T antigen mutants dl1135, which has a deletion of amino acids 17-27, and 5080 which has an amino acid substitution of P584L have been described(28Peden K.W.C. Srinivasan A. Farber J.M. Pipas J.M.

The plasmids pdl1135 and p5080 contain the complete mutant viral genomes inserted at the BamHI site of pBR322 (28Peden K.W.C. Srinivasan A. Farber J.M. Pipas J.M.

Recombinant baculovirus containing these mutants were constructed by digesting the pdl1135 plasmid or the p5080 plasmid with BamHI and StuI and ligating the purified SV40 fragment (2657 base pairs) into the BamHI and SmaI sites of the baculoviral transfer vector pVL1393. Subsequently, the recombinant transfer vectors containing the cDNAs of the mutants were made in an exchange reaction with 941T following digestion of both the wild-type and mutant constructs with EcoNI. The new recombinant transfer DNA was cotransfected with purified wild-type baculovirus DNA into insect cells followed by identification and purification of the recombinant virus by three rounds of dot-blot hybridization. High 5 insect cells were infected with the above recombinant baculoviruses, and the infected cells were lysed 36-42 h later using a buffer containing 0.2 M LiCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),1( 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolAMP-PNPadenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate.) and a protease inhibitor mixture.

A. 1985; 82: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The DNA replication products were ethanol-precipitated, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Modified McKay2( 2R. A. F. Dixon, personal communication.) assays were done with site I and site II DNAs using two different buffers and conditions: McKay buffer and conditions and replication buffer with conditions appropriate for in vitro replication(52McKay R.D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 471-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The McKay reaction buffer contained 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mM DTT, and radiolabeled DNA. T antigen was then added, and the reactions were incubated on ice for 45 min to 1 h. Two hundred microliters of a 1:1 mixture of KT3/PAb101 hybridoma supernatant was added and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The precipitated protein·DNA complex was washed three times with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The replication buffer contained 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM creatine phosphate, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, plus radiolabeled DNA. These reactions were started by first adding T antigen and then 1 mM AMP-PNP (Sigma). The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 200 μl of KT3/PAb101 (44Gurney E.G. Tamowski S. Deppert W. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53MacArthur H. Walter G. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 483-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubation for 20 min at 37°C. The protein A-Sepharose was then added and incubated for 15-20 min. The immunocomplex was washed with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M EDTA, and 10% Nonidet P-40. In both instances, the final pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10% glycerol and heated to 65°C for 2 min. The protein A-Sepharose beads were pelleted for 2 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% or 1.4% agarose gel followed by autoradiography. The procedure has been described by Loeber et al.(22Loeber G. Stenger J.E. Ray S. Parsons R.E. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T antigen was incubated at 37°C for 20-30 min in a reaction buffer consisting of 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 4 mM ATP. The protein was then cross-linked for 10-15 min at 37°C with 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Sample buffer containing 15% 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue at pH 6.8 was added, and the oligomers were analyzed on a 4-22% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel in Tris glycine buffer for 11 h at 4°C at 35 mA. The assay was performed as described by Virshup et al.(48Virshup D.M. Russo A.A. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4883-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A 67-base pair fragment containing the ori (site II) was obtained by digesting the pDV.XH plasmid with ApaLI and SnaBI, purified and radiolabeled. T antigen was added to an assay mixture containing HEPES, pH 7.8, 7 mM MgCl2, 40 mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM DTT with 4 mM AMP-PNP (Sigma), and 3 fmol (10,000-15,000 cpm/reaction) of 32P-labeled DNA fragment and the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min after which the cross-linker glutaraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.05% and the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 5 more min. The DNA·protein complexes were electrophoresed on 0.5% agarose, 2.4% acrylamide gel in 89 mM Tris borate, 2 mM EDTA (TBE) for approximately 1 h at room temperature at 200 V. The gels were dried on DE81 Whatman paper and then exposed to XAR film at −70°C with an intensifying screen. The assay buffer consisted of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, and 1.3 μM ATP including [α-32P]ATP. Each reaction mixture contained 10% glycerol. The reaction was started by the addition of T antigen and incubated at 37°C. At timed intervals, 1-8 μl of reaction mixture was pipetted into tubes containing an equal volume of 0.75 M KH2PO4, pH 3.5. Samples of 1-4 μl were subsequently spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates and developed in 0.75 M KH2PO4 at room temperature for approximately 2 h. The plates were then exposed to XAR film, and the corresponding ATP and ADP spots were cut out and quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter, or the appropriate spots were quantitated by the AMBIS radioanalytic imaging system. This assay is based upon the method of Stahl et al.(54Stahl H. Droge P. Knippers R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The annealed substrate consisting of M13mp18 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a 17-nucleotide forward-sequencing primer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was extended from the primer using Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, dGTP, and dTTP as described by Stahl et al.(54Stahl H. Droge P. Knippers R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The assay mixture consisted of 0.3 fmol of annealed primer, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM phosphocreatine, 0.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction was started with the addition of 100 to 500 ng of T antigen followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 1.5% SDS, 0.2 M EDTA. Subsequently, 5 μl of sample buffer was added to each reaction, and the reactions were electrophoresed on a 12% acrylamide gel in TBE buffer for 2 h at 200 V. The unwinding assays were performed as described by Virshup et al.(55Virshup D.M. Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3891-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The plasmid pUC.HSO, containing the minimal origin of replication, was linearized with HindIII, labeled using the Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP, and digested with BamHI and HinfI. This results in two labeled fragments, an ori+ and an ori- fragment. The ori- fragment served as an internal control for the unwinding reactions. T antigen was incubated with 0.5 fmol of labeled substrate DNA in a buffer containing 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 7 mM MgCl2, 4 mM ATP, 40 mM creatine phosphate, and single-stranded DNA binding protein (United States Biochemical Corp.). The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then stopped with 0.5% SDS, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, and proteinase K (10 mg/ml). The incubation was continued for 1 h at 37°C. DNA sample buffer was then added, and the reactions were heated at 65°C for 2 min. The reactions were then analyzed on an 8% acrylamide gel, dried on DE81 Whatman paper, and autoradiographed with XAR film. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing 5080 and dl1135 were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the T antigens were subsequently immunoaffinity-purified from infected insect cells. Samples of each protein were assessed for purity and integrity by silver staining and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). The silver stain shows a predominant band of approximately 97 kDa for both mutant and wild-type T antigens. Based on a visual assessment of this gel, we estimate that 5080 and dl1135 T antigens are greater than 90% pure. Fig. 2B shows a Western blot of purified dl1135 protein, and wild-type T antigen demonstrates that the monoclonal antibodies PAb101 and KT3, which recognize epitopes within the carboxyl-terminal region of T antigen, detect both mutant and wild-type proteins. However, the dl1135 deletion results in a loss of reactivity for PAb419 and PAb108. Since both PAb419 and PAb108 recognize denaturation-resistant epitopes, it seems likely that the deletion of residues 17-27 encompasses the actual epitopes for these monoclonal antibodies. The mutant protein 5080, like wild-type T antigen, is detected by antibodies PAb101 and KT3 as well as PAb419 and PAb108 (not shown). When electrophoresed through a nondenaturing gradient gel, T antigen resolves as multiple oligomeric forms that appear as a ladder extending from the monomer to dodecamer and higher. At 37°C in the presence of ATP and magnesium, T antigen undergoes a conformational change such that the predominant species is the hexamer(15Dean F.B. Dodson M. Echols H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8981-8985Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 56Parsons R.E. Stenger J.E. Ray S. Welker R. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction can occur in the presence or absence of DNA; however, DNA cooperatively enhances protein to protein association(18Mastrangelo I.A. Hough P.V.C. Wall J.S. Dodson M. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Nature. 1989; 338: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 56Parsons R.E. Stenger J.E. Ray S. Welker R. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T antigen assembles on the origin of replication (ori) as a double hexamer in the presence of ATP and participates in localized melting of the origin(7Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 12Parsons R. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Borowiec J.A. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3149-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to see if the mutant proteins formed the normal pattern of oligomeric forms and if they formed hexamers in response to ATP. The dl1135 protein resolved into an oligomeric ladder in the absence of ATP at 4°C without cross-linker, but unlike wild-type extended only from monomer to apparently hexamer with clear resolution. Some higher oligomeric forms were present, but these appeared fainter than with the wild-type T antigen (Fig. 3). There also seems to be a non-integer band with 1135 which is not present with wild-type, which we have seen in multiple experiments and for which we cannot account. When cross-linker was added at 4°C, the oligomeric forms appeared to be indistinguishable from wild-type. With the addition of 4 mM ATP at 37°C, some of the dl1135 protein shifted to the hexameric form, although most of it appeared to be in the monomeric form, suggesting that the response was less efficient than wild-type. Most of 5080 protein seems to be a smear in the gel with a only few lower molecular weight bands migrating near the level of dimer in the wild-type lane at 4°C without cross-linker (Fig. 3). With cross-linker, the few lower molecular weight bands are no longer visible, and there appears to be more smearing toward the top of the gel, suggesting more higher oligomeric or aggregated forms. The 5080 mutant also did not show any monomer as did both the wild-type and 1135 proteins. At 37°C with cross-linker in the presence and absence of ATP, the 5080 protein did not appear to enter the gel but remained at the top of the gel, suggesting that perhaps the protein forms a greater aggregate at the higher temperature or that the smaller oligomers are unstable at the higher temperature. This property of the 5080 T antigen has been reported previously by Lin et al.(36Lin H.-J.L. Upson R.H. Simmons D.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5443-5452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined the ability of the purified mutant T antigens expressed in the baculovirus system for sequence-specific DNA binding activity using an immunoprecipitation assay. A modified McKay assay was done using plasmids containing sites I or II in either a HEPES/EDTA buffer (McKay buffer) on ice or a HEPES/MgCl2 buffer with ATP and without EDTA (replication buffer) at 37°C. The wild-type T antigen appeared to bind to site I and site II slightly better in McKay buffer (on ice) than in replication buffer at 37°C (Fig. 4). The 5080 T antigen bound to site I nearly as well as wild-type in replication buffer. In contrast, 5080 bound to site I very inefficiently in McKay buffer, although it retained some specific DNA binding activity (Fig. 4) The 1135 protein also could specifically bind to site I, but the efficiency of the binding was much less than with wild-type. The 5080 T antigen bound very inefficiently to site II under both reaction conditions (Fig. 4). Site II binding by the 1135 protein was barely detectable when assayed in McKay buffer (Fig. 4). Clark et al.(37Clark R. Peden K. Pipas J.M. Nathans D. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also reported detecting no ori binding for the 1135 protein purified from infected CV1 monkey cells in a similar immunoprecipitation DNA binding assay. However, 1135 did bind to site II in replication buffer, but, in addition, it bound two other fragments. This binding is not entirely nonspecific since the fastest migrating band of 458 base pairs was not bound by 1135. This pattern of binding was seen in several independent experiments and with different protein preparations. We next wished to determine whether dl1135 and 5080 were capable of ATP-dependent assembly on the minimal origin (site II) of SV40 DNA. The ATP-dependent assembly of T antigen on the origin as a double hexamer is required for the presynthesis complex (for a review, see Ref. 7). Virshup et al.(55Virsh"
https://openalex.org/W2093500184,"We identified two neighboring missense mutations in the chloroplast atpA gene which are responsible for the defect of ATP synthase assembly in the FUD16 mutant from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The two corresponding amino acid substitutions, Ile184→ Asn and Asn186→ Tyr, occurred at strictly conserved sites among the α and β subunits of (C)F1 complexes from bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The altered region in the α polypeptide chain is located 7 amino acids downstream of the P-loop, which forms most of the conserved nucleotide binding site. Although the resulting chloroplast mutant fails to accumulate most of the ATP synthase subunits, it displays an increased intracellular content in both the α and β subunits. We demonstrate that the two subunits do not bind to the thylakoid membranes but associate and overaccumulate in the chloroplast stroma as inclusion bodies. Increased rates of synthesis of the two subunits in the mutant point to an early interaction between the two subunits during their biogenesis.

Increased rates of synthesis of the two subunits in the mutant point to an early interaction between the two subunits during their biogenesis. The H+-ATP synthase, located on bacterial, mitochondrial, and chloroplast inner membranes, is highly conserved from procaryotes to eucaryotes (Nelson, 1992). It consists of two functionally independent components, the extrinsic soluble portion, (C)F1, which is the site of nucleotide binding and ATP catalysis, and the intrinsic membrane sector, (C)F0, which is responsible for the proton flux across the membrane. The (C)F1 sector consists of three copies each of two large subunits, α and β and single copies of three smaller subunits, γ, δ, and ∊. The crystal structure of the F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria has been recently solved at atomic resolution (Abrahams et al., 1994). Three αβ heterodimers are arranged around a central α-helix formed by the C-terminal domain of the γ subunit. The (C)F0 sector forms a pore with 1-2 copies of subunit I, 1 copy of subunits II and IV, and 10-12 copies of subunit III. In the chloroplast, both CF1 and CF0 sectors are comprised of nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded subunits. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, as in higher plants, the CF1 subunits α, β, ∊, and the CF0 subunits I, III, and IV are chloroplast-encoded while CF1 subunits γ and δ, and CF0 subunit II are nuclear-encoded (Lemaire and Wollman, 1989a; Herrmann et al., 1993). Therefore the two compartments of the cell must cooperate to regulate the proper assembly of the CF1 and CF0 complexes. Our primary interest has been to elucidate the assembly process of the chloroplast ATP synthase in C. reinhardtii by utilizing the numerous mutants available that are defective in correct ATP synthase assembly. Assembly mutants are useful for the dissection of the steps involved in the proper interaction of the nuclear and cytoplasmic derived components of the complex. The extent to which the assembly process can proceed when one of the ATP synthase subunits is not synthesized or is synthesized in an altered form can provide valuable information concerning the assembly process as well as the cellular functions which are necessary to cope with defective complex formation. In most cases of ATP synthase assembly mutants, improper assembly of the ATP synthase results in an instability of the unassembled or partially assembled complexes and a loss of subunits normally found in ATP synthase (Lemaire and Wollman, 1989b). An exception to this case is the mutant FUD16, defective in ATP synthase, which was previously characterized by Woessner et al.(1984) as bearing a chloroplast mutation, which belongs to complementation group II when compared with a series of ATP synthase mutants of chloroplast origin. In a subsequent biochemical analysis, Lemaire and Wollman (1989b) showed that the FUD16 mutant displayed improper assembly of CF1 on the thylakoid membranes together with increased intracellular levels of the α and β subunits. The complementation group II was then tentatively ascribed to the atpA locus (Lemaire and Wollman, 1989b). The FUD16 mutant has a 2-fold interest. It provides a means to further understand a process of protein assembly but it should also help to determine the outcome of overexpressed proteins in organellar compartments. Quite often the overexpression of proteins in procaryotes and eucaryotes results in the formation of substructures, termed inclusion bodies (Mitraki and King, 1989). These structures have been found in the cytosol and are composed of high molecular weight aggregates of the overexpressed protein. Whether this process occurs in organellar compartments has not been observed until now. The expression of organelle-encoded proteins is blocked or down-regulated in a number of mutants from yeast or Chlamydomonas (see reviews of Tzagoloff and Dieckmann(1990) and Rochaix(1992)). In contrast, isolation of mutants overexpressing an organelle-encoded protein is difficult to achieve. Several nuclear-encoded proteins, which are targetted to the mitochondria, have been overexpressed in yeast and in some cases displayed an increased steady-state concentration in the mitochondria but their state of assembly or self-aggregation was not characterized (van Loon et al., 1983a, 1983b). In this study we have identified the mutation in FUD16 as a 2-base pair substitution in the atpA gene coding for the α subunit, which is located immediately downstream from the conserved region involved in nucleotide-binding (Walker et al., 1982). We show that the overaccumulation of the mutated α subunit is accompanied by the formation of inclusion bodies in the chloroplast. This process requires the interaction of the mutated α subunit with the β subunit which also accumulates in the inclusion bodies. We discuss the molecular basis for the altered interactions between the two subunits. Wild-type (WT)1( 1The abbreviations used are: WTwild-typeLHClight harvesting complexTAPTris acetate-phosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) and mutant strains were grown at 300 lux (5.86 μE/m2 s PAR) in Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium. The WT strain is derived from strain 137c. The nuclear mutants F54, thm24, and ncc1 and the chloroplast mutant FUD16, have been previously described (Lemaire and Wollman, 1989b; Drapier et al., 1992). The chloroplast mutant 10-6C has been shown to bear a mutation in the rbcL gene by Dron et al.(1983). wild-type light harvesting complex Tris acetate-phosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Induction of gametes, crosses, maturation of zygotes, and dissection of tetrads were carried out according to Levine and Ebersold(1960). Chloroplast recombination tests were achieved according to Girard-Bascou(1987). The thm24.FUD16 double mutant was selected from tetrads obtained after FUD16.mt++ thm24.mt- crosses. Two clones, out of four per tetrad, were selected as double mutants based on the absence of atpB transcripts as determined by mRNA hybridization analysis. FUD16.mt++ ncc1.mt- crosses yielded two double mutant clones per tetrad. These were selected as affected in their atpA transcript accumulation upon mRNA analysis. Thylakoid membranes were isolated as described by Chua and Bennoun(1975). Protein content was analyzed after urea/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Piccioni et al.(1981). Gels were either silver-stained as in Rabilloud et al.(1988) or used for immunoblotting experiments as in de Vitry et al.(1989). Antibody labeling was detected with 125I-protein A (Amersham, France) or the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham, France). Anti-α, anti-β, and anti-γ were kindly provided by C. Lemaire (Centre de Genetique Moleculaire, Gif sur Yvette, France) and anti-CF0 subunit III by O. Vallon (Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France) and B. Lagoutte (CEN, Saclay, France). Anti-P10 was kindly provided by R. Bassi (Universita di Verona, Verona, Italy) and anti-LHC (light-harvesting complex) II was prepared in the laboratory as described in de Vitry et al.(1989). Pulse labeling experiments were carried out according to Delepelaire (1983). Cells were labeled for 5 min with 5 μCi/ml [14C]acetate (56 mCi/mM, Amersham, France) in the presence of 6.6 μg/ml cycloheximide which inhibits translation in the cytoplasm. Quantification of the 14C labeling or 125I labeling was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). 16 ´ 108 cells, resuspended in 4 ml of buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 0.3 M sucrose) were broken in a French press, directly loaded on a continuous 20-80% (w/v) sucrose gradient, containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 60 or 1 h in a Beckman SW-41 Ti rotor. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Fractions from the sucrose gradient containing the inclusion bodies were diluted four times with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 0.3 M sucrose, then incubated, at 4°C for 30 min, with either 2% Triton X-100 or 8 M urea with gentle stirring. Samples were loaded on a continuous 20-80% (w/v) sucrose gradient centrifuged at 54,000 rpm for 40 min in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor. Fractions of 300 μl were collected and analyzed on urea/SDS-acrylamide gels which were silver-stained. Chloroform-release extracts of purified thylakoid membranes were prepared and ATPase activity tested as in Piccioni et al.(1981). Sedimentation of WT CF1, prepared by the chloroform release procedure was carried out on a continuous sucrose gradient as described above. Chloroplast DNA was isolated according to Rochaix et al.(1988). For isolation of the R7 and R15 EcoRI fragments (nomenclature according to Rochaix, 1978), chloroplast DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI and subcloned in the pUC21 vector by standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989). After transformation into Escherichia coli, tetracycline-resistant colonies were hybridized against WT C. reinhardtii atpA R7 and R15 gene fragments. Plasmid DNA from the selected colonies was isolated and analyzed by DNA filter hybridization with WT fragments. Fragments were subcloned in pBSKS- (Stratagene) for DNA sequence analysis. Double-stranded plasmids were sequenced using Sequenase dideoxy nucleotide sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence from both strands was obtained and compared with the atpA sequence obtained from Leu et al.(1991) and Dron et al.(1982). Chloroplast transformation was carried out according to Kuras and Wollman(1994). Cells were grown up to 2.5 ´ 106 cells/ml in liquid TAP medium after treatment for about 6 generations (48 h) with 3-fluorodeoxyuridine. Cells were then plated on TAP medium containing 500 units/ml penicillin at a density of 108 cells/plate for transformation. Cells were bombarded with 1.2-μm tungsten particles containing appropriate DNA. Cells were then plated on TAP medium for 5 days under dim light (300 lux), then transferred to high light (4000 lux) on minimal medium for recovery of phototrophic transformants. Thin sections of intact cells were performed on samples fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxyde and embedded in Epon-Araldite resin. For the immunocytochemistry analysis, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in 4 mM potassium phosphate buffer plus 10 mM MgCl2, rinsed in the same buffer plus 0.1 M glycine and embedded in Lowicryl K4M resin. Lowicryl thin sections were labeled with antisera (1/200 dilution) as described in Vallon et al.(1985), using colloidal gold-labeled protein A to reveal binding of primary antibodies. The atpA gene is located between the atpH and rbcL genes on the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome, with the rbcL gene being transcribed in the direction opposite to atpA. The genetic lesion in FUD16 mapped next to the rbcL gene, yielding 1-2% recombinants upon crosses with the rbcL mutant 10-6C (experiments not shown). This result strongly suggested that the mutation was in atpA. A restriction map of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast DNA region containing the atpA gene is presented in Fig. 1A. Transformation rescue experiments were performed on the FUD16 mutant, with various restriction fragments from WT atpA gene region. After particle bombardment, transformants with a WT phenotype were selected by their ability to grow in phototrophic conditions. A restriction fragment containing the atpB gene was used in control transformations. As shown on Fig. 1B, all fragments which restored phototrophic growth mapped in the coding region of the atpA gene. The smallest fragment of this series was a 940-base pair EcoRI-PstI fragment which mapped within the first half of the atpA coding region. We then cloned the choroplast DNA fragments comprising the atpA gene from the FUD16 strain (see “Materials and Methods”). A comparison of the atpA gene sequences in WT (as determined by Leu et al.(1991) and Dron et al.(1982)) and FUD16 strains, revealed two base changes at positions 551 and 556 (with nucleotide number 1 being the A of the AUG start codon for atpA) in the coding region of the atpA gene (Fig. 1C). The two base changes are located 1930 and 1935 base pairs upstream from the rbcL mutation 10-6C, at the distance we expected for the 1-2% recombination frequency (Girard-Bascou et al., 1987). The observed T551A and A556T substitutions resulted in amino acid changes Ile184→ Asn and Asn186→ Tyr. We also found a few adenine additions at positions −453, −524, and −553 in the extragenic region between the atpA and rbcL genes. As mentioned above, FUD16 transformation with the EcoRI-PstI fragment, which restored only the two substituted bases from the coding region of atpA, proved sufficient to restore a WT phenotype. We thus conclude that the chloroplast mutation responsible for the FUD16 phenotype corresponds to two amino acid substitutions located within a tripeptide segment of the α polypeptide chain. Lemaire and Wollman (1989b) previously reported that the FUD16 mutant displayed an increased synthesis of the α subunit (hereafter referred to as αmut). This conclusion was drawn from a comparison of pulse-labeled FUD16 cells with a control strain which was subsequently demonstrated to bear a nuclear mutation (ncc1) altering the rates of synthesis of the α and β subunits (Drapier et al., 1992). We therefore re-examined, by [14C]acetate pulse labeling experiments, the rates of synthesis of these two subunits in exponentially growing cells of the FUD16 and WT strains. Labeled proteins (equivalent loads) from cell extracts were separated on urea/SDS-PAGE and dried gels were exposed to autoradiography for 1-4 weeks. As shown in Fig. 2, the resulting labeling of both the αmut and β subunits was higher in the FUD16 strain as compared to that in the WT strain. Quantification of the respective labeling in the two strains by phosphoimaging showed that FUD16 displayed a 4- and 3-fold increase in the rates of synthesis for the αmut and β subunits, respectively (mean value of three distinct experiments). We detected no parallel changes in the amount of atpA and atpB transcripts in FUD16 cells compared to WT cells (results not shown). The relative amounts of αmut and β subunits, present in exponentially growing cells or purified thylakoid membranes from FUD16, were estimated by immunoblotting using specific antibodies conjugated with iodinated protein A (Fig. 3A). We used combined antisera for both the α and β subunits, which show a higher titer for antibodies against the β subunit (Lemaire and Wollman, 1989b). Therefore the α:β stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 in WT samples corresponds to a stronger labeling of the β subunit. Most strikingly, the FUD16 mutant showed an increased intracellular accumulation in both the αmut and β subunits whereas purified thylakoid membranes displayed only trace amounts of these subunits: FUD16 membranes displayed one-tenth of the αmut subunits and 1/35 of the β subunits present in WT membranes (Table I). In contrast, FUD16 intracellular contents in αmut and β subunits were, respectively, three and two times higher than that of α and β subunits in the WT. We note that these values depended on the state of the cell culture for FUD16: the content in αmut subunits increased in the late phase of growth, whereas that in β subunits decreased ().Table I:Comparative accumulation of the α and β subunits in cells and membranes preparations from WT and FUD16 strains Open table in a new tab We also examined the steady-state concentrations of the γ subunit of CF1 (Fig. 3A) and subunit III of CF0 (Fig. 3B) with specific antibodies. These two subunits remained below detection in the FUD16 samples. Thus the mutation in FUD16 strain prevents the intracellular accumulation of both CF1 and CF0. Chloroform extraction is a selective tool to extract CF1 bound to biological membranes (Beechey et al., 1975). Although the rationale for this purification procedure is poorly understood, its use with the WT of C. reinhardtii proved to be selective for both chloroplast CF1 (Piccioni et al., 1981) and mitochondrial F1 (Atteia, 1994). Although the FUD16 mutant failed to accumulate significant amounts of CF1, we applied the chloroform treatment to purified FUD16 thylakoid membranes in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of our immunological detection. We used a large amount of highly concentrated membranes purified from cultures at 2 ´ 106 cells/ml. The chloroform-release extract contained a low level of αmut and β subunits (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, the two subunits now displayed the same stochiometric ratio as in the WT extract, although the starting membranes did not (). Moreover, the chloroform-release extract from FUD16 contained detectable amounts of γ subunit (Fig. 4B). These two criteria suggested that chloroform extracted CF1-like complexes from FUD16 thylakoid membranes. Based on the respective amounts of WT and FUD16 membranes extracted with chloroform, we could estimate that assembled CF1-like complexes in FUD16 represent approximately 3% of the genuine CF1 bound to WT thylakoids. CF1 released by chloroform extraction of WT thylakoid membranes still showed some Ca2+-ATPase activity as measured by CaCl2 precipitation on native gels (Piccioni et al., 1981). Such an ATPase activity was also observed with the FUD16 sample at the same migration position as that of the WT sample (results not shown). No CaCl2 precipitate was observed in the control FUD50 strain, totally devoid of CF1 complexes (Lemaire and Wollman, 1989b), which supports the assignment of this ATPase activity to assembled CF1-like protein complexes in mutant FUD16. Because of the discrepancy between the amount of assembled CF1-like complexes bound to FUD16 thylakoid membranes, and the amount of αmut and β subunits present in total cell extracts, we expected to find either soluble αmut-β complexes with abnormal stochiometry, or at least individual αmut and β subunits in the chloroplast stroma of FUD16. Therefore we separated cellular extracts of the WT and FUD16 strains by differential centrifugation on 20-80% (w/v) sucrose gradients. We first chose a centrifugation time of 60 h which was long enough for both membrane vesicles and soluble oligomeric proteins to reach their equilibrium density. The fractions were separated by urea/SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Combined antisera against α and β subunits were used to determine their location in the gradient and antibodies against LHCII proteins were used to monitor the location of thylakoid membranes. The data presented in Fig. 5 result from phosphoimaging analysis of the antibody labeling patterns. Antibodies against γ subunit were also used to determine the possible state of assembly of the CF1 (data not shown). In the WT profile, the α and β subunits co-localized with the γ subunit, in the same fractions as the LHCII (fractions 8-11). This reflects the association of CF1 with the thylakoid membranes. CF1 subunits were also detected in a minor peak (fraction 13), slightly above the bulk of the thylakoid membranes, with an α/β subunit ratio similar to that in fractions 8-11. Fraction 13 most likely corresponds to a subset of thylakoid membranes rather than to free CF1 since (i) it displayed the same amount of LHCII relative to that of cytochrome f as in fractions 8-12 (data not shown) and (ii) chloroform-extracted CF1 from WT thylakoid membranes was not recovered at the level of fraction 13 but in fraction 10, i.e. at 40% sucrose density (results not shown). In the FUD16 profile, most of the αmut and β subunits migrated to a higher density (fractions 3-5) than that of the LHC-containing thylakoid membranes (fractions 8-11 as in WT). The αmut:β ratio in these higher density fractions was 2.3, as calculated by phosphoimaging. These fractions contained neither the γ subunit nor any other protein components (see the silver-stained gel on Fig. 6A). Some αmut and β subunits still sedimented to fractions 13-15 (Fig. 5), which corresponds to the minor α and β peak in the WT gradient. It is of note that, in spite of the higher accumulation of αmut than β subunits in FUD16, all the fractions displaying a significant content in the αmut subunit also showed the presence of β subunit. Extracts from older FUD16 cells displayed the same profile as those from younger cells, although in an αmut:β ratio of 5, instead of 2.3, in fractions 3-5 (results not shown), which was consistent with the changes in their relative accumulation described in. Thus, the experiment of Fig. 5 clearly points to the presence, in the FUD16 mutant, of a membrane-free protein complex made of αmut and β subunits. This αmut-β complex equilibrated to a 55% sucrose concentration which corresponds to a density of 1.26. Surprisingly, in a similar experiment in which the time of centrifugation was shortened to 1 h, the same distribution of the major αmut-β peak was observed, peaking at 55% sucrose concentration (result not shown). This latter observation further suggested that the αmut-β oligomer was of larger molecular mass than expected from a regular oligomeric protein complex, well above 1000 kDa. Indeed, when we diluted the αmut-β-containing fractions to a sucrose concentration lower than 0.3 M, we recovered the αmut-β oligomers in the pellet, after low speed centrifugation at 5000 ´ g for 15 min. We then attempted to disrupt the αmut-β association by various treatments. Whereas 2% Triton X-100 had no effect, incubation of αmut-β oligomers from fraction 3 with 8 M urea (see “Materials and Methods”) totally destroyed their association: when loaded on a second sucrose gradient, the subunits were recovered in the two fractions close to the top of the gradient (Fig. 6B). These observations strongly suggested that αmut-β oligomers behaved as an inclusion body, a subcellular structure observed, for example, when foreign proteins are overexpressed in E. coli (Williams et al., 1982). We looked at the ultrastructure of FUD16 cells by electron microscopy. Fig. 7 shows a thin section across a cell region where the cytosol can be distinguished from the stroma of the chloroplast by its granular and darker aspect. A striking ultrastructural characteristic of the chloroplast in FUD16 cells was the presence of a round-shaped amorphous and dark mass which is typical of an inclusion body (labeled ib on Fig. 7). It was unambiguously localized in the stroma next to the thylakoid membranes (arrows on Fig. 7) but not enclosed within a membrane vesicle. Its average diameter was 1 μm, as measured on a preparation of inclusion bodies purified from FUD16 broken cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation (experiment not shown). It was similar to that of the majority of the inclusion bodies recovered after purification (Taylor et al., 1986). An immunocytochemical characterization of the composition of these inclusion bodies was undertaken, in situ, using various antibodies conjugated with gold-labeled protein A (Fig. 8). The inclusion bodies (white arrows), but not the thylakoid membranes (black arrows), were heavily labeled with antibodies against the α or β subunits (Fig. 8, a and b). We observed no labeling of the inclusion bodies with antibodies against the γ subunit of CF1 (Fig. 8c) or against LHCII subunits (Fig. 8d). The LHCII antibody, but not the antibodies against the various ATP synthase subunits, heavily labeled the thylakoid membranes in FUD16 (black arrows). This labeling pattern of the membranes is consistent with their unaltered content in peripheral antenna proteins but with extensive deficiency in ATP synthase. That the overexpressed αmut subunit in FUD16 was found in association with the β subunit in inclusion bodies led us to suspect that an early recognition of the mutated α subunit by a neighboring β subunit may be required for its stable accumulation. In addition, this early recognition may critically depend on the respective rates of synthesis of the two subunits. Therefore we looked at the synthesis and accumulation of αmut and β subunits in nuclear contexts which markedly altered their synthesis. Two nuclear mutants were used in this study: the thm24 mutant which is unable to synthesize the β subunit, because of a destabilization of the atpB transcript, and the ncc1 mutant which shows a decrease in the rate of synthesis of the α subunit because of a decreased stability of the atpA transcript (Drapier et al., 1992). We placed the FUD16 chloroplast mutation in each of these nuclear backgrounds by selecting double mutants from FUD16.mt++ thm24.mt- or FUD16.mt++ ncc1.mt- crosses (see “Materials and Methods”). We characterized these double mutants for their rates of synthesis of the αmut and β subunits by pulse labeling (Fig. 9A) and for the extent of intracellular accumulation of the two subunits by Western blotting (Fig. 9B). The double mutant FUD16.thm24 had characteristics similar to that of the thm24 single mutant. In vivo pulse labeling of chloroplast translates showed the absence of β synthesis and no overexpression of the αmut subunit (Fig. 9A). Pulse labeling of chloroplast translates in the double mutant FUD16.ncc1 showed no differences with that in the single mutant ncc1. In each case, the rate of synthesis of the α (respectively αmut) subunit was severely decreased as indicated by its much lower labeling than that of the β subunit (Fig. 9A) at variance with the situation observed in the WT or FUD16 cells. The immunoblots on Fig. 9B show that neither the FUD16.thm24 nor the FUD16.ncc1 accumulated the αmut subunit. The FUD16.ncc1 strain thus behaves very differently from the single mutant ncc1 which accumulates α and β subunits in CF1 complexes. The trace amount of β subunit visible in whole cells of FUD16.ncc1 is similar to the phenotype of the F54 strain which totally lacks synthesis of the α subunit but accumulates small amounts of the β subunit (Drapier et al., 1992). Thus, the absence of inclusion bodies in the two double mutants suggests that their formation critically depends on the rates of association between αmut-β oligomers. In the present study we have identified the mutational event which prevents ATP synthase assembly in the chloroplast mutant FUD16 of C. reinhardtii. Two neighboring point mutations in the atpA gene result in the expression of an αmut subunit with two amino acid substitutions: the Ile184→ Leu185→ Asn186 tripeptide segment from the WT α subunit is converted into Asn184→ Leu185→ Tyr186 in the FUD16 αmut. The IXN motif found in the WT α subunit is strictly conserved among the 40 sequences of α subunits from bacterial, mitochondrial, and chloroplast (C)F1 available in the NBRF data bank. This motif is also present in β subunits from bacterial, beef heart, and yeast mitochondrial F1 and higher plants and C. reinhardtii CF1 (Walker et al., 1985). These two amino acid changes in αmut are located 7 and 9 amino acids downstream the conserved nucleotide-binding fold GXXXXGKT (Walker et al., 1982), a protein motif also present in all α and β subunits of (C)F1-ATP synthase. According to the three-dimensional structure of the F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria, which is now resolved at 2.8-Å resolution (Abrahams et al., 1994), the nucleotide-binding motif forms the “P-loop” between strand 3 and helix B in the nucleotide-binding domain of either the α or β subunit. The two amino acid substitutions in αmut are thus located next to the end of helix B, toward the periphery of the complex, and opposite the region facing the internal cavity where the helical domains of the γ subunit are located. Most strikingly, the conversion of the Ile184→ Leu185→ Asn186 tripeptide segment from the WT α subunit into Asn184→ Leu185→ Tyr186 in FUD16 results in the overproduction of the αmut subunit. The intracellular concentration of the β subunit is also increased in the mutant but to a more limited extent than that of the αmut subunit. In contrast, the other subunits of the chloroplast ATP synthase, such as the γ subunit of CF1 or subunit III of CF0, were hardly detectable in this mutant strain. The bulk of the αmut and β subunits in FUD16 copurified in membrane-free, high molecular weight aggregates which sedimented upon low speed centrifugation. These urea-sensitive aggregates had morphological features and a density of 1.26 on sucrose gradients, which are typical of previously characterized inclusion bodies from E. coli (Taylor et al., 1986). Although chloroplast chaperonins can associate with β subunits in some instances (Lubben et al., 1989; Chen and Jagendorf, 1994), we found no evidence for their presence in the inclusion bodies: silver-stained gels showed that they contained no other proteins than the αmut and β subunits. The FUD16 phenotype is thus remarkable since it demonstrates that the chloroplast compartment can accommodate inclusion bodies which, up to now, were observed only in the cytosol upon expression of abnormal proteins or overexpression of endogeneous or foreign proteins, in bacteria (Nicolas et al., 1993; Marston, 1986) or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Binder et al., 1991). It is of note that the mutation in FUD16 preserved αmut-β interactions but almost totally prevented further interactions with the γ subunit. Although the two point mutations in αmut alter amino acids located toward the periphery of CF1 complexes, as viewed from the three-dimensional structure of F1 (Abrahams et al., 1994), one could consider that these mutations should interfere with the folding of the whole P-loop region thereby preventing interaction with the γ subunit. However, the study of Smart and Selman(1993) showed that the mere absence of interactions between the γ subunit and α-β oligomers does not lead the latter to aggregate in inclusion bodies. Instead the α and β subunits were rapidly degraded in a nuclear mutant of C. reinhardtii disrupted in the atpC gene encoding the γ subunit. In a thorough survey of the various reports on inclusion body formation, Mitraki and King(1989) concluded that inclusion bodies result from the aggregation of partially folded intermediates. This view is consistent with our observation that some CF1, although in marginal amounts, were properly assembled in the FUD16 mutant and displayed some ATPase activity in nondenaturing gels. In addition, as we previously reported (Lemaire and Wollman, 1989b), the FUD16 strain displays some ATP synthase activity in vivo, as deduced from the increase in the decay rates of the flash-induced transmembrane potential upon preillumination of dark-adapted cells. This treatment is known to activate the membrane-bound ATP synthase (Joliot and Delosme, 1974). Thus the two point mutations in the FUD16 strain, instead of destroying a site required for proper folding of the α subunit, would rather alter its folding pattern during CF1 biogenesis. Newly synthesized αmut subunits still interact with β subunits and are thus protected from proteolytic degradation as demonstrated by their destruction in the FUD16.thm24 mutant in which the β subunit is not synthesized. The subsequent assembly pathway in FUD16 would drive most, but not all, of the α-β folding intermediates toward inclusion body formation rather than toward CF1 assembly. This explains why the inclusion bodies in FUD16 comprise two components, the αmut and β subunits, instead of one only as usually observed (Mitraki and King, 1989). Our study is consistent with the folding pathway recently proposed by Chen and Jagendorf(1994) based on a chaperonin-assisted in vitro system for reconstitution of α, β, and γ subunits from CF1: several α-β dimers would assemble up to an hexamer complex able to interact with the γ subunit. The FUD16 mutation would prevent formation of most of the hexamers competent for γ binding. A similar situation most likely prevails after import of the α and β subunits of F1 in the mitochondria: Ackerman and Tzagoloff(1990) showed that the proper folding pathway of α-β oligomers in the organelle requires assistance of at least two nuclear-encoded proteins which are not part of mitochondrial F1. Yeast mutants defective in either of these two proteins displayed a phenotype which strikingly resembles that of FUD16. They accumulated α-β aggregates of high molecular weight in the mitochondria. We believe that further analysis of these mutants would show genuine intramitochondrial inclusion bodies made of α-β aggregates. Five-min pulse labeling experiments showed that there was a 4-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of αmut in FUD16 as compared to that of α in the WT. As we discussed elsewhere (Kuras and Wollman 1994), these rates of synthesis do not reflect the subsequent state of accumulation of a given polypeptide and result from a combination of the rates of translation with the rates of possible co-translational or early post-translational modifications. According to the codon usage in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii (Rochaix, 1987) we could exclude that either of the 2-base pair substitutions corresponded to a conversion of a rare codon in a more frequently used codon, a situation which may have accounted for an increased rate of translation of αmut. We can also exclude an increased translation due to an increased availability in atpA transcripts since mRNA hybridization experiments showed no changes in their accumulation between the WT and FUD16 strains. We observed that the rate of synthesis of the β subunit was also increased in FUD16. It suggests that the biogenesis of the two subunits are intimately related. Aschenbrenner et al.(1993) working with mitochondrial yeast F1 had observed an increased synthesis of a mutated β subunit with a concomitant increase in synthesis of the α subunit. Other evidence for an early interaction in the synthesis of the two subunits came from our previous study of several nuclear mutants of C. reinhardtii (Drapier et al., 1992). These mutants displayed changes in the rates of α synthesis associated with changes in the rates of synthesis of the β subunit. Here, we observed that FUD16.thm24 and FUD16.ncc1 double mutants no longer displayed an increased rate of synthesis of the αmut subunit. In the two cases, the translated αmut subunits were rapidly degraded. This suggests that the increased synthesis of αmut subunit observed in the single mutant FUD16 is controlled by an early interaction with neighboring β subunits. At the moment we cannot discriminate between co-translational interactions and early post-translational interactions. The nucleotide fold of newly synthesized α or β subunits could act as a translational regulator on the atpA or atpB transcripts as recently suggested for other (di)nucleotide binding proteins (Hentze, 1994). Changes in ribosome pausing during translation, at positions where proper folding intermediates would otherwise accommodate cofactor-binding or further interactions between nascent subunits and chaperonins (Kim et al., 1991; Stollar et al., 1994), could also account for our observations. Polypeptides were separated by urea/SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, detected with antibodies against α and β subunits, and radioiodinated protein A; quantification was performed by phosphoimaging. Values in mutant FUD16 are given relative to those in WT. We thank R. Kuras for numerous suggestions in the course of this work, D. Picot for comments on the F10 structure, F. Lacqueriere and M.

INTRODUCTIONA number of proteins such as Ras protein, nuclear lamins, the g-subunits of large molecular G-proteins, various Ras-like low molecular weight G-proteins, and heat shock proteins in eukaryotic cells have been found to be modified with isoprenoids such as farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups(1Clarke S.

The prenylation is indispensable for the proteins to play the role in signal transduction, cell cycle progression, transformation, and protein transportation. Epstein et al.(8Epstein W.W. Lever D.

A. 1991; 88: 9668-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have revealed that the amount of prenylated proteins in prokaryotic cells is much lower than that in eukaryotic cells. In particular, no prenylated proteins have been detected in Escherichia coli. It is very important to see whether prokaryotic cells contain such prenylated proteins responsible for the fundamental cellular functions as found in eukaryotic cells or any other lipid-linked proteins.To investigate whether or not prokaryotic cells have proteins modified by mevalonic acid-derived materials, we previously performed metabolic labeling of extremely halophilic archaebacteria, Halobacterium halobium and Halobacterium cutirubrum, with [3H]mevalonic acid and found that mevalonic acid-derived materials were actually incorporated into a number of proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis followed by fluorography(9Sagami H. Kikuchi A. Ogura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We also pointed out that the material released by treatment of delipidated proteins with methyl iodide is neither farnesyl nor geranylgeranyl but an unknown compound that migrated on a reverse phase (C18) thin layer plate with a similar mobility to that of a prenol with a carbon chain length of C85. In this study, the released material was further purified by reverse and normal phase high performance liquid chromatographies (HPLC)1( 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography(ies)MSmass spectrometry.) and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). As a result, the released material was determined to be a diphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsR-[5-3H]Mevalonic acid (34.3 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Polyprenols (C85-C90) from Ginkgo biloba and E,E,E-geranylgeraniol (C20) were generous gifts from Kuraray Corp. Diphytanylglycerol was prepared from H. halobium cells according to the method of Minnikin et al.(10Minnikin D.E. Alshamaony L. Goodfellow M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 88: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and confirmed by MS(11Kushwaha S.C. Kramer J.K.G. Kates M. Biochim. Biophys.

All other chemicals were from commercially available sources.Release of Radioactive Materials from Delipidated ProteinsCells of H. halobium were grown as described in a previous report(9Sagami H. Kikuchi A. Ogura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 96 h with 0.15 μM [5-3H]mevalonic acid, combined with unlabeled cells (wet weight, 25 g), washed, and extracted with acetone:water (4:1), chloroform:methanol (2:1), chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3), and ethanol. The delipidated proteins were then treated with methyl iodide as described previously (9). The recovery of [3H]mevalonic acid-derived materials was maximally 40%.HPLC Purification of the Released Radioactive MaterialsThe radioactive materials released by the treatment of delipidated proteins with methyl iodide were purified by silica gel Sep-Pak chromatography (Waters) in a solvent system of methylene chloride. The radioactive materials were recovered 70% in run-through fractions. The run-through fractions were combined and concentrated to dryness with nitrogen and purified by reverse phase C18 HPLC (YMC, 250 ´ 4.6 mm) in acetone:water (30:1). The radioactive materials were further purified by silica gel HPLC (YMC, 250 ´ 4.6 mm) in a solvent system of hexane:methylene chloride (5:1) before MS analysis.MS and NMR AnalysisMS spectra were recorded on a JEOL JMS-DX300 mass spectrometer. Samples were introduced on a probe at 200°C directly into the ion source. The potential of the ionizing beam was 70 eV. NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker NMR spectrometer (1H NMR, 300 MHz). Samples were dissolved in CDCl3. Chemical shifts were given in d units relative to tetramethylsilane used as an internal standard. Splitting patterns were designated as s (singlet) and m (multiplet).Synthesis of Diphytanylglyceryl Methyl ThioetherDiphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether was synthesized according to a modified method of Kates et al.(12Kates M. Palameta B. Yengoyan L.S. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1595-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) from methyl thioglycerol and phytanyl bromide. Commercially available 1-thioglycerol (1 ml) and potassium hydroxide (0.76 g) were mixed with methyl iodide (0.72 ml) in ethanol, and the mixture was stirred at 0°C under nitrogen for 15 min. The solvent was evaporated, and the products were purified by silica gel (Merck Kieselgel 60) column chromatography in a solvent system of chloroform:methanol (20:1). The yield was 86%. Thus, obtained methyl thioglycerol was confirmed by 300 MHz 1H NMR. The methyl thioglycerol (265 mg) was mixed with phytanyl bromide (1.8 g) in dry benzene, and to the mixture was added powdered potassium hydroxide (1.3 g). The mixture was heated under reflux with magnetic stirring for 36 h, the water being removed by means of a phase-separating head. The cooled mixture was then diluted with diethyl ether and successively washed with water. The crude oil obtained after evaporation of the solvent was chromatographed on normal phase (Merck Kieselgel 60) and reverse phase (Merck LiChroprep RP-18) columns in a solvent system of hexane:methylene chloride (5:1) and acetone:water (40:1), respectively. The fractions containing diphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether were pooled, concentrated, and dried under vacuum. The yield was 26%. The dried sample was analyzed by NMR: 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) d 0.82-0.95 (30H, m, methyls), 1.00-1.43 (40H, m, methylenes), 1.45-1.69 (8H, m, methines), 2.16 (3H, s, S-methyl), 2.59-2.78 (2H, m, S-methylene), 3.45-3.63 (7H, m, O-methylenes and O-methine). Analytical TLC was carried out using reverse phase (Whatman LKC-18) and normal phase (Merck Kieselgel 60) plates. All the samples on thin layer plates were visualized with iodine vapor or by spraying 10% phosphomolybdate methanol solution and heating the plates.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo elucidate the structure of the material released by treatment of delipidated proteins with methyl iodide, we prepared a large amount of delipidated proteins from H. halobium cells and treated them with methyl iodide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The released materials actually migrated on a reverse phase thin layer plate as if they were polyprenols with a chain length longer than C20, but they moved faster than C85 polyprenols on a silica gel thin layer plate, suggesting that they are non-polar compounds. Concerning the fragments released by methyl iodide treatment of proteins modified by lipids through thioether linkages, there should be two possibilities depending on the lipid structure. One is the case of a lipid with an allylic double bond, the fragments being a mixture of primary and tertiary alcohols(13Kamiya Y. Sakurai A. Tamura S. Takahashi N. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1979; 43: 1049-1053Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The other is the case of a lipid without an allylic double bond. In this case, the fragments would be a mixture of a primary alcohol and a methyl thioether compound. The non-polar nature of the unknown material released raised the possibility that it might be a methyl thioether. The released mevalonic acid-derived materials were purified by silica gel Sep-Pak column chromatography followed by reverse phase C18 HPLC (Fig. 1). The radioactive materials were a mixture with minor components. Therefore, the fractions (fractions 31-34) corresponding to the major radioactivity peak were combined and further purified by silica gel HPLC and analyzed by MS. We assumed that the purified material is a diphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether compound on the basis of the mass spectrum, which exhibited a parent ion at m/e 682 (C44H90O2S, C20H41OCH2CH(OC20H41)CH2SCH3) and peaks at m/z 667 (M-CH3), 620 (M-CH3SCH3), 415 (M-C19H39), 384 (M-C20H41OH), 337 (M-C20H41OH-SCH3), and 278 (C20H38) (Fig. 2A). The fragmentation is well explained as shown in Fig. 3. To confirm the structure of this compound, we chemically synthesized 1-methylthio-2,3-di-O-(3′,7′,11′,15′-tetramethylhexadecyl)glycerol (diphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether) and analyzed it by HPLC, NMR, and MS. As a result, the synthetic specimen co-migrated with the unknown compound on the analytical HPLC (data not shown). In addition, the unknown compound was in good agreement with the synthetic specimen with respect to MS spectrum (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that a diphytanylglyceryl group is attached to a cysteine of protein in thioether linkage.Figure 2:Mass spectrograms of the material corresponding to the major peak in Fig. 1 (A) and authentic diphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether (B). The samples were introduced on a probe at 200°C directly into the ion source. The potential of the ion beam was 70 eV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Structure of mevalonic acid-derived materials released from delipidated proteins by treatment with methyl iodide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Judging from the structure of diphytanylglyceryl cysteinyl thioether in the lipid-bound form, the treatment with methyl iodide would give either diphytanylglycerol and diphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether, or both. Therefore, we again analyzed the radioactive materials released from delipidated proteins in details by use of authentic diphytanylglycerol(10Minnikin D.E. Alshamaony L. Goodfellow M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 88: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 11Kushwaha S.C. Kramer J.K.G. Kates M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, no detectable amount of released diphytanylglycerol was formed. Presumably, diphytanylglyceryl methyl thioether must be the only major product in the cleavage reaction of the thioether. This reaction can be rationalized as shown in Fig. 4.Figure 4:Possible mechanism for methyl iodide treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In this report, we have shown the evidence for the diphytanylglycerylation of proteins for the first time. It presents a new type of protein modification by isoprenoid-derived material. Covalent thioether modification of a cysteine residue with a diacylglyceryl group has been already identified for several proteins such as lipoproteins found in E. coli(14Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the biosynthetic pathway of diacylglycerylated proteins(15Hayashi S. Wu H.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 451-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), the glyceryl moiety in phosphatidylglycerol is transferred to the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine in Leu-X-Y-Cys sequences (X or Y indicates neutral small amino acid) following signal peptide sequences of the amino-terminal region of the precursor proteins(15Hayashi S. Wu H.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 451-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The glyceryl proteins are further modified with the acyl moieties in phospholipids. Thereafter, a prolipoprotein signal peptidase removes the signal peptide by cleavage of the diacylglyceryl precursor protein at the position between Y and diacylglyceryl-Cys, and then the free terminal NH2 group of the protein is modified with an acyl moiety in phospholipids. In this case, the modification by the diacylglyceryl group is located at the amino-terminal cysteine of proteins (Fig. 5B). Archaebacteria have unique membrane lipids(11Kushwaha S.C. Kramer J.K.G. Kates M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which are linked to phytanyl groups through ether linkages. Although there is a similarity in the chemical structure between the diacylglyceryl group in eubacteria and the diphytanylglyceryl group in archaebacteria as shown in the present study, it remains unclear whether the diphytanylglycerylation occurs on the amino terminus. Mattar et al.(16Mattar S. Scharf B. Kent S.B.H. Rodewald K. Oesterhelt D. Engelhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14939-14945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently characterized halocyanin, an archaeal blue copper protein in a haloalkaliphilic archaeron Natronobacterium phraonis. They observed a discrepancy between the molecular mass of the unmodified halocyanin polypeptide deduced on the basis of the cDNA sequence and that of the copper-free endogenous halocyanin determined by electrospray MS. To explain the discrepancy, they presumed a diphytanylglycerylation of the sulfhydryl group of the amino-terminal cysteine in addition to removal of a signal peptide and acetylation of the NH2 group of the same cysteine, although the structural elucidation has not been made. Taking all these into account, we assume that the diphytanylglycerylation occurs at the amino-terminal cysteine of proteins (Fig. 5A). In addition, it would be reasonable to propose the acetylation of the terminal amino group from mechanistic consideration of the cleavage reaction as discussed in Fig. 4. It also seems likely that archaebacteria incapable of synthesizing fatty acids (17) modify the amino terminus by acetylation instead of fatty acylation.Figure 5:Two types of covalent modification of a cysteine residue with a glyceride thioether group. A, diphytanylglycerylated proteins presented in this report are characteristic of archaebacteria (H. halobium). It is expected that the diphytanylglycerylation is located at the amino-terminal cysteine of proteins. B, diacylglycerylated proteins such as lipoprotein in E. coli are mainly found in eubacteria. Diacylglycerylation is located at the amino-terminal cysteine of proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is known that two enzymatic steps are involved in the diacylglycerylation of cysteines of proteins in eubacteria(15Hayashi S. Wu H.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 451-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). They are glycerylation and acylation, in which the lipid donors are phosphatidylglycerol and phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, or cardiolipin, respectively. By analogy, it is possible to assume the first-step transfer of the glyceryl moiety in phosphatidylglycerol onto proteins. However, it is unlikely that the second-step phytanylation of glyceryl proteins occurs as an exchange reaction of the phytanyl group between archaebacterial phospholipids and glyceryl proteins, because the ether-linked phytanyl group in phospholipids is not so reactive as the ester-linked fatty acyl group in phospholipids in eubacteria. For the diphytanylation there must be a different pathway from that for diacylglycerylation in eubacteria.Pursuing metabolic labeling of H. cutirubrum cells with [3H]mevalonic acid, Moldoveanu and Kates (18Moldoveanu N. Kates M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 960: 164-182Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have reported that the biosynthetic pathway for the major diphytanylglyceryl ether phospholipids involves their respective allylic ether-linked isoprenyl intermediates such as geranylgeranyl and phytyl intermediates, which undergo stepwise reduction to form the final saturated phytanyl ether phospholipids. Further, Poulter's group (19Zhang D.-L. Daniels L. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 1264-1265Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Chen A. Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21701-21705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has recently reported in vitro formation of digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate from glyceryl phosphate and two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate in two-step mechanisms. These results suggest that geranylgeranylation occurs on the glycerylcysteine residue of precursor proteins in archaebacteria and that the transferred digeranylgeranyl moiety is further reduced to the corresponding diphytanyl structure. The minor components shown in Fig. 1 might be derivatives from intermediate proteins modified with lipids such as the phytanylphytylglyceryl group and diphytylglyceryl group.In a previous report (9Sagami H. Kikuchi A. Ogura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) we have shown that the endogenous amount of prenylated proteins such as geranylgeranyl and farnesyl proteins of H. halobium cells was too low to detect. However, we have also reported enzymatic formation of farnesyl Ras protein from Ras precursor protein and farnesyl diphosphate by 100,000 ´ g supernatant of this bacterium(9Sagami H. Kikuchi A. Ogura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Coupled together, it is concluded that H. halobium contains at least two kinds of isoprenoid-modified proteins besides retinal-linked proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin(21Blaurock A.E. Stoeckenius W. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), diphytanylglycerylated proteins, and prenylated proteins, with the former being the major one. It is conceivable that these lipid-modified proteins, irrespective of the location of their modification, share a common requirement of anchoring an otherwise hydrophilic polypeptide to the membrane via hydrophobic lipid moieties in a structurally diverse group of proteins in order to function at the membrane/aqueous interface. Further experiments are in progress to identify the specific diphytanylglycerylated proteins and elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of the new lipoproteins in Halobacteria. INTRODUCTIONA number of proteins such as Ras protein, nuclear lamins, the g-subunits of large molecular G-proteins, various Ras-like low molecular weight G-proteins, and heat shock proteins in eukaryotic cells have been found to be modified with isoprenoids such as farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups(1Clarke S.

The prenylation is indispensable for the proteins to play the role in signal transduction, cell cycle progression, transformation, and protein transportation. Epstein et al.(8Epstein W.W. Lever D.

In particular, no prenylated proteins have been detected in Escherichia coli. It is very important to see whether prokaryotic cells contain such prenylated proteins responsible for the fundamental cellular functions as found in eukaryotic cells or any other lipid-linked proteins.To investigate whether or not prokaryotic cells have proteins modified by mevalonic acid-derived materials, we previously performed metabolic labeling of extremely halophilic archaebacteria, Halobacterium halobium and Halobacterium cutirubrum, with [3H]mevalonic acid and found that mevalonic acid-derived materials were actually incorporated into a number of proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis followed by fluorography(9Sagami H. Kikuchi A. Ogura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We also pointed out that the material released by treatment of delipidated proteins with methyl iodide is neither farnesyl nor geranylgeranyl but an unknown compound that migrated on a reverse phase (C18) thin layer plate with a similar mobility to that of a prenol with a carbon chain length of C85.

Additionally, COUP-TF I enhanced retinoic acid response element-dependent reporter gene expression in 3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that COUP-TF I can modulate transcriptional activation in these cells.

Nuclear hormone receptors, which function as ligand-dependent transcription factors, have a crucial role in establishing initial cellular diversity in the nervous system. Among the best characterized members of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors are the receptors for retinoids, thyroid hormones, steroid hormones, and glucocorticoids, whose importance during neurogenesis is well described (for review, see Beato(1989); Evans and Arriza(1989); McEwen et al.(1991); and Linney(1992)). Hormone receptors activate or repress gene transcription through binding to cis-acting hormone response elements (HRE)1( 1The abbreviations used are: HREhormone response elementCOUP-TFchick ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayRAREretinoic acid response elementbpbase pair(s)RARretinoid acid receptorRXRretinoid X receptor.) (Green and Chambon, 1988; Beato, 1989). Besides the ligand-dependent transcription factors, the hormone receptor superfamily comprises several orphan receptors for which ligands are not known (for review, see Evans(1988) and Green and Chambon(1988)). Orphan receptors, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) homologues, have been isolated from Drosophila (Mlodzik et al., 1990), sea urchin (Chan et al., 1992), zebrafish (Fjose et al., 1993), Xenopus (Matharu and Sweeney, 1992), chick (Lutz et al., 1994), and mammals (Miyajima et al., 1988; Wang et al., 1989; Richie et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1991; Ladias and Karathanasis, 1991). One possible function of COUP-TF transcription factors is to regulate the activity of ligand-activated hormone receptors through heterodimer formation or competition for specific response elements (Cooney et al., 1992, 1993; Tran et al., 1992). hormone response element chick ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay retinoic acid response element base pair(s) retinoid acid receptor retinoid X receptor. Analyses of nuclear hormone receptors in various systems clearly demonstrate that regulation of gene expression by these transcription factors depends on the presence of different ligands and also on the interactions with activators and repressors. The role of COUP-TF orphan receptors in neurogenesis is virtually unknown. In Drosophila, the expression of COUP-TF homologue seven-up is required for development of specific subset of photoreceptor neurons during eye development (Mlodzik et al., 1990). In chick (Lutz et al., 1994) and mouse (Jonk et al., 1994; Lu et al., 1994; Qiu et al., 1994), COUP-TFs are expressed in a complex spatial and temporal pattern during development of the nervous system. The central nervous system of most adult vertebrates is inhibitory to axonal growth. During development, inhibitory regions regulate the formation of neuronal pathways and connections (Tosney and Landmesser, 1984; Davies et al., 1990). Several factors responsible for neurite outgrowth inhibition have been characterized (Caroni and Schwab, 1988; Cox et al., 1990; Davies et al., 1990; Raper and Kapfhammer, 1990; Luo et al., 1993). We developed a screening system for cloning inhibitory molecules after transfection of a cDNA library into “substrate” cells, which are subsequently cocultured with neuronal cells and screened for functional expression of neurite outgrowth inhibition. This approach allows isolation of cDNAs for surface molecules, which cause direct inhibition of neurite outgrowth, as well as cDNAs for factors involved in regulating the expression of molecules, which inhibit or facilitate neurite outgrowth. This screening system enabled us to isolate a rat homologue of orphan receptor COUP-TF I, whose overexpression results in decreased contact stability between neurites and substrate cells. These data suggest the possible involvement of COUP-TF I in the regulation of neurite contacts and cell aggregation. Mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and neuroblastoma ´ glioma hybrid NG108-15 (Hamprecht, 1977) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Neuronal differentiation of NG108-15 cells was achieved by culture in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 72 h. To establish cell lines overexpressing COUP-TF I, cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen) using HindIII linkers and transfected into 3T3 cells followed by selection with G418 (600 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 14-21 days. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated (FastTrack, Invitrogen) from brains and spinal cords of embryonic day 17, postnatal day 5, and adult rats and also from chronically injured spinal cords. 24 μg of Poly(A)+ RNA from postnatal day 5, adult, and injured spinal cord (8 μg from each) was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using oligo(dT) primer with a NotI restriction site at the 5′-end (5′-CTAGATCGCGAGCGGCCGCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT) andSuperScript RNaseH-reverse transcriptase (200 units/μg of Poly(A)+ RNA, Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand synthesis reaction was labeled using [+P]dCTP (5 μCi, >3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) to facilitate tracing of the DNA. First strand cDNA was hybridized to embryonic day 17 poly(A)+ RNA (200 μg) in sealed ampules (total volume, 100 μl, buffer 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS) for 18 h at 70°C. The hybridization mix was diluted to a final molarity of 0.08 M sodium phosphate, loaded onto a DNA grade hydroxylapatite column (4 ml (volume), Bio-Rad), and washed extensively with 0.08 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Single-stranded cDNAs were eluted in 10 ml of 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer. Column fractions (0.5 ml) exhibiting radioactivity above background were pooled, and the cDNAs were concentrated by butanol extraction followed by chromatography in STE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) on a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Single-stranded cDNAs were mixed with 100 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from embryonic day 17 for the second cycle of hybridization. After the second cycle, first strand cDNAs were hybridized with 5 μg of the original Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from postnatal day 5, adult, and injured rats nervous systems, and the resulting DNA/RNA hybrids were used as template for second strand synthesis with RNaseH and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Blunt ends were created with T4 DNA polymerase, and the HindIII adapter (5′-AGCTTGGCACGAG-3′, 3′-ACCGTGCTC-5′) was ligated to the cDNA. Longer cDNAs (>700 bp) were isolated by digestion with NotI followed by size selection on a Sephacryl S 400 column (Pharmacia) and were subsequently cloned between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites of the expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen). The library was divided into 20 aliquots and used to transform E. coli DH5α cells (MAX Efficiency, Life Technologies, Inc.). Each aliquot yielded 5-8 ´ 103 colonies, which were combined and grown for large scale plasmid isolation (plasmid maxi kit, Qiagen). The cDNA expression library has 2 ´ 105 independent clones with an average insert size of 1.5 kilobases (range, 0.6-3.7 kilobases). Transfection of the cDNA library into fibroblasts was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique using 20 μg of DNA/100-mm tissue culture plates (Falcon) at a cell density of 2 ´ 106 cells per plate with an incubation time of 15-16 h. Each aliquot of the cDNA library (n = 20) was used to transfect cells in 20 plates. The cDNA library was transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. Selection of transfected cells was performed with 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 14-21 days prior to testing for neurite outgrowth inhibition. Screening for neurite outgrowth inhibition involved coculture of transfected fibroblasts with the neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15 differentiated for 72 h in serum-free culture medium prior to coculture. Differentiated NG108-15 cells rapidly established an extensive and robust network of contacts with control NIH-3T3 cells, indicating that fibroblasts provide a good substrate for contact formation. Inhibitory clones were identified as those that had fewer or no contacts with surrounding neurites. Inhibitory clones were isolated and propagated. Genomic DNA was prepared from isolated clones (TurboGen, Invitrogen) and used as a template for amplification of cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction. Primers for cDNA amplification corresponding to flanking sequences in the pRcCMV vector (5′-primer 5′-AGCTCTCTGGCTAACTAGAGAAC, 3′-primer 5′-AGCGAGCTCTAGCATTTAGGTGA) were prepared, and 35 cycles of polymerase chain reaction were performed using the following conditions: 92°C, 1.2 min; 58°C, 2 min; and 72°C, 4 min. Amplified DNAs were cloned into EcoRV site of Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene) for sequencing. Isolated cDNAs with vector (pRcCMV) sequences were subcloned into pRcCMV expression vector between HindIII and NotI sites and retested for neurite inhibition. Total RNA was isolated using acid guanidinium/phenol/chloroform extraction procedure (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). The RNA (25 μg/lane) was fractionated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham). Full-length COUP-TF I was radiolabeled (+P) using Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham) and used as a probe. The blots were washed at high stringency (0.2 ´ SSC, 65°C) and exposed to x-ray film for 3 days. Transferred RNAs were monitored by methylene blue staining of the filters before hybridization. Fibroblasts were plated in 12-well dishes at a density of 2 ´ 103 cells/well 72 h prior to coculture. Differentiated NG108-15 cells were added at a density of 2 ´ 105 cells per well. 2 h after coculture initiation, fibroblast colonies were identified, and the number of contacts between fibroblasts and NG108-15 cells were recorded at three time points: 1) starting time, t = 0; 2) 0.5 h later, t = 0.5; and 3) 2.5 h after the starting time, t = 2.5. The number of contacts was used to determine the direction and magnitude of any change in the dynamics of cell-cell interaction. Analysis of the data was performed with one-tailed t test. Cells (3 ´ 105) in 60-mm dishes were cotransfected overnight with a combination of plasmid DNA (total 15 μg) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The DNA mix consisted of expression plasmid (pRcCMV or pRc-COUP-TF I, 9 μg), CAT reporter gene construct (DR-1, β-RARE, CRBP I, 3 μg), and pRcCMV-lacZ (3 μg). The pRcCMV-lacZ construct was used to facilitate normalization of the CAT activity to transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed in triplicate. Transfection medium was replaced after 18 h with a control media or media supplemented with 10-5M retinoic acid. Cells were harvested 48 h later and processed for CAT and lacZ assays according to the methods of Sambrook et al. (1989). Protein concentration was determined with a protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples from the CAT assays were resolved by thin-layer chromatography, visualized on x-ray film, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. For construction of reporter plasmids, oligonucleotides containing corresponding HREs were synthesized, trimerized, and cloned into the EcoRV site of Bluescript II KS (Stratagene). Orientation of the oligonucleotides was determined by sequencing. The Bluescript vectors containing oligonucleotides were digested (HindIII/XbaI), and the fragments were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer, electroeluted, and ligated to the HindIII/XbaI site of pBLCAT2 (Luckow and Schütz, 1987). The following oligonucleotides, based on DR-1 (Kadowaki et al., 1992), β-RARE (Tran et al., 1992), and CRBP I (Tran et al., 1992), were synthesized: DR-1, 5′- GGCTTCAGGTCAGAGGTCAGAGA and 5′- GGTCTCTGACCTCTGACCTGAAG; β-RARE, 5′-GGTGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCA and 5′-GGTGAGTGAACTTTCGGTGAACCCTACA; and CRBP I, 5′-CCATCCAGGTCAAAAAGTCAGGA and 5′-GGTCCTGACTTTTTGACCTGGAT. The HRE sequences are underlined. These methods were performed at 4°C as previously described (Scholer et al., 1989). Briefly, the extraction buffer contained 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 450 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and bestatin (40 μg/ml). Sonicated extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min. Binding conditions for the EMSA were 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 1 mM spermidine, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 9% glycerol, 0.8 μg of poly(dI-dC), 50,000 cpm of the +P-labeled oligonucleotide, and 10 μg of cell extract. After incubation for 15 min at 25°C, DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Three different batches of extracts were used in EMSA analyses, and no batch differences were observed. Expression screening of the subtraction cDNA library was performed to isolate genes that inhibit neurite outgrowth. The cDNA library in pRcCMV expression vector was transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and, after 3 weeks of antibiotic selection, several clones that had less contacts with neurites were isolated. These clones were propagated, and the transfected cDNAs were isolated using polymerase chain reaction and retested for neurite outgrowth inhibition. Sequence analysis revealed that one cDNA is the rat homologue of human orphan receptor COUP-TF I lacking 40 amino acids of the transactivation domain localized near the amino terminus of the DNA binding domain (ΔCOUP-TF I). Full-length COUP-TF I cDNA was isolated by high stringency screening of the brain cDNA library cloned into lZAPII vector (Stratagene). The rCOUP-TF I cDNA encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 45.8 kilodaltons (Genbank accession number, U10995) and is 98% identical to the human COUP-TF I at the amino acid level with 95% identity at the nucleotide level. Expression of COUP-TF I was analyzed by Northern blot using six COUP-TF I and three pRcCMV vector-transfected clones. Vector-transfected and -untransfected fibroblasts did not express detectable levels of COUP-TF I (Fig. 1A, lanes1, 9, and 10). Three transfected clones expressed introduced COUP-TF I at high levels (Fig. 1A, lanes6, 7, and 9), two clones expressed at moderate levels (Fig. 1A, lanes3 and 5), while one clone did not express COUP-TF I at a detectable level (Fig. 1A, lane4). Since COUP-TF I can form inactive complexes with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and binds to HREs from different genes as a homodimer to repress the hormone response (Cooney et al., 1992, 1993; Tran et al., 1992), we used EMSA analysis to examine whether the overexpression of COUP-TF I in fibroblasts affects formation of HRE binding complexes. Since the effects of COUP-TF I depend on the HRE sequence, we analyzed two natural and one synthetic HRE: β-RARE, a direct repeat with a 5-bp spacer that is activated by RARα and is not inhibited by COUP-TF I (Tran et al., 1992); CRBP I-RARE, a direct repeat with a 2-bp spacer that is optimally activated by RAR∙RXR heterodimers but not by RXR homodimers (Hermann et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992); and DR-1, a direct repeat that contains a 1-bp spacer and has a high affinity for COUP-TF I (Kadowaki et al., 1992) and RXRs (Mangelsdorf et al., 1990, 1991). Our results demonstrated that the pattern of protein-DNA complexes is changed in COUP-TF I overexpressing cells compared with controls (Fig. 1B). A unique DNA-protein complex (Fig. 1B, arrow) was detected in extracts made from COUP-TF I overexpressing cells. Antibodies (developed in our laboratory) against COUP-TF I supershifted the complex (data not shown), verifying the presence of COUP-TF I in the complex. The role of COUP-TF I as an activator or inhibitor of transcription in 3T3 cells was examined by transient CAT assays using the β-RARE, CRBP I, and DR-1 oligonucleotides coupled to the TK promoter of the CAT reporter gene. Results from cotransfections of reporter constructs and pRcCMV or COUP-TF I expression vectors are shown in Fig. 1C. Cotransfection of COUP-TF I significantly induced (p < 0.05) β-RARE containing reporter construct activity (Fig. 1C). Addition of retinoic acid-induced expression (p < 0.01) of the β-RARE reporter gene construct in cells cotransfected with the pRcCMV control expression vector to levels similar (p > 0.05) to cells cotransfected with COUP-TF I in the presence or absence of retinoic acid. No significant effects of COUP-TF I or retinoic acid treatment on reporter gene expression of other constructs was detected. In these experiments, COUP-TF I functioned as a positive regulator of β-RARE-coupled reporter gene expression in 3T3 fibroblasts. The growth rate of neurites from NG108-15 cells is rapid and robust, which makes them a good model for studying cell-cell interaction and contact stability. Analyses of neurite contact stability were performed with fibroblast clones overexpressing COUP-TF I. Fibroblasts transfected with the pRcCMV vector only and naive fibroblasts were used as controls. There is a general increase in the number of contacts over the course of the experimental period. This increase was not different for naive control fibroblasts or fibroblasts transfected with the expression vector (205 ± 64% versus 160 ± 37%, respectively, p > 0.05). However, fibroblasts transfected with COUP-TF I (clones 5, 8, and 9) exhibited a significantly (p < 0.05) lower increase in contact number (51 ± 14%, 18 ± 20%, 38 ± 27%, respectively, Fig. 2) indicative of lower contact stability. While differences in level of expression of COUP-TF I were apparent in clones 5, 8, and 9 (Fig. 1A, lanes5, 7, and 9, respectively), contact stability was not dependent upon the level of expression of COUP-TF I cDNA (p > 0.05). Neuroblastoma-glioma NG108-15 cells have rapidly growing neurites with large growth cones and filopodia. After contact with control fibroblasts, growth cones maintain their form (Fig. 3, CMVpanel). In contrast, the processes of NG108-15 cells exhibit retraction or become very small after contact with COUP-TF I-expressing cells, indicative of growth cone collapse and contact instability (Fig. 3, COUPpanel). The increased number of contacts in these cultures comes from other NG108-15 cells in the vicinity of the fibroblasts. Since the differentiated NG108-15 cells observed have an equal probability to establish and maintain contacts with fibroblasts, the test determines the stability of cell-cell contact.Figure 3:Interactions of neurites with control and COUP-TF I overexpressing 3T3 fibroblasts. 2 h after the addition of NG108-15 cells (t = 0), fibroblast clones were identified and photographed at various times during the culture period (given below each panel). Fibroblasts transfected with the pRcCMV control vector (F in upperCMVpanel) provide a good substrate for support of processes from NG108-15 cells (N). The processes are robust, and contacts (arrows) are persistent during prolonged culture. In contrast, cells overexpressing COUP-TF I cDNA (F in lowerCOUPpanel) do not sustain significant attachment of processes from NG108-15 cells. During the culture period, contacts (arrows) are not maintained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily interact in a complex manner and stimulate or repress gene expression, depending upon the type and number of factors present and also the context of the gene promoter (Cooney et al., 1992, 1993). We have shown that overexpression of the orphan receptor, COUP-TF I, can alter cell-cell interaction in fibroblasts and block neuronal differentiation of PCC7 cells (Neuman et al., 1995). Expression of COUP-TF I in fibroblasts is correlated with detectable alterations of normal cell behaviors, presumably associated with alteration or modification of the expression of cell surface proteins. The exact nature of this change is unknown since no differences were detected in comparisons of isolated membrane proteins from control and COUP-TF I-expressing cells, nor was there any indication of involvement of secretory factors.2( 2H. Connor, H. Nornes, and T. Neuman, unpublished data.) Discerning the mechanism by which COUP-TF I altered surface properties was further hampered due to a lack of characterization of fibroblasts with regard to members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, which are endogenously expressed and represent potential heterodimerization partners. However, data from transient CAT assays indicated that COUP-TF I induced transcriptional activity of β-RARE-coupled reporter gene constructs. Together, these data are consistent with a model in which COUP-TF I interacts with other nuclear hormone receptors, causing changes in gene expression. Several scenarios are possible, including COUP-TF I homodimers binding to retinoic acid response elements, or COUP-TF I/retinoic acid receptor heterodimer formation (Tran et al., 1992) with subsequent alteration of gene expression. Retinoic acid alters expression of genes that promote cell growth and attachment, i.e. laminin B1 (Vasios et al., 1991), and is also important in the regulation of hox genes (Linney, 1992), which have been shown to interact with promoters of cell adhesion molecules, i.e. N-CAM and cytotactin (Jones et al., 1992a, 1992b, 1993). Our data are consistent with a model in which perturbation of a variety of processes, including differentiation, aggregation, and cell-cell interaction, is regulated by expression of COUP-TF I."

We have now cloned and functionally characterized an erythroid-specific enhancer, mapped in the fetal liver as hypersensitive site B (HSSB) at 3.7 kilobases upstream from the promoter L′. Protein-DNA interactions were examined in the 200-base pair core of the site by in vivo footprinting experiments. In the fetal liver, footprints were revealed at multiple GATA and CACC/GT motifs, whose association is the hallmark of erythroid-specific regulatory sequences. Functional analysis of the HSSB element in transgenic mice revealed properties of a cell-restricted enhancer. Indeed, this element was able to activate the linked ubiquitous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in erythroid tissues. The activation was also observed in a variety of nonerythroid tissues known to synthesize GATA-binding factors. In the context of L′-PK transgenes, HSSB was not needed for an erythroid-specific activation of the L′ promoter, while it was required to stimulate the L′ promoter activity to a proper level. Finally, HSSB cannot be replaced by strong ubiquitous viral or cellular enhancers, suggesting a preferential interaction of the HSSB region with the L′ promoter. The rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene is transcribed either from promoter L in the liver or promoter L′ in erythroid cells.

Finally, HSSB cannot be replaced by strong ubiquitous viral or cellular enhancers, suggesting a preferential interaction of the HSSB region with the L′ promoter. The use of alternative promoters is a common mechanism of tissue- and development-specific gene expression. The rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene (L-PK)1( 1The abbreviations used are: L-PKL-type pyruvate kinaseHSShypersensitive sitePCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptaseDMSdimethyl sulfateCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseHSVhamster sarcoma virusntnucletotidebpbase pairkbkilobase pair.) affords a good example of such a mechanism since it encodes two tissue-specific isoforms of a glycolytic enzyme (EC 2.7.1.40), transcribed from two alternative promoters, located 500 bp apart. These two promoters direct the transcription of erythroid- (L′) and liver-specific (L) mRNAs, which differ only by their first exon(1Kahn A. Marie J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Noguchi T. Yamada K. Inoue H. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14366-14371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the L promoter is also active in two other gluconeogenic tissues, i.e. the small intestine and proximal tubules of the kidney(3Cartier N. Miquerol L. Tulliez M. Lepetit N. Levrat F. Grimber G. Briand P. Kahn A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1413-1422PubMed Google Scholar). The L′ promoter is strictly specific to erythroid cells. It is active in the fetal liver during its period of hematopoietic activity and in the adult bone marrow and spleen, which is an erythropoietic organ in rodents. In the liver, the amount of L′-mRNA decreases a few days after birth, when erythropoiesis stops in this organ. Sequences involved in the tissue-specific expression from the erythroid L′ promoter have been characterized either in vitro(4Lacronique V. Boquet D. Lopez S. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5669-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or in transient transfection assays(5Max-Audit I. Eleouet J.-F. Romeo P-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5431-5437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Footprinting experiments and site-directed mutagenesis of a 300-bp proximal L′ promoter fragment have revealed that the promoter requires a cluster of binding sites for the hematopoietic restricted protein GATA-1- and CACC/GT-binding factors (4, 5). In vivo, this region corresponds to a strong DNase I hypersensitive site (HSSA) detected in the fetal liver (6Boquet D. Vaulont S. Tremp G. Ripoche A.M. Deagelen D. Jami J. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Transcriptional activity of transgenes carrying this L′ promoter plus 2.7 kb of 5′-flanking sequence, although specific to erythropoietic tissues such as fetal liver, spleen, and bone marrow, was low in all transgenic lines as compared to that of the endogenous gene(7Tremp G.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the transgenic constructs used in these experiments were lacking an essential positive control element. Since a second DNase I erythroid-specific hypersensitive region (HSSB), previously identified far upstream from the gene, was lacking in all of these microinjected constructs(6Boquet D. Vaulont S.

Filters were hybridized at 65°C in the following mix: 3 l SSC, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, 1% (w/v) glycine, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) Ficoll, 0.2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, supplemented with 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and washed in 2 ´ SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The probe was prepared and radiolabeled by PCR (8). Restriction mapping, combined with oligonucleotide hybridization, revealed that one genomic clone (l) contained the L′ promoter and more than 15 kb of 5′-flanking sequences. A 4.5-kb BamHI restriction fragment was subsequently subcloned into pEMBL18+. The 5′ end of this fragment (spanning from nt −5231 to −2721) was then sequenced on both strands by primer walking using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method with the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Nuclei were isolated from 17-day-old rat liver fetuses and digested by increasing amounts of DNase I as previously described(6Boquet D. Vaulont S. Tremp G. Ripoche A.M. Deagelen D. Jami J. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DNA samples were purified, digested by BamHI, and analyzed on a Southern blot by hybridization with a probe located either 5′ (nt −5231 to −4850; probe A) or 3′ (nt −3197 to −2721; probe B) of the HSSB site, labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. A pEMBL8+ plasmid containing the entire rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene plus 2.7 and 1.4 kb of the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, respectively, was used to achieve two types of constructs(6Boquet D.

First, the PK minigene was created by excision of 4.7 kb between the first and ninth intron of the pyruvate kinase gene by BglII digestion and religation. The second type of constructs corresponded to three PK-Tag chimeric genes: (i) a PK-Tag hybrid gene containing 2.7 kb of 5′-regulatory sequences of the PK gene, controlling the expression of large T and little t SV40 antigens, whose expression in transgenic mice has been previously reported(3Cartier N. Miquerol L. Tulliez M. Lepetit N. Levrat F. Grimber G. Briand P. Kahn A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1413-1422PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) enh SV40-PK-Tag, a hybrid gene containing the 72-bp repeats of enhancer SV40 spanning positions 95-270, inserted into the ClaI site(−532) of the PK-Tag construct; (iii) enh H-PK-Tag, a hybrid gene containing the H enhancer of the human aldolase A gene, extending from nt +2610 to +3100 of the published sequence (9Concordet J.P. Maire P. Kahn A. Deagelen D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the ClaI site(−532) of the PK-Tag construct. The erythroid-specific DNase I hypersensitive site HSSB was contained in a 4.5-kb BamHI fragment of the genomic clone l3, and subcloned into pEMBL18+. The resulting plasmid named HSSB-pEMBL18+ was taken as the source for two constructs. HSSB-PK minigene was constructed by inserting a KpnI fragment spanning from nt −989 to +9455 of the PK minigene into the KpnI site of HSSB-pEMBL18+; it contained 5225 bp of 5′-flanking region. HSSB-tk-CAT was obtained by insertion of a BamHI-EcoRI fragment spanning from nt −5230 to −3197, upstream of the CAT gene in pBLCAT2, which contains the thymidine kinase promoter (nt −105 to +51) and the SV40 early polyadenylation signal(10Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was digested with HindIII and ScaI for the HSSB-PK minigene, HindIII and ClaI for HSSB-tk-CAT, XbaI and ClaI for tk-CAT, and EcoRI and PvuI for enh SV40-PK-Tag and enh H-PK-Tag. The different inserts excised from the plasmids were purified on Elutip-d columns (according to the instructions of the supplier Schleicher & Schuell) and microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs by the method reported by Tremp et al.(7Tremp G.

Transgenic mice were detected by Southern blot analysis of 5 μg of DNA isolated from 2-week-old mouse tail biopsies, using appropriate restriction enzymes and probes. Transgene copy number was determined by scanning autoradiograms with a Shimatzu densitometer with determined amounts of the injected DNA as standard. Positive founders F0 mice were outbred to establish transgenic lines. All subsequent studies were performed on F1 mice and 12-18-day-old fetuses. Total RNA was prepared from various tissues by the guanidium thiocyanate procedure(11Chirgwin J.M. Przybuyla A.Z. MacDonald R.Y. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed as described by Miquerol et al.(12Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N. Tulliez M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8944-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of synthetic oligonucleotides used in PCR amplification experiments is: 5′-CACGCTTTGGAAGCATG-3′, which is complementary to a segment of the erythroid-specific first exon; 5′-CACATCATCTGCCCAGATGG-3′, complementary to a segment of exon 10. Oligonucleotides specific to the rat β-actin gene were used as internal amplification standard. They allow for the amplification of both rat and mouse β-actin mRNAs(12Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N. Tulliez M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8944-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification products were run through 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with radiolabeled specific oligonucleotides. The template used for S1 nuclease protection assays was a 1944-bp KpnI-BglII fragment (nt −989 to +955, subcloned into M13mp18) encompassing the two promoters. To map the start sites of transcription of L′ transcripts, an antisense single-stranded probe was synthesized by extension of a specific oligonucleotide complementary to nt +164 to +181, located in the first intron; the probe was excised by digestion with StyI(−160). To map the start sites of transcription of L transcripts, extension was made with a specific oligonucleotide complementary to nt +546 to +563. Located in the first intron downstream of the exon L, the probe was excised by digestion with NheI (+378). Both antisense probes were labeled by extension of the primers in the presence of two [α-32P]dNTPs adjacent to the 3′ end of the oligonucleotides and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (quasi-end labeling, previously reported in Tremp et al.(7Tremp G.

Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and CAT activity was assayed according to the standard methods(14Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Specific activities were expressed as counts/min of reaction and per mg of protein. 17-day-old rat fetal liver and adult brain were treated by DMS, and genomic DNA was purified as described previously(4Lacronique V. Boquet D. Lopez S. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5669-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Isolated nuclei were treated by DNase I as in standard DNase I hypersensitivity experiments(6Boquet D. Vaulont S. Tremp G. Ripoche A.M. Deagelen D. Jami J. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Eur. J.

Genomic DNA sequencing by ligation-mediated PCR method was performed according to Mueller and Wold(15Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Two sets of primers were used to obtain sequence information on both strands of the HSSB site. They were used for the Sequenase extension reaction (primer 1), the PCR amplification reaction (primer 2), and the labeling reaction (primers 3 and 4). The primer set for the upper strand analysis was as follows: V1 −3520 to −3540: TAGCAGGCAAGTGCAGCTGTG; V2 −3527 to −3549: CAAGTGCAGCTGTGCTCTAGGCG; V3 −3541 to −3562: CTCTAGGCGGGAGGACACAGCC; V4 −3610 to −3630: AGAGAGCCGCGGCGGTCGGGC. The primer set for the lower strand analysis was as follows: V1R −3828 to −3809: GGCAGCAGAGTGCAACGTGC; V2R −3824 to −3802: GCAGAGTGCAACGTGCAGTTCGC; V3R −3817 to −3793: CAACGTGCAGTTCGCGTGCTACGGG; V4R −3735 to −3712: GATCATAGCACTCCGCGCAACCCC. In order to characterize the erythroid-specific HSSB element, we isolated from a rat DNA genomic library a 20-kb clone (clone l3) containing the 5′ distal region of the L-PK gene (Fig. 1A). This clone overlapped at its 3′ end with our previous L-PK genomic clone and contained 15 kb of additional 5′-flanking sequence. A subsequent 4.5-kb BamHI restriction fragment was used to generate new probes (probes A and B) to accurately localize the previously described HSSB element (Fig. 1B). DNA purified from DNase I-treated nuclei of 17-day-old rat fetal livers, used as source of erythroid cells, was digested with BamHI, and the fragments were electrophoresed in agarose before Southern blotting and hybridization with either probe A or probe B, as shown in Fig. 1B. These experiments showed cleavage of the 4.5-kb genomic BamHI fragment to give diffuse bands at about 1.5 and 3 kb with the probe A and the probe B, respectively. These results, in good agreement with the previous data (6), have allowed us to delineate the hypersensitive site to a 200-bp region, extending from nt −3800 to −3600 upstream of the erythroid-specific cap site. Other experiments have failed to detect HSSB in rat adult liver and brain tissues (not shown). The complete sequence of the 200-bp core of HSSB is presented in Fig. 2. The array of nuclear factors binding to the 200-bp core of the HSSB region was determined by in vivo footprinting analyses. To gain maximal information about protein-DNA interactions, we performed the in vivo analysis with two specific DNA cleavage methods: the DMS procedure, allowing for the identification of the nucleotides involved in protein-DNA contacts, and the DNase I procedure, as a complementary approach for the detection of protein occupancy on binding sites. Footprinting results are illustrated in Fig. 3. In vivo footprinting analysis showed interactions with nuclear proteins in erythroid cells, scattered all over the hypersensitive region. These interactions being more obvious on the upper strand than on the lower one, we present here data that concern only the upper strand. The in vivo interactions revealed by DMS reactivity consisted of hypersensitive residues rather than protected residues and were very weak compared with those obtained with in vivo DNase I cleavage. In vivo protein occupancy within the HSSB region is summarized in Fig. 2. DNase I in vivo footprinting analysis of the 200-bp core region revealed protein occupancy of seven boxes, numbered I-VII in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:. Boxes II, IV, and V encompass several putative binding motifs for the erythroid nuclear factor GATA-1 (for review, see Ref. 16); two of them conforming the consensus sequence WGATAR and the others being significantly different from this motif (see Fig. 2). Boxes I and III consist of two putative CACC/GT motifs. These motifs have been characterized as binding sites for either ubiquitous factors Sp1 (17Gidoni D. Kadonaga J.T. Barrera-Saldana H. Takahashi K. Chambon P. Tjian R. Science. 1985; 230: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and TEF2 (18Jarman A.P. Wood W.G. Sharpe J.A. Gourdon G. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the erythroid-specific EKLF (19Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and CACD (20Hartzog G. Myers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proteins. Box VI corresponds to a GC-rich sequence, similar to the binding site for proteins of the Sp1 family. Finally, the sequence of the box VII does not give any clue on the nature of the cognate binding factor. Furthermore, a close examination of the 200-bp core fragment reveals additional elements related to GATA (nt −3653) and CACC/GT (nt −3576), but these motifs are not protected in the in vivo DNase I footprinting experiments (Fig. 2). Box I contains, in addition to the CACC/GT motif, a poly(pu) region homologous to the AGGAGGA sequence present in the promoter and enhancer of the chicken β-globin gene(21Gallarda J.L. Foley K.P. Yang Z. Engel J.D. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1845-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and in the human Ag-globin gene 3′ enhancer(22Purucker M. Bodine D. Lin H. McDonagh K. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The AGGAGGA motif has been reported to interact with an erythroid-specific factor NF-E4, expressed during the late stages of definitive erythropoiesis(23Yang Z. Engel J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10079-10087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fetal liver protection pattern differs from the ones observed in the brain (Fig. 3) and the adult liver (not shown), in which the erythroid L′ promoter is inactive. Nevertheless, some footprints can be observed in these two nonexpressing tissues, as already reported for the upstream enhancer 5′ HS-2 of the human β-globin genes cluster in nonerythroid cells(24Reddy P.M.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C-K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8287-8295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the in vivo role of the HSSB region, we first established two series of transgenic mouse lines. Both series contained a minigene construct either with 2.7 kb (PK minigene) or 5.2 kb (HSSB-PK minigene) of 5′-flanking sequence, respectively. Transgenic founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis, and the number of integrated copies was estimated for each line. Fig. 4 presents all of the different PK transgenic lines analyzed, generally two lines for each constuct. All carried multiple intact copies, ranging from 2 to 50. Expression analysis was performed on F1 and F2 heterozygotes. The accumulation of the L′-PK transcripts from the transgenes was examined in various tissues by RT-PCR and compared to that of the rat endogenous gene expression (Fig. 5). In the PK minigene line B49 harboring 2.7 kb of 5′-flanking region, the transgenic L′ promoter was found to be active in erythropoietic tissues, i.e. the fetal liver, spleen and bone marrow of adult animals(7Tremp G. Boquet D. Ripoche A.M. Cognet M. Lone Y.C. Jami J. Kahn A. Deagelen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19904-19910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As it was observed for the endogenous gene in rat, this expression was undetectable in liver of newborn animals, reflecting the perinatal disappearance of erythroid cells from the liver (not shown). Transgenic L′-PK transcripts were also detected in various fetal tissues, probably due to the presence of circulating erythroblasts. This was also observed for the rat endogenous L′-PK transcripts. The analysis of the HSSB-PK minigene line 10 showed an expected developmental expression appropriately distributed in the different tissues. Thus, the tissue specificity was not modified by the presence or the absence of the erythroid-specific HSSB element. We have already reported that the level of expression of L-PK transgenes was in good correlation with the number of integrated copies and seemed to be independent of the integration site(3Cartier N. Miquerol L. Tulliez M. Lepetit N. Levrat F. Grimber G. Briand P. Kahn A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1413-1422PubMed Google Scholar, 6Boquet D. Vaulont S. Tremp G. Ripoche A.M. Deagelen D. Jami J. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Tremp G. Boquet D. Ripoche A.M. Cognet M. Lone Y.C. Jami J. Kahn A. Deagelen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19904-19910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with results shown in Fig. 6. Indeed, the abundance of both L- and L′-specific RNA precursors, quantified by S1 nuclease protection assays in fetal liver of 16-day-old transgenic mice, was higher in line 10 (five copies; Fig. 6A, lane 4) than in line 3 (two copies; Fig. 6A, lane 7), and the abundance of L transcripts was higher in line B49 (50 copies; Fig. 6B, lane 8) than in lines 10 and 3 (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 7). In contrast, the accumulation of L′ transcripts, appreciated by both RT-PCR (Fig. 5) and S1 nuclease protection assays (Fig. 6A), was roughly similar in line B49 devoid of the HSSB region (Fig. 6A, lane 8) and in line 10 (Fig. 6A, lane 4), while the number of integrated copies was 50 for the first line versus 5 for the latter one. These results suggest that the fragment encompassing HSSB could stimulate activity of the erythroid-specific promoter approximately 10-fold. This 10-fold stimulation is consistent with the previous report that transcription from the L′ promoter in line B49 harboring a transgene devoid of HSSB was approximately 5% of that from the endogenous L′ promoter(6Boquet D. Vaulont S. Tremp G. Ripoche A.M. Deagelen D. Jami J. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Since the L′ promoter is erythroid-specific by itself, we wondered whether the HSSB region could be replaced by viral or cellular strong ubiquitous enhancers. To answer this question, we used a different set of transgenic lines (PK-Tag) developed in our laboratory for the purpose of a targeted oncogenesis program(3Cartier N. Miquerol L. Tulliez M. Lepetit N. Levrat F. Grimber G. Briand P. Kahn A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1413-1422PubMed Google Scholar, 12Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N. Tulliez M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8944-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 4, these constructs were directed either by the 2.7 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence (PK-Tag), the 72 bp repeats of the SV40 enhancer (enh SV40-PK-Tag), or the enhancer H of the human aldolase A gene (enh H-PK-Tag)(9Concordet J.P. Maire P. Kahn A. Deagelen D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both enhancers were located 0.5 kb upstream of the L′ cap site. We compared three lines of transgenic mice, each of them harboring about five copies of the transgene. Tissue-specific patterns of expression of these three chimeric constructs were roughly similar (3).2( 2L. Miquerol et al., unpublished data.) As exemplified in Fig. 6A, both H and SV40 enhancers stimulated the activity of the L′ promoter (compare lanes 10 and 11 to lane 9), but relatively inefficiently compared with the DNA fragment encompassing HSSB and present in the transgene of line 10 (lane 4), while the number of integrated copies was identical. These results provide some evidence that maximal expression from the L′ promoter requires erythroid-specific elements shared by both promoter and HSSB regions. It should be noted that the level of RNA precursors transcribed from the liver-specific L promoter did not vary in transgenic lines harboring about five copies of a transgene encompassing (HSSB-PK minigene) or not (PK-Tag) the HSSB region (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 9). This result indicates that the expression from the L promoter is independent of the presence of HSSB in hepatocytes. In contrast, the abundance of L-specific transcripts dramatically decreased in the lines harboring either the enhancer H or the SV40 enhancer (Fig. 6B, lanes 10 and 11), compared with the control line PK-Tag (lane 9). Both enh SV40-PK-Tag and enh H-PK-Tag constructs were devoid of the DNase I liver-specific hypersensitive site 2 (HSS2, see Fig. 1A), which is known to be needed for a maximal activity of the L promoter(13Cuif M.H. Cognet M. Boquet D. Tremp G. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that the two ubiquitous enhancers are not able to mimic the HSS2-dependent cis-activation of the L promoter in hepatocytes. In an attempt to define more precisely the tissue-specific properties of the HSSB region, we tested its ability to stimulate transcription from an heterologous promoter. Therefore, we analyzed in erythropoietic and nonerythropoietic tissues the expression of a CAT reporter gene driven by the HSV thymidine kinase promoter fused or not to a 2-kb BamHI-EcoRI restriction fragment encompassing HSSB. The levels of CAT activity were measured in various tissues for several individual mice and values are shown in. The two tk-CAT lines studied here did not express the CAT transgene at a detectable level (lines 81 and 87), and this has been confirmed in our laboratory for additional lines (not shown). Among the six HSSB-tk-CAT transgenic mouse lines established, two lines did not express the transgene, although stably inherited through the germ line (not shown). However, an important activation was clearly observed for each of the other four lines in erythroid fetal liver cells (see). This activation began before day 10 of development and remained detectable until day 17. Afterward, CAT activity decreased with the concomitant disappearance of erythropoietic cells in the developing liver (not shown). These results demonstrate that HSSB can confer, in fetal liver, an erythroid-specific expression on a minimal promoter and thus behaves as a tissue-specific enhancer. In tissues expressing the L′-pyruvate kinase isoform during the adult life, i.e. spleen, bone marrow, and blood, CAT activity was barely detectable. Unexpectedly, we noticed a significant and reproductible activation of the thymidine kinase promoter in various adult nonerythropoietic tissues, such as the thymus in lines 2, 18, and 31, the cardiac muscle in lines 2 and 31, and the brain in lines 2 and 23. Although each HSSB-tk-CAT line behaves slightly differently, the ectopic expression of the transgene was restricted to the above tissues. This result might reflect a preferential activation of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter in a set of specific cell-types. This is, however, not the case, since the tk-CAT insert was insufficient for a constitutive expre"

Przybyla A.E. Mc Donald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA slot-blots were performed using a Schleicher & Schuell Minifold II apparatus following the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA samples were mixed with 3 volumes of a denaturing solution (50% formamide, 2.2 M formaldehyde, 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM sodium acetate, 0.5 mM EDTA), heated 5 min at 65°C and diluted 2-fold in 19 ´ SSC(10Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were then applied to a nylon membrane equilibrated in 10 ´ SSC. Prehybridization (5 h at 42°C), hybridization (18 h at 42°C), and high stringency washes (15 min at 37°C, 1 h at 60°C, 1 h at 55°C) were carried out as already reported(10Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A.

Quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms was performed by laser densitometry on a PDI laser scanner. Normalization was accomplished using radiolabeled glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as reference probe. Proliferating (6H) FRTL-5 cells and KiMol cells were incubated for 2 h with [14C]acetic acid (53 mCi/mmol) or for 18 h with [3H]mevalonolactone (35 Ci/mmol). At the end of the incubation period, medium was aspirated, cells were washed with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, collected in 3 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution, and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 rpm in a Beckman J-6 centrifuge. Pellets were suspended in 1 ml of 2-propanol, sonicated at 4°C with 5 bursts of 10 s each, and recentrifuged for 15 min at 2,500 rpm (Beckman J-6 centrifuge). The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was re-extracted as above. Both extracts were combined, dried under a stream of N2, and dissolved in 0.5-1 ml of chloroform. Aliquots of 10 μl were applied to Silica Gel-60 thin-layer chromatographic plates and developed in hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (70:30:1). Each lipid fraction was located by comparison to high purity standards, scraped off the plate, and radioassayed(10Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol values were normalized to cell proteins measured on the 2-propanol insoluble pellet, dissolved in 0.1 N KOH. Nuclear extracts from TSH-challenged FRTL-5 cells or KiMol cells were prepared as described previously (19Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol.

Mutations of the CRE sequence present in the reductase promoter were created by two-step, recombinant polymerase chain reaction methods, as described previously(19Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M.

Luciferase expression vector (pRSV-Luc) was used as positive control to evaluate transfection efficiency(30de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). Normal and transformed FRTL-5 cells were grown to 50-60% confluence. Transfection was by the DEAE-dextran protocol as described previously(19Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol.

Cells were co-transfected with 20 μg of pEMBL-8-CAT under the control of wild-type or CRE-mutated 765-bp PstI fragment from HMG-CoA reductase promoter and 2 μg of pRSV-Luc/dish and then incubated 48 h before harvesting. Where indicated, forskolin (10 μM) was added to the cells during the last 6 h. CAT assays were performed as described previously(32Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad kit; recrystallized bovine serum albumin was the standard. We have compared reductase mRNA levels and the rates of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in normal cells and in KiMol cells, which express constitutively active Ras protein. In FRTL-5 cells, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels are 3-fold higher than in the virally transformed counterpart. Higher reductase message yields a higher rate of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in normal cells (the relative rates varying between 15- and 20-fold in different experiments) (Fig. 1). Under the conditions detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” when cells were exposed to [14C]acetate, the yield of [14C]cholesterol was 50,000 ± 5,000 cpm/mg of cell protein in FRTL-5 cells and 3,000 ± 300 cpm/mg of cell protein in KiMol cells. When cells were incubated with [3H]mevalonate, the yield of [3H]cholesterol was 100,000 ± 15,000 cpm/mg of cell protein in FRTL-5 cells and 20,000 ± 3,000 cpm/mg of cell protein in KiMol cells. Thus, also the rate of [3H]mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol was lower in cells expressing active Ras; this is not surprising since preliminary data show that also mevalonate kinase is down-regulated by v-K-ras (data not shown). However, the difference in the relative rates of acetate versus mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol were consistent with the magnitude of reductase down-regulation (3-fold) in cells expressing active ras. In FRTL-5 cells transformed with a Kirsten murine sarcoma virus variant producing a temperature-sensitive mutant Ras protein (Ats), the levels of reductase mRNA and enzyme activity depend upon the incubation temperature. Thus, when exposed to 39°C, the nonpermissive temperature for ras activation, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels, and [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol are comparable with those exhibited by normal FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 2). Shifting the cells to 33°C caused a time-dependent fall of both HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels and rate of cholesterol synthesis. Reduction was significant after 3 days, and maximal after 7 days (Fig. 2). HMG-CoA reductase activity was also decreased after 3 days at 33°C (data not shown). Changing temperature from 33 to 39°C resulted in recovery of the normal phenotype within 1 day only (Fig. 2), suggesting that the rate of inactivation of the mutant Ras protein is much faster than its turnover rate. Exposure of FRTL-5 cells to either 39 or 33°C had no appreciable effect on HMG-CoA reductase mRNA and activity (data not shown). Since TSH and cAMP induce HMG-CoA reductase gene expression in FRTL-5 cells, we tested whether the down-regulatory effect of active ras could be reverted by raising intracellular cAMP. In the presence of forskolin (10 μM), reductase mRNA levels in Ats cells at 33°C were increased by 2-fold (Fig. 3). Nearly identical effects were obtained by treating Ats cells exposed to 33°C with sphingosine (10 μM) (Fig. 3). The combination of forskolin and sphingosine did not cause any additive effect (Fig. 3). These observations strongly suggest that the effects of ras activation on reductase expression are mediated by cAMP depletion and protein kinase C activation. The involvement of protein kinase C was confirmed by the finding that tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (10 ng/ml) mimicked the effect of ras activation in Ats cells at 39°C (Fig. 3). We have investigated cAMP-dependent DNA binding factors in nuclear extracts from KiMol cells. Fig. 4 shows retarded protein-DNA complexes formed with an oligonucleotide containing the CRE identified in the reductase promoter. The retardation pattern is identical to the one generated with FRTL-5 nuclear extracts, as we have characterized in the accompanying paper(19Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15231-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The KiMol protein-DNA complex, like the one from FRTL-5 cells, was supershifted by antibodies to CREB, whereas it was not affected by anti-ATF-2 antibodies or preimmune serum (Fig. 4). This observation indicates that CREB, as we have shown in the accompanying paper(19Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15231-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), is the nuclear trans-acting factor that binds the reductase CRE. Analysis of reductase promoter activity in normal FRTL-5 cells and in KiMol and Ats cells was approached by transfecting the different cell strains with a chimeric plasmid containing the rat HMG-CoA reductase promoter (the 765-bp PstI fragment, from −323 to +442) linked to the CAT reporter gene. Assays for CAT activity performed in these cells (Fig. 5) showed a significant reduction (3-fold) in KiMol and in Ats cells exposed to 33°C, compared with FRTL-5 cells and Ats cells exposed to 39°C. Adenylyl cyclase stimulation gained through the incubation of the cells with forskolin (10 μM) for 6 h, was able to restore HMG-CoA reductase promoter activity, in KiMol cells, to levels comparable with those observed in TSH-stimulated FRTL-5 cells, in which forskolin failed to cause further increase. In KiMol cells transfected with a chimeric construct in which the CAT reporter gene was under the control of the CRE-mutated 765-bp fragment of the reductase promoter, forskolin failed to increase CAT activity (Fig. 5). These findings strongly suggest that active Ras protein down-regulates HMG-CoA reductase expression by inhibiting cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activity, and by preventing protein kinase A-dependent CREB phosphorylation. The data presented show that expression of v-K-ras in thyroid cells decreases significantly the level of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA and quenches enzyme activity. We believe that ras-dependent repression of the reductase gene is exerted at transcriptional level for two reasons. First, in normal thyroid cells cAMP increases the rate of reductase gene transcription (10, 19); second, in this study, we show that reductase promoter activity is inhibited in cells expressing active v-K-ras, and the inhibition can be released by cAMP. These data further qualify the reductase promoter as a cAMP-dependent promoter(19Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15231-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), a finding that has not been reported so far. The cAMP signaling pathway is severely impaired in thyroid cells transformed by v-K-ras; indeed, constitutive levels of cAMP are drastically reduced in KiMol cells, in comparison with the parent FRTL-5 cells. This results from loss of TSH receptor(34Berlingieri M.T. Akamizu T. Fusco A. Grieco M. Colletta G. Cirafici A.M. Ikuyama S. Kohn L.D. Vecchio G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), reduced adenylyl cyclase(35Colletta G. Corda D. Schettini G. Cirafici A.M. Kohn L.D. Consiglio E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and increased cAMP phosphodiesterase activities2( 2S. Obici, personal communication.) in cells expressing active ras. Low cAMP levels are inhibitory for protein kinase A activity; under these conditions, the transfer of cytoplasmic protein kinase A to the nucleus is hampered(36Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Feliciello A. Cassano S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This has been shown to impair phosphorylation of trans-acting factors such as CREB and TTF-1(36Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Feliciello A. Cassano S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4853-4859Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar) which in the nonphosphorylated state fail to bind and activate their respective targets. On the contrary, high levels of cAMP and active protein kinase A inhibit ras pathway as they interfere with Raf-1 activation (38Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) interrupting the link between the oncogene product (Ras-Raf) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases cascade (39). Depletion of cAMP caused by v-K-ras in thyroid cells has also a stimulatory effect on the activity of membrane-associated protein kinase C; thus, in thyroid cells, and in other cell strains, protein kinase C activation appears to mediate the effects of ras(36Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Feliciello A. Cassano S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study are consistent with these observations, since protein kinase C stimulation in FRTL-5 cells, and in Ats cells carrying an inactive p21ras, mimics a v-K-ras like effect on reductase mRNA. In contrast, protein kinase C inhibition abolishes the effects of active ras. Regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is most complex. It is exerted at different levels and affected by different factors(1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar, 41Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Osborne T.F. Bennett M. Rhee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18973-18982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that the data presented in this study are consistent with the interpretation that down-regulation by active Ras protein is exerted largely, if not exclusively, at transcriptional level through depletion of intracellular cAMP, redistribution and augmentation of protein kinase C activity, and failure of CREB phosphorylation by inactive protein kinase A. It is also possible that, in addition, low cAMP may induce the uptake or reduce the efflux of cholesterol(10Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bifulco M. Santillo M. Tedesco I. Zarrilli R. Laezza C. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19336-19342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not know yet what is the role played by HMG-CoA reductase in ras transforming activity; therefore, the interpretation of the significance of its down-regulation remains speculative. It could be hypothesized that active ras may turn on a mechanism of negative feed-back by one of the end-products of the isoprenoid pathway. Indeed, we have found an increased level of farnesylation of p21ras in v-K-ras-transformed FRTL-5 cells in comparison with normal FRTL-5 cells.3( 3B. Perillo, I. Tedesco, C. Laezza, M. Santillo, A. Romano, S. M. Aloj, and M. Bifulco, unpublished observation.) This should be clarified when the role of isoprenoid metabolism in cell transformation by ras oncogenes will be further elucidated.
