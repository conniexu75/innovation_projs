https://openalex.org/W2019979303,"The lipids of nine different methanogenic bacterial strains are comprised of diphytanyl glycerol diethers, previously known only in extremely halophilic bacteria, as well as dibiphytanyl diglycerol tetraethers, known formerly only in the extremely thermoacidophilic bacteria Thermoplasma and Sulfolobus. Of the methanogens examined from four representative taxonomic groups, Methanobacterium and Methanospirillum contained both types of isopranyl ethers in nearly equal proportions, whereas the coccal forms, Methanosarcina and Methanococcus, possessed diphytanyl glycerol diethers, but with only a trace of or no dibiphytanyl diglycerol tetraethers. The occurrence of both types of isopranyl glycerol ethers in methanogenic bacteria supports the proposal that they have a close genealogical relationship to the extremely halophilic and thermoacidophilic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2086784184,"The fundamentally diverse vertebrate pigment cells, melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores, contain pigmentary organelles known, respectively, as melanosomes, pterinosomes, and reflecting platelets. Their pigments are mealanins pteridines, and purines. Mosaic pigment cells containing more than one type of organelle have been observed and mosaic organelles containing more than one type of pigment have been discovered. It is proposed that the various pigment cells are derived from a stem cell that contains a primordial organelle of endoplasmic reticular origin. This primordial organelle can differentiate into any of the known pigmentary organelles."

https://openalex.org/W1996612655,"When rabbits are infected with Pasteurella multocida, the concentration of iron in their plasma decreases and their rectal temperature rises. To determine whether the rise in body temperature (fever) and the fall in plasma iron may be a coordinated host defense response, Pasteurella multocida were grown in vitro at various temperatures and iron concentrations. At afebrile temperatures the bacteria grew equally well at low or high concentrations of iron. However, when the temperature of the bath was raised to a febrile temperature the growth of the bacteria was inhibited by the low, but not the high, iron concentrations. These data support the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms behind the adaptive (or beneficial) role of fever is the reduced ability of pathogenic bacteria to grow well at elevated temperatures in an iron-poor medium."

During recovery, cortical glucose utilization is still elevated, but the increased metabolic activity is distributed in columns running perpendicularly through the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1981237424,"The onset of maternal responsiveness by virgin female rats to foster pups was observed after (i) complete vomeronasal nerve cuts, (ii) partial olfactory bulb cuts, or (iii) the combined procedures. Although both vomeronasal nerve cuts and olfactory bulb cuts resulted in a more rapid onset of maternal care, relative to control animals with sham operations, animals sustaining the loss of both sources of olfactory input exhibited the shortest response latency. These findings are discussed in terms of the probable distinct functions of the two olfactory systems in the control of maternal behavior in the rat."

https://openalex.org/W2045153921,"Echolocating bats determine distance to targets by the time delay between their emitted biosonar pulses and the returning echoes. By varying the delay between synthetic pulses and echoes in stimulus pairs at various repetition rates and durations, neurons have been found in the auditory cortex of the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus) which are sensitive to target range during the search, approach, and terminal phases of prey capture or landing. Two classes of range-sensitive neurons were found: (i) tracking neurons, whose best delay for response to an echo following the emitted pulse becomes shorter and narrower as the bat closes in on the target, and (ii) range-tuned neurons, whose best delay is constant, and which respond to the target only when it is within a certain narrow fixed range. Range-tuned neurons are specialized for processing echoes only during a particular period of the search, approach, or terminal phases of echolocation, and they provide support for a theory of ranging in bats that incorporates groups of neurons with a spectrum of preferred echo delays to detect target distance."

https://openalex.org/W2058971771,"Low catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity (less than 8 units per milliliter) in the human erythrocyte is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait (COMTL). The average half-life of COMT in erythrocyte lysates incubated at 48 degrees C was significantly shorter in lysates from three subjects with low enzyme activity than in lysates from three subjects with high enzyme activity (12.5 +/- 0.9 minutes compared with 21.2 +/- 1.4 minutes, P less than .01). When the ratios of COMT activities in lysates heated at 48 degrees C for 15 minutes to enzyme activities in unheated samples were used as a measure of enzyme thermostability in blood samples from 316 randomly selected subjects, the ratios were significantly less for subjects with low enzyme activity than for subjects with higher enzyme activity. The presense of thermolabile COMT in blood of individuals homozygous for COMTL raises the possibility that the locus COMT may represent the structural gene for the human enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1525733127,"Irradiation of previously dark-grown cell suspension cultures from parsley (Petroselinum hortense Hoffm.) with ultraviolet light caused large, concomitant increases in mRNA activities for two characteristic enzymes of phenylpropanoid metabolism, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and flavanone synthase. The rates of enzyme synthesis both in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate and in vivo were quantitated by direct immunoprecipitation of the labeled enzyme subunits. Following a period of about 2 h, during which possible changes were below the limits of detectability, the two mRNA activities increased rapidly in irradiated cells for serveral hours. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase mRNA reached a peak in activity a few hours earlier than flavanone synthase mRNA. The apparent half-lives of the enzyme activities were about 7 to 10 h for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and 5 to 7 h for flavanone synthase. These data were used to calculate the expected, light-induced changes in enzyme activity from the measured changes in mRNA activity. The results for both enzymes were in agreement with experimental data, indicating that the light-induced changes in enzyme activity can be explained by changes in the respective mRNA activity. Some data concerning changes in the degree of polyadenylation of the mRNAs and the inhibitory effects of 7-methylguanosine 5'-phosphate are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1987982494,Extracts of the cerebral cortes of genetically obese (ob/ob) mice with hyperphagia contain 0.05 +/- 0.02 microgram (mean +/- standard error) of cholecystokinin octapeptide equivalent per gram of wet weight compared to 0.15 +/- 0.01 microgram per gram for their nonobese littermates and 0.20 +/- 0.01 microgram per gram for normal LAF1 mice. These findings are suggestive of a causal relation between the diminished brain immunoreactive cholecystokinin content and the unrestrained appetite of the obese mice.
https://openalex.org/W1500220303,"A clone (AE1) of cells resistant to adenosine cytotoxicity was isolated from a mutagenized population of mouse T-lymphoma (S49) cells. These adenosine-resistant cells cannot transport adenosine or any other purine or pyrimidine nucleoside tested, but their transport of purine bases is intact. The AE1 cells also have an impaired ability to salvage thymidine. Kinetic analyses of the uptake of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides further substantiate the evidence that the facilitated transport of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides in S49 cells is mediated by the same carrier. Growth rate and transport studies indicate that the lack of expression of the nucleoside transport in AE1 cells is recessive in intraspecies cell-cell hybrids."

https://openalex.org/W2087926884,"Human speech and animal sounds contain phonemes with prominent and meaningful harmonics. The biosonar signals of the mustache bat also contain up to four harmonics, and each consists of a long constant-frequency component followed by a short frequency-modulated component. Neurons have been found in a large cluster within auditory cortex of this bat whose responses are facilitated by combinations of two or more harmonically related tones. Moreover, the best frequencies for excitation of these neurons are closely associated with the constant-frequency components of the biosonar signals. The properties of these neurons make them well suited for identifying the signals produced by other echolocating mustache bats. They also show how meaningful components of sound are assembled by neural circuits in the central nervous system and suggest a method by which sounds with important harmonics (or formants) may be detected and recognized by the brain in other species, including humans."

https://openalex.org/W1985553006,"A simple avoidance training procedure during early development produces massive neural traces in visual and somatic cortices of kittens reared in a normal environment. A preponderance of cells in these areas had response preferences for the stimuli used during training. Furthermore, some of these cells exhibited properties never found in normal animals not receiving such training. It appears that, even in an environment in which many other stimuli are present, some early experiences powerfully affect brain development and the way in which other experiences exert their effect."

https://openalex.org/W1588436196,"Oligopeptides containing tyrosyl, lysyl, and alanyl residues bind to polynucleotides and nucleic acids as shown by proton magnetic resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy, and difference absorption spectroscopy. Proton magnetic resonance data indicate that stacking of tyrosyl residues with nucleic acid bases takes place only in single-stranded structures (such as poly(A) or denatured DNA). Stacking interactions lead to a quenching of tyrosine fluorescence. However, the tyrosyl fluorescence of the peptides is quenched in their complexes with both single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids. A comparison of the behavior of homologous peptides containing Tyr, methoxytyrosine, and Phe leads to the conclusion that hydrogen bonding of tyrosine with bases or phosphates is not involved in the investigated complexes. An energy transfer mechanism from tyrosine to nucleic acid bases is proposed to account for fluorescence quenching in oligopeptide complexes with double-stranded DNAs. Due to the specificity of its stacking interaction for single-stranded nucleic acid structures, tyrosine might be involved through such interactions in the selective recognition of single strands by proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053170864,"Both normal human serum and supernatant from explanted malignant tumors contained a heat-stable low-molecular-weight factor that inhibited monocyte activation in vitro. In contrast, serum from individuals with solid tumors enhanced monocyte activation. It is suggested that the systemic activation of monocytes that occurs in malignant disease may be an appropriate host response but that successful tumors may continue to grow because they subvert the normal physiological signal for inhibition of macrophage activation."
https://openalex.org/W1605233131,"Abstract Parenteral administration of [3H]heme to allylisopropylacetamide-treated rats resulted in the formation of a radiolabeled allylisopropylacetamide-porphyrin adduct in the liver, which was isolated and purified. Since formation of this adduct requires the heme moiety of a functional cytochrome P-450 species, our findings indicate that exogenously supplied heme had been incorporated into the hepatic microsomal hemoprotein. Moreover, they suggest that exogenously supplied heme readily gains access to an unassigned heme pool, which provides heme for cytochrome P-450 formation."

https://openalex.org/W2102252603,Human observers who lack stereopsis reliably make eye-of-origin discriminations for grating patterns under conditions that render the performance of normal observers unreliable. This lends support to the view that stereoblind individuals possess proportions of monocular and binocular cortical cells similar to those of cats and monkeys deprived of early binocular visual experience.

https://openalex.org/W1509217376,"A discontinuous assay to measure the proteolysis of tritiated prothrombin to fragment 1 and prethrombin 1 by thrombin has been devised, based empirically on extracting the radiolabeled fragment 1 into 4% p-toluenesulfonic acid. The assay is shown to be valid for the measurement of the initial rate of reaction in simple mixtures and has been used to determine the Michaelis-Menten parameters. The Km, 127 microgram of prothrombin per ml, and the kcat, 6.9 s(-1), indicate that, in the absence of other controls, attack of thrombin on prothrombin would be overwhelming during coagulation in plasma and that the prothrombin concentration would be rate-limiting. However, Ca2+ ions at concentrations around 1 mM reduce the rate of proteolysis by at least 20-fold. This inhibition is rapidly reversible by the addition of chelating agents. Measurement of initial rates at Ca2+ concentrations up to 1.5 mM shows that the inhibition is multisite and perhaps involves cooperative binding of the metal ions. The effect of Ca2+ on the kinetic parameters has also been investigated. kcat could not be measured because thrombin could not be saturated with prothrombin under conditions amenable to assay, but the Km is increased, showing that the inhibition by Ca2+ is at least partially competitive. An independent qualitative demonstration that Ca2+ is inhibitory in the reaction of native prothrombin with thrombin has been obtained by measurement of intrinsic fluorescence."

The proteinases were solubilized by detergent or salt treatment. Two soluble proteins that specifically inhibit these proteinases were also isolated and characterized. Both these proteins formed 1:1 complexes with the serine proteinases. A molecular weight of 10,000 was estimated for both inhibitors. They were found to be present in excess in the cells. An acid proteinase of Phycomyces was able to take the inhibitor off a serine proteinase.inhibitor complex. This proteinase was partially purified. The proteinases and inhibitors of three mutant strains were partially purified and compared with a standard strain. These mutants exhibit abnormal growth responses of the sporangiophore to light. Mutant specific changes of the proteinases and their inhibitors were detected, but a connection to the behavioral responses could not be demonstrated."

The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined in the analytical ultracentrifuge to be 250,000 to 253,000. Rabbit antiserum has been prepared against the purified heart enzyme. The antiserum is specific for the mitochondrial form of malic enzyme and cross-reacts completely with the enzyme from brain. An examination of the specific activity of the enzyme in heart and brain mitochondrial pellets of 10 inbred strains showed that all had essentially identical heart activities, whereas the brain activities fell into two distinct classes. F/sub 1/ hybrid animals between a high activity strain (C3H) and a low activity strain (C57BL/10) had an exactly intermediate level of activity. Using the antiserum, it has been shown that the tissue-specific difference in the specific activity of the enzyme in brains of C3H and C57BL/10 mice is due to the presence of more enzyme molecules in one of the strains than in the other. Genetic analysis has established that the level of expression of mitochondrial malic enzyme in brain is determined by a single locus, designated Mdr, which exists in two allelic forms.

https://openalex.org/W1604189297,"Platelet tubulin isolated by two successive cycles of polymerization-depolymerization was shown to contain protein kinase activity. The phosphorylating activity measured by incorporation of [32P]phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP was cAMP-independent and behaved with respect to substrate specificity, cation requirement, and maximum incorporation of phosphate similarly to tubulin of brain. Contrary to tubulin from that source, however, platelet tubulin itself, not one of its co-purifying proteins appeared to be the source of the protein kinase activity. This was suggested by assays of tubulin freed from its associated proteins by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and on immunosorbent columns containing monospecific antibody to human platelet tubulin. Further corroboration was obtained from experiments in which tubulin was applied to casein affinity columns. No separation of protein kinase from colchicine binding activity could be obtained. Gel filtration showed that all of the in vitro phosphorylated tubulin was aggregated. Tryptic peptide patterns of 32P-labeled alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits were analyzed by ion exchange chromatography. Multiple peptides in both tubulin subunits were identified as acceptors of [32P]phosphate. In vivo phosphorylated tubulin was demonstrated to contain an average of 5 phosphoserine residues/monomer."
