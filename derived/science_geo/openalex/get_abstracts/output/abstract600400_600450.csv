https://openalex.org/W2612467560,"We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap), whereby genes, drugs, and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io."

Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy surfaces for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create surfaces with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary surface terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain surfaces for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2773766732,"Blood DNases hack the NET Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are lattices of processed chromatin decorated with select secreted and cytoplasmic proteins that trap and neutralize microbes. However, their inappropriate release may do more harm than good by promoting inflammation and thrombosis. Jiménez-Alcázar et al. report that two deoxyribonucleases (DNases), DNASE1 and DNASE1L3, have partially redundant roles in degrading NETs in the circulation (see the Perspective by Gunzer). Knockout mice lacking these enzymes were unable to tolerate chronic neutrophilia, quickly dying after blood vessels were occluded by NET clots. Furthermore, the damage unleashed by clots during septicemia was enhanced when these DNases were absent. Science , this issue p. 1202 ; see also p. 1126"
https://openalex.org/W3099994133,"Competing inhomogeneous orders are a central feature of correlated electron materials including the high-temperature superconductors. The two- dimensional Hubbard model serves as the canonical microscopic physical model for such systems. Multiple orders have been proposed in the underdoped part of the phase diagram, which corresponds to a regime of maximum numerical difficulty. By combining the latest numerical methods in exhaustive simulations, we uncover the ordering in the underdoped ground state. We find a stripe order that has a highly compressible wavelength on an energy scale of a few Kelvin, with wavelength fluctuations coupled to pairing order. The favored filled stripe order is different from that seen in real materials. Our results demonstrate the power of modern numerical methods to solve microscopic models even in challenging settings."

In a mouse lung model of KRasG12D-driven adenomas, we find that co-activation of Myc drives the immediate transition to highly proliferative and invasive adenocarcinomas marked by highly inflammatory, angiogenic, and immune-suppressed stroma. We identify epithelial-derived signaling molecules CCL9 and IL-23 as the principal instructing signals for stromal reprogramming. CCL9 mediates recruitment of macrophages, angiogenesis, and PD-L1-dependent expulsion of T and B cells. IL-23 orchestrates exclusion of adaptive T and B cells and innate immune NK cells. Co-blockade of both CCL9 and IL-23 abrogates Myc-induced tumor progression. Subsequent deactivation of Myc in established adenocarcinomas triggers immediate reversal of all stromal changes and tumor regression, which are independent of CD4+CD8+ T cells but substantially dependent on returning NK cells. We show that Myc extensively programs an immune suppressive stroma that is obligatory for tumor progression.

The 1983 discovery of oncogenic cooperation between activated Ras and Myc (Land et al., 1983Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Tumorigenic conversion of primary embryo fibroblasts requires at least two cooperating oncogenes.Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar) demonstrated the obligate interdependence of individual oncogenic mutations. However, 30 years on, the mechanisms underlying Ras/Myc cooperation remain elusive. Early studies focused solely on Ras and Myc’s complementary cell-intrinsic outputs, such as their co-induction and/or stabilization of cell cycle proteins (Born et al., 1994Born T.L. Frost J.A.

Both Ras and Myc are implicated in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Oncogenic KRas mutations are thought to be causal drivers in ∼30% of NSCLC, especially in smokers (Rodenhuis et al., 1988Rodenhuis S. Slebos R.J. Boot A.J. Evers S.G. Mooi W.J.

Mutant KRas is principally thought to drive precocious mitogenic signaling but is also credited with reprogramming tumor cell metabolism (Kimmelman, 2015Kimmelman A.C.

Inflammation and cancer: the long reach of Ras.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 20-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)—the latter two presumably by indirect signaling, since oncogenic Ras is confined to the epithelial tumor cell compartment. Indeed, oncogenic KRas is a potent inducer of various cytokines in many tumor types, including lung, where IL-8 (CXCL8) and IL-6 both contribute to lung cancer’s signature inflammatory phenotype (Ancrile et al., 2008Ancrile B.B.

It is demonstrably overexpressed in >70% of NSCLC (Richardson and Johnson, 1993Richardson G.E. Johnson B.E. The biology of lung cancer.Semin.

Even in NSCLC not overtly driven by mutations in Ras or Myc themselves, endogenous Ras and Myc both play prominent, even obligate, roles as downstream conduits for diverse upstream oncogenic drivers. Here, we specifically explore the cooperative contribution made by Myc deregulation to the evolution and progression of KRasG12D-driven lung tumors in vivo. Using a rapidly and reversibly switchable genetic system (Murphy et al., 2008Murphy D.J. Junttila M.R. Pouyet L. Karnezis A. Shchors K. Bui D.A. Brown-Swigart L. Johnson L. Evan G.I. Distinct thresholds govern Myc’s biological output in vivo.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we define the causal sequence of events by which Myc drives conversion of indolent adenomas to aggressive, inflammatory, and immune-suppressed adenocarcinomas and by which subsequent Myc de-activation triggers tumor regression. Our data show a profound role for Myc in re-programming the tumor microenvironment—especially the inflammatory and immune components of tumor stroma. To investigate Myc cooperation with KRasG12D in vivo, we used mice heterozygous for the LSL-KRasG12D allele (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T. Tuveson D.A.

In these LSL-KRasG12D;Rosa26-lox-STOP-lox MycERT2 mice (hereafter referred to as KM), inhalation of Cre-recombinase-expressing adenovirus (AdV) triggers sporadic coincident expression in lung of oncogenic KRasG12D from its endogenous promoter and reversibly activatable 4-OHT-dependent MycERT2 driven from the constitutively active Rosa26 promoter at low, quasi-physiological levels (Murphy et al., 2008Murphy D.J.

Multiple small foci of atypical epithelial and adenomatous hyperplasia are evident by 6 weeks after AdV-Cre inhalation, progressing to indolent and non-invasive adenomas by 12–18 weeks. Aggressive and invasive adenocarcinomas emerge sporadically much later, presumably through additional oncogenic lesions. Activation of MycERT2 (for 6 weeks) in 12-week-old indolent KRasG12D-driven lesions dramatically accelerated tumorigenesis over that in KRasG12D-only controls (Figures 1A, S1A, S2A, and S2B), resulting in highly proliferative, invasive tumors heavily infiltrated with leukocytes and with inchoate, nascent vasculature indicative of ongoing angiogenesis (Figures 1B–1D). Myc activation profoundly accelerated lung tumor progression at every stage of adenoma evolution (Figures S2A and S2B), triggering a precipitous drop in survival (Figure S2C). Activation of MycERT2 in the absence of KRasG12D elicited no discernible lung phenotype (Figure S2D), while tamoxifen treatment alone had no effect on KRasG12D-only lung tumors (not shown). The aggressive phenotypes of KRasG12D tumors following MycERT2 activation were indistinguishable from those of KRasG12D tumors driven by constitutive Rosa26-driven Myc (not shown).Figure S1Schematic Representations of Animal Experiments, Related to Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7Show full caption(A) Related to Figures 1 and S2.

The lung tumors resulting from long-term combined KRasG12D and Myc activity are more advanced and aggressive than the indolent tumors driven by KRasG12D alone, being markedly more proliferative, invasive, inflammatory, and angiogenic. Such dramatic stromal changes could either be indirect, passive consequences of the disruption of normal lung architecture caused by Myc-driven tumor growth or, alternatively, direct proximal consequences of Myc activation within the adenoma epithelial compartment. Hence, to determine how Myc activation causally elicits its diverse phenotypic changes, we used the rapid, synchronous, and reversible in vivo activation possible with MycERT2 (Pelengaris et al., 2002Pelengaris S.

Key correlative science metrics emerge for an upcoming clinical trial, testing enhancement of immune checkpoint therapy for NSCLC. The development of effective therapeutic approaches for patients with lung cancer, the world’s leading cause of cancer-related death, is a critical medical need. The advent of immune checkpoint therapy has been a tremendous step forward (Borghaei et al., 2015Borghaei H. Paz-Ares L. Horn L. Spigel D.R. Steins M. Ready N.E. Chow L.Q. Vokes E.E. Felip E.

Med. 2016; 375: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (6215) Google Scholar), but only a minority of unselected patients benefit. Thus, identifying rational combinations to augment anti-tumor immunity and increase the response to immune checkpoint therapy represents a major challenge for the field. Durable responses were observed in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were initially treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) combined with intermittent histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), followed by immune checkpoint therapy (Juergens et al., 2011Juergens R.A. Wrangle J. Vendetti F.P. Murphy S.C. Zhao M. Coleman B. Sebree R. Rodgers K. Hooker C.M. Franco N. et al.Combination epigenetic therapy has efficacy in patients with refractory advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Cancer Discov. 2011; 1: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Combination epigenetic therapy regimens most commonly utilize DNMTis in combination with HDACis on the premise that the latter can enhance re-expression of abnormally silenced genes mediated by abnormal gene promoter DNA methylation (Cameron et al., 1999Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myöhänen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Synergy of demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibition in the re-expression of genes silenced in cancer.Nat.

However, little attention has been paid to examining the specific pharmacologic features of HDACi, optimal dosing strategy, and underlying mechanisms mediating maximal synergy with DNMTis. The zinc-chelating HDACis comprise 3 major classes: benzamide, hydroxamic acid, and cyclic tetrapeptides (Bradner et al., 2010Bradner J.E. West N. Grachan M.L. Greenberg E.F. Haggarty S.J. Warnow T.

Cancer Res. 2016; 130: 55-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Benzamide class HDACis target class I HDAC isoforms, while hydroxamic acid class HDACis target both class I (HDAC1, 2, and 3) and class IIb (HDAC6), although differences in isoform targeting can be noted (Bradner et al., 2010Bradner J.E. West N. Grachan M.L. Greenberg E.F. Haggarty S.J. Warnow T. Mazitschek R. Chemical phylogenetics of histone deacetylases.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that low doses of DNMTi impart durable changes in both genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome while avoiding acute cytotoxicity (Tsai et al., 2012Tsai H.C. Li H.

Additionally, we and others have discovered that DNMTis can induce an epithelial immune signature for NSCLC and other cancers (Li et al., 2014Li H. Chiappinelli K.B. Guzzetta A.A. Easwaran H.

A key mediator of this signaling is a cytoplasmic, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated interferon response induced through the activation of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcription (Chiappinelli et al., 2015Chiappinelli K.B.

How the distinct classes of HDACis contribute to enhancing immune therapy specifically is unknown. Herein, testing individual HDACis based on both their isoform-specific inhibitory constant (Ki) and pharmacokinetic parameters, we demonstrate the best pairing of these agents with Aza for achieving anti-tumor effects, which include immune responses. The combination of HDACi + Aza achieves robust anti-tumor responses mediated by reducing MYC-driven cell proliferation with enhancement of immune signaling. We hypothesize dual epigenetic therapy will synergize with immune checkpoint blockade in NSCLC patients to drive a potent anti-tumor response. We tested HDACis by pairing these agents with low-dose (500 nM) Aza. Clinically relevant HDACis (ITF-2357, MGCD-0103, and MS-275) were selected and paired with Aza based on their known pharmacokinetic parameters (serum maximum concentration [Cmax] and half-life) and enzymatic Ki against key HDAC isoforms (Figure S1A) (Bradner et al., 2010Bradner J.E.

We initially examined the effect of sequential Aza + HDACi on cell proliferation across a panel of 16 cell lines representing the diverse oncogenotypes of NSCLC (Figures 1A, S1B, and S1C). These data revealed that the antiproliferative effect of this treatment regimen correlated with the subtype and mutational status of the NSCLC cell line queried. The hydroxamic acid class HDACi (ITF-2357) in combination with Aza demonstrated the most potent antiproliferative phenotype. Among our four most responsive cell lines, three were RAS mutant subtype. Therefore, we selected these cell lines for further studies of therapeutic scheduling and HDAC isoform targeting delineation. Using a comparative analysis, wherein Aza and ITF-2357 were both sequentially and concurrently employed (Figure S1C), only the former schedule induced both synergy and robust potentiation of HDACi by Aza (Figures 1B, 1C, S1D, and S1E). We thus used this schema of sequential treatment in our further studies. To delineate the enhanced antiproliferative effect of ITF-2357 over the others, we next tested the function of the individual HDAC isoforms in the Aza priming response to HDACi. We found, through the application of HDAC isoform-specific inhibitors, an Aza induced priming to both class I and IIb targeting HDACis (Figures 1D and 1E). These data suggest the observed Aza + ITF-2357 antiproliferative phenotype to be the result of broader targeting of HDACs, including both nuclear (HDAC1, 2, and 3) and non-nuclear isoforms (HDAC6).Figure 1Azacitidine Synergizes with Sequential HDACi for Reducing Cell ProliferationShow full caption(A) Composite representation of ITF-2357 IC50 as determined by four parameter dose-response analysis in the presence of mock or 500 nM Aza pre-treatment.

See also Figure S1. As a further characterization of the antiproliferative effects of Aza in combination with HDACi, we deployed equal molar concentrations of MS-275 and ITF-2357 and assessed cell proliferation specifically. In agreement with the previous data, we found 100 nM ITF-2357, a concentration roughly one-third Cmax (Furlan et al., 2011Furlan A. Monzani V. Reznikov L.L. Leoni F. Fossati G. Modena D. Mascagni P. Dinarello C.A. Pharmacokinetics, safety and inducible cytokine responses during a phase 1 trial of the oral histone deacetylase inhibitor ITF2357 (givinostat).Mol. Med. 2011; 17: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), demonstrated a more robust inhibition of proliferation than 100 nM MS-275 (Figure S1F). We next sought to define the contribution of individual HDAC isoforms to the antiproliferative effect noted from 100 nM ITF-2357. To accomplish this end, we first determined equivalent doses based on isoform pharmacodynamic targets, these being histone acetylation for HDAC1 and 2 and tubulin acetylation for HDAC6 (Asthana et al., 2013Asthana J.

Sci. 2013; 110: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These normalized doses of HDAC isoform-specific inhibitors identified HDAC1, 2, and 3 as key arbiters of the Aza + ITF-2357 antiproliferative actions (Figure S1H). Additionally, to elucidate the specificity of Aza priming to HDACi, we deployed small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated DNMT1 depletion, the major pharmacodynamic target of Aza (Cai et al., 2014Cai Y. Geutjes E.J. de Lint K. Roepman P. Bruurs L. Yu L.R. Wang W. van Blijswijk J. Mohammad H. de Rink I. et al.The NuRD complex cooperates with DNMTs to maintain silencing of key colorectal tumor suppressor genes.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 2157-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We observed potent augmentation of the HDACi antiproliferative effect when utilized in combination with DNMT1 depletion (Figures S1I and S1J). Finally, we tested the efficacy of sequential Aza + HDACi in vivo using immune-incompetent mice. We observed a significant reduction of tumor burden across 3 xenograft models, two for established NSCLC cell lines and one using a KRAS, KDR, TP53 mutant primary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model when utilizing Aza + ITF-2357 (Figures 1F–1H). The combination of Aza + MS-275 did not have significant efficacy in the H460 xenograft model, the most sensitive cell line tested, at the doses used in our study (Figure 1F). Aza + MGCD0103 achieved significant efficacy in H460 xenografts (Figure S1K) and modest efficacy in the patient-derived xenograft (Figure S1L). Assessment of drug combination-induced effects on gene expression yields important insight into signaling pathway alterations that may relate to eventual clinical efficacy. The combination epigenetic treatment induced an increase in differential gene expression relative to HDACi mono-treatment conditions, with a clear advantage noted from the application of Aza + ITF-2357 (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). Clustering of the top 500 differentially expressed genes showed a divergence between HDACi mono-treatment and Aza-containing regimens (Figure 2B). Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) pathway analysis revealed the most differentially expressed pathways to be immune, MYC, and metabolism related (Figure 2C). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified three significantly induced pathways by combination epigenetic treatment, two of which are related to immune signaling (Figures 2D and 2E). The interferon alpha/beta (IFNα/β)-signaling pathway was the most prominent of these altered pathways (Figure S2C). Comparative analysis of combination epigenetic treatment-downregulated pathways by GSEA revealed a conserved cell cycle repression signature across the drug combinations tested, with a noted advantage for Aza + ITF-2357 (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2D). The above transcriptional downregulation of cell cycle-related pathways elicited by combinatorial epigenetic treatment matched with the observed proliferative arrest induced by combination epigenetic treatment (Figures S1F).Figure S2Combination Epigenetic Treatment Induces Significant Differential Gene Expression, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Quantitation of the differentially expressed genes for each treatment condition (differential gene expression cutoff Log2 fold change over mock > 0.5, day 8, microarray, 500nM Aza, 100nM MS275, 100nM ITF-2357).(B) Relative RNA expression correlation matrix for inhibitor conditions and cell lines indicated in panel A (microarray, day 8, 500nM Aza, 100nM MS275, 100nM ITF-2357).(C) GSEA enrichment plots for top upregulated pathway (Interferon αβ) following combination epigenetic treatment with the indicated HDACi.(D) GSEA enrichment plots for top downregulated pathway (DNA replication) following combination epigenetic treatment with the indicated HDACi.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Quantitation of the differentially expressed genes for each treatment condition (differential gene expression cutoff Log2 fold change over mock > 0.5, day 8, microarray, 500nM Aza, 100nM MS275, 100nM ITF-2357).

A primary goal for combined epigenetic therapy is to increase the efficacy of immune checkpoint and other immunotherapies. We found the combination of Aza + ITF-2357 to be the most effective relative to other conditions tested in terms of induction of IFNα/β pathway-related genes, including those associated with antigen presentation (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). To demonstrate whether this efficacy of immune gene induction by Aza + ITF-2357 was potency or isoform targeting based, we used isoform-specific HDACi at concentrations mimicking 100 nM ITF-2357. We observed the inhibition of HDAC1, 2 (MGCD0103), and HDAC6 (Tubastatin A) in combination with Aza, induced IFNα/β pathway-related genes, including antigen presentation, while HDAC3- (RGFP996) specific inhibitors demonstrated no significant induction of these genes (Figures 3C–3F, S3B, and S3C).Figure S3HDACi Isoform-Specific Induction of Interferon Signaling, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Expression of Interferon stimulated genes induced by Aza and/or the indicated HDACi in various NSCLC cell lines (qRT-PCR, day 8, 500nM Aza, 100nM ITF-2357, and 200nM MGCD0103).(B and C) Expression of Interferon stimulated genes induced by Aza and/or the indicated HDACi in A549 and H23 cells (PCR genecard, day 8, 500nM Aza, 1000nM Tubastatin A, 2000nM RGFP996).(D and E) Expression of Interferon stimulated genes induced by Aza and/or the indicated HDACi in A549 and H23 cells (PCR genecard, day 8, 500nM Aza, 100nM ITF-2357, 200nM MGCD0103, 300nM SAHA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Expression of Interferon stimulated genes induced by Aza and/or the indicated HDACi in various NSCLC cell lines (qRT-PCR, day 8, 500nM Aza, 100nM ITF-2357, and 200nM MGCD0103).

We also compared the efficacy of ITF-2357 against another hydroxamic acid derivative HDACi (SAHA). Using doses at equal ratio of Cmax for the respective inhibitors, we observed a superior augmentation of interferon genes by ITF-2357 when deployed in combination with Aza (Figures S3D and S3E). The above data demonstrates an induction of interferon-stimulated genes by Aza, which are further augmented by HDACi’s targeting isoforms 1, 2, and 6. Cancer/testis antigens are epigenetic-treatment responsive and have an established role in facilitating the recognition of tumors through immune surveillance (Moreno-Bost et al., 2011Moreno-Bost A.

https://openalex.org/W2774959102,"Statistical mechanics is founded on the assumption that a system can reach thermal equilibrium, regardless of the starting state. Interactions between particles facilitate thermalization, but, can interacting systems always equilibrate regardless of parameter values\,? The energy spectrum of a system can answer this question and reveal the nature of the underlying phases. However, most experimental techniques only indirectly probe the many-body energy spectrum. Using a chain of nine superconducting qubits, we implement a novel technique for directly resolving the energy levels of interacting photons. We benchmark this method by capturing the intricate energy spectrum predicted for 2D electrons in a magnetic field, the Hofstadter butterfly. By increasing disorder, the spatial extent of energy eigenstates at the edge of the energy band shrink, suggesting the formation of a mobility edge. At strong disorder, the energy levels cease to repel one another and their statistics approaches a Poisson distribution - the hallmark of transition from the thermalized to the many-body localized phase. Our work introduces a new many-body spectroscopy technique to study quantum phases of matter."
https://openalex.org/W2771639136,"Blood platelets are critical for hemostasis and thrombosis and play diverse roles during immune responses. Despite these versatile tasks in mammalian biology, their skills on a cellular level are deemed limited, mainly consisting in rolling, adhesion, and aggregate formation. Here, we identify an unappreciated asset of platelets and show that adherent platelets use adhesion receptors to mechanically probe the adhesive substrate in their local microenvironment. When actomyosin-dependent traction forces overcome substrate resistance, platelets migrate and pile up the adhesive substrate together with any bound particulate material. They use this ability to act as cellular scavengers, scanning the vascular surface for potential invaders and collecting deposited bacteria. Microbe collection by migrating platelets boosts the activity of professional phagocytes, exacerbating inflammatory tissue injury in sepsis. This assigns platelets a central role in innate immune responses and identifies them as potential targets to dampen inflammatory tissue damage in clinical scenarios of severe systemic infection."

We demonstrate that skin pigmentation is highly heritable, but known pigmentation loci explain only a small fraction of the variance.

By considering diverse, under-studied African populations, we show how the architecture of skin pigmentation can vary across humans subject to different local evolutionary pressures. Skin pigmentation is one of the most strikingly variable and strongly selected phenotypes among human populations, with darker skin observed closer to the equator and lighter pigmentation observed at high latitudes (Sturm and Duffy, 2012Sturm R.A. Duffy D.L. Human pigmentation genes under environmental selection.Genome Biol. 2012; 13: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Researchers have hypothesized that variable exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) creates opposing selective forces for vitamin D production and folate protection, resulting in variable melanin production and global pigmentation differentiation (Chaplin and Jablonski, 2009Chaplin G.

Skin pigmentation differences at similar latitudes and UV exposures indicate that additional evolutionary forces, such as assortative mating, drift, and epistasis, are also likely to have affected global skin pigmentation (Pośpiech et al., 2014Pośpiech E.

While ∼171 genes have been implicated in variability across model organisms (e.g., the Color Genes database: http://www.espcr.org/micemut/), only ∼15 genes have been associated with skin color differences in humans (Table 2). The relative paucity of loci identified from genome-wide association study (GWAS) efforts has led to the characterization of pigmentation variation as relatively simple, with only a handful of SNPs being highly predictive of skin, eye, and hair color across populations (Hart et al., 2013Hart K.L.

For example, the derived Ala111Thr allele (rs1426654) of SLC24A5 that swept to near fixation in western Eurasian populations confers the largest known effect on skin color variability (Beleza et al., 2013bBeleza S. Santos A.M. McEvoy B. Alves I. Martinho C. Cameron E. Shriver M.D. Parra E.J. Rocha J. The timing of pigmentation lightening in Europeans.Mol. Biol.

Because African populations have been under-studied, the genetic architecture and higher variability of skin pigmentation is poorly understood. Strong positive selection acting on skin pigmentation has resulted in large effects that explain a large fraction of heritable variation. For example, a previous study in recently admixed Cape Verdeans with European and West African ancestors showed that only 4 loci explain 35% of the variation in skin pigmentation (Beleza et al., 2013bBeleza S. Santos A.M. McEvoy B. Alves I. Martinho C. Cameron E. Shriver M.D. Parra E.J. Rocha J. The timing of pigmentation lightening in Europeans.Mol. Biol.

In contrast, complex traits such as height and schizophrenia require ∼10,000 independent SNPs derived from GWAS of >100,000 individuals to build predictors that explain ∼29% and ∼20% of the variance in independent cohorts, respectively (Ripke et al., 2014Ripke S.

Light skin pigmentation is observed in the far southern latitudes of Africa among KhoeSan hunter-gatherers and pastoralists in and near the Kalahari Desert. The KhoeSan are unique in their early divergence from other populations, likely dating back at least ∼100,000 years (Schlebusch et al., 2012Schlebusch C.M. Skoglund P. Sjödin P. Gattepaille L.M.

Previous studies have noted different pigmentation allele frequencies between the Ju|’hoansi San and other Africans, but these have been based on fewer than 7 individuals from the former population without measured phenotypes (Berg and Coop, 2014Berg J.J.

We use the term “KhoeSan” to refer to a diverse array of indigenous populations in southern Africa that carry KhoeSan ancestry and speak Khoe, !Ui-Tuu, or Kx’a languages. “KhoeSan” is not accepted by all such communities; where possible, we refer to populations by their specific ethnic name. This grouping lumps together populations of different languages, cultures, and variable genetic diversity. Here, we report an evolutionary and genetic study of skin pigmentation with a total of 465 genotyped KhoeSan individuals (278 ‡Khomani San and 187 Nama), with targeted resequencing at associated pigmentation loci and matched quantitative spectrophotometric phenotype data (Table S4). The ‡Khomani San are traditionally a N|u-speaking hunter-gatherer population living in the southern Kalahari Desert, while the Nama are traditionally a Khoekhoe-speaking semi-nomadic pastoralist group of KhoeSan ancestry. We investigate (1) the degree of polygenicity and heritability of skin pigmentation, (2) the extent of pigmentation variation explained by previously associated or canonical pigmentation genes, and (3) novel pigmentation alleles contributing to variation in the ‡Khomani San and Nama populations. We quantitatively phenotyped baseline skin color in 479 individuals (277 ‡Khomani, 202 Nama; Figure S1 and Table S4) via narrow-band reflectometry to measure hemoglobin and melanin of both the left and right upper inner arms (STAR Methods), withMindex=log10(1%redreflectance) We sequenced and/or genotyped a subset of phenotyped samples (Table S4 and STAR Methods). Skin pigmentation is lighter in the KhoeSan than in the majority of other African populations, with baseline upper-arm M index = 57.57 ± 10.12 (mean ± SD) in the ‡Khomani San. Baseline upper-arm pigmentation in the Nama is slightly lower, with M index = 52.12 ± 8.93. The ‡Khomani are on average significantly darker than the Nama (p = 3.6e−10; Figure 1C), but the variance is not significantly different (p > 0.05). For comparison, we aggregated quantitative skin pigmentation across 32 globally diverse populations (4,712 individuals) assayed with a DermaSpectrometer (DSM I or DSM II) (Basu Mallick et al., 2013Basu Mallick C.

Only four African populations are available for comparison; among these, only the Ghanians represent an equatorial African population without recent admixture. Skin color is substantially darker in equatorial Ghanaians, where M index reaches a mean of 96.04 ± 10.94; M index for Cape Verdeans, who have ∼40% European admixture on average, have slightly lighter (55.39 ± 13.00, p = 5.6e−3) and considerably more variable pigmentation (p = 1.9e−6) than the KhoeSan. Two other populations living in South Africa, the Xhosa and admixed Coloured populations, have respectively darker (M index = 67.1 ± 7.5) and similar (M index = 53.1 ± 8.5) pigmentation compared to the KhoeSan populations (Coussens et al., 2015Coussens A.K.

We tested whether the correlation between absolute latitude and pigmentation was significant with our large, quantitatively phenotyped sample of global populations.

Shriver M.D. Investigating the case of human nose shape and climate adaptation.PLoS Genet. 2017; 13: e1006616-e1006631Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we find that skin pigmentation is strongly associated with absolute latitude (R2 = 0.53, β = −1.18 on M index scale, p < 2e−16); populations further from the equator have lighter skin pigmentation. We next tested whether variance in melanin within populations also varies across populations. Skin pigmentation has primarily been studied in lightly pigmented European and East Asian populations, where skin color varies minimally among individuals (Figures 1A and 1B). Less-studied equatorial and admixed populations, including Melanesians, Ghanaians, Cape Verdeans, South African admixed Coloured, and South Asians vary considerably more in skin pigmentation (Figure 1B). We find that absolute latitude is also significantly negatively associated with the standard deviation in melanin (R2 = 0.41, p = 5.0e−5). Further, melanin distributions are heteroskedastic (i.e., the variance is not constant; rather, it changes over the range of observed M index), with the coefficient of variation, a standardized metric of phenotypic dispersion, decreasing with increasing distance from the equator (cv = σ/μ, R2 = 0.14, p = 0.03; Table S1). A sign test comparing variances in lighter versus darker population pairs within the same study indicates that populations with lighter skin have significantly reduced phenotypic variance than expected by chance (p = 2.01e−8). These results suggest that there is reduced genetic heterogeneity and/or reduced variance in the population distribution of causal effect sizes contributing to lighter versus darker pigmentation. There is more than an order of magnitude difference in variance between the lightest and darkest populations (i.e., Irish versus Ghanaian F = 0.03, p = 6.7e−23). Europeans and East Asians have significantly less variation than South Asians (F = 0.25, p = 1.06e−14 and F = 0.30, p = 1.27e−10, respectively; Figure 1B). Cape Verdeans with the highest quartile of European admixture have lighter, less variable skin color than individuals with the lowest quartile of European ancestry (p = 4.28e−9, although notably, ancestry proportions are bimodal across individuals). Among Melanesians, islands at similar latitudes with more lightly pigmented individuals on average show less variance than those with more darkly pigmented individuals (e.g., one-sided F test comparing variance among more lightly pigmented New Britain individuals versus individuals from Bougainville, p = 2.89e−9; Figure 1B). Among the ‡Khomani and Nama, comparing individuals with primarily European admixture (>20%, n = 124) to individuals with primarily Bantu admixture (>20%, n = 91), we find significantly greater melanin variation among KhoeSan individuals with more Bantu admixture (p = 1.33e−4). The ‡Khomani San and the Nama have both experienced admixture with neighboring darker-skinned Bantu-speaking groups beginning ∼450 years ago, as well as with lighter-skinned European settlers who first arrived in the Northern Cape during the late 18th century (Uren et al., 2016Uren C.

We assessed these ancestry proportions using unsupervised allele frequency clustering with ADMIXTURE, as well as principal components analysis (PCA; STAR Methods). At k = 3 ancestry components, we observe distinct clustering between Europeans, Bantu-speaking and West African populations, and KhoeSan populations; both the Nama and the ‡Khomani have ∼75%–80% KhoeSan-specific ancestry. For k = 7, which gives most stable ancestry estimates, we observe a partitioning of the KhoeSan ancestry into “northern Kalahari” ancestry shared with Ju|’hoansi and a distinct southern or circum-Kalahari ancestry present in the Nama and the ‡Khomani. On average, in the ‡Khomani San, we find 55% northern Kalahari KhoeSan ancestry, 21% southern Kalahari KhoeSan ancestry, 11% European ancestry (common in Central European [CEU] and French individuals), 12% western African ancestry (common in Yoruba and Bantu-speaking populations), and 2% attributable to other African populations (Tanzanian hunter-gatherers, East African populations, and North African populations; Figures 2A, S2A, and Table S2). The Nama differ from the ‡Khomani in their proportion of northern versus southern Kalahari ancestry; they have, on average, 17% northern Kalahari ancestry, 62% southern Kalahari ancestry, 9% European ancestry, 10% western African ancestry, and 1% attributable to other African populations.

https://openalex.org/W2774459534,"DSL ligands activate Notch by inducing proteolytic cleavage of the receptor ectodomain, an event that requires ligand to be endocytosed in signal-sending cells by the adaptor protein Epsin. Two classes of explanation for this unusual requirement are (1) recycling models, in which the ligand must be endocytosed to be modified or repositioned before it binds Notch and (2) pulling models, in which the ligand must be endocytosed after it binds Notch to exert force that exposes an otherwise buried site for cleavage. We demonstrate in vivo that ligands that cannot enter the Epsin pathway nevertheless bind Notch but fail to activate the receptor because they cannot exert sufficient force. This argues against recycling models and in favor of pulling models. Our results also suggest that once ligand binds receptor, activation depends on a competition between Epsin-mediated ligand endocytosis, which induces cleavage, and transendocytosis of the ligand by the receptor, which aborts the incipient signal."

Although sparsely investigated, a number of studies indicate sex differences in stress effects on neuronal structure, function, and behaviors associated with these regions. We recently demonstrated a basal sex difference in- and differential effects of stress on- microglial activation in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The resident immune cells of the brain, microglia are implicated in synaptic and dendritic plasticity, and cognitive-behavioral function. Here, we examined the effects of acute (3h/day, 1 day) and chronic (3h/day, 10 days) restraint stress on microglial density and morphology, as well as immune factor expression in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and dorsal hippocampus (DHC) in male and female rats. Microglia were visualized, classified based on their morphology, and stereologically counted. Microglia-associated transcripts (CD40, iNOS, Arg1, CX3CL1, CX3CR1, CD200, and CD200R) were assessed in brain punches from each region. Expression of genes linked with cellular stress, neuroimmune state, and neuron-microglia communication varied between unstressed male and female rats in a region-specific manner. In OFC, chronic stress upregulated a wider variety of immune factors in females than in males. Acute stress increased microglia-associated transcripts in BLA in males, whereas chronic stress altered immune factor expression in BLA more broadly in females. In DHC, chronic stress increased immune factor expression in males but not females. Moreover, acute and chronic stress differentially affected microglial morphological activation state in male and female rats across all brain regions investigated. In males, chronic stress altered microglial activation in a pattern consistent with microglial involvement in stress-induced dendritic remodeling across OFC, BLA, and DHC. Together, these data suggest the potential for microglia-mediated sex differences in stress effects on neural structure, function, and behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2774495077,"The mechanisms by which lung structural cells survive toxic exposures to cigarette smoke (CS) are not well defined but may involve proper disposal of damaged mitochondria by macro-autophagy (mitophagy), processes that may be influenced by pro-apoptotic ceramide (Cer) or its precursor dihydroceramide (DHC). Human lung epithelial and endothelial cells exposed to CS exhibited mitochondrial damage, signaled by phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) phosphorylation, autophagy, and necroptosis. Although cells responded to CS by rapid inhibition of DHC desaturase, which elevated DHC levels, palmitoyl (C16)-Cer also increased in CS-exposed cells. Whereas DHC augmentation triggered autophagy without cell death, the exogenous administration of C16-Cer was sufficient to trigger necroptosis. Inhibition of Cer-generating acid sphingomyelinase reduced both CS-induced PINK1 phosphorylation and necroptosis. When exposed to CS, Pinkl-deficient (Pink1−/−) mice, which are protected from airspace enlargement compared with wild-type littermates, had blunted C16-Cer elevations and less lung necroptosis. CS-exposed Pink1−/− mice also exhibited significantly increased levels of lignoceroyl (C24)-DHC, along with increased expression of Cer synthase 2 (CerS2), the enzyme responsible for its production. This suggested that a combination of high C24-DHC and low C16-Cer levels might protect against CS-induced necroptosis. Indeed, CerS2−/− mice, which lack C24-DHC at the expense of increased C16-Cer, were more susceptible to CS, developing airspace enlargement following only 1 month of exposure. These results implicate DHCs, in particular, C24-DHC, as protective against CS toxicity by enhancing autophagy, whereas C16-Cer accumulation contributes to mitochondrial damage and PINKl-mediated necroptosis, which may be amplified by the inhibition of C24-DHC-producing CerS2.— Mizumura, K., Justice, M.J., Schweitzer, K.S., Krishnan, S., Bronova, I., Berdyshev, E.

https://openalex.org/W2773895504,"Among vaccines aimed at treating substance use disorders, those targeting opioids present several unique medication development challenges. 1) Opioid overdose is a common complication of abuse, so it is desirable for an opioid vaccine to block the toxic as well as the addictive effects of opioids. 2) It is important that an opioid vaccine not interfere with the action of opioid antagonists used to reverse opioid overdose or treat addiction. 3) Some opioids are immunosuppressive and chronic ongoing opioid use could interfere with vaccine immunogenicity. 4) Although antibody-bound oxycodone is unable to enter the brain because of its size, it might still be able to activate peripheral opioid receptors. To assess vaccine impact on opioid toxicity, rats vaccinated with oxycodone conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin subunit dimer (OXY-dKLH) adsorbed to alum or controls vaccinated with dKLH were compared with regard to oxycodone-induced hotplate analgesia and oxycodone-induced respiratory depression and bradycardia. Vaccination shifted the dose-response curves to the right, representing protection, for each of these endpoints. Naloxone was equally effective in both OXY-dKLH and control groups, providing complete and rapid reversal of respiratory depression. The administration of a long-acting naltrexone formulation during vaccination did not impair vaccine immunogenicity in mice. Similarly, serum anti-oxycodone antibody titers were not altered by continuous morphine infusion during vaccination compared to opioid-naive controls. Competitive ELISA assay showed negligible or low affinity of immune antiserum for endogenous opioids or opioid antagonists. In vitro receptor binding assays showed that antibody-bound oxycodone does not activate mu opioid receptors. These data support further study of OXY-dKLH as a potential treatment for oxycodone abuse and suggest that vaccination might also reduce the severity of oxycodone overdose."

https://openalex.org/W2773508039,"Background Despite great achievements by insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in reducing malaria transmission, it is unlikely these tools will be sufficient to eliminate malaria transmission on their own in many settings today. Fortunately, field experiments indicate that there are many promising vector control interventions that can be used to complement ITNs and/or IRS by targeting a wide range of biological and environmental mosquito resources. The majority of these experiments were performed to test a single vector control intervention in isolation; however, there is growing evidence and consensus that effective vector control with the goal of malaria elimination will require a combination of interventions. Method and findings We have developed a model of mosquito population dynamic to describe the mosquito life and feeding cycles and to optimize the impact of vector control intervention combinations at suppressing mosquito populations. The model simulations were performed for the main three malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa, Anopheles gambiae s.s, An. arabiensis and An. funestus. We considered areas having low, moderate and high malaria transmission, corresponding to entomological inoculation rates of 10, 50 and 100 infective bites per person per year, respectively. In all settings, we considered baseline ITN coverage of 50% or 80% in addition to a range of other vector control tools to interrupt malaria transmission. The model was used to sweep through parameters space to select the best optimal intervention packages. Sample model simulations indicate that, starting with ITNs at a coverage of 50% (An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus) or 80% (An. arabiensis) and adding interventions that do not require human participation (e.g. larviciding at 80% coverage, endectocide treated cattle at 50% coverage and attractive toxic sugar baits at 50% coverage) may be sufficient to suppress all the three species to an extent required to achieve local malaria elimination. Conclusion The Vector Control Optimization Model (VCOM) is a computational tool to predict the impact of combined vector control interventions at the mosquito population level in a range of eco-epidemiological settings. The model predicts specific combinations of vector control tools to achieve local malaria elimination in a range of eco-epidemiological settings and can assist researchers and program decision-makers on the design of experimental or operational research to test vector control interventions. A corresponding graphical user interface is available for national malaria control programs and other end users."

Sedentary behaviors such as sitting time are associated with obesity and diabetes independently of total reported physical activity. This study aimed to describe the current sitting time/day prevalence and trends and to examine the association of sitting time with sociodemographic and clinical variables in Mexico City.


Methods 
Two cross-sectional representative surveys in Mexico City were used for this analysis (2006: n = 1148 and 2015: n = 1329). Sedentary behavior questions from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire included time spent sitting on a weekday in the last week or on a Wednesday. Sitting time /day was divided into deciles, and participants in the highest decile (≥ 420 minutes/day) were classified within the high sitting category; others were classified in the low sitting time category. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations of sitting time with sociodemographic and clinical indicators, controlling for confounders and testing for potential interactions.


Results 
A total of 13.7% (2006) and 14.8% (2015) adults were classified in the highest sitting time category (≥ 420 minutes/day). There was a significant increase in the average sitting time/day between the surveys (216.0 minutes in 2006 vs. 233.3 minutes in 2015, p < 0.001). In 2015, men, those aged 20–49 years, those in low-intensity jobs, students, and those with a high socioeconomic level were more likely to be in the highest sitting time category. Participants with overweight/obesity (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.11, 5.09) and those with high glucose levels (survey finding) (OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.04, 5.25) were more likely to report sitting time in the highest category.


Discussion 
Sitting time/day prevalence increased 8%, and average daily sitting minutes significantly increased by 8.2% (18 minutes) in the nine-year study period (2006–2015). Current public health policies should consider strategies not only for increasing physical activity levels, but also for reducing sitting time/day among the population as a measure to fight the growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes in Mexico."

PDI can become dysfunctional by post-translational modifications, including those promoted by biological oxidants, and its dysfunction has been associated with several diseases in which oxidative stress plays a role. Because the kinetics and products of the reaction of these oxidants with PDI remain incompletely characterized, we investigated the reaction of PDI with the biological oxidant peroxynitrite. First, by determining the rate constant of the oxidation of PDI’s redox-active Cys residues (Cys53 and Cys397) by hydrogen peroxide (k = 17.3 ± 1.3 m−1 s−1 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C), we established that the measured decay of the intrinsic PDI fluorescence is appropriate for kinetic studies. The reaction of these PDI residues with peroxynitrite was considerably faster (k = (6.9 ± 0.2) × 104 m−1 s−1), and both Cys residues were kinetically indistinguishable. Limited proteolysis, kinetic simulations, and MS analyses confirmed that peroxynitrite preferentially oxidizes the redox-active Cys residues of PDI to the corresponding sulfenic acids, which reacted with the resolving thiols at the active sites to produce disulfides (i.e. Cys53–Cys56 and Cys397–Cys400). A fraction of peroxynitrite, however, decayed to radicals that hydroxylated and nitrated other active-site residues (Trp52, Trp396, and Tyr393). Excess peroxynitrite promoted further PDI oxidation, nitration, inactivation, and covalent oligomerization.

Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) 4The abbreviations used are: PDIprotein-disulfide isomeraseDBNBS3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acidDTPAdiethylene triamine pentaacetic acidERendoplasmic reticulumESI-Qelectrospray ionization-quadrupole. is a ubiquitous dithiol–disulfide oxidoreductase chaperone that is found at nearly millimolar concentration in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and at much lower levels at other cellular locations, such as the cell surface, cytosol, mitochondria, and extracellular matrix. PDI contains 508 amino acid residues organized as a U-shaped structure bearing sequential domains named a-b-b′-a′-c, the latter containing the C-terminal ER-retention sequence KDEL. The a and a′ domains at the arms of the “U” contain one CGHC redox-active motif each, whereas the b and b′ domains at the bottom of the U are rich in hydrophobic residues involved in substrate protein recognition and binding (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sevier C.S.

Indeed, PDI is involved in protein folding by oxidizing, reducing, and isomerizing disulfide bonds. Oxidized PDI can act as a thiol oxidase, directly introducing disulfide bonds into reduced unfolded substrates and, in a second step, promoting disulfide isomerization. Alternatively, PDI also supports isomerization of disulfide bonds induced via other sources (2Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Protein disulfide isomerase.Biochim. Biophys.

PDI-catalyzed isomerization occurs either by sequential cycles of non-native disulfide reduction/oxidation to yield correct native disulfide bonds (8Schwaller M. Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F.

In either case, isomerization requires reduced PDI and generates reduced PDI with no need for reoxidation. Meanwhile, substrate oxidation mediated by disulfide-oxidized PDI generates reduced PDI, which needs to be reoxidized to regenerate its activity. This reoxidation is accomplished by a number of ER proteins, including Ero1a, GPx7, GPx8, and PrxIV (2Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Protein disulfide isomerase.Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, PDI disulfides are essentially required for catalytic introduction of disulfide bonds into nascent proteins, acting as a converging hub of several reactions involved in protein folding (4Laurindo F.R.

In parallel, PDI oxidation impairs its reductase and to some extent isomerase activities (7Hudson D.A. Gannon S.A. Thorpe C.

However, the oxidation of PDI by low-molecular-weight biological oxidants has received limited attention in the literature. These oxidants are likely responsible for the oxidative post-translational modifications of PDI that have been detected under various conditions associated with oxidative stress, leading to the loss of PDI activity (14Parakh S.

These findings argue for a better understanding of PDI oxidation by biological oxidants with regard to the kinetics and products of these reactions. The few available kinetic studies are limited to the oxidation of PDI dithiol by GSSG (12Lappi A.-K. Ruddock L.W.

Another biological oxidant, dehydroascorbate, has also been reported to slowly oxidize PDI dithiols (k = 12.5 m−1 s−1) (26Saaranen M.J. Karala A.-R. Lappi A.-K. Ruddock L.W.

Because the multidomain structure of PDI is essential for its high catalytic efficiency (20Muller C. Bandemer J. Vindis C. Camaré C. Mucher E. Guéraud F. Larroque-Cardoso P. Bernis C. Auge N.

Hydrogen peroxide was used to test the methodology because the kinetics of its reaction with mutated PDI domain a has been studied previously (25Karala A.-R. Lappi A.-K. Saaranen M.J. Ruddock L.W.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the fluorescence of reduced PDI (black trace) decreased upon addition of 320 μm hydrogen peroxide (red trace) but did not show a clear blue shift. Addition of DTT (500 μm) to the oxidized PDI recovered the initial PDI fluorescence (blue trace), confirming that PDI reactive thiols are the main targets of hydrogen peroxide (25Karala A.-R. Lappi A.-K. Saaranen M.J. Ruddock L.W. Efficient peroxide-mediated oxidative refolding of a protein at physiological pH and implications for oxidative folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Antioxid.

Although the decay of the intrinsic fluorescence of PDI upon oxidation is small, it can be used for kinetic studies. Indeed, the decay of PDI fluorescence upon oxidation by 320 μm hydrogen peroxide with time fits to a single-exponential function and is reversed by DTT (Fig. 1B). Increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (0.25–1.0 mm) increased the rate of fluorescence decay, but the overall fluorescence decrease and the recovery upon DTT addition were maintained (data not shown). Likewise, all of the measured fluorescence decays with time followed single-exponential functions from which the corresponding kobs values were calculated. Plotting of these values against hydrogen peroxide concentration provided a straight line (Fig. 1C), the slope of which permitted the determination of the second-order rate constant of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and PDI reactive thiols as k = 17.3 ± 1.3 m−1 s−1 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. No evidence for double-exponential decay was observed, indicating that both PDI reactive thiols (Cys53 and Cys397) are oxidized by hydrogen peroxide with similar rate constants. Accordingly, the value of the second-order rate determined here for the full-length PDI (17.3 m−1 s−1) was roughly twice that determined for the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the mutated PDI a domain (9.2 m−1 s−1) (25Karala A.-R.

After demonstrating the usefulness of the intrinsic PDI fluorescence for kinetic studies (Fig. 1), we applied it to investigate the reaction of reduced PDI (5 μm) with peroxynitrite. In view of the higher reactivity of peroxynitrite as compared with hydrogen peroxide (27Ferrer-Sueta G. Radi R. Chemical biology of peroxynitrite: kinetics, diffusion, and radicals.ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4 (19267456): 161-17710.1021/cb800279qCrossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 31Ferrer-Sueta G. Manta B. Botti H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Denicola A.

Toxicol. 2011; 24 (21391663): 434-45010.1021/tx100413vCrossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we utilized a stopped-flow fluorometer and started with low peroxynitrite concentrations (2.5–10.0 μm). On the time scale of the experiment, PDI was not oxidized in the absence of peroxynitrite but in its presence was oxidized in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by the rate of decrease of PDI intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 2A). The total fluorescence decay was also proportional to peroxynitrite concentration because it increased with oxidant concentration, varying from substoichiometric (2.5–7.5 μm) up to stoichiometric (10 μm) to PDI reactive thiols (5 μm PDI = 10 μm PDI reactive thiols). Relevantly, the total PDI fluorescence decay in the presence of peroxynitrite (10 μm) (ΔF = −0.56 V) was the same as that of excess hydrogen peroxide and twice that of 5 μm peroxynitrite (Fig. 2C). After PDI oxidation by substoichiometric and stoichiometric peroxynitrite, the initial PDI fluorescence was recovered by DTT addition as was the case of excess hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, a higher peroxynitrite concentration, such as 20 μm, caused a major increase in the overall decay of PDI fluorescence, which was only partially recovered upon DTT addition (Fig. 2, B and C). These results suggested that PDI reactive Cys residues are the preferential targets of peroxynitrite in a process that is reversed by DTT up to the stoichiometric concentration of the oxidant and of PDI reactive thiols. Increasing the relative concentration of peroxynitrite over PDI reactive thiols results not only in their oxidation but also in PDI modifications that change its fluorescence spectrum in a manner not completely reversed by DTT. To test the above suggestion, we performed experiments of limited proteolysis with trypsin under oxidizing and reducing conditions followed by electrophoretic analysis (Fig. 2E). Previous work has shown that upon oxidation of PDI reactive thiols the enzyme adopts a more open conformation, becoming more susceptible to proteolysis (13Wang C. Yu J. Huo L. Wang L. Feng W. Wang C. Human protein-disulfide isomerase is a redox-regulated chaperone activated by oxidation of domain a′.J. Biol.

Indeed, reduced PDI (10 μm) is fairly resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 1 and 2). If reduced PDI is treated with a stoichiometric concentration of peroxynitrite relative to PDI reactive thiols (20 μm), the degree of digestion increases (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 5 and 6), and this increased susceptibility is almost completely reversed by the addition of DTT to the oxidized enzyme before trypsin addition (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 2 and 5–7). Peroxynitrite concentrations beyond 20 μm result in increased digestion and only partial recovery upon DTT addition as seen in the experiments performed with 200 μm peroxynitrite (Fig. 2E, lanes 11–13). In contrast, when reduced PDI is added to decomposed peroxynitrite (200 μm) (reverse addition), the digestion pattern resembles that of the reduced enzyme (Fig. 2E, lanes 3 and 4).Taken together, the above results (Fig. 2, A–C and E) confirm that the PDI reactive thiols are the preferential targets of peroxynitrite at substoichiometric and stoichiometric concentrations, but when in excess the oxidant also attacks other PDI"
https://openalex.org/W2771753297,"PITX2 is a homeobox transcription factor involved in embryonic left/right signaling and more recently has been associated to cardiac arrhythmias. Genome wide association studies have pinpointed PITX2 as a major player underlying atrial fibrillation (AF). We have previously described that PITX2 expression is impaired in AF patients. Furthermore, distinct studies demonstrate that Pitx2 insufficiency leads to complex gene regulatory network remodeling, i.e. Wnt>microRNAs, leading to ion channel impairment and thus to arrhythmogenic events in mice. Whereas large body of evidences has been provided in recent years on PITX2 downstream signaling pathways, scarce information is available on upstream pathways influencing PITX2 in the context of AF. Multiple risk factors are associated to the onset of AF, such as e.g. hypertension (HTN), hyperthyroidism (HTD) and redox homeostasis impairment. In this study we have analyzed whether HTN, HTD and/or redox homeostasis impact on PITX2 and its downstream signaling pathways. Using rat models for spontaneous HTN (SHR) and experimentally-induced HTD we have observed that both cardiovascular risk factors lead to severe Pitx2 downregulation. Interesting HTD, but not SHR, leads to up-regulation of Wnt signaling as well as deregulation of multiple microRNAs and ion channels as previously described in Pitx2 insufficiency models. In addition, redox signaling is impaired in HTD but not SHR, in line with similar findings in atrial-specific Pitx2 deficient mice. In vitro cell culture analyses using gain- and loss-of-function strategies demonstrate that Pitx2, Zfhx3 and Wnt signaling influence redox homeostasis in cardiomyocytes. Thus, redox homeostasis seems to play a pivotal role in this setting, providing a regulatory feedback loop. Overall these data demonstrate that HTD, but not HTN, can impair Pitx2>>Wnt pathway providing thus a molecular link to AF."

Despite these critical features of core fucosylation, a one-step core defucosylation process has yet to be identified. Although extensive research effort has been applied to α-l-fucosidase for decades, understanding of specific critical biochemical and biologically interesting fucosidase activities are still missing.

To the best of our knowledge, no core α-1,3 fucosidase has been reported yet. Therefore, finding a new α-fucosidase that has core fucosidase activity is required to improve our understanding of core fucosylation in biological systems and processes. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases (F1, F2, and F3) and peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) have been identified in Elizabethkingia spp. and broadly used in glycobiological research (38Garbe J. Collin M.

In addition, we have identified the novel protein peptide:N-glycosidase F-II (PNGase F-II) from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and revealed that the enzyme has broad substrate specificity, including deglycosylation of core α-1,3-fucosylated N-glycans, that is resistant to PNGase F hydrolysis (40Sun G.

In this study, we identified a novel fucosidase from the E. meningoseptica genome and demonstrated that it has core fucosidase activity. E. meningoseptica FMS-007 is a clinical strain that was isolated from a T-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patient in our laboratory (41Sun G. Wang L. Bao C. Li T. Ma L. Chen L. Complete genome sequence of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, isolated from a T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient.Genome Announc. 2015; 3 (26112786): e00673-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome revealed a fucosidase candidate (core fucosidase I, cFase I) that consisted of 480 amino acids with a predicted signal peptide of 25 amino acids. Two of the homologs in the PDB database that were closest in sequence to cFase I were bacterial α-fucosidases from Thermotoga maritima (TM0306) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT2970). Their sequence identities with cFase I were 25 (PDB code 1HL8) and 26% (PDB code 2WVT), respectively. Conserved domain analysis revealed that cFase I was similar to enzymes that belonged to the GH29 class of carbohydrate-active enzymes as defined in the CAZy database. The typical structure of GH29 α-fucosidases was composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain adopts an (α/β)8 barrel-like fold, with eight parallel strands that are packed around a central axis and surrounded by six helices and a C-terminal sandwich domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that cFase I was in neither the cluster of the established GH29-A subfamily nor that of GH29-B (Fig. 1). The evolutionary distance of cFase I gene to the GH29-A and GH29-B subfamilies indicated that the ancestral gene of cFase I was in a separate lineage than the current taxonomic lineage of the GH29-A and GH29-B subfamilies, suggesting that it may have different biochemical and biological functions. A DNA fragment of α-fucosidase that lacked the sequence that encodes its N-terminal signal peptide was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from E. meningoseptica FMS-007 as a template and was then ligated into a pET-28a(+) expression vector to produce a fusion protein with an N-terminal His6 tag. The purified protein migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa when subjected to SDS-PAGE (data not shown), in agreement with its calculated mass. We verified the enzymatic activity of recombinant cFase I by subjecting the purified protein to a colorimetric enzymatic assay that used pNP-Fuc as its leading substrate. Fucosidase activity was detected. The optimum pH of cFase I activity is ∼4.5 (Fig. 2a), whereas the pH stability assay showed that cFase I was unstable at pH values less than 3.0 (Fig. 2b). We also demonstrated that the optimum temperature of the activity was ∼55 °C (Fig. 2c); however, a thermostability assay showed that cFase I quickly lost its hydrolytic activity at this temperature (Fig. 2d), indicating that the substrate may help to prevent the denaturation of the enzyme at 55 °C. As a result, 37 °C was chosen as the standard testing temperature in later experiments to prevent the denaturation of the enzyme and potential nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate at higher temperatures. The effects of various metal ions and reagents on cFase I activity were also investigated in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.6. At a 1 mm concentration, divalent cations Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Cd2+ had no significant effect on the enzymatic activity, and Zn2+ ions only slightly inhibited the activity; by contrast, the enzyme activity was obviously inhibited by Cu2+ ions (Table 1). The inhibition of cFase I by Cu2+ was concentration-dependent, with a nonlinear decrease in activity as the concentration of Cu2+ ions increased (Fig. 2e). Moreover, the organomercury PCMB severely inactivated the enzyme (Table 1), whereas this inhibitory effect on cFase I was reversible with additional DTT (data not shown). Our observations were similar to those in previous reports on fucosidases (42Ashida H. Miyake A. Kiyohara M. Wada J. Yoshida E. Kumagai H. Katayama T. Yamamoto K.

Furthermore, the fucosidase-specific inhibitor deoxyfuconojirimycin inhibited the activity of cFase I, indicating the fucosidase activity of the enzyme (Fig. 2f). The chelator EDTA had no significant influence on the enzyme activity. The presence of 1 m urea and 10 mm DTT had no effect on the activity of cFase I, whereas 0.1% SDS almost inactivated the enzyme. The inhibitory effect of SDS to cFase I was overcome by Nonidet P-40 (data not shown).Table 1Action of reagents on cFase I activityReagentsConcentrationRelative activityaThe activity was measured at 37 °C for 60 min in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.6, with 1 mm pNP-Fuc as substrate.

The substrate linkage specificity of cFase I was examined by treating a panel of oligosaccharides that contain representative α-linkages to fucose residues. The reaction mixtures were analyzed using a K-FUCOSE kit and ESI-MS. The assay was conducted in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.6, at 37 °C. The results of the K-FUCOSE assay showed that cFase I was capable of hydrolyzing 3-FL and Lewis X that had a fucose attached by an α-1,3 linkage, but it was inactive against oligosaccharides with other types of linkages, such as 2′-FL, Fucα1–6GlcNAc, 6-fucosyl-N,N′-diacetylchitobiose, and Lewis A (Table 2). cFase I was more active against Lewis X than 3-FL and pNP-Fuc (Table 2).Table 2Linkage specificity of cFase ISubstrateaThe substrate was used at a concentration of 1.0 mm.AbbreviationStructureRelative activity%p-Nitrophenyl-α-l-fucosidepNP-FucFucα-pNP100bThe activity on pNP-Fuc was taken to be 100%.6-Fucosyl-N-acetylglucosamineFα1–6GnFucα1–6GlcNAcNDcND means not detectable.2′-Fucosyllactose2′-FLFucα1–2Galβ1–4GlcND3-Fucosyllactose3-FLGalβ1–4 (Fucα1–3)Glc1328.6Lewis A trisaccharideLeaGalβ1–3 (Fucα1–4)GlcNAcNDLewis X trisaccharideLexGalβ1–4 (Fucα1–3)GlcNAc15448.56-Fucosyl-N,N′-diacetylchitobioseN2FGlcNAcβ1–4 (Fucα1–6)GlcNAcNDa The substrate was used at a concentration of 1.0 mm.b The activity on pNP-Fuc was taken to be 100%.c ND means not detectable. Open table in a new tab ESI-MS was employed to verify the reactivity of cFase I against the oligosaccharides (Fig. 3). In the control experiment that used 3-FL and no cFase I, a molecular ion peak at m/z 511.13, representing a sodium adduct of 3-FL (calculated mass, m/z 511.16), was detected. The peak was significantly attenuated by cFase I treatment; after this treatment, two intense mass ion peaks appeared at m/z 365.08 and 187.05, representing sodium adducts of Gal(β1–4) Glc disaccharide (calculated mass, m/z 315.11) and fucose monosaccharide (calculated mass, m/z 187.06), respectively. A similar result was obtained in the treatment of Lewis X. The peak at m/z 552.17, representing sodium adducts of Lewis X, was replaced by peaks representing a sodium adduct of Gal(β1–4) GlcNAc disaccharide (at m/z 406.12) and a fucose (at m/z 187.03) after cFase I treatment. cFase I did not react with substrates that possessed other types of linkages (data not shown). These results demonstrated that cFase I was an α-1,3-fucosidase. A structure-based sequence alignment was conducted to predict the active sites of cFase I (Fig. 4). The overall structures of these characterized α-fucosidases were quite conserved, although the primary sequence identity between cFase I and the other proteins was between 20 and 32%. The main substrate-binding site residues that were identified in TM0306, such as His-34, His-128, His-129, and Tyr-171, were conserved in cFase I and corresponded to the residues His-57, His-132, His-133, and Tyr-181, respectively.

In order to elucidate this relationship, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 27 HLA matched related (MRD), & 50 unrelated donors (URD), to identify nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). An average 2,463 SNPs were identified in MRD, and 4,287 in URD DRP (p<0.01); resulting peptide antigens that may be presented on HLA class I molecules in each DRP were derived in silico (NetMHCpan ver2.0) and the tissue expression of proteins these were derived from determined (GTex). MRD DRP had an average 3,670 HLA-binding-alloreactive peptides, putative mHA (pmHA) with an IC50 of <500 nM, and URD, had 5,386 (p<0.01). To simulate an alloreactive donor cytotoxic T cell response, the array of pmHA in each patient was considered as an operator matrix modifying a hypothetical cytotoxic T cell clonal vector matrix; each responding T cell clone’s proliferation was determined by the logistic equation of growth, accounting for HLA binding affinity and tissue expression of each alloreactive peptide. The resulting simulated organ-specific alloreactive T cell clonal growth revealed marked variability, with the T cell count differences spanning orders of magnitude between different DRP. Despite an estimated, uniform set of constants used in the model for all DRP, and a heterogeneously treated group of patients, higher total and organ-specific T cell counts were associated with cumulative incidence of moderate to severe GVHD in recipients. In conclusion, exome wide sequence differences and the variable alloreactive peptide binding to HLA in each DRP yields a large range of possible alloreactive donor T cell responses. Our findings also help understand the apparent randomness observed in the development of alloimmune responses."

With apnea durations exceeding 5 min, the purpose of the present study was to determine how that affects cerebral free-radical formation and the corresponding implications for brain structure and function. Measurements were obtained before and following a maximal apnea in 14 divers with transcerebral exchange kinetics, measured as the product of global cerebral blood flow (duplex ultrasound) and radial arterial to internal jugular venous concentration differences (a-vD). Apnea increased the systemic (arterial) and, to a greater extent, the regional (jugular venous) concentration of the ascorbate free radical, resulting in a shift from net cerebral uptake to output (P < 0.05). Peroxidation (lipid hydroperoxides, LDL oxidation), NO bioactivity, and S100β were correspondingly enhanced (P < 0.05), the latter interpreted as minor and not a pathologic disruption of the blood-brain barrier. However, those changes were insufficient to cause neuronal-parenchymal damage confirmed by the lack of change in the a-vD of neuron-specific enolase and human myelin basic protein (P > 0.05). Collectively, these observations suggest that increased cerebral oxidative stress following prolonged apnea in trained divers may reflect a functional physiologic response, rather than a purely maladaptive phenomenon.— Bain, A.

In this study, our goal was to determine the renal localization of Gprc5c, a receptor that we previously reported to be highly expressed in murine whole kidney, and to examine physiologic parameters in Gprc5c knockout (KO) mice to gain insight into function. Gprc5c localized to the apical membrane of renal proximal tubules (PTs) in mice, rats, and humans. With the comparison of Gprc5c wild-type (WT) and KO mice, we found that Gprc5c KO mice have altered acid-base homeostasis. Specifically, Gprc5c KO mice have lower blood pH and higher urine pH compared with WT mice, with a reduced level of titratable acids in their urine. In an in vitro GPCR internalization assay, we observed that Gprc5c internalization (an index of activation) was triggered by alkaline extracellular pH. Furthermore, with the use of an in vitro BCECF assay, we observed that Gprc5c increases Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) activity at alkaline pH. We also find that the NHE3 activity is reduced in Gprc5c KO mice by 2 photon imaging in seminaphthorhodafluors (SNARF)-4F-loaded kidney sections. NHE3 is a primary contributor to apical transport of H+ in the renal PT.

https://openalex.org/W2774153037,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive muscle disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Nonetheless, secondary processes involving perturbation of muscle regeneration probably exacerbate disease progression, resulting in the fatal loss of muscle in DMD patients. A dysfunction of undifferentiated myogenic cells is the most likely cause for the reduction of regenerative capacity of muscle. To clarify molecular mechanisms in perturbation of the regenerative capacity of DMD muscle, we have established several NCAM (CD56)-positive immortalized human dystrophic and non-dystrophic myogenic cell lines from DMD and healthy muscles. A pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, promoted cell cycle progression of non-dystrophic myogenic cells but not DMD myogenic cells. In contrast, IL-1β upregulated the Notch ligand Jagged1 gene in DMD myogenic cells but not in non-dystrophic myogenic cells. Knockdown of Jagged1 in DMD myogenic cells restored the IL-1β-promoted cell cycle progression. Conversely, enforced expression of Jagged1-blocked IL-1β promoted proliferation of non-dystrophic myogenic cells. In addition, IL-1β prevented myogenic differentiation of DMD myogenic cells depending on Jagged1 but not of non-dystrophic myogenic cells. These results demonstrate that Jagged1 induced by IL-1β in DMD myogenic cells modified the action of IL-1β and reduced the ability to proliferate and differentiate. IL-1β induced Jagged1 gene expression may be a feedback response to excess stimulation with this cytokine because high IL-1β (200–1000 pg/ml) induced Jagged1 gene expression even in non-dystrophic myogenic cells. DMD myogenic cells are likely to acquire the susceptibility of the Jagged1 gene to IL-1β under the microcircumstances in DMD muscles. The present results suggest that Jagged1 induced by IL-1β plays a crucial role in the loss of muscle regeneration capacity of DMD muscles. The IL-1β/Jagged1 pathway may be a new therapeutic target to ameliorate exacerbation of muscular dystrophy in a dystrophin-independent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2773366095,"Nutritional interventions such as caloric and dietary restriction increase lifespan in various animal models. To identify alternative and less demanding nutritional interventions that extend lifespan, we subjected fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to weekly nutritional regimens that involved alternating a conventional diet with dietary restriction. Short periods of dietary restriction (up to 2 d) followed by longer periods of a conventional diet yielded minimal increases in lifespan. We found that 3 or more days of contiguous dietary restriction (DR) was necessary to yield a lifespan extension similar to that observed with persistent DR. Female flies were more responsive to these interventions than males. Physiologic changes known to be associated with prolonged DR, such as reduced metabolic rates, showed the same time course as lifespan extension. Moreover, concurrent transcriptional changes indicative of reduced insulin signaling were identified with DR. These physiologic and transcriptional changes were sustained, as they were detectable several days after switching to conventional diets. Taken together, diets with longer periods of DR extended lifespan concurrently with physiologic and transcriptional changes that may underlie this increase in lifespan.— Romey-Glüsing, R., Li, Y., Hoffmann, J., vonFrieling, J., Knop, M., Pfefferkorn, R., Bruchhaus, I., Fink, C., Roeder, T.

https://openalex.org/W2771470320,"Sentence reading involves multiple linguistic operations including processing of lexical and compositional semantics, and determining structural and grammatical relationships among words. Previous studies on Indo-European languages have associated left anterior temporal lobe (aTL) and left interior frontal gyrus (IFG) with reading sentences compared to reading unstructured word lists. To examine whether these brain regions are also involved in reading a typologically distinct language with limited morphosyntax and lack of agreement between sentential arguments, an FMRI study was conducted to compare passive reading of Chinese sentences, unstructured word lists and disconnected character lists that are created by only changing the order of an identical set of characters. Similar to previous findings from other languages, stronger activation was found in mainly left-lateralized anterior temporal regions (including aTL) for reading sentences compared to unstructured word and character lists. On the other hand, stronger activation was identified in left posterior temporal sulcus for reading unstructured words compared to unstructured characters. Furthermore, reading unstructured word lists compared to sentences evoked stronger activation in left IFG and left inferior parietal lobule. Consistent with the literature on Indo-European languages, the present results suggest that left anterior temporal regions subserve sentence-level integration, while left IFG supports restoration of sentence structure. In addition, left posterior temporal sulcus is associated with morphological compounding. Taken together, reading Chinese sentences engages a common network as reading other languages, with particular reliance on integration of semantic constituents."
https://openalex.org/W2774253640,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset neuromuscular disorder characterised by selective loss of motor neurons leading to fatal paralysis. Current therapeutic approaches are limited in their effectiveness. Substantial advances in understanding ALS disease mechanisms has come from the identification of pathogenic mutations in dominantly inherited familial ALS (FALS). We previously reported a coding mutation in D-amino acid oxidase (DAOR199W) associated with FALS. DAO metabolises D-serine, an essential co-agonist at the N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid glutamate receptor subtype (NMDAR). Using primary motor neuron cultures or motor neuron cell lines we demonstrated that expression of DAOR199W, promoted the formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, activated autophagy and increased apoptosis. The aim of this study was to characterise the effects of DAOR199W in vivo, using transgenic mice overexpressing DAOR199W. Marked abnormal motor features, e.g. kyphosis, were evident in mice expressing DAOR199W, which were associated with a significant loss (19%) of lumbar spinal cord motor neurons, analysed at 14 months. When separated by gender, this effect was greater in females (26%; p< 0.0132). In addition, we crossed the DAOR199W transgenic mouse line with the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS to determine whether the effects of SOD1G93A were potentiated in the double transgenic line (DAOR199W/SOD1G93A). Although overall survival was not affected, onset of neurological signs was significantly earlier in female double transgenic animals than their female SOD1G93A littermates (125 days vs 131 days, P = 0.0239). In summary, some significant in vivo effects of DAOR199W on motor neuron function (i.e. kyphosis and loss of motor neurons) were detected which were most marked in females and could contribute to the earlier onset of neurological signs in double transgenic females compared to SOD1G93A littermates, highlighting the importance of recognizing gender effects present in animal models of ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2774592029,"The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) family of proteins regulates gene expression, development, and differentiation. Although Arid5b has important functions in adipogenesis and chondrogenesis, theroleofArid5b in skeletal muscle myogenesis has not been investigated. Therefore, we isolated primary skeletal muscle cells from Arid5b+/+ and Arid5b−/− mice and characterized differentiation in these cells. We found that Arid5b−/− primary skeletal muscle cells showed differentiation defects and impaired sarcomeric assembly. Microarray analysis revealed down-regulation of the prostanoid biosynthesis pathway in Arid5b−/− myoblasts, including the genes encoding cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 (Ptgsl) and prostaglandin (PG)I synthase (Ptgis). Down-regulation of COX-1 and PGI synthase was confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Correspondingly, the production of PGI2, as measured by ELISA, was reduced in Arid5b−/− cells relative to Arid5b+/+ cells. Boyden chamber assays showed that migration was increased but chemotaxis was impaired in Arid5b−/− cells. Myoblast fusion was also inhibited in Arid5b−/− cells compared with Arid5b+/+ cells. Treatment with the PGI2 analog iloprost rescued the defects in myotube formation, migration, and fusion. These results demonstrate that Arid5b has a novel and essential role in skeletal muscle differentiation by regulating PGI2 production.— Murray, J., Whitson, R. H., Itakura, K.

https://openalex.org/W2775327080,"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), one of the most common acute otitis media (OM) pathogens, is postulated to promote middle-ear epithelial remodeling in the progression of OM from acute to chronic. The goal of this study was to examine early quantitative proteomic secretome effects of NTHi lysate exposure in a human middle-ear epithelial cell (HMEEC) line. NTHi lysates were used to stimulate HMEEC, and conditional quantitative stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture of cell secretions was performed. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 766 proteins across samples. Of interest, several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) were regulated by NTHi lysate treatment, especially hnRNP A2B1 and hnRNP Q, known to be implicated in microRNA (miRNA) packaging in exosomes. After purification, the presence of exosomes in HMEEC secretions was characterized by dynamic light scattering (<100 nm), transmission electron microscopy, and CD63/heat shock protein 70 positivity. hnRNP A2B1 and hnRNP Q were confirmed to be found in exosomes by Western blot and proteomic analysis. Finally, exosomal miRNA content comprised 110 unique miRNAs, with 5 found to be statistically induced by NTHi lysate (miR-378a-3p + miR-378i, miR-200a-3p, miR-378g, miR30d-5p, and miR-222-3p), all known to target innate immunity genes. This study demonstrates that NTHi lysates promote release of miRNA-laden exosomes from middle-ear epithelium in vitro. -Val, S., Krueger, A., Poley, M., Cohen, A., Brown, K., Panigrahi, A., Preciado, D.

https://openalex.org/W2771218583,"Hormonal changes that cause metabolic complications are a common problem in postmenopausal women. Adiponectin and osteocalcin are cytokines associated with glucose regulatory and insulin sensitized function in postmenopausal stages. The current study investigated the role of adiponectin signaling and osteocalcin mediated function in glucose metabolism in ovariectomized mice. In a mouse menopausal-related metabolic disorder model, overexpression of adiponectin receptor 1 improved glucose tolerance and caused resistance to body weight increase and decline of serum osteocalcin. Furthermore, adiponectin receptor 1 transgenic ovariectomized mice had higher GPRC6A (the putative osteocalcin receptor) expression in muscle tissue. Immunofluorescence indicated that GPRC6A and adiponectin receptor 1 were co-localized in mouse muscle tissues. The present finding suggested adiponectin receptor 1 can mediate the improvement of glucose metabolism by osteocalcin in ovariectomized mice. Our findings imply the possibility to ameliorate menopause-induced metabolic disorder by GPRC6A and adiponectin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2771993235,"Using a standardized instrument to evaluate patients' stress reactions has become more important in daily clinical routines. Different signs or symptoms of stress are often unilaterally explored: the physiological, psychological or social aspects of stress disorders are each viewed on a single dimension. However, all dimensions afflict patients who have persistent health problems due to chronic stress. Therefore, it is important to use a multidimensional approach to acquire data. The 'Psycho-Physiological-Stress-Test' (PPST) was established to achieve a comprehensive understanding of stress and was further developed at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin in collaboration with the Psychological Department of Freie Universität Berlin. The PPST includes a series of varying stress phases, embedded in two periods of rest. Physiological and psychological parameters are simultaneously measured throughout the test session. Specifically, the PPST activates the sympathetic stress axis, which is measured by heart rate, blood pressure, respiration depth and rate, electro dermal activation and muscle tension (frontalis, masseter, trapezius). Psychological data are simultaneously collected, and include performance, motivation, emotion and behavior. After conducting this diagnostic test, it is possible to identify individual stress patterns that can be discussed with the individual patient to develop and recommend (outpatient) treatment strategies. This paper introduces the PPST as a standardized way to evaluate stress reactions by presenting the results from a sample of psychosomatic inpatients (n = 139) who were treated in Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. We observed that the varying testing conditions provoked adjusted changes in the different physiological parameters and psychological levels."

However, management with repeated follow-up radiographs may result in infertility. The study aimed to evaluate the risk of infertility following pelvic fracture treated with pelvic angiographic embolization in female patients. We used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance of the Department of Health in Taiwan from the period of 1997-2010. A total of 36 and 18,029 patients were included in the case and control cohorts, respectively. The risk estimations for the case and control cohorts were compared using a Cox's proportional hazards regression model. The significance level was set at <0.05. After adjusting for possible confounding factors, the incidence of infertility in the case cohort was nearly 30.7-fold higher than that in the control cohort (adjust hazard ratio [HR] = 30.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.643-70.109). Patients between 15-35 years of age had a much higher incidence of infertility in the case cohort than in the control cohort (adjusted HR = 49.9, 95% CI = 15.177-64.099). Taken together, pelvic fractures in female patients treated with arterioembolization for haemostasis might be associated with a higher risk of infertility in Taiwan. Physicians should be aware of the link and inform patients of this risk prior to arterioembolization."
https://openalex.org/W2774590910,"Endogenously tagging proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP) enables the visualization of the tagged protein using live cell microscopy. GFP-tagging is widely utilized to study biological processes in model experimental organisms including filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans. Many strains of A. nidulans have therefore been generated with different proteins endogenously tagged with GFP. To further enhance experimental approaches based upon GFP-tagging, we have adapted the GFP Binding Protein (GBP) system for A. nidulans. GBP is a genetically encoded Llama single chain antibody against GFP which binds GFP with high affinity. Using gene replacement approaches, it is therefore possible to link GBP to anchor proteins, which will then retarget GFP-tagged proteins away from their normal location to the location of the anchor-GBP protein. To facilitate this approach in A. nidulans, we made four base plasmid cassettes that can be used to generate gene replacement GBP-tagging constructs by utilizing fusion PCR. Using these base cassettes, fusion PCR, and gene targeting approaches, we generated strains with SPA10-GBP and Tom20-GBP gene replacements. These strains enabled test targeting of GFP-tagged proteins to septa or to the surface of mitochondria respectively. SPA10-GBP is shown to effectively target GFP-tagged proteins to both forming and mature septa. Tom20-GBP has a higher capacity to retarget GFP-tagged proteins being able to relocate all Nup49-GFP from its location within nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to the cytoplasm in association with mitochondria. Notably, removal of Nup49-GFP from NPCs causes cold sensitivity as does deletion of the nup49 gene. The cassette constructs described facilitate experimental approaches to generate precise protein-protein linkages in fungi. The A. nidulans SPA10-GBP and Tom20-GBP strains can be utilized to modulate other GFP-tagged proteins of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2775264803,"QTc interval prolongation is a serious diabetic complication and increases mortality rate. Hyperglycemia inhibits the rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium channel currents (Ikr) and prolongs the QTc interval on electrocardiograms. Sevoflurane also inhibits the Ikr and causes QTc interval prolongation. In fact, torsade de pointes occurred in a patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus during sevoflurane anesthesia. We enrolled 74 patients, including 37 normoglycemic patients (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]: <6.5%) (NG group) and 37 chronically hyperglycemic patients (HbA1c: ≥6.5%) (HG group). Anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.3 μg/kg/min remifentanil, and maintained with 2% sevoflurane in 40% O2 and 0.2–0.3 μg/kg/min remifentanil. The QT interval and Tp-e interval (from the peak to the end of the T wave) were measured before and at 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the administration of sevoflurane and adjusted for the patient’s heart rate (QTc and Tp-ec, respectively). P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The QTc and the Tp-ec intervals of the two groups did not differ significantly before the administration of sevoflurane. The QTc interval gradually increased with time in both groups and was significantly longer than the baseline value at 10 min after the administration of sevoflurane in both groups. The QTc interval of the HG group was significantly longer than that of the NG group at 90 min and 120 min after the administration of sevoflurane. The Tp-ec interval was not affected by sevoflurane in either group.We have demonstrated that sevoflurane significantly prolongs the QTc interval, and that the extent of the prolongation is significantly greater in chronically hyperglycemic patients than in normoglycemic patients. Although Tp-ec is not affected by sevoflurane, it should be noted that the simultaneous blockade of potassium channels would increase the risk of arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2952763192,"An average mouse in midlife weighs between 25 and 30 g, with about a gram of tissue in the largest adipose depot (gonadal), and the weight of this depot differs between inbred strains. Specifically, C57BL/6ByJ mice have heavier gonadal depots on average than do 129P3/J mice. To understand the genetic contributions to this trait, we mapped several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for gonadal depot weight in an F2 intercross population. Our goal here was to fine-map one of these QTLs, Adip20 (formerly Adip5), on mouse chromosome 9. To that end, we analyzed the weight of the gonadal adipose depot from newly created congenic strains. Results from the sequential comparison method indicated at least four rather than one QTL; two of the QTLs were less than 0.5 Mb apart, with opposing directions of allelic effect. Different types of evidence (missense and regulatory genetic variation, human adiposity/body mass index orthologues, and differential gene expression) implicated numerous candidate genes from the four QTL regions. These results highlight the value of mouse congenic strains and the value of this sequential method to dissect challenging genetic architecture."

Surprisingly, the third stage, which appears to be critical for neural fate commitment, depends almost entirely on intracellular signaling."
