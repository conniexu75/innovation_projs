https://openalex.org/W2772792536,"R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG), produced at high levels by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) enzymes, was reported as an oncometabolite. We show here that R-2HG also exerts a broad anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting leukemia cell proliferation/viability and by promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, R-2HG inhibits fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) activity, thereby increasing global N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification in R-2HG-sensitive leukemia cells, which in turn decreases the stability of MYC/CEBPA transcripts, leading to the suppression of relevant pathways. Ectopically expressed mutant IDH1 and S-2HG recapitulate the effects of R-2HG. High levels of FTO sensitize leukemic cells to R-2HG, whereas hyperactivation of MYC signaling confers resistance that can be reversed by the inhibition of MYC signaling. R-2HG also displays anti-tumor activity in glioma. Collectively, while R-2HG accumulated in IDH1/2 mutant cancers contributes to cancer initiation, our work demonstrates anti-tumor effects of 2HG in inhibiting proliferation/survival of FTO-high cancer cells via targeting FTO/m6A/MYC/CEBPA signaling."

However, drugs are tested in clinical trials on genetically diverse patient populations. We show here that patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action are sufficient to explain the superiority of many FDA-approved drug combinations in the absence of drug synergy or additivity. This is also true for combinations tested in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a combination exhibiting independent drug action, each patient benefits solely from the drug to which his or her tumor is most sensitive, with no added benefit from other drugs. Even when drug combinations exhibit additivity or synergy in pre-clinical models, patient-to-patient variability and low cross-resistance make independent action the dominant mechanism in clinical populations.

This insight represents a different way to interpret trial data and a different way to design combination therapies. The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of human cancers poses a substantial obstacle to effective therapy. Heterogeneity in drug response from one cell to the next within a single tumor (within-tumor heterogeneity) contributes to disease progression and drug resistance in each patient. Heterogeneity among patients (between-tumor heterogeneity) makes the effectiveness of therapy difficult to predict, even for patients whose tumors carry the best-available response biomarkers. Overcoming within-tumor heterogeneity was an early rationale for combination cancer therapy: Law, 1952Law L.W.

Early clinical tests of sequential and combination regimens demonstrated that this logic was also applicable to between-tumor heterogeneity: patients whose cancers did not respond to one drug had a chance of responding to a second, different drug (Frei et al., 1961Frei 3rd, E. Freireich E.J. Gehan E. Pinkel D. Holland J.F. Selawry O. Haurani F. Spurr C.L. Hayes D.M.

In pharmacological terms, drugs in such a combination exhibit “independent action” whereby the response of an individual patient to two (or more) drugs equals the response to the more effective drug alone with no additional benefit from the less effective drug (with benefit measured by tumor shrinkage or duration of progression-free survival [PFS]). Independent drug action assumes no pharmacological interaction (neither additivity nor synergy) and is equivalent to Gaddum’s 1940 definition of non-interaction (STAR Methods; Gaddum, 1940Gaddum J.H. Pharmacology.First Edition. Oxford University Press, 1940Google Scholar). Since then, clinical and pre-clinical studies have confirmed that any single drug may be active in a subset of tumors (Brugarolas et al., 2003Brugarolas J. Clark J.W. Chabner B. Using “rationally designed drugs” rationally.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1758-1759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, Pritchard et al., 2013Pritchard J.R. Bruno P.M.

USA. 2013; 110: E170-E179Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that individual tumors can be more sensitive to one drug in a combination than others (reflecting their sensitivity to the drugs given individually). Many targeted therapies are currently combined based on molecular reasoning about the functions of targets (Kummar et al., 2010Kummar S. Chen H.X. Wright J. Holbeck S. Millin M.D. Tomaszewski J. Zweibel J. Collins J. Doroshow J.H. Utilizing targeted cancer therapeutic agents in combination: novel approaches and urgent requirements.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 843-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or evidence of additive or synergistic effects in cell line and animal models. Clinical trials based on molecular reasoning have been successful: for example, co-inhibition of BRAF and MEK in the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma (Long et al., 2014Long G.V. Stroyakovskiy D. Gogas H. Levchenko E. de Braud F. Larkin J. Garbe C. Jouary T. Hauschild A. Grob J.J. et al.Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition versus BRAF inhibition alone in melanoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 1877-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the concept of drug independence and its distinction from additivity or synergy has been lost over time; a drug combination that is clinically superior (e.g., on a Kaplan-Meier plot) is generally called additive or synergistic even in the absence of a quantitative test of pharmacological interaction (such as Loewe Additivity or Bliss independence, which are applicable to cell culture experiments, but not clinical trials) (Eder et al., 2010Eder J.P. Hait W.N. Frei 3rd, E. Grochow L.B. Principles of Dose, Schedule, and Combination Chemotherapy.in: Hong W.K. Holland Frei Cancer Medicine 8. People’s Medical Pub. House, 2010Google Scholar). Distinguishing between drug interaction (additivity or synergy) and drug independence is important because the two are profoundly different at a mechanistic level; in the former case, benefit is conferred at the level of individual patients due to drug interaction within tumor cells, and in the latter case, benefit is conferred only at the level of patient populations due to variability in drug responses. The distinction influences the interpretation of clinical trial data, the choice between sequential and simultaneous treatment, and the design of new drug combinations. In this paper, we attempt to distinguish between drug interaction and independence in three complementary ways: (1) by re-analyzing human clinical trial data in which single and combination therapies are compared, (2) by mining a database of drug responses for patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs), which are generally regarded as the best available animal surrogate of human cancer (DeRose et al., 2011DeRose Y.S. Wang G. Lin Y.C. Bernard P.S. Buys S.S. Ebbert M.T. Factor R. Matsen C.

Remarkably, for many effective and approved combinations, we conclude that therapeutic benefit is likely to arise from independent drug action rather than drug additivity or synergy. This analysis identifies occasional cases of truly synergistic drug interactions and provides an alternative approach to designing new sequential or combination treatment regimens. The observed responsiveness of human melanomas to ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) individually and in combination demonstrates the benefits achievable with drug independence. In a recent phase III trial, 24% and 54% of patients (respectively) having previously untreated disease exhibited an objective response to one or the other drug (≥ 30% reduction in volume of a reference lesion), while the remaining patients experienced little or no benefit (Figure 1A) (Larkin et al., 2015Larkin J. Chiarion-Sileni V. Gonzalez R. Grob J.J. Cowey C.L. Lao C.D. Schadendorf D. Dummer R. Smylie M. Rutkowski P. et al.Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab or Monotherapy in Untreated Melanoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (5160) Google Scholar). When ipilimumab and nivolumab were tested in combination, median PFS increased from 3 or 7 months on monotherapy to >12 months on combination therapy—a highly significant improvement. Importantly, combination doses were equal to monotherapy doses except for the first two cycles of nivolumab (dosing for all trials analyzed in this paper is described in Table S1). Anticipated benefits under the assumption of drug independence were calculated by (1) assigning each simulated patient a magnitude of response for each drug individually based on random sampling from the clinically observed monotherapy response distributions and (2) assuming no additive or synergistic effect so that each patient’s response equals the better one of their two single-agent responses (Figures 1A [tumor volume change], 1B [PFS], and S1). This is equivalent to the benefit that would accrue were it possible to give each patient the better of the two drugs for her/his individual tumor. In the case of ipilimumab plus nivolumab, independent action predicts a median PFS of 14 months, similar to what was observed clinically. What is unexpected in this example is the large and clinically significant benefit that can be achieved by independent drug action.Figure S1Procedure for Randomly Sampling Monotherapy Responses, Related to Figures 1 and 4Show full captionFor illustrative purposes, the procedure is here applied to a subset of 40 responses each to Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab plus Nivolumab in previously untreated melanoma (Larkin et al., 2015Larkin J.

Here responses are assigned randomly (no correlation in response), but in the first step the simulated patients’ responses can instead be assigned with a positive correlation in response.The same procedure applies to the simulation of progression free survival (Figures 1B and 4), taking the longest duration of progression free survival out of two responses per patient.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For illustrative purposes, the procedure is here applied to a subset of 40 responses each to Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab plus Nivolumab in previously untreated melanoma (Larkin et al., 2015Larkin J.

Here responses are assigned randomly (no correlation in response), but in the first step the simulated patients’ responses can instead be assigned with a positive correlation in response. The same procedure applies to the simulation of progression free survival (Figures 1B and 4), taking the longest duration of progression free survival out of two responses per patient. First principles reasoning establishes that the benefits conferred by independent drug action depend on patient-to-patient variability in responsiveness to the drugs making up the combination and the degree to which responsiveness is correlated. Across all of the trials we examined, the distribution of PFS is broad and approximately log normal (a bell-shaped distribution on a logarithmic timescale). Even when patients are stratified by the best available genetic biomarkers, PFS can have coefficient of variation (CV) as large as 100% (Figure S2). When drug responses are uncorrelated (ρ = 0), the benefits of independent drug action are maximal because each patient has two fully separate chances of above-average response. No benefit is predicted at ρ = 1.0, which corresponds to complete cross-resistance (Figure 1C). The effects of ipilimumab and nivolumab in clinical trials are most consistent with weakly correlated responses (low cross-resistance; ρ ≈ 0.25; Figures 1B, black line, and 1C, black dot); for example, the benefits of targeting PD-1 alone are similar whether or not CTLA-4 has previously been targeted (Hamid et al., 2013Hamid O. Robert C. Daud A. Hodi F.S. Hwu W.J. Kefford R. Wolchok J.D. Hersey P. Joseph R.W. Weber J.S. et al.Safety and tumor responses with lambrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in melanoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 369: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). PDX studies comparing the responsiveness of a single tumor to multiple drugs provide the most direct means to determine ρ. In PDX studies by Gao et al., 2015Gao H. Korn J.M. Ferretti S. Monahan J.E. Wang Y. Singh M. Zhang C. Schnell C. Yang G. Zhang Y. et al.High-throughput screening using patient-derived tumor xenografts to predict clinical trial drug response.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1318-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, xenografts of 6 tumor types from 277 patients were exposed to 1 of 62 monotherapies or combination therapies. Across >400 treatment models tested in replicates (net > 2000 animals), fewer than 10% of biological replicates differed by >1 RECIST category, showing that response was reproducible across animals and making comparison of each tumor’s response to different drugs feasible. Tumor type (tissue of origin) was poorly predictive of optimal therapy: the drug conferring the greatest average benefit for each class of tumor proved to be optimal for only 49% of individual tumors, with 51% of tumors demonstrating substantially longer PFS on a different drug (a minimum increase in PFS of 4 and average of 12 weeks) (Figure S3A). Thus, like human patients, mice carrying PDX tumors benefit from a “precision medicine” approach in which therapy is informed by data other than tissue of origin. The observed correlation in response for all drugs tested by Gao et al. was ρ = 0.37 (average), with lower correlation between targeted and cytotoxic drugs (average ρ = 0.28) and higher correlation between drugs with related targets (average ρ = 0.51) (Figure 2A and STAR Methods). All of these values are within the range over which independent action can improve PFS.Figure 2PDX Data Show that Because Different Tumors Respond to Different Drugs, Independent Drug Action Is Sufficient for a Combination Therapy to Improve Response Distribution in a PopulationShow full caption(A) Correlations in drug response (Spearman’s ρ applied to PFS) were calculated from PDX trials where the same tumors receive many different treatments (Gao et al., 2015Gao H.

See also Figure S3 and Data S1. PDX studies clearly illustrate how independent action can provide therapeutic benefit. For example, in the case of mice bearing one of 41 unique gastric PDX cancers, 27% of tumors demonstrated PFS of 3 months or more when treated with alpelisib (a PI3K inhibitor in Phase III trials), as did 17% of tumors treated with LLM871 (a pre-clinical FGFR2/4 antibody-drug conjugate) (Gao et al., 2015Gao H. Korn J.M. Ferretti S. Monahan J.E. Wang Y. Singh M. Zhang C. Schnell C. Yang G. Zhang Y. et al.High-throughput screening using patient-derived tumor xenografts to predict clinical trial drug response.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1318-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). However, found among 26 tumor xenografts with below-average responses to alpelisib, were 5 of the 7 tumors with the greatest responses to LLM871 (response correlation Spearman’s ρ = 0.28; Figure 2B). The combination of alpelisib plus LLM871 is therefore expected, under a model of drug independence, to provide significantly greater benefit than either drug alone (41% survival at 3 months; hazard ratio versus alpelisib alone 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 1.00; p = 0.05; n = 41 xenografts; Figure 2C), simply because poor responders to alpelisib have a chance of responding well to LLM871. Gao et al. observed that across all drugs and tumor types, combination therapies were broadly superior to monotherapies. Focusing on the most systematic subset of these data (Figure S3B), we find that drug independence can quantitatively account for almost all of this superiority (Figures 3A–3C ). Except in the case of melanoma PDXs (discussed at the end of this section), the benefit predicted for randomly selected pairs of monotherapies was not significantly different from the average benefit observed with empirically tested combinations (hazard ratio for combinations versus random monotherapy pairs 1.13; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38; p = 0.23; n = 197 PDXs) (Figures 3A, 3B, S4A, and S4B). As the number of drugs in the combination increases, benefit is predicted to increase, but with diminishing returns (Figure 3D), consistent with trials showing that more intensive combination regimens do not necessarily confer additional benefit (Bookman et al., 2009Bookman M.A. Brady M.F.

Zhang Y. et al.High-throughput screening using patient-derived tumor xenografts to predict clinical trial drug response.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1318-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, response rates (frequency of stable disease, partial, or complete response) within a tumor type for monotherapy (light green) is inferior to response rate for combinations (blue) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, p < 10−5, n = 85 monotherapy treatments of a tumor-type; 33 combination treatments of a tumor-type). In each tumor type we selected random pairs of the tested monotherapies, and assumed independent drug action, such that each PDX responds to a hypothetical combination only if it responds to one of the constituent drugs. The response rate in random pairs of monotherapies was not significantly different from the observed response rate with combinations (KS test, p = 0.39, n = 33 observed combination treatments; 3300 random pairs of monotherapies), but significantly superior to observed monotherapies (KS test, p < 10−13). Historical data on animal-to-animal reproducibility in RECIST response was reported by Gao et al., being a table of how often the consensus response (PD = progressive disease, SD = stable disease, PR = partial response, CR = complete response) in a treatment model (a specific treatment of a specific PDX) was measured in replicate mice as a different response (see Gao et al., 2015Gao H.

Med. 2015; 21: 1318-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar; Figure 2A). We used this data to create an error model for the effects of animal-to-animal variability, by replacing each observed response in monotherapy treatments of each PDX cohort with a response according to this table of probabilities. When each PDX’s response to a monotherapy is replaced with the best of two responses drawn from this error model (as when simulating the effects of random pairs of monotherapies), the resulting response rate (dark green) is not significantly different from the observed response to monotherapies (KS test, p = 0.13, n = 85 monotherapy treatments).(B) Only in melanoma PDXs were experimentally tested combination therapies superior to random pairs of monotherapies.

Analyzing individual tumor types, only in melanoma are combinations significantly superior (hazard ratio versus random pairs of monotherapies 0.30; 95% C.I. 0.18 to 0.52; p < 10−4; n = 42); this is consistent with evidence of synergy in the drug combinations tested in melanoma (D). Analyzing PDXs from all tumor types other than melanoma, there is no trend in favor of combinations (hazard ratio versus random pairs of monotherapies 1.13; 95% C.I. 0.93 to 1.39; p = 0.21; n = 197).(C) The best achievable responses with monotherapies and with combinations are equivalent, except for synergy in melanomas.

A potential limitation of this data is that some drugs were only tested as monotherapies and never in a combination, and some drugs were only tested as part of a combination and never as a monotherapy. Top (all tumors): Here this analysis is repeated considering only those therapies that were tested both as a monotherapy and as a component of a combination on the same tumor type; this yields 42 monotherapy trials and 24 combination trials. Across all tumor types, optimally chosen combinations trend toward superiority over monotherapies (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% C.I. 0.70 to 1.01; p = 0.07; n = 230). This trend is exclusively driven by melanoma where combinations were identified that strongly surpassed the effect of independent drug action (D). Bottom (all tumors except melanoma): In all tumor types other than melanoma, optimally chosen combinations lack any superiority over optimally chosen monotherapies (hazard ratio 1.08; 95% C.I. 0.89 to 1.33; p = 0.42; n = 197).(D) Independent drug action provides a reference for the identification of synergy in survival data. Synergistic drug combinations are defined in cell culture studies by having effects greater than the sum of their parts (commonly according to Loewe’s isobologram analysis, Chou and Talalay, or Bliss (Berenbaum, 1989Berenbaum M.C. What is synergy?.Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 93-141PubMed Google Scholar)). However, a definition of ‘sum of parts’ has not been apparent for clinical trial data (summing months of survival would be absurd). Here our model of independent drug action defines a ‘null-hypothesis’ of no interaction to identify drug combinations producing genuinely enhanced potency.

https://openalex.org/W2774455409,"Natural genetic variation in the human genome is a cause of individual differences in responses to medications and is an underappreciated burden on public health. Although 108 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets of 475 (∼34%) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and account for a global sales volume of over 180 billion US dollars annually, the prevalence of genetic variation among GPCRs targeted by drugs is unknown. By analyzing data from 68,496 individuals, we find that GPCRs targeted by drugs show genetic variation within functional regions such as drug- and effector-binding sites in the human population. We experimentally show that certain variants of μ-opioid and Cholecystokinin-A receptors could lead to altered or adverse drug response. By analyzing UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data, we suggest that characterizing GPCR variants could increase prescription precision, improving patients' quality of life, and relieve the economic and societal burden due to variable drug responsiveness.

https://openalex.org/W2775812132,"The coupled interaction between slow-wave oscillations and sleep spindles during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep has been proposed to support memory consolidation. However, little evidence in humans supports this theory. Moreover, whether such dynamic coupling is impaired as a consequence of brain aging in later life, contributing to cognitive and memory decline, is unknown. Combining electroencephalography (EEG), structural MRI, and sleep-dependent memory assessment, we addressed these questions in cognitively normal young and older adults. Directional cross-frequency coupling analyses demonstrated that the slow wave governs a precise temporal coordination of sleep spindles, the quality of which predicts overnight memory retention. Moreover, selective atrophy within the medial frontal cortex in older adults predicted a temporal dispersion of this slow wave-spindle coupling, impairing overnight memory consolidation and leading to forgetting. Prefrontal-dependent deficits in the spatiotemporal coordination of NREM sleep oscillations therefore represent one pathway explaining age-related memory decline."
https://openalex.org/W2772147257,"Stem cells are highly resistant to viral infection compared to their differentiated progeny; however, the mechanism is mysterious. Here, we analyzed gene expression in mammalian stem cells and cells at various stages of differentiation. We find that, conserved across species, stem cells express a subset of genes previously classified as interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) but that expression is intrinsic, as stem cells are refractory to interferon. This intrinsic ISG expression varies in a cell-type-specific manner, and many ISGs decrease upon differentiation, at which time cells become IFN responsive, allowing induction of a broad spectrum of ISGs by IFN signaling. Importantly, we show that intrinsically expressed ISGs protect stem cells against viral infection. We demonstrate the in vivo importance of intrinsic ISG expression for protecting stem cells and their differentiation potential during viral infection. These findings have intriguing implications for understanding stem cell biology and the evolution of pathogen resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2771184879,"Large-scale transcriptome sequencing efforts have vastly expanded the catalog of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with varying evolutionary conservation, lineage expression, and cancer specificity. Here, we functionally characterize a novel ultraconserved lncRNA, THOR (ENSG00000226856), which exhibits expression exclusively in testis and a broad range of human cancers. THOR knockdown and overexpression in multiple cell lines and animal models alters cell or tumor growth supporting an oncogenic role. We discovered a conserved interaction of THOR with IGF2BP1 and show that THOR contributes to the mRNA stabilization activities of IGF2BP1. Notably, transgenic THOR knockout produced fertilization defects in zebrafish and also conferred a resistance to melanoma onset. Likewise, ectopic expression of human THOR in zebrafish accelerated the onset of melanoma. THOR represents a novel class of functionally important cancer/testis lncRNAs whose structure and function have undergone positive evolutionary selection."
https://openalex.org/W2771082365,"Summary Genetics and neuropathology strongly link α-synuclein aggregation and neurotoxicity to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related α-synucleinopathies. Here we describe a new Drosophila model of α-synucleinopathy based on widespread expression of wild-type human α-synuclein, which shows robust neurodegeneration, early-onset locomotor deficits, and abundant α-synuclein aggregation. We use results of forward genetic screening and genetic analysis in our new model to demonstrate that α-synuclein expression promotes reorganization of the actin filament network and consequent mitochondrial dysfunction through altered Drp1 localization. Similar changes are present in a mouse α-synucleinopathy model and in postmortem brain tissue from patients with α-synucleinopathy. Importantly, we provide evidence that the interaction of α-synuclein with spectrin initiates pathological alteration of the actin cytoskeleton and downstream neurotoxicity. These findings suggest new therapeutic approaches for α-synuclein induced neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2775096538,"Eukaryotic 60S ribosomal subunits are comprised of three rRNAs and ∼50 ribosomal proteins. The initial steps of their formation take place in the nucleolus, but, owing to a lack of structural information, this process is poorly understood. Using cryo-EM, we solved structures of early 60S biogenesis intermediates at 3.3 Å to 4.5 Å resolution, thereby providing insights into their sequential folding and assembly pathway. Besides revealing distinct immature rRNA conformations, we map 25 assembly factors in six different assembly states. Notably, the Nsa1-Rrp1-Rpf1-Mak16 module stabilizes the solvent side of the 60S subunit, and the Erb1-Ytm1-Nop7 complex organizes and connects through Erb1's meandering N-terminal extension, eight assembly factors, three ribosomal proteins, and three 25S rRNA domains. Our structural snapshots reveal the order of integration and compaction of the six major 60S domains within early nucleolar 60S particles developing stepwise from the solvent side around the exit tunnel to the central protuberance."

We found that NKT cells, a population of innate-like T lymphocytes, are critical for the induction of B cell immunity upon viral infection. The positioning of NKT cells at the interfollicular areas of lymph nodes facilitates both their direct priming by resident macrophages and the localized delivery of innate signals to antigen-experienced B cells.

Importantly, the requirement of this innate immunity arm appears to be evolutionarily conserved because early NKT and IL-4 gene signatures also positively correlate with the levels of neutralizing antibodies in Zika-virus-infected macaques.

In conclusion, our data support a model wherein a pre-TfH wave of IL-4 secreted by interfollicular NKT cells triggers the seeding of germinal center cells and serves as an innate link between viral infection and B cell immunity. B cells are key elements of the adaptive immune response because they provide protection from pathogenic threats through the production of highly specific antibodies. In the past few years, there has been much attention on the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable or emerging pathogens, such as influenza, HIV, and Zika virus to develop effective vaccines capable of conferring broad and long-lasting immunity. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how viruses elicit B cell immunity during an infection process. Pathogen recognition occurs in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes (Batista and Harwood, 2009Batista F.D. Harwood N.E. The who, how and where of antigen presentation to B cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the lymph nodes, B cells recognize pathogens on the surface of subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages, migratory dendritic cells, and follicular dendritic cells (Carrasco and Batista, 2007Carrasco Y.R.

Extrafollicular activation of lymph node B cells by antigen-bearing dendritic cells.Science. 2006; 312: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Following pathogen recognition, B cells process and present pathogen-derived peptides via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules (Amigorena et al., 1994Amigorena S. Drake J.R. Webster P. Mellman I. Transient accumulation of new class II MHC molecules in a novel endocytic compartment in B lymphocytes.Nature. 1994; 369: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This results in the recruitment of specific CD4+ T cells, which help the B cells to differentiate into either antibody-secreting plasma cells or germinal center (GC) cells. Within germinal centers, B cells undergo class-switch recombination and cycles of proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and affinity-based selection, finally resulting in the production of high-affinity antibodies (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012Victora G.D. Nussenzweig M.C. Germinal centers.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). These processes are strictly dependent on co-stimulatory signals, mainly CD40-L, ICOS, and cytokines, such as interferon γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and IL-21, provided by follicular helper T (TfH) cells (Weinstein et al., 2016Weinstein J.S. Herman E.I. Lainez B. Licona-Limón P. Esplugues E. Flavell R. Craft J. TFH cells progressively differentiate to regulate the germinal center response.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because TfH cells are known to appear later during the immune response, how B cells initially seed germinal center reactions is still unclear. In addition to pathogen-derived peptides, B cells are able to present glycolipid antigens, such as those present on the surface of Sphingomonas species (spp.), Borrelia burgdorferi, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, on CD1d molecules (Barral et al., 2008Barral P. Eckl-Dorna J. Harwood N.E. De Santo C. Salio M. Illarionov P. Besra G.S. Cerundolo V. Batista F.D.

Populations of CD1d-restricted, innate-like T cells, known as natural killer (NK)T cells, recognize these lipids and provide cognate help to B cells. This NKT cell-mediated help enhances the production of antibodies by B cells (Bai et al., 2013Bai L. Deng S. Reboulet R. Mathew R. Teyton L. Savage P.B. Bendelac A.

NK T cells provide lipid antigen-specific cognate help for B cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8339-8344Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because there are no reports of lipid antigens originating from viruses, it is currently unclear whether NKT cells have a role in inducing antiviral B cell responses. Here we show that, following respiratory viral infection, NKT cell-deficient mice are impaired in their ability to form germinal centers and immunoglobulin G (IgG) class-switched antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). In a striking contrast to B cell activation by glycolipid antigens, CD1d-mediated interactions between B cells and NKT cells are dispensable during viral infection. Instead, NKT cells promote B cell immunity through the early and localized production of IL-4 at the follicular borders, a process that is likely driven by CXCR3 and requires initial priming by resident macrophages through CD1d and IL-18. Importantly, this seems to be a conserved process because transcriptomic analysis of Zika-virus-infected macaques shows that early NKT and IL-4 gene signatures positively correlate with the levels of Zika-specific neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, our results indicate that the production of IL-4 by NKT cells immediately after viral infection contributes to a pre-TfH IL-4 wave at the follicular borders that facilitates the initial seeding of germinal center cells. The role of NKT cells in inducing the humoral response to glycolipid-bearing antigens has been established (Bai et al., 2013Bai L. Deng S. Reboulet R. Mathew R. Teyton L. Savage P.B. Bendelac A. Natural killer T (NKT)-B-cell interactions promote prolonged antibody responses and long-term memory to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

NK T cells provide lipid antigen-specific cognate help for B cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8339-8344Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); however, because virus-derived lipid antigens are unknown, we sought to investigate the role of NKT cells in the induction of B cell responses during viral infections. Accordingly, we intranasally infected C57BL/6 wild-type and CD1d−/− mice, which lack CD1d and type I and II NKT cells, with 200 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of influenza A virus, Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain. After 7, 9, and 21 days of infection, lung-draining lymph nodes were harvested, and adaptive immune response development was assessed by flow cytometry. We observed a progressive expansion of Fas+GL7+ germinal center cells and CXCR5+PD-1+ TfH cells during the course of infection in wild-type animals compared with uninfected ones (Figures 1A and 1B ; Figures S1A–S1D). Interestingly, the formation of germinal center cells was significantly reduced in NKT cell-deficient mice at early time points, whereas the expansion TfH cells remained similar throughout the infection process (Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1A–S1D). We further compared the spatial organization of germinal centers in wild-type and CD1d−/− mice by immunohistochemistry. In wild-type animals, influenza infection induces both the enlargement of IgD+ B cell follicles as well as the formation of follicular GL7+ structures corresponding to germinal centers (Figure 1C). In contrast, in NKT cell-deficient animals, germinal center structures were reduced by day 9 of infection, a defect that was accompanied by a strong decrease in the generation of influenza-specific IgG1 ASCs (Figures 1C–1E). Interestingly, CD1d−/− mice also displayed a significant reduction in germinal center formation when infected with the vaccinia virus Western Reserve strain, suggesting that the ability of NKT cells to promote B cell responses is a general feature of viral infections (Figures 1F and 1G).Figure S1NKT Cell-Deficient Mice Display Early Impairment in B Cell Immunity, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–D) Flow cytometry analysis of mediastinal lymph node cells from wild type or CD1d−/− mice that were intranasally infected with 200 PFU of influenza virus for (A-B) 7 or (C-D) 21 days.

To address whether NKT cells would also induce B cell immunity after vaccination with viral antigens, we intranasally immunized wild-type and CD1d−/− mice with hemagglutinin (HA) trimmer from the PR8 influenza strain in the presence or absence of two different adjuvants: alpha-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) or poly(I:C). We found that HA-specific germinal centers developed in lung-draining lymph nodes only when HA was administered together with either of these adjuvants (Figures S1E and S1F). Interestingly, the formation of HA-specific germinal centers and ASCs is completely abrogated in NKT-cell-deficient mice when α-GalCer was co-administered, demonstrating that NKT cells are essential to induce B cell immunity when exogenous glycolipids are used as adjuvants (Figures S1G and S1H). In addition, when poly(I:C) was co-administered, we observed a diminution in the number of IgM ASCs and a consistent, although non-significant, reduction in HA-specific germinal centers in CD1d−/− animals. These results indicate that NKT cells may also enhance B cell immunity during intranasal vaccination in the absence of exogenous glycolipids (Figures S1I and S1J). Having shown that CD1d−/− mice have diminished B cell responses during influenza and vaccinia virus infection, we sought to determine the mechanism by which NKT cells help B cells to mount an antiviral immune response. In the case of bacterium-derived glycolipids, NKT cells differentiate into CXCR5+PD-1+Bcl6+ follicular helper NKT (NKTfH) cells, which engage in CD1d-mediated cognate interactions with B cells, produce IL-21, and support germinal center responses (Chang et al., 2011Chang P.-P. Barral P. Fitch J. Pratama A. Ma C.S. Kallies A. Hogan J.J. Cerundolo V. Tangye S.G.

To address whether NKT cells differentiate into NKTfH cells after viral infection, wild-type mice were intranasally infected with influenza virus, and mediastinal lymph nodes were harvested after 0–9 days. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that, although conventional CD4+ T cells gradually express CXCR5, PD-1, Bcl6, and SLAM and produce high levels of IL-21 after infection, TCRβ+CD1d-tetramer+ NKT cells do not upregulate Bcl6, CXCR5, or PD-1 and express moderate levels of SLAM and IL-21 (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figures S2A–S2D). These results indicate that NKT cells do not acquire NKTfH cell phenotype after viral infection.Figure S2Expression Analysis of TfH Markers by NKT Cells and Strategy for the Generation of CD1d-Floxed ESCs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Flow cytometry gating strategy for the analysis of NKT cells (TCRβ+ CD1d tetramer+), CD4+ T cells (TCRβ+ CD1d tetramer- CD4+) and TfH cells (TCRβ+ CD1d tetramer- CD4+ CXCR5+ PD-1+) in mediastinal lymph nodes at day 9 of influenza infection.(B) RT-qPCR analysis of IL-21 expression at day 3 and 9 of influenza infection by sorted NKT and TfH cells compared to CD4+ cells.(C and D) Representative contour plots show the expression of (C) Bcl-6 and (D) SLAM by NKT, TfH and CD4+ T cells at day 3 and 9 of infection.

To further explore the localization of NKT cells within the tissues of infected mice, we stained mediastinal lymph nodes of wild-type mice with R-phycoerythrin-labeled, PBS-57-loaded CD1d-tetramer as reported previously (Lee et al., 2015Lee Y.J. Wang H. Starrett G.J. Phuong V. Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Tissue-Specific Distribution of iNKT Cells Impacts Their Cytokine Response.Immunity. 2015; 43: 566-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Lymph node sections were further stained for GL7 and analyzed by confocal microscopy. We found that tetramer-labeled cells localized in the periphery of GL7+ areas, whereas almost no tetramer-labeled cells were found inside these GL7+ areas (Figure 2C). This observation indicates that NKT cells are excluded from the germinal center after viral infection. To directly address whether CD1d-mediated cognate interaction between B cells and NKT cells is required for the development of the antiviral B cell response, we generated CD1dflox/flox mice to delete CD1d specifically on B cells. To this end, two loxP sites were inserted, flanking exon 3 of CD1d, and CD1dflox/flox mice were then crossed with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the promoter of CD19 or Mb1 genes (Figure 2D; Figures S2E–S2H). Deletion of CD1d was observed in approximately 80% of B cells in CD1dflox/floxCD19-Cre+ mice and in 100% of B cells in CD1dflox/floxMb1-Cre+ mice, indicating that the Mb1-Cre system is a more efficient tool to delete CD1d on B cells (Figures 2E–2G). Then, groups of CD1dflox/floxCD19-Cre+ and CD1dflox/floxMb1-Cre+ and their corresponding Cre− littermates were intranasally infected with influenza virus, and mediastinal lymph nodes were harvested after 9 days. The formation of germinal centers and TfH cells was similar in CD1dflox/flox CD19-Cre− and CD19-Cre+ mice and in CD1dflox/flox Mb1-Cre− and Mb1-Cre+ animals, indicating that CD1d-mediated interactions between B cells and NKT cells are not required for the development of germinal centers during viral infection (Figures 2H–2K). One mechanism by which NKT cells might initiate antiviral B cell immunity in a non-cognate manner is likely to be via the production of B cell-modulatory cytokines. To examine the ability of NKT cells to produce these molecules, we first assessed their kinetics of activation after influenza infection by measuring the levels of the surface activation marker CD69. We observed that, although most NKT cells were negative for CD69 in uninfected mice (day 0), the number of CD69+ NKT cells peaked 3 days after infection, indicating that activated NKT cells accumulated early after viral challenge (Figure 3A). Interestingly, influenza infection not only results in an upregulation of activation markers but also in a robust production of IFN-γ and IL-4, with a similar percentage of NKT cells producing either cytokine (Figure 3B; Figure S3A). Notably, even though NKT cells produce IFN-γ after infection, they represent only 1% of the total IFN-γ+ cell population in lymph nodes (Figure 3C). In striking contrast, NKT cells represent up to 50%–70% of the total IL-4+ cells after influenza infection (Figure 3C); however, we did not detect NKT cell production of other type 2 cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13 (Figure S3B). These observations demonstrate that, although the population of NKT cells is much smaller than those of conventional T cells, they represent the main source of IL-4 in lymph nodes at the early stages of influenza infection.Figure S3Analysis of the NKT Cell Source of IL-4, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Quantification of IFN-γ+ (blue) and IL-4+ (red) producing lymph node (left chart) or NKT cells (right chart) in mediastinal lymph nodes after 3 days of influenza infection.(B) RT-qPCR analysis of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 expression at day 3 of influenza infection by sorted NKT cells compared to CD4+ T cells.

Previous studies have shown that TfH cells constitute essentially all of the IL-4-producing T cells in draining lymph nodes after infection (King and Mohrs, 2009King I.L. Mohrs M.

Here, we show that ablation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 improves insulin sensitivity, protects against diet-induced obesity, and elicits the browning of white adipose tissue. Mechanistic studies define bone marrow cells as the source of the IL-10 signal and adipocytes as the target cell type mediating these effects. IL-10 receptor alpha is highly enriched in mature adipocytes and is induced in response to differentiation, obesity, and aging. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq reveal that IL-10 represses the transcription of thermogenic genes in adipocytes by altering chromatin accessibility and inhibiting ATF and C/EBPβ recruitment to key enhancer regions. These findings expand our understanding of the relationship between inflammatory signaling pathways and adipose tissue function and provide insight into the physiological control of thermogenesis that could inform future therapy."

Here, through electrophysiological recordings, we investigated fast sensory processing across multiple cortical areas as mice learned to lick a reward spout in response to a brief deflection of a single whisker. Sensory-evoked signals were absent from medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus in naive mice, but developed with task learning and correlated with behavioral performance in mice trained in the detection task. The sensory responses in medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus occurred with short latencies of less than 50 ms after whisker deflection. Pharmacological and optogenetic inactivation of medial prefrontal cortex or dorsal hippocampus impaired behavioral performance. Neuronal activity in medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus thus appears to contribute directly to task performance, perhaps providing top-down control of learned, context-dependent transformation of sensory input into goal-directed motor output."

Much of our understanding of their functional properties comes from voltage-clamp analysis, the predominant approach for investigating synaptic physiology. Here, we reveal that voltage clamp is completely ineffective for most excitatory synapses due to spine electrical compartmentalization. Under local dendritic voltage clamp, single-spine activation produced large spine head depolarizations that severely distorted measurements and recruited voltage-dependent channels. To overcome these voltage-clamp errors, we developed an approach to provide new, accurate measurements of synaptic conductance. Single-synapse AMPA conductance was much larger than previously appreciated, producing saturation effects on synaptic currents. We conclude that electrical compartmentalization profoundly shapes both synaptic function and how that function can be assessed with electrophysiological methods."

These data suggest that, in addition to sensory-motor integration, a function of human PPC is to utilize memory signals to make choices. Retrieving long-term memories to inform ongoing behavior is essential for many kinds of decisions. Examples of such decisions include determining whether you met a person before and, if so, recalling that person’s name. While the processes by which perceptual decisions are made are beginning to be understood (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N. The neural basis of decision making.Annu. Rev.

In macaques and rodents, neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) encode cognitive variables, such as choices and the confidence in such choices, during a variety of perceptual and motor decision-making tasks (Andersen and Cui, 2009Andersen R.A.

It presently remains unknown whether PPC neurons are also involved in making episodic memory-based choices and whether these neurons are distinct from those coding for actions. While PPC is important for sensory-motor integration (Andersen and Buneo, 2002Andersen R.A. Buneo C.A. Intentional maps in posterior parietal cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), a combination of imaging, lesion, and electrophysiology studies have started to reveal that the PPC also plays a role in integrating memory-based information (Gilmore et al., 2015Gilmore A.W.

For example, it has long been appreciated that subjects with unilateral neglect due to parietal lesions show striking spatial memory deficits (Bisiach and Luzzatti, 1978Bisiach E. Luzzatti C. Unilateral neglect of representational space.Cortex. 1978; 14: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, Guariglia et al., 2005Guariglia C. Piccardi L. Iaria G. Nico D. Pizzamiglio L. Representational neglect and navigation in real space.Neuropsychologia. 2005; 43: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When asked to recall a familiar scene, these patients ignore the neglected side of the imagined scene. However, the patients are able to describe the previously neglected items when asked to describe the same scene from a different imagined point of view that places the objects on their non-neglected side. Parietal lesions also cause specific recognition memory deficits: patients with PPC lesions report lower confidence in their retrieval decisions and are less likely to report the subjective experience of recollection (Hower et al., 2014Hower K.H.

While spatial memory deficits are most prominent after right parietal lesions, electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence indicates that recognition memory-related signals are particularly prominent in left PPC (lPPC) (Gonzalez et al., 2015Gonzalez A.

Consequently, the lPPC is now thought to be a core component of the memory retrieval network (Olson and Berryhill, 2009Olson I.R. Berryhill M.

Different aspects of memory retrieval modulate different areas of PPC, a degree of specialization that has given rise to multiple theories of the exact role of each in memory retrieval (Cabeza et al., 2008Cabeza R.

In contrast, BOLD activity in the angular gyrus (AG) is larger for high- compared to low-confidence judgments for both new and old items (Hutchinson et al., 2015Hutchinson J.B. Uncapher M.R.

Dorsal superior parietal lobule (SPL) fMRI activity, on the other hand, is larger for low- compared to high-confidence judgments for both new and old items, an effect that is thought to be related to decision uncertainty (Hutchinson et al., 2014Hutchinson J.B. Uncapher M.R. Weiner K.S. Bressler D.W. Silver M.A. Preston A.R. Wagner A.D. Functional heterogeneity in posterior parietal cortex across attention and episodic memory retrieval.Cereb.

Attention to memory and the environment: functional specialization and dynamic competition in human posterior parietal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8445-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While these extant data suggest that IPS, AG, and SPL make distinct contributions to memory retrieval, it remains unknown what signals are encoded by individual neurons in these areas. A role of lPPC in memory retrieval is also supported by electrophysiological studies. The “parietal new/old”-evoked potential (Rugg and Curran, 2007Rugg M.D. Curran T. Event-related potentials and recognition memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2007; 11: 251-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), which differentiates new from old stimuli, has its putative source in left parietal cortex. While scalp recordings cannot differentiate between different parts of lPPC, intracranial recordings strongly support distinct roles of different parts of lPPC. Specifically, comparing gamma-band power between old and new items has revealed a striking disassociation between IPS and SPL: whereas gamma-band power is higher for old compared to new items in IPS, the opposite is the case for SPL (Gonzalez et al., 2015Gonzalez A. Hutchinson J.B. Uncapher M.R. Chen J. LaRocque K.F. Foster B.L. Rangarajan V. Parvizi J. Wagner A.D. Electrocorticography reveals the temporal dynamics of posterior parietal cortical activity during recognition memory decisions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 11066-11071Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, no differences of this kind were observed in AG. However, AG gamma-band activity was highest during autobiographical memory retrieval relative to other tasks (Foster et al., 2015Foster B.L. Rangarajan V. Shirer W.R. Parvizi J. Intrinsic and task-dependent coupling of neuronal population activity in human parietal cortex.Neuron. 2015; 86: 578-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), supporting its role in recollection. Together, this body of work supports the view that levels of neural activity in different parts of lPPC correlate with distinct aspects of episodic memory retrieval. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms behind these changes in overall activity. In particular, it remains unknown whether lPPC neurons encoding memory-related signals are separate from those encoding action intention and execution signals. Also, the functional differences between the IPS, SPL, and AG revealed by intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) and fMRI studies suggest that each area is specialized to encode only subsets of memory-related signals, but it remains unknown whether the same conclusion holds at the single-neuron level. We studied the activity of individual human lPPC neurons during a recognition memory task with confidence ratings. The recognition memory-based choices in our task are thought to be made based on two sources of information: a sense of familiarity and, in addition for a subset of stimuli, recollection of associated details of the period of time when the stimulus was seen the first time. In our task, high-confidence choices are associated predominantly with recollected items whereas low-confidence items are mostly made based on familiarity alone (Wixted, 2007Wixted J.T.

This feature makes our task well suited to test the neural correlates of declarative memory retrieval. Subjects were two tetraplegic subjects with chronically implanted recording arrays in lPPC, who were participating in a brain machine interface (BMI) clinical trial (Aflalo et al., 2015Aflalo T.

We found two groups of neurons whose activity was related to memory retrieval: memory-selective (MS) and confidence-selective (CS) neurons. There were two types of MS neurons, the first of which increased its firing rates for familiar stimuli and the second to novel stimuli, respectively. The strength of activity of MS neurons was modulated asymmetrically by memory strength as assessed by confidence ratings. CS neurons, on the other hand, encoded retrieval confidence symmetrically, i.e., independent of whether a stimulus was familiar or novel. During error trials, PPC neurons signaled the choice made by the subject regardless of truth, indicating that MS cells signaled choices and not ground truth. PPC cells differentiated between new and old choices approximately 550 ms after stimulus onset, a latency similar to that of the lPPC new/old event-related potential (ERP). Additional experiments confirmed that the activity of MS and CS neurons did not encode motor intentions or action signals. After first memorizing 75–100 novel images, subjects performed a recognition memory test during which they rated each image as familiar (old) or novel (new). Simultaneously, they also indicated how certain they were that their choice was correct. Subjects provided verbal answers on a 1–6 confidence scale (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Subjects provided their reply after a go cue, which appeared at an unpredictable point of time after offset of the image (Figure 1A). Across all confidence levels, subjects had good memory (Figure 1B; average area under the curve [AUC]: 0.85 ± 0.05, ± SD). The behavioral receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was asymmetric (Manns et al., 2003Manns J.R. Hopkins R.O. Reed J.M. Kitchener E.G. Squire L.R. Recognition memory and the human hippocampus.Neuron. 2003; 37: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) as expected from a declarative memory task (Figure 1C; average slope of z-transformed ROC was 0.79 ± 0.24, significantly less than 1, p = 0.008). The accuracy of retrieval decisions co-varied systematically with confidence judgments (Figures 1D–1F; mean accuracy high versus low confidence was significantly different, p = 2.7e−13; this difference was visible for each subject considered individually; see Figures S5A and S5B), which shows that subjects were able to assess memory strength. Decision times (DTs) varied as a function of both confidence and familiarity (Rutishauser et al., 2015Rutishauser U. Ye S. Koroma M. Tudusciuc O. Ross I.B. Chung J.M. Mamelak A.N. Representation of retrieval confidence by single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar): DTs were faster for high- compared to low-confidence judgments regardless of familiarity, and DTs were slower for new compared to old judgments regardless of confidence (Figure 1G; repeated-measure ANOVA, significant main effect of both familiarity F(1,34) = 8.8, p = 0.0006 and confidence F(1,34) = 49.7, p < 1e−07). Lastly, the accuracy and confidence of decisions made in response to old stimuli during recognition was independent of the position at which the same stimulus was shown when it was novel during learning (Figures 1H and 1I; repeated-measure ANOVA of binned serial position during learning; bin size 20 trials; F(4,37) = 0.51, p = 0.73 and F(4,37) = 0.94, p = 0.45 for true positive rate and confidence, respectively). This result shows that the delay between the two blocks of the task was long enough to abolish recency effects. Thus, different confidence ratings are not due to list position during learning. Together, the described patterns of behavior indicate that the subjects made use of medial temporal lobe (MTL)-dependent declarative memory (Kahana, 2012Kahana M.J. Foundations of Human Memory. Oxford University Press, 2012Google Scholar, Manns et al., 2003Manns J.R. Hopkins R.O. Reed J.M. Kitchener E.G. Squire L.R. Recognition memory and the human hippocampus.Neuron. 2003; 37: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We recorded from a total of 1,379 individual neurons in 12 recording days from 2 patients (8 and 4 sessions, respectively; on average, 146 ± 11 and 61 ± 22 neurons recorded simultaneously, respectively; neurons recorded on different days were treated as different; mean firing rate of neurons was 2.4 ± 2.3 Hz; see Figure S1 for spike sorting metrics; see Table S1 for list of recording sessions). In both patients, the left PPC 96-channel recording array was located within the putative human homolog of the AIP (see Figures 1J and 1K). Recordings were generally stable across several hours, but not days, and we thus treated clusters identified from the same electrodes on different days as separate neurons. We use the term neuron to refer to a putative single unit throughout. We first tested to what extent individual neurons were sensitive to whether a stimulus was novel or familiar. For this purpose, we used only stimuli that were correctly identified as novel or familiar by the subject (see below for analysis of error trials). Following stimulus onset, the response of 166 (12%; p = 0.001 versus chance, p value from bootstrap after scrambling labels, see Figure S2A; see Figures S5C and S5D for individual subjects) neurons indicated whether a stimulus was novel or familiar (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D show examples). There were two types of such MS neurons (Figure 3A): one type increased its firing rate selectively for novel stimuli (Type 1; Figure 2A; n = 83, p = 0.001 versus chance) and the other for familiar stimuli (Type 2; Figure 2B; n = 83, p = 0.001 versus chance).Figure 3Population Summary of Recognition Memory Signals in PPCShow full caption(A) Distribution of memory preference across all recorded neurons.

In this work water quality monitoring at different ports using a range of water quality evaluation indices was applied to assess the port water quality. Seawater samples at 30 stations in the year 2016-2017 from six ports in NSW, Australia, namely Port Jackson, Botany, Kembla, Newcastle, Yamba and Eden, were investigated to determine the physicochemical and biological variables that affect the port water quality. The large datasets obtained were designed to determine the Water Quality Index, Heavy metal Evaluation Index, Contamination Index and newly developed Environmental Water Quality Index. The study revealed medium water quality index and high and medium heavy metal evaluation index at three of the study ports and high contamination index in almost all study ports. Low level dissolved oxygen and higher level of total dissolved solids, turbidity, fecal coliforms, copper, iron, lead, zinc, manganese, cadmium and cobalt are mainly responsible for the poor water qualities of the port areas. Good water quality at the background samples indicated that various port activities are the likely cause for poor water quality inside the port area."
https://openalex.org/W2774849155,"Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is considered a powerful tumor suppressor mechanism. Caveolin-1 acts as a scaffolding protein to functionally regulate signaling molecules. We demonstrate that a lack of caveolin-1 expression inhibits oncogenic K-Ras (K-RasG12V)-induced premature senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Oncogenic K-Ras induces senescence by limiting the detoxification function of MTH1. We found that K-RasG12V promotes the interaction of caveolin-1 with MTH1, which results in inhibition of MTH1 activity. Lung cancer cells expressing oncogenic K-Ras have bypassed the senescence barrier. Interestingly, overexpression of caveolin-1 restores cellular senescence in both A549 and H460 lung cancer cells and inhibits their transformed phenotype. In support of these findings, our in vivo data demonstrate that overexpression of oncogenic K-Ras (K-RasG12D) induces cellular senescence in the lung of wildtype but not caveolin-1–null mice. A lack of K-RasG12D–induced premature senescence in caveolin-1–null mice results in the formation of more abundant lung tumors. Consistent with these data, caveolin-1–null mice overexpressing K-RasG12D display accelerated mortality. Finally, our animal data were supported by human sample analysis in which we show that caveolin-1 expression is dramatically down-regulated in lung adenocarcinomas from lung cancer patients, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and that low caveolin-1 expression is associated with poor survival. Together, our data suggest that lung cancer cells escape oncogene-induced premature senescence through down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression to progress from premalignant lesions to cancer.

Lung cancer is the most frequent type of cancer. In the United States, lung cancer accounted for ∼13% of all cancer diagnoses and 27% of all cancer deaths in 2015. It is the second most diagnosed cancer in both men and women, but it is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women.

K-Ras is a GTPase that plays an important role in normal tissue signaling. Wildtype K-Ras is activated by signals that promote the exchange of bound GDP to GTP. This is a transient activation due to the intrinsic ability of K-Ras to hydrolyze GTP and therefore turn itself off. However, single point mutations generate an oncogenic mutant form of K-Ras with a constitutively activated GTP-bound state. Interestingly, a well-established and intriguing function of K-Ras is its ability to promote oncogene-induced senescence (7Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

Thus, a high level of oncogenic K-Ras promotes a transformed phenotype only when the tumor suppressor features of K-Ras–induced senescence are bypassed. However, the mechanisms that define this fundamental transition in tumorigenesis remain to be fully established.

However, whether caveolin-1 regulates the tumor suppressor properties of oncogene-induced senescence remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that caveolin-1 promotes oncogenic K-Ras–induced senescence and that activation of the oncogenic K-Ras/caveolin-1/senescence pathway prevents lung cancer development in mice. Consistent with these findings, low caveolin-1 expression is found in lung cancer patients and is associated with poor lung cancer patient survival. Together, our data provide novel molecular insights into the functional significance of OIS. To investigate the role of caveolin-1 in oncogene-induced senescence, we overexpressed oncogenic K-Ras (K-RasG12V) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from either wildtype or caveolin-1–null mice, which do not express caveolin-1 (31Bartholomew J.N. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Caveolin-1 regulates the antagonistic pleiotropic properties of cellular senescence through a novel Mdm2/p53-mediated pathway.Cancer Res. 2009; 69 (19318577): 2878-288610.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After 2 weeks, cellular senescence was quantified by using three independent senescence markers: senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and expression of p21 and p16 by immunoblotting analysis. We found that overexpression of K-RasG12V induced senescence in ∼90% of wildtype MEFs, as assessed by SA-β-gal staining (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, K-RasG12V-induced senescence was dramatically inhibited in MEFs lacking caveolin-1 expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with these findings, the K-RasG12V-promoted up-regulation of both p21 and p16 was significantly inhibited in MEFs derived from caveolin-1–null mice, as compared with wildtype MEFs (Fig. 1, C and D). In support of these data, we found that oncogenic K-Ras induced senescence in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and that down-regulation of caveolin-1 in these cells significantly inhibited K-RasG12V-induced senescence (Fig. 2, C–E). We conclude that K-RasG12V induces cellular senescence in a caveolin-1–dependent manner.Figure 2Down-regulation of caveolin-1 inhibits oncogenic K-Ras–induced cellular senescence in NHBE cells.

Thus, oncogenic K-Ras induces premature senescence by limiting the detoxification function of MTH1. However, the endogenous signaling mechanism through which oncogenic K-Ras limits MTH1 activity and promotes OIS remains to be established. To gain insights into K-RasG12V-induced and caveolin-1–mediated cellular senescence, we asked whether caveolin-1 was the molecule through which oncogenic K-Ras inhibits MTH1. The scaffolding domain of caveolin-1, which is represented by residues 82–101, mediates direct protein-protein interactions between caveolin-1 and a variety of signaling molecules carrying a caveolin-binding domain (ΦXΦXXXXΦ, ΦXXXXΦXXΦ, or ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ, where Φ represents an aromatic amino acid and X represents any amino acid) (45Couet J.

https://openalex.org/W2774100421,"Aptamers are molecules that reveal highly complex and refined molecular recognition properties. These molecules are capable of binding with high affinity and selectivity to targets, ranging from small molecules to whole living cells. Several aptamers have been selected for targeting cellular proteins and they have also used in developing therapeutics and diagnostic strategies. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is considered as a cancer stem cell (CSC) biomarker and one of the most promising targets for aptamer selection against CSCs. In this study, we have developed a ssDNA aptamer with high affinity and selectivity of targeting the EpCAM protein extracellular domain. The SELEX technique was applied and the resulted sequences were tested on EpCAM-positive human gastric cancer cell line, KATO III, and the EpCAM-negative mouse embryonic fibroblast, NIH/3T3 cells. Ep1 aptamer was successfully isolated and showed selective binding on EpCAM-positive KATO III cells when compared to EpCAM-negative NIH/3T3 cells, as observed by the flow cytometry and the confocal imaging results. Additionally, the binding of Ep1 to EpCAM protein was assessed using mobility shifting assay and aptamers-protein docking. Furthermore, the binding affinity of Ep1 was measured against EpCAM protein using EpCAM-immobilized on magnetic beads and showed apparent affinity of 118 nM. The results of this study could suggest that Ep1 aptamer can bind specifically to the cellular EpCAM protein, making it an attractive ligand for targeted drug delivery and as an imaging agent for the identification of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2772927332,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease and ranges from isolated steatosis to NASH. To determine whether circulating fatty acids could serve as diagnostic markers of NAFLD severity and whether specific fatty acids could contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, we analyzed two independent NAFLD patient cohorts and used the methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) NASH mouse model. We identified six fatty acids that could serve as non-invasive markers of NASH in patients with NAFLD. Serum levels of 15:0, 17:0 and 16:1n7t negatively correlated with NAFLD activity scores and hepatocyte ballooning scores, while 18:1n7c serum levels strongly correlated with fibrosis stage and liver inflammation. Serum levels of 15:0 and 17:0 also negatively correlated with fasting glucose and AST, while 16:1n7c and 18:1n7c levels positively correlated with AST and ferritin, respectively. Inclusion of demographic and clinical parameters improved the performance of the fatty acid panels in detecting NASH in NAFLD patients. The panel [15:0, 16:1n7t, 18:1n7c, 22:5n3, age, ferritin and APRI] predicted intermediate or advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with 82% sensitivity at 90% specificity [AUROC = 0.92]. 15:0 and 18:1n7c were further selected for functional studies in vivo. Mice treated with 15:0-supplemented MCD diet showed reduced AST levels and hepatic infiltration of ceroid-laden macrophages compared to MCD-treated mice, suggesting that 15:0 deficiency contributes to liver injury in NASH. In contrast, 18:1n7c-supplemented MCD diet didn’t affect liver pathology. In conclusion, 15:0 may serve as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target in NASH, opening avenues for the integration of diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2775249851,"Several viruses manipulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to initiate a productive infection. Determined viral proteins are able to change the host's ubiquitin machinery and some viruses even encode their own ubiquitinating or deubiquitinating enzymes. African swine fever virus (ASFV) encodes a gene homologous to the E2 ubiquitin conjugating (UBC) enzyme. The viral ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCv1) is expressed throughout ASFV infection and accumulates at late times post infection. UBCv is also present in the viral particle suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway could play an important role at early ASFV infection. We determined that inhibition of the final stage of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway blocked a post-internalization step in ASFV replication in Vero cells. Under proteasome inhibition, ASF viral genome replication, late gene expression and viral production were severely reduced. Also, ASFV enhanced proteasome activity at late times and the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins surrounding viral factories. Core-associated and/or viral proteins involved in DNA replication may be targets for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that could possibly assist virus uncoating at final core breakdown and viral DNA release. At later steps, polyubiquitinated proteins at viral factories could exert regulatory roles in cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2771548784,"Greater understanding and acceptance of the new concept “bone quality”, which was proposed by the National Institutes of Health and is based on bone cells and collagen fibers, are required. The novel protein Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) is associated with osteoprotection by regulating bone cells. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of mechanical loads on Sema3A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers around implants in rat maxillae. Grade IV-titanium threaded implants were placed at 4 weeks post-extraction in maxillary first molars. Implants received mechanical loads (10 N, 3 Hz for 1800 cycles, 2 days/week) for 5 weeks from 3 weeks post-implant placement to minimize the effects of wound healing processes by implant placement. Bone structures, bone mineral density (BMD), Sema3A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers were analyzed using microcomputed tomography, histomorphometry, immunohistomorphometry, polarized light microscopy and birefringence measurement system inside of the first and second thread (designated as thread A and B, respectively), as mechanical stresses are concentrated and differently distributed on the first two threads from the implant neck. Mechanical load significantly increased BMD, but not bone volume around implants. Inside thread B, but not thread A, mechanical load significantly accelerated Sema3A production with increased number of osteoblasts and osteocytes, and enhanced production of both type I and III collagen. Moreover, mechanical load also significantly induced preferential alignment of collagen fibers in the lower flank of thread B. These data demonstrate that mechanical load has different effects on Sema3A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers between the inside threads of A and B. Mechanical load-induced Sema3A production may be differentially regulated by the type of bone structure or distinct stress distribution, resulting in control of bone quality around implants in jaw bones."

Our results support the notion that dCx performs a global, rather than local, analysis of the visual scene. What are the overarching principles of cortical computation and the functional advantages conferred by its modular and pluripotent design? These important questions have thus far been explored nearly exclusively in mammals (primates, carnivores, and, more recently, rodents), and mostly (though not exclusively) in primary or “early” sensory areas (V1, A1, and S1). Yet cerebral cortex, a layered structure covering the forebrain, is not a mammalian invention. It likely evolved over 300 million years ago with the amniotes, for it is found in all mammals (monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians) and in their sister group, the sauropsids, but does not exist in either fish or amphibians (Butler et al., 2011Butler A.B.

Among the sauropsids, cortex proper can be identified clearly only in the non-avian reptiles. Reptilian cortex, a three-layered structure similar to the mammalian paleo- and archi-cortices (piriform and hippocampal, respectively), probably resembles the common ancestral cortex in stem amniotes. Hence, reptiles offer a good opportunity to study a relatively simple cortex, and possibly to uncover some of the structural and computational logic of its original design.

Thus, the nature of visual representations in turtle dCx remains to be discovered. Our goal was to revisit these questions with a quantitative approach using large-scale recordings and classical techniques of RF mapping used to study information processing and representation in mammalian visual cortex (DeAngelis et al., 1993DeAngelis G.C.

Our anatomical data show that the mapping of the visual field is not a straightforward projection onto dCx; there appears to be no retinotopic map in dCx. Consistent with the anatomy, we found that the vast majority of dCx RFs cover almost entirely the contralateral visual field. Yet we show that dCx is sensitive to the spatial and temporal statistics of natural scenes. Moreover, a substantial fraction of dCx neurons exhibit some non-uniformity in their spatial response profiles, which can be used to decode the position and contrast polarity of a stimulus. These results show that despite their generally poor spatial selectivity, dCx neurons provide information about stimulus position, both at the single-cell and population level. The structural and functional attributes underlying this selectivity appear different from those underlying the encoding of visual space in mammalian primary visual neurons (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H.

Our data argue for a distributed encoding of visual space in dCx, with no topographical mapping of the physical dimensions of the sensory space. It suggests that information processing in turtle visual cortex might rely on similar principles to those that govern object encoding in olfactory cortex and higher visual areas. The reptilian cortex is composed of three layers with densely packed pyramidal cells in layer 2 only, and interneurons scattered through layers 1–3 (Figure 1A). The visual dCx is traditionally divided across the latero-medial axis into two areas called D2 and D1 (Desan, 1984Desan P.H. The Organization of the Cerebral Cortex of the Pond Turtle, Pseudemys scripta elegans. Harvard University, 1984Google Scholar, Heller and Ulinski, 1987Heller S.B. Ulinski P.S. Morphology of geniculocortical axons in turtles of the genera Pseudemys and Chrysemys.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1987; 175: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); D2 (lateral to D1) receives direct input from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Intraocular injection of the trans-synaptic tracer WGA-HRP (STAR Methods) revealed the axonal projection zone of retino-recipient LGN neurons as a densely stained superficial zone in layer 1 of dCx (L1a; Figure 1B). This projection zone was also stained by an antibody against VGluT2, a marker of subcortical synaptic terminations (Nahmani and Erisir, 2005Nahmani M. Erisir A. VGluT2 immunochemistry identifies thalamocortical terminals in layer 4 of adult and developing visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 484: 458-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Sixty-four-electrode eCoG recordings of dCx responses to flashed stimuli in awake animals showed that the visually responsive zone in dCx matches that revealed by WGA-HRP tracing experiments (Figure S1). Visually evoked local field potential (LFP) activity extended over several square millimeters in the rostral half of the cortex. eCoG traces revealed dominant spectral power in the beta range (15–35 Hz; Figure 1D), plotted as iso-amplitude contours in Figure 1E. The extent of the visually activated zone did not depend on the spectral band selected to analyze the data. We used this knowledge to target our depth recordings in anesthetized turtles to area D2 (as confirmed post hoc from VGluT2 stainings). Current-source density profiles measured across the depth of dCx in anesthetized animals revealed an early (<100 ms) superficial current sink (Figure 1C, middle) whose depth profile matched the zone of LGN afferent projections (Figure 1C, left). The macroscopic (LFP or eCoG) responses of turtle visual cortex to visual stimuli typically contained an early, stimulus-locked broadband component and a superimposed and sustained oscillatory component. We observed these oscillations for a variety of stimuli both in anesthetized animals (Figure 1F) and in awake animals (Figures 1D and 1E). Consistent with earlier reports (Prechtl et al., 1997Prechtl J.C. Cohen L.B. Pesaran B. Mitra P.P. Kleinfeld D. Visual stimuli induce waves of electrical activity in turtle cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7621-7626Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, Rutishauser et al., 2013Rutishauser U. Kotowicz A. Laurent G.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the power increase in the stimulus-evoked oscillations was strongest in the beta range (15–35 Hz). We observed a peak oscillatory power between 15 and 25 Hz (anesthetized, mean = 19 Hz, range = 15–25 Hz, n = 5 animals; awake, mean = 23 Hz, range = 22–25 Hz, n = 4 animals). To examine the potential significance of the macroscopic oscillations in determining the timing of neuronal responses, we recorded cortical LFPs together with the responses of individual neurons to visual stimuli (sparse and dense noise; STAR Methods) using linear silicon arrays inserted across the entire cortical depth in anesthetized animals (Figures 1F–1H). On average, beta LFP oscillations (triggered on the oscillation trough recorded from a superficial channel) showed almost no gradient of phase across depth, but a rapid phase reversal superficially, at a level corresponding approximately to the transition between layers 1a (containing LGN axon terminals) and 1b (Figure 1G). Beta oscillations measured in the LFP reflected the firing statistics of the neuronal population in dCx (Figure 1H). The correlation between spike times and LFP was quantified by computing the peri-oscillation-triggered histogram (POTH; STAR Methods). In total, 65% of the recorded neurons (479 out of 741) showed a significant modulation of their firing rate across a beta oscillation cycle (Rayleigh test, p < 0.01). For some neurons, this oscillatory activity was clearly reflected in their spike autocorrelogram (Figure S2). These neurons preferred to fire in the descending phase of the beta oscillation cycle (Figure 1H, middle), indicative of synchronous excitation. Note that ∼30% of these neurons exhibited less than 20% firing rate modulation during an oscillation cycle (Figure 1H, right). To examine whether dCx is sensitive to the spatial structure of visual stimuli, we examined the effectiveness of various stimulus categories in driving beta activity in awake animals (n = 4). Using a large set of luminance-adjusted static images (Figure 2A; STAR Methods), we measured power in the beta range (15–35 Hz; Figures 2B and S3) for each stimulus and category. The most efficient stimulus categories were RGB natural scenes and uniform red flashes (Figure 2C). Least effective were phase-scrambled BW scenes and white-noise stimuli. The high effectiveness of red stimuli is likely explained by the known bias of the turtle retinal spectral sensitivity (Graf, 1967Graf V. A spectral sensitivity curve and wavelength discrimination for the turtle Chrysemys picta picta.Vision Res. 1967; 7: 915-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the ranking across the remaining stimuli suggests a sensitivity of turtle cortex activity to the spatial structure of the image. In particular, the significant preference for natural images (Nat) compared to their phase-scrambled counterparts (Scr) (ANOVA, p < 0.01) indicates that dCx may be selective to the presence of salient contours. Using movies of natural images, we also found that dCx is sensitive to the spatiotemporal statistics of the visual scene. eCoG responses evoked by 10 s-long natural movie clips (Figure 2D) showed increased power in the beta range upon static presentation of the first frame (Figure 2E, dark gray) and at the movie onset (2 s later), but also sustained beta oscillations throughout the entire movie (Figures 2E and S3). Sustained beta oscillations measured after movie onset were significantly smaller when the frames of the movie were phase-scrambled (Scr) and/or shuffled in time (Shf) (ANOVA, p < 0.01; Figure 2F; n = 2 animals; STAR Methods). To test whether RFs are organized retinotopically across dCx, we recorded the activity of dCx neurons extracellularly in anesthetized and paralyzed turtles and measured their spatial selectivity with “sparse-noise” stimuli consisting of bright (ON) or dark (OFF) squares flashed on an intermediate intensity background (3 × 5 positions covering 90° × 120° of visual angle; STAR Methods; Figure 3A). Consistent with earlier reports (Gusel’nikov et al., 1972Gusel’nikov V.I. Morenkov E.D. Pivovarov A.S. Unit responses of the turtle forebrain to visual stimuli.Neurosci. Behav. Physiol. 1972; 5: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, Mazurskaya, 1973Mazurskaya P.Z. Organization of receptive fields in the forebrain of Emys orbicularis.Neurosci. Behav. Physiol. 1973; 6: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we found that the population response (MUA) recorded in any of the dCx locations we sampled covered the entire stimulated area. Responses to sparse noise recorded simultaneously in two different sites, spaced by >1 mm along the rostro-caudal axis of dCx (n = 3 out of 5 animals), were highly similar, with no obvious spatial anisotropy in RF location across the dCx surface (Figures 3A and S4A). Nevertheless, we measured a temporal delay across dCx recording sites: caudal dCx average responses were delayed by ∼30 ms compared to rostral dCx (Figure 3B, bottom; mean = 32.2 ms; paired t test, p ≪ 0.01), consistent with earlier reports on propagation of activity across dCx (Senseman, 1999Senseman D.M. Spatiotemporal structure of depolarization spread in cortical pyramidal cell populations evoked by diffuse retinal light flashes.Vis. Neurosci. 1999; 16: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the latency of dCx responses and the azimuthal position of the stimulus for individual recording locations: on average, responses to single flashes in the periphery of the visual field were delayed by ∼70 ms compared to the center (Figure 3B, top; r = −0.78, p ≪ 0.01). This result suggests the possibility that azimuth of the visual field may be encoded in the timing of dCx responses. Retrograde tracing from dCx recording sites revealed a retinotopic organization of thalamocortical projections that was very coarse at best. We routinely coated our recording electrodes with lipophilic dyes (Figure 3C; STAR Methods). These dyes underwent retrograde axonal transport and, thus, identified thalamic afferents. After 1–4 weeks, LGN neurons labeled retrogradely from the dCx recording site (STAR Methods) were detected over most of the rostro-caudal axis of LGN (Figures 3D–3F). Quantitative analyses reveal that rostral dCx (Figure 3E, light brown) receives inputs from cells distributed throughout the whole rostro-caudal extent of the LGN, while more caudal portions of dCx (Figure 3E, dark brown) gradually lack input from caudal LGN. Applying two different tracers along the rostro-caudal axis of dCx (DiI and DiD) revealed large spatial overlap in LGN, but only very few (<2%) double-labeled cells (Figure 3E, inset). These results indicate coarse differences between (rostral to caudal) LGN projections along the rostro-caudal axis of dCx. Yet the widespread divergence of LGN output to any part of dCx is consistent with the absence of a fine-grain retinotopic organization of dCx, as indicated by our electrophysiological recordings. To assess the diversity of spatial selectivity across the dCx neuronal population, we quantified the RF properties of individual dCx neurons from responses to sparse noise in anesthetized turtles. Most recorded neurons responded over large parts—often all—of the stimulated area. Significant responses were observed in ∼75% of the recorded neurons over more than 90% of the explored visual area (i.e., more than 100° of visual angle) (Figures 4A and 4B ; n = 128 neurons and 5 animals). Moreover, ON and OFF subfields usually overlapped in a given neuron, as shown by the correlation coefficient measured between ON and OFF responses (Figure 4C, middle). No systematic bias was found between ON and OFF responses (paired t test, p = 0.75; Figure S4B). Despite their large size, dCx RFs are not entirely uniform across space. The spatial modulation index showed that 50% of neurons (70/128) had more than 20% modulation of their response amplitude across space (Figure 4C, left; median = 0.21). Cells with RF size <100° of visual angle showed larger spatial modulation (Figure S4C; median = 0.28; n = 34 neurons) than cells with large RFs (>100° of visual angle, n = 94; median = 0.18). Moreover, ON and OFF responses were not perfectly balanced across the visual field for most neurons: the correlation between ON and OFF responses was <0.6 for ∼50% of dCx neurons (median = 0.62) (Figure 4C, middle); i.e., half of dCx neurons show more than ∼40% modulation of their response to contrast of opposite signs. Additionally, RFs were not uniform within local populations of dCx neurons. We measured the Pearson’s correlation between every neuron’s RF and the mean RF averaged across all other neurons recorded simultaneously on the same electrode (Figure 4C, right; population correlation). For half of dCx neurons, this correlation was <0.4 (median = 0.40); i.e., more than ∼60% of the variance of their RFs could not be explained by the average response from the rest of the population. We also compared the uniformity of RFs across recording sites separated along the rostro-caudal dimension by measuring the Pearson’s correlation between RFs recorded in rostral (or caudal) dCx and the mean RF averaged across neurons recorded in caudal (or rostral) dCx (n = 3 animals). Comparison of population correlation values within and across recording sites showed that dCx RFs tended to be more uniform within the local population (Figure S4D; paired t test, p ≪ 0.01). To assess whether the diversity of RFs across the dCx population was sufficient to decode the position and polarity of the stimulus, we used a Bayesian decoding approach and measured the average posterior probability from the recorded spike trains for each stimulus position and contrast (STAR Methods). Both the location and the ON or OFF polarity of the stimulus could be decoded from dCx neuron responses (Figures 4D and S4E). Thus, despite their poor spatial selectivity, dCx neurons exhibit some anisotropy in their spatiotemporal response profiles, which can be used to decode the location and contrast polarity of a stimulus. Responses in dCx are usually much reduced during prolonged stimulation (Clawson et al., 2017Clawson W.P. Wright N.C. Wessel R. Shew W.L. Adaptation towards scale-free dynamics improves cortical stimulus discrimination at the cost of reduced detection.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005574Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test if positions in the visual field are also encoded in dCx responses during ongoing stimulation, we recorded the activity of dCx neurons in anesthetized turtles during the presentation of an ∼30 s-long movie clip, displayed in different positions on the screen (Figure 5). Unlike sparse noise stimuli, the luminance of each movie frame was adjusted to the background luminance and all movie frames were equalized in overall contrast. Across all experiments (n = 123 neurons and 4 animals), most neurons responded reliably to the appearance of the first frame and to the onset of the movie in all stimulated positions (Figures 5A and S5). Similar to sparse noise, responses to the onset of the movie were not entirely uniform across space or across the dCx population: 50% of dCx neurons modulated their responses across space by more than ∼20% (Figure 5B, left; median = 0.18) and more than 60% of their RF variance could not be explained by the average response of all other cells (Figure 5B, right; population correlation; median = 0.38). To test if the location of the movie could be decoded from the response of dCx neurons at the movie onset, we applied the same Bayesian approach as above. Similar to results with sparse noise, we found that the position of the movie could be accurately decoded from the activity recorded in dCx for the first 4 s following stimulus onset (Figures 5C and S6A), although most neurons exhibited significant responses to all stimulated positions (Figures S5A and S5B). After movie onset, the firing rate of most dCx neurons decreased drastically (Figures 5A, S4A, and S4B). Nevertheless, responses, if present during the movie, were clearly structured (Figures 5A and S5). Some response peaks were correlated with the transition between the last frame of run 1 of the movie and the first frame of run 2 (blue line), while some others were locked to specific features of the movie, possibly related to increased visual flow (Figures S5A and S5B). Responses during the movie presentation (from 4 s post-onset till the end of the movie) were more spatially selective than at the onset of the stimulus as shown by the higher spatial modulation index (Figure 5D, left; paired t test, p ≪ 0.01). The coefficient of spatial correlation of the RF was also significantly lower during the movie presentation (median = 0.31) than at the stimulus onset (median = 0.70) (Figure 5D, middle; spatial correlation, paired t test, p ≪ 0.01; STAR Methods), indicating that dCx neurons exhibited more position-specific responses during the movie presentation. The correlation between responses recorded from different neurons (population correlation) was unchanged compared to the correlation between responses recorded at the onset of the stimulus (Figure 5D, right; paired t test, p = 0.19). Thus, while the firing rate of dCx neurons decreases during stimulation, their spatial selectivity increases. This result is consistent with recent findings suggesting a trade-off in dCx between detection and discrimination as the response develops following stimulus onset (Clawson et al., 2017Clawson W.P. Wright N.C. Wessel R. Shew W.L. Adaptation towards scale-free dynamics improves cortical stimulus discrimination at the cost of reduced detection.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005574Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Bayesian decoding of the stimulus position from responses recorded during the movie showed that the position of the stimulus can also be decoded during prolonged stimulation, despite the strong adaptation of dCx firing rates (Figures 5E and S6A). In one experiment (turtle K5), we presented three different movies during the same recording session (Figures S5B and S5D). Bayesian decoding of the stimulus f"

Total median folate and B12 intakes amongst women were 156.3 μg/d and 4.0 μg/d while for men were 163.6 μg/d and 4.5 μg/d, respectively. In all age groups, vitamin intakes were significantly higher in plausible than in non-plausible energy reporters.A limited number of participants had adequate folate intakes, whereas vitamin B12 intakes were adequate for practically the entire population.

https://openalex.org/W2772529147,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate neurotransmission at the majority of excitatory synapses in the brain. Little is known, however, about how glutamate reaches the recessed binding pocket in iGluR ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Here we report the process of glutamate binding to a prototypical iGluR, GluA2, in atomistic detail using unbiased molecular simulations. Charged residues on the LBD surface form pathways that facilitate glutamate binding by effectively reducing a three-dimensional diffusion process to a spatially constrained, two-dimensional one. Free energy calculations identify residues that metastably bind glutamate and help guide it into the binding pocket. These simulations also reveal that glutamate can bind in an inverted conformation and also reorient while in its pocket. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that eliminating these transient binding sites slows activation and deactivation, consistent with slower glutamate binding and unbinding. These results suggest that binding pathways have evolved to optimize rapid responses of AMPA-type iGluRs at synapses."

Little is known about host-pathogen interactions and host defense mechanisms. Here, individual resistant and susceptible plants were selected from cultivars Maverick and ZG9830 and used for transcript profiling at 24 and 72 hours after inoculation (hai) with the isolate PssALF3. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in resistant and susceptible genotypes. Although resistant plants from each cultivar produced a hypersensitive response, transcriptome analyses indicated that they respond differently at the molecular level. The number of DEGs was higher in resistant plants of ZG9830 at 24 hai than in Maverick, suggesting that ZG9830 plants had a more rapid effector triggered immune response. Unique up-regulated genes in resistant ZG9830 plants included genes encoding putative nematode resistance HSPRO2-like proteins, orthologs for the rice Xa21 and soybean Rpg1-b resistance genes, and TIR-containing R genes lacking both NBS and LRR domains. The suite of R genes up-regulated in resistant Maverick plants had an over-representation of R genes in the CC-NBS-LRR family including two genes for atypical CCR domains and a putative ortholog of the Arabidopsis RPM1 gene. Resistance in both cultivars appears to be mediated primarily by WRKY family transcription factors and expression of genes involved in protein phosphorylation, regulation of transcription, defense response including synthesis of isoflavonoids, and oxidation-reduction processes. These results will further the identification of mechanisms involved in resistance to facilitate selection of parent populations and development of commercial varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2771763081,"East Coast Fever (ECF) is the most economically important production disease among traditional beef cattle farmers in Zambia. Despite the disease control efforts by the government, donors, and farmers, ECF cases are increasing. Why does ECF oscillate over time? Can alternative approaches such as systems thinking contribute solutions to the complex ECF problem, avoid unintended consequences, and achieve sustainable results? To answer these research questions and inform the design and implementation of ECF interventions, we qualitatively investigated the influence of dynamic socio-economic, cultural, and ecological factors. We used system dynamics modelling to specify these dynamics qualitatively, and an innovative participatory framework called spatial group model building (SGMB). SGMB uses participatory geographical information system (GIS) concepts and techniques to capture the role of spatial phenomenon in the context of complex systems, allowing stakeholders to identify spatial phenomenon directly on physical maps and integrate such information in model development. Our SGMB process convened focus groups of beef value chain stakeholders in two distinct production systems. The focus groups helped to jointly construct a series of interrelated system dynamics models that described ECF in a broader systems context. Thus, a complementary objective of this study was to demonstrate the applicability of system dynamics modelling and SGMB in animal health. The SGMB process revealed policy leverage points in the beef cattle value chain that could be targeted to improve ECF control. For example, policies that develop sustainable and stable cattle markets and improve household income availability may have positive feedback effects on investment in animal health. The results obtained from a SGMB process also demonstrated that a “one-size-fits-all” approach may not be equally effective in policing ECF in different agro-ecological zones due to the complex interactions of socio-ecological context with important, and often ignored, spatial patterns."

Large-celled PSB Chromatium okenii and GSB Chlorobium populations were reliably separated and identified due to differences in auto-fluorescence and cell size. Moreover, we showed that these dominant taxa share the same ecological niche over seasonal periods. Taking advantage of FCM detection of dynamic cellular complexity variation during phases of photosynthetic activity, we identified an unexpected alternation in PSB versus GSB metabolic activity, indicating dynamic interspecific interactions between these two populations."

A series of pHEMA/MMA/β-CD copolymers containing different ratios of β-CD (range, 2.77 to 10.24 wt.%) were obtained using thermal polymerization. The polymers had high transmittance at visible wavelengths and good biocompatibility with mouse connective tissue fibroblasts. Drug loading and release studies demonstrated that introducing β-CD into hydrogels increased loading efficiency and achieved the sustained release of the drug. Administering β-CD via hydrogels increased the equilibrium swelling ratio, elastic modulus and tensile strength. In addition, β-CD increased the hydrophilicity of the hydrogels, resulting in a lower water contact angle and higher cellular adhesion to the hydrogels. In summary, pHEMA/MMA/β-CD hydrogels show great potential as IOL biomaterials that are capable of maintaining the sustained release of anti-inflammatory drugs after cataract surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2773984989,"In Arabidopsis, the F-box HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) protein is important for organ growth. Loss of function of HWS exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes including sepal fusion. To dissect the HWS role, we EMS-mutagenized hws-1 seeds and screened for mutations that suppress hws-1 associated phenotypes. We identified shs-2 and shs-3 (suppressor of hws-2 and 3) mutants in which the sepal fusion phenotype of hws-1 was suppressed. shs-2 and shs-3 (renamed hst-23/hws-1 and hst-24/hws-1) carry transition mutations that result in premature terminations in the plant homolog of Exportin-5 HASTY (HST), known to be important in miRNA biogenesis, function and transport. Genetic crosses between hws-1 and mutant lines for genes in the miRNA pathway also suppress the phenotypes associated with HWS loss of function, corroborating epistatic relations between the miRNA pathway genes and HWS. In agreement with these data, accumulation of miRNA is modified in HWS loss or gain of function mutants. Our data propose HWS as a new player in the miRNA pathway, important for plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2772492123,"Human hepatic lipase (hHL) is mainly localized on the hepatocyte cell surface where it hydrolyzes lipids from remnant lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins and promotes their hepatic selective uptake. Furthermore, hepatic lipase (HL) is closely associated with obesity in multiple studies. Therefore, HL may play a key role on lipid homeostasis in liver and white adipose tissue (WAT). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of hHL expression on hepatic and white adipose triglyceride metabolism in vivo. Experiments were carried out in hHL transgenic and wild-type mice fed a Western-type diet. Triglyceride metabolism studies included β-oxidation and de novo lipogenesis in liver and WAT, hepatic triglyceride secretion, and adipose lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated free fatty acid (FFA) lipolysis and influx. The expression of hHL promoted hepatic triglyceride accumulation and de novo lipogenesis without affecting triglyceride secretion, and this was associated with an upregulation of Srebf1 as well as the main genes controlling the synthesis of fatty acids. Transgenic mice also exhibited more adiposity and an increased LPL-mediated FFA influx into the WAT without affecting glucose tolerance. Our results demonstrate that hHL promoted hepatic steatosis in mice mainly by upregulating de novo lipogenesis. HL also upregulated WAT LPL and promoted triglyceride-rich lipoprotein hydrolysis and adipose FFA uptake. These data support the important role of hHL in regulating hepatic lipid homeostasis and confirm the broad cardiometabolic role of HL."
https://openalex.org/W2772956995,"The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of critical power (CP) and the total amount of work accomplished above CP (W´) across repeated tests using ecologically valid maximal effort time-trials (TT) under laboratory conditions. After an initial incremental exercise test, ten well-trained male triathletes (age: 28.5 ± 4.7 years; body mass: 73.3 ± 7.9 kg; height: 1.80 ± 0.07 m; maximal aerobic power [MAP]: 329 ± 41 W) performed three testing sessions (Familiarization, Test I and Test II) each comprising three TT (12, 7, and 3 min with a passive recovery of 60 min between trials). CP and W´ were determined using a linear regression of power vs. the inverse of time (1/t) (P = W´ ∙ 1/t + CP). A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to detect differences in CP and W´ and reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the coefficient of variation (CoV). CP and W´ values were not significantly different between repeated tests (P = 0.171 and P = 0.078 for CP and W´, respectively). The ICC between Familiarization and Test I was r = 0.86 (CP) and r = 0.58 (W´) and between Tests I and II it was r = 0.94 (CP) and r = 0.95 (W´). The CoV notably decreased from 4.1% to 2.6% and from 25.3% to 8.2% for CP and W´, respectively. Despite the non-significant differences for both parameter estimates between Familiarization, Test I, and Test II, ICC and CoV values improved notably after the familiarization trial. Our novel findings indicate that for both, CP and W´ a familiarization trial increased reliability. It is therefore advisable to familiarize well-trained athletes when determining the power-duration relationship using TT under laboratory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2775278251,"T-lymphocyte activation after antigen presentation to the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) is a critical step in the development of proper immune responses to infection and inflammation. This dynamic process involves reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and signaling molecules at the cell membrane, leading to the formation of the Immunological Synapse (IS). The mechanisms regulating the formation of the IS are not completely understood. Nonerythroid spectrin is a membrane skeletal protein involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signaling and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. However, the role of spectrin in IS formation has not been explored. We used molecular, imaging and cellular approaches to show that nonerythroid αII-spectrin redistributes to the IS during T-cell activation. The redistribution of spectrin coincides with the relocation of CD45 and LFA-1, two components essential for IS formation and stability. We assessed the role of spectrin by shRNA-mediated depletion from Jurkat T cells and show that spectrin-depleted cells exhibit decreased adhesion and are defective in forming lamellipodia and filopodia. Importantly, IS formation is impaired in spectrin-depleted cells. Thus, spectrin may be engaged in regulation of distinct events necessary for the establishment and maturity of the IS: besides the involvement of spectrin in the control of CD45 and LFA-1 surface display, spectrin acts in the establishment of cell-cell contact and adhesion processes during the formation of the IS."
https://openalex.org/W2773950704,"Fatty acid desaturases are enzymes that introduce double bonds into fatty acyl chains. Extensive studies of fatty acid desaturases have been done in many plants. However, less is known about the diversity of this gene family in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), an important oilseed crop that is cultivated worldwide.In this study, twelve novel AhFADs genes were identified and isolated from peanut. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the transcript abundances of AhFAB2-2 and AhFAD3-1 were higher in seeds than in other tissues examined, whereas the AhADS and AhFAD7-1 transcripts were more abundant in leaves. AhFAB2-3, AhFAD3-2, AhFAD4, AhSLD-4, and AhDES genes were highly expressed in flowers, whereas AhFAD7-2, AhSLD-2, and AhSLD-3 were expressed most strongly in stems. During seed development, the expressions of AhFAB2-2, AhFAD3-1, AhFAD7-1, and AhSLD-3 gradually increased in abundance, reached a maximum expression level, and then decreased. The AhFAB2-3, AhFAD3-2, AhFAD4, AhADS, and AhDES transcript levels remained relatively high at the initial stage of seed development, but decreased thereafter. The AhSLD-4 transcript level remained relatively low at the initial stage of seed development, but showed a dramatic increase in abundance at the final stage. The AhFAD7-2 and AhSLD-2 transcript levels remained relatively high at the initial stage of seed development, but then decreased, and finally increased again. The AhFAD transcripts were differentially expressed following exposure to abiotic stresses or abscisic acid. Moreover, the functions of one AhFAD6 and four AhSLD genes were confirmed by heterologous expression in Synechococcus elongates or Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The present study provides valuable information that improves understanding of the biological roles of FAD genes in fatty acid synthesis, and will help peanut breeders improve the quality of peanut oil via molecular design breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2773075979,"Resolution of inflammation that occurs after microbial infection or tissue damage is an important physiologic process in maintaining or restoring host homeostasis. Taurine chloramine (TauCl) is formed by a reaction between taurine and hypochlorite in leukocytes, and it is especially abundant in activated neutrophils that encounter an oxidative burst. As neutrophils undergo apoptosis, TauCl is released to the extracellular matrix at the inflamed sites, thereby affecting coexisting macrophages in the inflammatory microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the role of TauCl in phagocytosis by macrophages during resolution of fungal infection-induced inflammation. We found that exogenous TauCl substantially increased the phagocytic efficiency of macrophages through up-regulation of dectin-1, a receptor for fungal β-1,3-glucans, which is present on the membrane of macrophages. Our previous studies demonstrated the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in murine peritoneal macrophages treated with TauCl. In the present study, knocking out HO-1 or pharmacologic inhibition of HO-1 with zinc protoporphyrin IX attenuated the TauCl-induced expression of dectin-1 and subsequent phagocytosis. Furthermore, carbon monoxide (CO), a by-product of the HO-1-catalyzed reaction, induced expression of dectin-1 and potentiated phagocytic capability of the macrophages, which appeared to be mediated through up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. Taken together, induction of HO-1 expression and subsequent CO production by TauCl are essential for phagocytosis of fungi by macrophages. Our results suggest that TauCl has important roles in host defense against fungal infection and has therapeutic potential in the management of inflammatory diseases.— Kim, S.

https://openalex.org/W2771652959,"During the infection process, Apicomplexa discharge their secretory organelles called micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules to sustain host cell invasion, intracellular replication and to modulate host cell pathways and immune responses. Herein, we describe the Toxoplasma gondii Deg-like serine protein (TgDegP), a rhoptry protein homologous to High temperature requirement A (HtrA) or Deg-like family of serine proteases. TgDegP undergoes processing in both types I and II strains as most of the rhoptries proteins. We show that genetic disruption of the degP gene does not impact the parasite lytic cycle in vitro but affects virulence in mice. While in a type I strain DegPI appears dispensable for the establishment of an infection, removal of DegPII in a type II strain dramatically impairs the virulence. Finally, we show that KO-DegPII parasites kill immunodeficient mice as efficiently as the wild-type strain indicating that the protease might be involved in the complex crosstalk that the parasite engaged with the host immune response. Thus, this study unravels a novel rhoptry protein in T. gondii important for the establishment of lethal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2772894869,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) plays an important role in the development of diabetes mellitus and renal injury. GSK3 inhibition increases glucose uptake in insulin-insensitive muscle and adipose tissue, while it reduces albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in acute kidney injury. The effect of chronic GSK3 inhibition in diabetic nephropathy is not known. We tested the effect of lithium, the only clinical GSK3 inhibitor, on the development of diabetes mellitus and kidney injury in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy. Twelve-week old female BTBR-ob/ob mice were treated for 12 weeks with 0, 10 and 40 mmol LiCl/kg after which the development of diabetes and diabetic nephropathy were analysed. In comparison to BTBR-WT mice, ob/ob mice demonstrated elevated bodyweight, increased blood glucose/insulin levels, urinary albumin and immunoglobulin G levels, glomerulosclerosis, reduced nephrin abundance and a damaged proximal tubule brush border. The lithium-10 and -40 diets did not affect body weight and resulted in blood lithium levels of respectively <0.25 mM and 0.48 mM. The Li-40 diet fully rescued the elevated non-fasting blood glucose levels. Importantly, glomerular filtration rate was not affected by lithium, while urine albumin and immunoglobulin G content were further elevated. While lithium did not worsen the glomerulosclerosis, proximal tubule function seemed affected by lithium, as urinary NGAL levels were significantly increased. These results demonstrate that lithium attenuates non-fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic mice, but aggravates urinary albumin and immunoglobulin G content, possibly resulting from proximal tubule dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2775824922,"3D vision develops during childhood and tends to diminish after 65 years of age. It is still relatively unknown how stereopsis is used in more complex/ecological contexts such as when walking about in crowds where objects are in motion and occlusions occur. One task that shares characteristics with the requirements for processing dynamic crowds is the multiple object-tracking task (MOT). In the present study we evaluated the impact of stereopsis on a MOT task as a function of age. A total of 60 observers consisting of three groups of 20 subjects (7–12 years old, 18–40 years old and 65 years and older) completed the task in both conditions (with and without stereoscopic effects). The adult group obtained the better scores, followed by the children and the older adult group. The performance difference between the stereoscopic and non-stereoscopic conditions was significant and similar for the adults and the children but was non significant for the older observers. These results show that stereopsis helps children and adults accomplish a MOT task, but has no impact on older adults’ performances. The present results have implications as to how populations differ in their efficiency of using stereoscopic cues for disambiguating complex dynamic scenes."

The purpose of this study was to determine if oral and intravenous (IV) treatment of IDA in patients with gastrointestinal disease attending hospital were associated with differential rates of subsequent re-attendance.Data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (primary care) and Hospital Treatment Insights (secondary care) databases in England were used to conduct this retrospective cohort study. Patients with a coded gastrointestinal disease and IDA who attended hospital (inpatient or outpatient) and were dispensed oral or IV iron between 01/01/2010-31/10/2013 were included. Elective and emergency re-attendances in secondary care within 30 days of the initial attendance were determined. Demographics, medical diagnoses and treatments were extracted. Re-attendance rates following oral or IV iron were compared using chi-square tests and a step-wise logistic regression model to adjust for confounders. 2,844 patients contributed 6,294 initial attendances; 80% of patients received oral iron, 14% received intravenous iron, and 6% received both. Of initial attendances recording oral iron, 77% resulted in re-attendance in hospital, compared to 34% of those recording IV iron (unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.16; adjusted OR: 0.52 [95% CI: 0.44-0.61]). Initial attendances using IV treatment were more likely to result in elective re-attendance (84%) than those recording oral treatment (43%) (p<0.001). Median length of stay in hospital tended to be shorter for patients using IV iron (1.4 days; interquartile range 0.5-3.6 days; oral iron: 5.1 days; interquartile range: 2.2-9.6 days).Patients with gastrointestinal disease and IDA who received IV iron were less likely to re-attend hospital, more likely to re-attend electively, and tended to have a shorter length of stay in hospital.

In this comparative study the toxicity level of A. flavus isolates exhibited 100% agreement among ammonia vapour test, ELISA and TLC for highly toxigenic (>2000 ppb) and toxigenic (501-2000 ppb) isolates while 88.5% agreement observed for least toxic (<20 ppb) isolates. In ammonia vapour test 51% of A. flavus isolates showed creamish or no colour change corresponding to least toxic/atoxic (<20ppb) category estimated by ELISA. Similarly 22% highly toxic isolates exhibited plum red colour, 12% moderately toxic indicated pink colour and 10% toxic isolates showed red colour. However, 11.5% isolates were found to be false positive in cream colour category (least toxic) and 28.5% false negatives in pink colour (moderately toxic) category. The isolates from different agroclimatic zones of maize in India showed high variability for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production potential ranging from 0.214-8116.61 ppb. Toxigenic potential of Aspergillus flavus isolates in culture was further validated by inoculating maize grain sample with four different isolates with varied toxin producing ability. With good agreement percentage between cultural and analytical methods the study concludes the ammonia vapour test to be easy, inexpensive, reliable and time saving method that can be used for segregating or pre-screening of contaminated samples from bulk food/feed stock."

To control the infection, we collaborated with NGOs to promote safer sex and HIV testing since mid-2010. In this study, we carried out the second molecular epidemiological survey between 2010 and 2016 to determine the status of HIV-1 infection in Mongolia.The study included 143 new cases of HIV-1 infection. Viral RNA was extracted from stocked plasma samples and sequenced for the pol and the env regions using the Sanger method. Near-full length sequencing using MiSeq was performed in 3 patients who were suspected to be infected with recombinant HIV-1. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method.MSM was the main transmission route in the previous and current studies. However, heterosexual route showed a significant increase in recent years. Phylogenetic analysis documented three taxa; Mongolian B, Korean B, and CRF51_01B, though the former two were also observed in the previous study. CRF51_01B, which originated from Singapore and Malaysia, was confirmed by near-full length sequencing. Although these strains were mainly detected in MSM, they were also found in increasing numbers of heterosexual males and females. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis estimated transmission of CRF51_01B into Mongolia around early 2000s. An extended Bayesian skyline plot showed a rapid increase in the effective population size of Mongolian B cluster around 2004 and that of CRF51_01B cluster around 2011.HIV-1 infection might expand to the general population in Mongolia.

Although the prostaglandin (PG)I2 receptor IP is expressed broadly in the liver, the role of PGI2-IP signaling in the development of NASH remains to be determined. Here, we investigated the role of the PGI2-IP system in the development of steatohepatitis using mice lacking the PGI2 receptor IP [IP-knockout (IP-KO) mice] and beraprost (BPS), a specific IP agonist. IP-KO and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD) for 2, 5, or 10 wk. BPS was administered orally to mice every day during the experimental periods. The effect of BPS on the expression of chemokine and inflammatory cytokines was examined also in cultured Kupffer cells. WT mice fed MCDD developed steatohepatitis at 10 wk. IP-KO mice developed steatohepatitis at 5 wk with augmented histologic derangements accompanied by increased hepatic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and TNF-α concentrations. After 10 wk of MCDD, IP-KO mice had greater hepatic iron deposition with prominent oxidative stress, resulting in hepatocyte damage. In WT mice, BPS improved histologic and biochemical parameters of steatohepatitis, accompanied by reduced hepatic concentration of MCP-1 and TNF-α. Accordingly, BPS suppressed the LPS-stimulated Mcp-1 and Tnf-α mRNA expression in cultured Kupffer cells prepared from WT mice. PGI2-IP signaling plays a crucial role in the development and progression of steatohepatitis by modulating the inflammatory response, leading to augmented oxidative stress.

On the basis of the binding of PEG molecules to Rv3802, we identified its lipid-binding site and the structural basis for phosphatidyl-based substrate binding and phospholipase A activity. We found that movement of the α8-helix affords lipid binding and is required for catalytic turnover through covalent tethering.

https://openalex.org/W2772499123,"The sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase) in animal cells is vital for actively maintaining ATP hydrolysis–powered Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane. These ion gradients drive co- and countertransport and are critical for establishing the membrane potential. It has been an enigma how Na,K-ATPase discriminates between Na+ and K+, despite the pumped ion on each side being at a lower concentration than the other ion. Recent crystal structures of analogs of the intermediate conformations E2·Pi·2K+ and Na+-bound E1∼P·ADP suggest that the dimensions of the respective binding sites in Na,K-ATPase are crucial in determining its selectivity. Here, we found that the selectivity at each membrane face is pH-dependent and that this dependence is unique for each face. Most notable was a strong increase in the specific affinity for K+ at the extracellular face (i.e. E2 conformation) as the pH is lowered from 7.5 to 5. We also observed a smaller increase in affinity for K+ on the cytoplasmic side (E1 conformation), which reduced the selectivity for Na+. Theoretical analysis of the pKa values of ion-coordinating acidic amino acid residues suggested that the face-specific pH dependences and Na+/K+ selectivities may arise from the protonation or ionization of key residues. The increase in K+ selectivity at low pH on the cytoplasmic face, for instance, appeared to be associated with Asp808 protonation. We conclude that changes in the ionization state of coordinating residues in Na,K-ATPase could contribute to altering face-specific ion selectivity."
