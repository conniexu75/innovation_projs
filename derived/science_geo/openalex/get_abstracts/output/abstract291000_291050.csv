https://openalex.org/W1975036106,"Fragmentation of habitats in the agricultural landscape is a major threat to biological diversity, which is greatly determined by insects. Isolation of habitat fragments resulted in decreased numbers of species as well as reduced effects of natural enemies. Manually established islands of red clover were colonized by most available herbivore species but few parasitoid species. Thus, herbivores were greatly released from parasitism, experiencing only 19 to 60 percent of the parasitism of nonisolated populations. Species failing to successfully colonize isolated islands were characterized by small and highly variable populations. Accordingly, lack of habitat connectivity released insects from predator control."
https://openalex.org/W2048165053,"The fullerene C(60) can be converted into two different structures by high pressure and temperature. They are metastable and revert to pristine C(60) on reheating to 300 degrees C at ambient pressure. For synthesis temperatures between 300 degrees and 400 degrees C and pressures of 5 gigapascals, a nominal face-centered-cubic structure is produced with a lattice parameter a(o) = 13.6 angstroms. When treated at 500 degrees to 800 degrees C at the same pressure, C(60) transforms into a rhombohedral structure with hexagonal lattice parameters of a(o) = 9.22 angstroms and c(o) = 24.6 angstroms. The intermolecular distance is small enough that a chemical bond can form, in accord with the reduced solubility of the pressure-induced phases. Infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance studies show a drastic reduction of icosahedral symmetry, as might occur if the C(60) molecules are linked."
https://openalex.org/W1988931510,"Micromechanical sensing of magnetic force was used to detect nuclear magnetic resonance with exceptional sensitivity and spatial resolution. With a 900 angstrom thick silicon nitride cantilever capable of detecting subfemtonewton forces, a single shot sensitivity of 1.6 x 10(13) protons was achieved for an ammonium nitrate sample mounted on the cantilever. A nearby millimeter-size iron particle produced a 600 tesla per meter magnetic field gradient, resulting in a spatial resolution of 2.6 micrometers in one dimension. These results suggest that magnetic force sensing is a viable approach for enhancing the sensitivity and spatial resolution of nuclear magnetic resonance microimaging."
https://openalex.org/W2002947503,"The evolutionary success of flowering plants has been attributed to key innovations that originated at the base of that clade. Maximum likelihood methods were used to assess whether branching rate increases were correlated with the origin of these traits. Four hypotheses for the basal relationships of angiosperms were examined by methods that are robust to uncertainty about the timing of internal branch points. Recent hypotheses based on molecular evidence, or on a combination of molecular and morphological characters, imply that large increases in branching rate did not occur until after the putative key innovations of angiosperms had evolved."
https://openalex.org/W2003217172,"The chemical construction of organized architectures is an important aspect of innovative materials synthesis. Bicontinuous water-filled microemulsions can be used as preorganized systems for the fabrication of crystalline calcium phosphate materials with extended reticulated microstructures. These macroporous materials are formed by mineralization reactions located within the interconnecting water channels of the bicontinuous network. The resulting materials represent replicas of the microemulsion architecture, but the pore sizes are incommensurate, suggesting that secondary modifications in the bicontinuous microstructure occur during crystal growth. Synthetic macroporous calcium phosphates could have uses in biomaterial implants."
https://openalex.org/W2033614604,"Sulfur species in pore waters of the Great Marsh, Delaware, were analyzed seasonally by polarographic methods. The species determined (and their concentrations in micromoles per liter) included inorganic sulfides (</=3360), polysulfides (</=326), thiosulfate (</=104), tetrathionate (</=302), organic thiols (</=2411), and organic disulfides (</=139). Anticipated were bisulfide increases with depth due to sulfate reduction and subsurface sulfate excesses and pH minima, the result of a seasonal redox cycle. Unanticipated was the pervasive presence of thiols (for example, glutathione), particularly during periods of biological production. Salt marshes appear to be unique among marine systems in producing high concentrations of thiols. Polysulfides, thiosulfate, and tetrathionate also exhibited seasonal subsurface maxima. These results suggest a dynamic seasonal cycling of sulfur in salt marshes involving abiological and biological reactions and dissolved and solid sulfur species. The chemosynthetic turnover of pyrite to organic sulfur is a likely pathway for this sulfur cycling. Thus, material, chemical, and energy cycles in wetlands appear to be optimally synergistic."
https://openalex.org/W2115880744,Methane was oxidatively coupled to ethylene with an ethylene yield up to 85 percent and a total C2 hydrocarbon yield up to 88 percent in a gas recycle high-temperature (800Â°C) electrocatalytic or catalytic reactor where the recycled gas passes continuously through a molecular sieve trap in the recycle loop. Oxygen is supplied either electrocatalytically by means of the solid electrolyte support of the silver-based catalyst or in the gas phase. The C2 products are obtained by subsequent heating of the molecular sieve trap. The selectivity to ethylene is up to 88 percent for methane conversion up to 97 percent.
https://openalex.org/W2046023589,"Nanometer-scale layered structures based on thallium(III) oxide were electrodeposited in a beaker at room temperature by pulsing the applied potential during deposition. The conducting metal oxide samples were superlattices, with layers as thin as 6.7 nanometers. The defect chemistry was a function of the applied overpotential: High overpotentials favored oxygen vacancies, whereas low overpotentials favored cation interstitials. The transition from one defect chemistry to another in this nonequilibrium process occurred in the same potential range (100 to 120 millivolts) in which the rate of the back electron transfer reaction became significant. The epitaxial structures have the high carrier density and low electronic dimensionality of high transition temperature superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W1991046530,"Micro-infrared spectroscopic measurements on single crystals of MgSiO(3) perovskite document two pleochroic hydroxyl absorbance peaks at 3483 and 3423 centimeter(-1). These measurements were obtained with the use of a synchrotron infrared source for spectroscopy. These data are consistent with a trace hydrogen content of 700 +/- 170 hydrogen atoms per 10(6) silicon atoms in the nominally anhydrous MgSiO(3) perovskite. When integrated over the volume of the lower mantle, this concentration is comparable to 12 percent of the mass of hydrogen in the Earth's hydrosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2042324429,"In recent years a methodology for performing laboratory experiments in economics has been developed. The object of the methodology is to integrate clearly motivated but largely subjectively determined human decisions with the organizational features of markets. The nature of the incentive system and the use of market organization as an independent variable are described. Initial results of basic research that involved assessment of the effects of the ""posted-price"" institution demonstrated that the effect of the institution is to raise prices and lower market efficiency. The existence of such effects and the close proximity of the laboratory posted-price institution to the rate-posting institution required by the government in several industries has led to a series of policy-related experiments. The results have also led to more basic research efforts on seemingly unrelated topics."
https://openalex.org/W2067709621,"One of the many speculations that quickly followed on the heels of the Kraetschmer-Huffman process for producing large quantities of C[sub 60] buckminsterfullerene was the possibility of stitching the molecules together to create a linear chain polymer, a [open quotes]pearl necklace[close quotes] of buckyballs. In addition to being chemically elegant and intrinsically beautiful, such a material might be expected to exhibit interesting electronic and nonlinear optical properties. Traditional solution-phase routes to fullerene polymerization have thus far resulted only in mixtures of incompletely characterized species with a high degree of cross-linking. This article reviews experiments that show that this goal might be achieved by starting from a fullerene solid precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2014219807,"New radiocarbon dates on four artifacts that were thought to provide evidence for human occupation of the Yukon Territory during the upper Pleistocene indicate that all four are of late Holocene age. The original radiocarbon age obtained for one artifact (the so-called ""Old Crow flesher"") was in error by almost 26,000 years."
https://openalex.org/W1993313205,"The spontaneous formation and coexistence of crystalline polymorphic trilayer domains in amphiphilic films at air-liquid interfaces is demonstrated by grazing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction. These polymorphic crystallites may serve as models for the early stages of crystal nucleation and growth, helping to elucidate the manner in which additives influence the progress of crystal nucleation, growth, and polymorphism and suggesting ways of selectively generating and controlling multilayers on liquid surfaces. Auxiliary molecules have been designed to selectively inhibit development of the polymorphs, leading primarily to a single phase monolayer."
https://openalex.org/W2013225104,"A series of free-radical catalysts have been discovered that increase the yield of highly valuable olefins from the cracking of low molecular weight paraffins. For example, catalytic cracking of n-butane, isobutane, and propane over manganese or iron supported on magnesium oxide (MgO) gave product distributions different from those given by thermal (free-radical) cracking or cracking over traditional acid catalysts. With n-butane and propane feeds, the products from catalytic cracking included large amounts of ethylene and ethane; with isobutane feed, propylene was the major product. Physical characterization of the MgO-supported catalyst showed the manganese to be in a 2+ oxidation state in the reduced catalyst and a 4+ oxidation state in the fully oxidized catalyst. Manganese was also shown to be uniformly distributed in the support material with very little enrichment at the surface. Matrix isolation of the gasphase radicals from n-butane feed showed that ethyl and methyl radicals were produced over the active catalysts. In the thermal process, only methyl radicals were produced. The mechanism of the catalytic reaction appears to be selective formation of primary carbanions at the catalyst surface followed by electron transfer and release of primary hydrocarbon radicals to the gas phase."

https://openalex.org/W2032096704,Museum collections were used to document the worldwide Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil record of 59 species that now occur on the Atlantic continental margin of North America. Tabulation of these data indicates that benthic foraminifera evolve at all latitudes and in all parts of the world ocean rather than from some center or centers of origin. Dispersal in geologic time is very rapid.

The method gives measurements of the albedo as accurate as those from satellites, and is considerably cheaper. Changes in the earth's albedo could be indicative of temperature and climate changes."
