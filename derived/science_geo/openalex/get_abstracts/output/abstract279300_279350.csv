https://openalex.org/W2045860903,"Verification and validation of numerical models of natural systems is impossible. This is because natural systems are never closed and because model results are always nonunique. Models can be confirmed by the demonstration of agreement between observation and prediction, but confirmation is inherently partial. Complete confirmation is logically precluded by the fallacy of affirming the consequent and by incomplete access to natural phenomena. Models can only be evaluated in relative terms, and their predictive value is always open to question. The primary value of models is heuristic."
https://openalex.org/W1972386643,Mycelial extracts from Phytophthora infestans caused necrosis and elicited the accumulation of antimicrobial stress metabolites in potato tubers. A portion of the material with elicitor activity could be extracted from the mycelium by a mixture of chloroform and methanol. The most active elicitors of stress metabolites in these extracts were eicosapentaenoic and arachidonic acids. These fatty acids were found in either free or esterified form in all active fractions of the mycelial extracts.
https://openalex.org/W2079195917,The seasonal course and magnitude of migratory restlessness recorded in four populations of the blackcap Sylvia atricapilla differ in a population-specific fashion that is related to the distance of travel. Experimentally produced hybrids of an exclusively migratory European population and a partially migratory African population showed intermediate migratory restlessness and an intermediate percentage of birds displaying restlessness compared to the two parental stocks. These results demonstrate the genetic basis of migratory behavior in this avian species and support the hypothesis that partial migration of populations is due to polymorphism.
https://openalex.org/W1972405528,"The social organization of Leptothorax allardycei is unique among ant species thus far studied. The workers form linear dominance hierarchies characterized by routine displays of dominance, avoidance behavior, and even fighting. The high-ranking ants are favored in liquid food exchange, have greater ovarian development, and produce 20 percent of the eggs."
https://openalex.org/W2042934058,"In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, sexually mature virgin females are prevented from shedding their wings and becoming functional egg layers by the presence of the mated queen. Experimental data suggest that this inhibitory effect results from the action of a relatively nonvolatile primer pheromone (or pheromones) produced by the mated queen and distributed by the workers. Target ants are both virgin queens and workers."
https://openalex.org/W2038814436,"The elongation zone in intact growing corn roots secretes acid leading to a reduced pH along the surface of the root and in the adjacent medium. This can be detected by placing the root on an agar medium containing the pH indicator dye bromocresol purple. When the root is treated with a growth inhibitory concentration of the hormone indole-3-acetic acid, the acid efflux is reversed and growth is greatly retarded. When the root is mounted vertically, acid secretion is uniform along the elongation zone, and the root grows straight downward. When the root is placed horizontally, there is enhanced acid efflux along the upper surface of the elongation zone and reduced acid efflux along the lower surface. An increased rate of elongation of the upper cells relative to the lower cells then results in downward curvature of the root. The correlation between acid efflux patterns and growth patterns indicates that proton efflux is important in the control of root growth."

https://openalex.org/W2020949814,Fully resolved intensity profiles of various lines in the carbon dioxide band at 10.4 micrometers have been measured on Mars with an infrared heterodyne spectrometer. Analysis of the line shapes shows that the Mars atmosphere exhibits positive gain in these lines. The detection of natural optical gain amplification enables identification of these lines as a definite natural laser.
https://openalex.org/W2092315069,"Beds of the Rio Chico Formation containing the earliest known land mammals in Patagonia, southern Argentina, were calibrated by potassium-argon age determinations and paleomagnetic polarity data. The Riochican land mammal age encompasses the middle and late Paleocene and corresponds in time with Torrejonian and Tiffanian land mammal faunas in North America."

https://openalex.org/W2043591123,"The solar wind response to a small-sized magnetized body is modeled on the basis of a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma description including Hall current corrections (Hall-MHD model). Basic features of the magnetic signatures observed near Galileo's closest approach to asteroid Gaspra are reproduced, assuming Gaspra's magnetic dipole momentto be of the order of 10(14) ampere.meters squared and tilted to the solar wind flow direction at an angle of about 45 degrees ."
https://openalex.org/W2019469473,"This article explores the various options available for disposing of the plutonium from dismantled U.S. and Soviet Union nuclear weapons. The simplest solution is long-term storage (approx. 20 years) until a more satisfactory solution is found, such as the development of reactors designed to burn plutonium. This is unsatisfactory for political reasons, such as the instability of the Russian government, the perception that the plutonium could be recovered later for use in nuclear weapons, and security problems to prevent theft. Another option is mixing it with highly radioactive nuclear wastes, or mixing it with natural uranium to be processed through conventional nuclear power reactors. The plutonium would be transformed into something resembling high-level radioactive waste, which would be extremely hard to steal and process into weapons. A Presidential panel will make its recommendations for handling of the plutonium next October."
https://openalex.org/W1987060864,"The authors of this article make the case for using open seismic networks in the monitoring of nuclear explosions for compliance with a global Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). These stations could be integrated with global communications networks to reduce the cost of monitoring for a CTBT. They would be multiuse stations not only for monitoring explosions but also for recording earthquake activity, assessment of seismic risk, and exploration of the earth's interior. Such networks now exist, but political aspects of negotiations for a CTBT have prevented them from being incorporated into the verification effort."

https://openalex.org/W2088478715,"Reagan's budget policy has cut support for an international energy agency planned to channel $30 billion into oil-poor Third World countries. The funds would finance energy projects over a five-year period and would more than double World Bank development aid. The US representative to the World Bank called the action ill-advised for its effect on both the Bank and global economic development in his resignation statement. Conceived as a way to counteract the economic strain of high energy prices, the financial aid for energy development would also have served the self-interests of industrialized countries. The new institution would have raised money through world capital markets with the backing of loan guarantees from member governments and with recipients raising some funds of their own. The Bank hoped that some of the capital would come from Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members in order to recycle the capital surpluses of oil-producing countries. The US budget cut accompanies a review of US participation in multilateral agencies and a shift toward bilateral aid and private-industry involvement. (DCK)"

https://openalex.org/W1990163952,This article describes the research programs of the national laboratories in developing satellites for detection of nuclear weapons material production. The present designs detect thermal emissions from reactors and electromagnetic radiation from nuclear explosions. Future designs hope to detect the vegetation kill zones around waste holding tanks associated with uranium and plutonium processing.

https://openalex.org/W2071599459,"The uncertain status of the recent proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (Science, 24 December 1993, p. 1967) was the hot topic in the hallways at the joint meetings of the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America, held 12-15 January in Cincinnati. But a few other topics did manage to get discussed. Among them: How gambling pays off in computing the volume of high-dimensional shapes; how a mathematical description of water dripping down a window pane might lead to the design of digital pulses that could race through the optical fibers of the future; and how one can be fooled infinitely often by another theorem of Fermat's."
