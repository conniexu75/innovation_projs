https://openalex.org/W2014947933,"The new technique of x-ray microtomography nondestructively generates three-dimensional maps of the x-ray attenuation coefficient inside small samples with approximately 1 percent accuracy and with resolution approaching 1 micrometer. Spatially resolved elemental maps can be produced with synchrotron x-ray sources by scanning samples at energies just above and below characteristic atomic absorption edges. The system consists of a high-resolution imaging x-ray detector and high-speed algorithms for tomographic image reconstruction. The design and operation of the microtomography device are described, and tomographic images that illustrate its performance with both synchrotron and laboratory x-ray sources are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1969805892,The oxygen and magnesium isotopic compositions of five individual particles that were collected from the stratosphere and that bear refractory minerals were measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Four of the particles exhibit excesses of oxygen-16 similar to those observed in anhydrous mineral phases of carbonaceous chondrites and thus are extraterrestrial. The oxygen and magnesium isotopic abundances of one corundum-rich particle are consistent with a terrestrial origin. Magnesium in the four extraterrestrial particles is isotopically normal. It is unlikely that these particles are derived from carbonaceous chondrites and thus such particles probably represent a new type of collected extraterrestrial material.
https://openalex.org/W1973664058,"Data on particulate strontium sulfate fluxes and strontium to chlorinity ratios were compared to provide insights into the strontium cycle of the North Pacific. Freedrifting sediment traps were used to derive large particle fluxes between depths of 100 and 3500 meters in the eastern and western North Pacific Ocean. Flux data revealed substantial quantities of acantharian skeletons and cysts (both made of strontium sulfate) settling through the upper kilometer of the water column. The greatest fluxes of celestite were detected at 400 meters. Minimal to nondetectable fluxes noted at and below 900 meters provide evidence that by this horizon, the majority of acantharian specimens had dissolved, thereby contributing to the pool of dissolved strontium. Growth and subsequent dissolution of acantharians in the upper kilometer are qualitatively consistent with the well-developed minimum and maximum strontium to chlorinity ratios that are consistently noted in these waters. These fluxes of particulate strontium and model calculations for fluxes of dissolved strontium indicate that acantharians play an important role in the ocean's strontium budget."
https://openalex.org/W2088123581,"Criteria are described by which refractory interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) can be differentiated from the products of spacecraft debris. These criteria have been used to discover and characterize IDPs that are composed predominantly of refractory phases. Two of these particles contain hibonite, perovskite, spinel, refractory glass, and a melilite; only hibonite was identified within a third. The grain size for all particles ranges from 0.05 to 1 micrometer, so that they are much finer grained than the refractory calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions in meteorites. The glass-containing refractory IDPs may be primitive nebular condensates that never completely crystallized and thus have been preserved extant."
https://openalex.org/W2062970283,"A simplified analytic model of a cooling hot neutron star, motivated by detailed computer calculations, describes well the neutrinos detected from the recent supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The observations do not require explanations that invoke exotic physics or complicated astrophysics. The parameters in this simple model are not severely constrained: 6.1(-3.6)(+3.5) x 10(52) ergs emitted in electron antineutrinos, a peak temperature of 4.2(-0.8)(+1.2) megaelectron volts, a radius of 27(-15)(+17) kilometers, and a cooling time of 4.5(-2.0)(+1.7) seconds."

https://openalex.org/W1979292620,"Congress established a 10-year interagency research program in 1980 to examine the causes and effects of acid rain and recommend actions to limit or reduce its harmful effects. On September 17, the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) is scheduled to release its interim assessment. The impression that emerges from the summary is that there is not much to worry about. Acid rain has negligible or no effects on crops and forests, though tropospheric ozone may be a serious problem. Only a small number of lakes have been acidified, and no further significant acidification is likely in the northeast. No abrupt increase in damage to crops, forests, and lakes is likely at current emissions."

Marx (19 June, p. 1523), Beatrice Hahn was incorrectly identified as a member of the Gallo-Wong-Staal group. Although Hahn collaborates with Gallo and Wong-Staal of the National Cancer Institute, she is in the Department of Medicine of the University of Alabama at Birmingham."
