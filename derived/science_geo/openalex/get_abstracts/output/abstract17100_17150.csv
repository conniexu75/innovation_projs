https://openalex.org/W2032805330,"The first step in flower development is the generation of a floral meristem by the inflorescence meristem. We have analyzed how this process is affected by mutant alleles of the Arabidopsis gene LEAFY. We show that LEAFY interacts with another floral control gene, APETALA1, to promote the transition from inflorescence to floral meristem. We have cloned the LEAFY gene, and, consistent with the mutant phenotype, we find that LEAFY RNA is expressed strongly in young flower primordia. LEAFY expression procedes expression of the homeotic genes AGAMOUS and APETALA3, which specify organ identify within the flower. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LEAFY is the Arabidopsis homolog of the FLORICAULA gene, which controls floral meristem identity in the distantly related species Antirrhinum majus."
https://openalex.org/W2009607549,"The adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells to establish immunity is an effective therapy for viral infections and tumors in animal models. The application of this approach to human disease would require the isolation and in vitro expansion of human antigen-specific T cells and evidence that such T cells persist and function in vivo after transfer. Cytomegalovirus-specific CD8++ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones could be isolated from bone marrow donors, propagated in vitro, and adoptively transferred to immunodeficient bone marrow transplant recipients. No toxicity developed and the clones provided persistent reconstitution of CD8++ cytomegalovirus-specific CTL responses."
https://openalex.org/W2081200884,"In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, functional defects and deletion of antigen-reactive T cells are more frequent than can be explained by direct viral infection. On culturing, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals died as a result of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis was enhanced by activation with CD3 antibodies. Programmed cell death, associated with impaired T cell reactivity, may thus be responsible for the deletion of reactive T cells that contributes to HIV-induced immunodeficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2027518730,"Human coronaviruses (HCV) in two serogroups represented by HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are an important cause of upper respiratory tract infections. Here we report that human aminopeptidase N, a cell-surface metalloprotease on intestinal, lung and kidney epithelial cells, is a receptor for human coronavirus strain HCV-229E, but not for HCV-OC43. A monoclonal antibody, RBS, blocked HCV-229E virus infection of human lung fibroblasts, immunoprecipitated aminopeptidase N and inhibited its enzymatic activity. HCV-229E-resistant murine fibroblasts became susceptible after transfection with complementary DNA encoding human aminopeptidase N. By contrast, infection of human cells with HCV-OC43 was not inhibited by antibody RBS and expression of aminopeptidase N did not enhance HCV-OC43 replication in mouse cells. A mutant aminopeptidase lacking the catalytic site of the enzyme did not bind HCV-229E or RBS and did not render murine cells susceptible to HCV-229E infection, suggesting that the virus-binding site may lie at or near the active site of the human aminopeptidase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1977350867,"Motor neurons in the embryonic chick spinal cord express a homeobox gene, Islet-1, soon after their final mitotic division and before the appearance of other differentiated motor neuron properties. The expression of Islet-1 by neural cells is regulated by inductive signals from the floor plate and notochord. These results establish Islet-1 as the earliest marker of developing motor neurons. The molecular nature of the Islet-1 protein suggests that it may be involved in the establishment of motor neuron fate."
https://openalex.org/W2075847325,"The paucity of virus-laden CD4+ cells in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) contrasts with the greatly reduced numbers and function of these lymphocytes. A pathway is described whereby dendritic cells carry HIV-1 to uninfected T cells, amplifying the cytopathic effects of small amounts of virus. After exposure to HIV-1, dendritic cells continue to present superantigens and antigens, forming clusters with T cells that are driven to replicate. Infection of the dendritic cells cannot be detected, but the clustered T cells form syncytia, release virions, and die. Carriage of HIV-1 by dendritic cells may facilitate the lysis and loss of antigen specific CD4+ T cells in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1979615660,"Coronaviruses, like many animal viruses, are characterized by a restricted host range and tissue tropism. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a major pathogen causing a fatal diarrhoea in newborn pig, replicates selectively in the differentiated enterocytes covering the villi of the small intestine. To investigate the molecular determinants of the infection, we characterized the surface molecule used by the virus for binding and entry into host cells. Here we report that aminopeptidase N, an ectoenzyme abundantly expressed at the apical membrane of the enterocytes, serves as a receptor for TGEV. Monoclonal antibodies were selected for their ability to block infection by TGEV of porcine cell lines. They recognized a brush-border membrane protein of M(r) 150K, which was identified as aminopeptidase N by amino-terminal sequencing. Two lines of evidence supported the view that the peptidase itself acts as a receptor. First, virions bound specifically to aminopeptidase N that was purified to homogeneity. Second, recombinant expression of aminopeptidase N conferred infectivity by TGEV to an otherwise non-permissive cell line."

https://openalex.org/W2057436316,"Experiments were performed to determine if retroviral-mediated transfer of the human multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) into murine bone marrow cells would confer drug resistance to the cells and whether the MDR1 gene could be used as a dominant selectable marker in vivo. When mice transplanted with bone marrow cells containing a transferred MDR1 gene were treated with the cytotoxic drug taxol, a substantial enrichment for transduced bone marrow cells was observed. This demonstration of positive selection establishes the ability to amplify clones of transduced hematopoietic cells in vivo and suggests possible applications in human therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2037830911,"We have isolated a cytoplasmic chaperonin based on its ability to catalyze the folding of denatured beta-actin. The cytoplasmic chaperonin is organized as a multisubunit toroid and requires Mg2+ and ATP for activity. The folding reaction proceeds via the rapid ATP-independent formation of a binary complex, followed by a slower ATP-dependent release of the native product. Electron microscopic observations reveal a striking structural change that occurs upon addition of Mg2+ and ATP. The eukaryotic cytoplasm thus contains a chaperonin that is functionally analagous to its prokaryotic, mitochondrial, and chloroplastic counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W2144458008,"The pathway by which cytochromes c1 and b2 reach the mitochondrial intermembrane space has been controversial. According to the “conservative sorting” hypothesis, these proteins are first imported across both outer and inner membranes into the matrix, and then are retranslocated across the inner membrane. Our data argue against this model: import intermediates of cytochromes c1 and b2 were found only outside the inner membrane; maturation of these proteins was independent of the matrix-localized hsp60 chaperone; and dihydrofolate reductase linked to the presequence of either cytochrome was imported to the intermembrane space in the absence of ATP. We conclude that cytochromes c1 and b2 are sorted by a mechanism in which translocation through the inner membrane is arrested by a “stop-transfer” signal in the presequence. The arrested intermediates may be associated with a proteinaceous channel in the inner membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2094412950,"Stimulus-evoked cellular responses are sometimes organized in the form of propagating waves of cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase. Ca2+ waves can be elicited in cultured astrocytes by the neurotransmitter glutamate; however, the propagation mechanism is unknown. Here, qualitative and quantitative features of propagation suggest that astrocytic Ca2+ waves are mediated by an intracellular signal that crosses intercellular junctions. The role of gap junctions in cell-cell Ca2+ wave propagation was specifically tested. Functional gap junctions were demonstrated using a noninvasive fluorescence recovery method and the gap junction blockers halothane and octanol. Gap junction closure prevented intracellular waves from propagating between cells without affecting the velocity of the intracellular wave itself. The pivotal role played by the gap junction creates the potential for dynamic changes in glial connectivity and long-range glial signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2019742983,"In many instances, the establishment of highly specific neuronal connections during development results from the rearrangement of axonal projections through the trimming of exuberant collaterals or the elimination of functional synapses or both. Although the involvement of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor has been demonstrated in the shaping of axonal arbors, its participation in the process of selective stabilization of synapses remains an open issue. In this study, the effects of chronic in vivo application of D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D,L-APV), a selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor, on the synapse elimination process that takes place in the developing cerebellum of the rat have been analyzed. D,L-APV treatment prevented the regression of supernumerary climbing fiber synapses in 49 percent of the recorded Purkinje cells, while the inactive isomer L-APV was ineffective. Thus, activation of the NMDA receptor is a critical step in the regression of functional synapses during development."

https://openalex.org/W1488738929,"Expression of the murine liver stearoyl-CoA desaturase gene (SCD1) is induced upon feeding fasted mice a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet (Ntambi, J. M., Buhrow, S. A., Kaestner, K. H., Christy, R. J., Sibley, E., Kelly, T. J., and Lane, M.D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17291-17300). In the present study, SCD1-specific RNA riboprobes and cDNA probes were used to study the mechanism for the induction of SCD1 mRNA. Based on the time course of induction, the SCD1 mRNA increased from 2-fold within 6 h to 45-fold within 36 h. Nuclear run-on transcription studies showed that the accumulation of SCD1 mRNA after refeeding starved mice a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet was a consequence of the transcriptional activation of the SCD1 gene. The SCD1 mRNA level decreased rapidly (t1/2 = approximately 4 h) within 24 h when mice fed the fat-free, high carbohydrate diet were switched to a regular chow diet. Furthermore, when the fat-free diet was supplemented with triacylglycerides containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, the transcription of the SCD1 gene and the induction of the SCD1 mRNA were significantly blunted. Triacylglycerides containing saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were without dramatic effects. In contrast, synthesis of liver albumin mRNA was little affected by any of these dietary variations, indicating that the observed changes in the transcription of the SCD1 gene and mRNA levels were specific. These data demonstrate that both dietary carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids or their metabolites directly or indirectly regulate the expression of the SCD1 gene in mouse liver."
https://openalex.org/W1529651253,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is an inducible glycoprotein expressed on the surface of inflamed endothelium which mediates in part the extravasation of granulocytes into sites of infection or injury. ICAM-1 mRNA is not detected in unstimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), but accumulates transiently following tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment with maximal steady state levels occurring at 2 or 4 h, respectively. Pretreating HUVECs with PMA for 72 h down-regulates protein kinase C and inhibits the subsequent induction of ICAM-1 mRNA by PMA, but does not affect TNF-alpha-induced message accumulation. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the ICAM-1 gene is transcribed under basal conditions in HUVECs, and that TNF-alpha stimulates transcriptional activity 3- to 4-fold within 30 min of treatment. In contrast, PMA has little effect on ICAM-1 gene transcription up to 4 h following stimulation. Message stability studies established that ICAM-1 mRNA induced by PMA has a longer half-life than the TNF-alpha-induced message. These results suggest that PMA acts through protein kinase C to up-regulate ICAM-1 expression primarily at a post-transcriptional level by stabilizing ICAM-1 mRNA, whereas TNF-alpha transcriptionally regulates ICAM-1 gene expression through an undefined, protein kinase C-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2040683477,"Glial cells isolated from the nervous system are sensitive to neurotransmitters and may therefore be involved in synaptic transmission. The sensitivity of individual perisynaptic Schwann cells to activity of a single synapse was investigated, in situ, at the frog neuromuscular junction by monitoring changes in intracellular Ca2+ in the Schwann cells. Motor nerve stimulation induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in these Schwann cells; this increase was greatly reduced when transmitter release was blocked. Furthermore, local application of the cotransmitters acetylcholine and ATP evoked Ca2+ responses even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Successive trains of nerve stimuli or applications of transmitters resulted in progressively smaller Ca2+ reponses. We conclude that transmitter released during synaptic activity can evoke release of intracellular Ca2+ in perisynaptic Schwann cells. This Ca2+ signal may play a role in the maintenance or modulation of a synapse. These data show that synaptic transmission involves three cellular components with both postsynaptic and glial components responding to transmitter secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2024919307,The growth-inhibiting peptide hormone somatostatin stimulates phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity in the human pancreatic cell line MIA PaCa-2. This hormonal activation was mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanosine 5'-triphosphate-binding protein (G protein) in the membranes of these cells. Activation of this G protein by somatostatin stimulated the dephosphorylation of exogenous epidermal growth factor receptor prepared from A-431 cells in vitro. This pathway may mediate the antineoplastic action of somatostatin in these cells and in human tumors and could represent a general mechanism of G protein coupling that is utilized by normal cells in the hormonal control of cell growth.
https://openalex.org/W2064834217,"Spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (MEPSCs) were recorded by whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques in cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The specific adenosine A1 receptor agonist cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) reduced the frequency of MEPSCs without affecting their amplitude distribution or kinetic properties. This action was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin. In the presence of divalent cation Ca2+ channel blockers, CPA was still effective in reducing the frequency of MEPSCs. It was shown that this effect cannot be explained by changes in basal Ca2+ influx. These results suggest that neurotransmitters that produce presynaptic inhibition at hippocampal synapses utilize several mechanisms, one of which may involve inhibition of some component of the quantal release apparatus that occurs independently of inhibition of Ca2+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W1529387078,"Stimulation of murine T cells by engagement of the multi-component T cell antigen receptor or by cross-linking the Thy-1 molecule leads to a similar response characterized by lymphocyte activation and lymphokine production. The early biochemical events induced by engaging these molecules also are similar and begin with activation of a tyrosine kinase pathway and tyrosine phosphorylation of a comparable set of substrates. Previous work demonstrates that the protein tyrosine kinase p60fyn is associated with the antigen receptor and therefore it may participate in the tyrosine phosphorylations that are observed with antigen receptor signaling. In this study we demonstrate that the Thy-1 molecule is also associated with p60fyn in a murine T cell hybridoma and in murine thymocytes. The interaction is independent of antigen receptor expression. Thy-1 is a member of the class of molecules anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) group. The association of Thy-1 with p60fyn is dependent on the GPI linkage, since cleavage of the GPI anchor disrupts the interaction. The association of Thy-1 and p60fyn suggests a means by which Thy-1 cross-linking leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1983955608,"Synaptotagmin (p65) is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein of neurons and contains regions similar to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C. These domains are thought to be involved in calcium-dependent interaction with membrane phospholipids during exocytosis. To assess the functional role of synaptotagmin, synaptotagmin-deficient clonal variants of PC12 cells were isolated. All of the variant cells released catecholamine and adenosine triphosphate in response to elevated intracellular concentrations of calcium, which suggests that synaptotagmin is not essential for secretion of catecholamine and adenosine triphosphate from PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071857166,"A parkinsonian syndrome can be produced in nonhuman primates by administration of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Parkinsonian-like symptoms induced acutely by MPTP were ameliorated after treatment with GM1 ganglioside, a substance shown to have neurotrophic effects on the damaged dopamine system in rodents. Treatment with GM1 ganglioside also increased striatal dopamine and metabolite levels and enhanced the dopaminergic innervation of the striatum as demonstrated by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that GM1 ganglioside may hold promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1605271364,"The covalent intermediate formed during catalysis by the lac Z beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli can be trapped by reaction of the enzyme with 2‘,4‘-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-galactopyranoside, thereby inactivating the enzyme. Kinetic parameters for this inactivation process with the holo- and apo-enzymes have been determined. The intermediate so formed turns over only very slowly (t1/2 = 11.5 h) resulting in reactivation of the enzyme. The nucleophilic amino acid involved has been identified as Glu-537 by using a tritium-labeled inactivator to label the enzyme, then cleaving the labeled protein into peptides and purifying and sequencing the labeled peptide. This residue is conserved in five homologous beta-galactosidases and is different from that (Glu-461) proposed to be the nucleophile (Herrchen, M., and Legler, G. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 138, 527-531) on the basis of affinity labeling studies with conduritol C cis-epoxide. A role for glutamic acid residue 461 as the acid/base catalyst is proposed and justified."
https://openalex.org/W1496943120,"Rat tyrosine hydroxylase expressed with a baculovirus expression system contains covalent phosphate and has kinetic parameters consistent with those expected of phosphorylated enzyme (Fitzpatrick, P. F., Chlumsky, L. J., Daubner, S. C., and O'Malley, K. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2042-2047). The phosphorylation site was identified as serine 40, by purifying the enzyme from cells grown in the presence of [32P]phosphate. Replacement of serine 40 with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis prevented phosphorylation but had little effect on the steady-state kinetic parameters at pH 7. Both wild type and S40A tyrosine hydroxylase were expressed in Escherichia coli; the kinetic parameters of the enzymes purified from bacteria were nearly identical to those of the enzymes expressed with the baculovirus system, although the bacterially expressed enzyme contained no covalent phosphate. Treatment of this wild type enzyme with cAMP-dependent protein kinase decreased the KBH4 value about 2-fold but had no effect on the Vmax value at pH 7. Treatment with a stoichiometric amount of dopamine decreased the Vmax value 15-fold and increased the KBH4 value 2-3-fold. Phosphorylation of the dopamine-bound enzyme increased the Vmax value 10-fold and decreased the KBH4 value 2-fold. The kinetic parameters of the dopamine-bound recombinant enzyme were identical to those of enzyme purified from PC12 cells. In contrast, the S40A enzyme was converted to a less active form by treatment with dopamine but was not affected by phosphorylating conditions. These results are consistent with a model in which the major effect of phosphorylation of serine 40 is to relieve tyrosine hydroxylase from the inhibitory effects of catecholamines."

https://openalex.org/W1511047189,"We previously described a novel molecular chaperone (designated p88) that participates in the assembly of murine class I histocompatibility molecules (Degen, E., and Williams, D. B. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 112, 1099-1115). Our findings suggest that p88 may either promote proper assembly of class I molecules or retain them, probably within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), until assembly of the ternary complex of heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, and peptide ligand is complete. In this report, we compare p88 to calnexin, a calcium-binding 90-kDa phosphoprotein of the ER membrane (Wada, I., Rindress, D., Cameron, P. H., Ou, W.-J., Doherty, J.-J., II, Louvard, D., Bell, A.W., Dignard, D., Thomas, D. Y., and Bergeron, J. J. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19599-19610). We show that p88 and calnexin share antigenic epitopes defined by a polyclonal anti-calnexin antiserum. Furthermore, both proteins were immunoprecipitated in association with an intracellularly retained variant of the class I H-2Kb molecule. Since p88 and calnexin were also indistinguishable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, were resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H, and exhibited virtually identical patterns of peptide fragments following digestion with either V8 protease or trypsin, we conclude that p88 and calnexin represent the same protein. The identification of the p88 chaperone as a phosphorylated, calcium-binding protein of the ER membrane suggests possible means whereby its interaction with class I molecules may be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1630663138,"Regulation of the procollagen type I (Pro alpha 1) gene in cultured Ito cells by diverse cytokines was studied. Specifically, we have examined the effect of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) on collagen biosynthesis, levels of Pro alpha 1 (I) mRNA, and rate of transcription of Pro alpha 1 (I) gene. TGF beta stimulated procollagen synthesis at least 2-fold at every concentration tested (5-20 ng/ml), whereas TNF alpha inhibited it at the same concentrations. In contrast to what occurs in dermal fibroblasts, IL-1 beta (5-20 units/ml) preferentially inhibited procollagen production as measured by [3H]proline incorporation. A similar pattern was obtained when total protein synthesis was analyzed by [25S]methionine radiolabeling. Interestingly, while TGF beta-treated cells exhibited greater than 3-fold increase in steady-state levels of Pro alpha 1 (I) mRNA, the treatment with IL-1 had no effect on procollagen mRNA levels. TNF alpha treatment resulted in a 2-fold decrease in the amount of collagen mRNA. The treatment with combinations of cytokines indicated that collagen gene expression in Ito cells is differentially regulated by these cytokines. Furthermore, nuclear run-off transcription experiments were performed. The results obtained suggest that TGF beta regulates increasing collagen type I gene expression at transcriptional levels, and TNF alpha inhibits the transcriptional rate of Pro alpha 1 (I) gene. It is noteworthy that IL-1 beta acts on collagen type I gene regulation by a separate mechanism at a posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1539055173,"The laminin-nidogen complex, the most abundant noncollagenous component of basement membranes, was recently shown to be a specific substrate for tissue transglutaminase (Aeschlimann, D., and Paulsson, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15308-15317). Saturation experiments to determine the number of amine acceptor site(s) indicated a single reactive Gln residue in nidogen and none in laminin. Murine nidogen was labeled with [3H]putrescine in the tissue transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction, and two major radioactively labeled fragments, T70 and T40, were isolated after limited trypsin digestion. NH2-terminal sequencing showed that T40 is contained in T70 and corresponds to the rodlike structure of nidogen, made up of epidermal growth factor-like repeats. Three radioactively labeled peptides, obtained by extensive trypsin digestion of reduced and alkylated T40, were sequenced. In all a single residue, Gln726, was found to contain label. Sequencing of additional peptides, obtained after further treatment of the largest radioactively labeled peptide with endoproteinase Asp-N, gave the same result. Gln726 is located in an exposed loop between the second and the third EGF-like repeat in nidogen. This site is also conserved in the human sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1598502849,"The neu protooncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that is involved in the regulation of normal growth and malignant transformation. To circumvent the use of the incompletely characterized ligand of Neu, we constructed a chimeric protein composed of the ligand-binding domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of Neu. By expressing this Neu-epidermal growth factor receptor chimera (termed NEC), we found that following stimulation by the heterologous ligand, the tyrosine kinase of Neu became associated with a phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity. The association was dependent on the concentration of the ligand and was almost maximal within 30 s after ligand binding. The lipid kinase was identified as a type I PI 3'-kinase on the basis of its inhibition by Nonidet P-40 and high pressure liquid chromatography of the phosphorylated product. To confirm the identification of PI 3'-kinase as an effector of Neu, we raised antibodies to the alpha-isoform of the regulatory subunit of PI 3'-kinase (p85). Using these antibodies, it was possible to directly demonstrate ligand-dependent formation of a tyrosine-phosphorylated complex of NEC and PI 3'-kinase. Apparently, both PI 3'-kinase and phospholipase C gamma, another substrate of the Neu kinase, simultaneously associated with the same activated NEC molecule. Nevertheless, immunofluorescence localization of PI 3'-kinase revealed no significant cellular redistribution of the enzyme after activation of the Neu kinase. Interestingly, PI 3'-kinase was localized primarily to the cell nucleus and to confined regions of the plasma membrane. Analysis of mutants of the Neu protein indicated that the oncogenic point-mutated Neu (Glu664) was permanently coupled to PI 3'-kinase; but two nontransforming versions of the oncoprotein, a kinase-defective protein and a carboxyl-terminally deleted Neu, were devoid of the constitutive association with PI 3'-kinase. Hence, we concluded that phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase is a physiological substrate of the Neu receptor, but the regulation of this coupling is released upon oncogenic activation."
https://openalex.org/W1526142701,"Complementary DNA (cDNA) that codes for a major androgen-dependent secretory protein of rat coagulating gland and dorsal prostate, dorsal protein 1 (DP1), was isolated by molecular cloning. Recombinant DP1 cDNA clones were identified from a bacteriophage lambda gt11 rat coagulating gland expression library using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody. Amino acid sequence deduced from DNA contained sequences identical with several DP1 cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments. Northern blot hybridization of poly(A) RNA isolated from intact rat dorsal prostate and coagulating gland revealed a predominant messenger RNA (mRNA) species of approximately 3200 nucleotides. Tissue-specific expression of DP1 mRNA was indicated by the absence of DP1 mRNA in ventral prostate and other tissues of the rat. Expression of DP1 mRNA was androgen-dependent, decreasing approximately 80% 7 days after castration and increasing rapidly following androgen replacement. Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme-digested rat DNA indicated that DP1 is encoded by a single gene and that no major genomic rearrangements accounted for its lack of expression in the dorsal prostate-derived rat Dunning tumor. Sequence comparisons revealed that rat prostate DP1 shares sequence identity with Factor XIIIa and tissue transglutaminase, including the active center, GQCWVF, indicating that DP1 is a member of the transglutaminase gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1896300191,"The expression of the genes encoding the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide in the endocrine islets of the pancreas is regulated in a cell-specific manner, defining four distinct cellular phenotypes (A-, B-, D-, and F-cells, respectively). Binding of nuclear proteins to cognate DNA sequences within cis-acting regulatory elements mediates the transcriptional events that result in the cell-specific activation or repression of gene expression. In a parallel study, we describe the functional properties of the SMS-UE, a pancreatic islet D-cell specific enhancer element that regulates the expression of the somatostatin gene and contains two interdependent domains, A and B. In the studies described herein, we have characterized the nuclear proteins that recognize the SMS-UE. Domain A of the SMS-UE is a DNA enhancer sequence that is identical to that bound by the ubiquitously distributed CCAAT box-binding protein alpha-CBF, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of the human chorionic gonadotrophin alpha-subunit gene. The B-domain, on the other hand, binds an islet cell-specific protein with characteristics similar to those of Isl-1, a transcriptional activator protein that binds to the E2 enhancer of the rat insulin-1 gene. In addition, the SMS-UE binds transcription factor CREB but not CREM, the close homolog of CREB, on a site adjacent to, or overlapping, the 3' end of domain B. We show that the carboxyl-terminal bZIP domain of CREB binds to the cAMP response element of the somatostatin gene but is not sufficient for binding to the SMS-UE, and we present evidence suggesting that CREB.SMS-UE binding requires stabilization by a region of the protein located within the transactivation domain."
https://openalex.org/W1533372919,"To investigate whether GTP concentrations can be a regulatory step in exocytotic hormone secretion, we treated isolated rat islets with mycophenolic acid (MPA) or mizoribine, two selective inhibitors of de novo GTP synthesis. When islets were cultured overnight in purine-free medium containing the drug, MPA reduced GTP levels by up to 81 +/- 1%; guanine circumvented this block via the nucleotide salvage pathway. MPA concomitantly inhibited glucose (16.7 mM)-induced insulin secretion in batch-type incubations (or perifusions), by up to 68% at 50 micrograms/ml. Although the inhibition of secretion occurred over a similar concentration range as the reduction in total GTP content, the two variables were not directly correlated. However, the secretory effects also were prevented by adding guanine, but not hypoxanthine or xanthine, to the culture medium. Similar results for GTP content and insulin release were seen using mizoribine. Insulin content was modestly (-18%) reduced by MPA but indices of fractional release (release/insulin content) were also markedly impaired. Although MPA also reduced ATP levels more modestly (-39%) and increased UTP (+87%), these were not the cause of the secretory defect since adenine restored ATP and UTP nearly to normal, but did not alter the reduction in GTP content or insulin secretion. MPA also inhibited secretion induced by amino acid or by a phorbol ester but had virtually no effect on release induced by a depolarizing concentration of K+, suggesting that GTP depletion does not merely impede Ca+ influx or directly block Ca(2+)-activated exocytosis. However, a severe reduction of GTP content did not prevent the pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of insulin release induced by epinephrine, suggesting that the function of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins is not limited by ambient GTP concentrations. Although these studies do not elucidate the exact site(s) in the exocytotic cascade which depend on intact GTP stores, they do provide the first direct evidence that GTP is required (and can be rate limiting) for insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1497258543,"We have investigated the possible role of chaperonins groEL and groES in the folding and assembly of heterotetramers (alpha 2 beta 2) of mammalian mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-keto acid decarboxylase (E1) in Escherichia coli. The mature E1 alpha subunit fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) was coexpressed with mature E1 beta on the same vector in ES- and EL- mutant strains. Only small or trace amounts of active E1 component were obtained. Cotransformation of the ES- mutant host with a second vector overexpressing groEL and groES resulted in a greater than 500-fold increase in E1-specific activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the content of both MBP-E1 alpha and E1 beta polypeptides was markedly increased in the presence of overexpressed chaperonin proteins. The time course studies showed that the increase in E1-specific activity and subunit levels correlated with the increase in groEL and groES until the concentration of the chaperonins reached a saturating level in the cell. The functional MBP-E1 fusion protein from ES- double transformants were purified by amylose resin affinity chromatography. The MBP moiety was removed by subsequent digestion with Factor Xa endoprotease, followed by Sephacryl S-300HR chromatography. It was found that E1 alpha and E1 beta assembled into an active 160-kDa species, which was consistent with the alpha 2 beta 2 structure of E1. The present results demonstrate that chaperonins groEL and groES promote folding and assembly of heterotetrameric proteins of mammalian mitochondrial origin."
https://openalex.org/W1545530316,"The dynamics of the guanylate cyclase receptor of atrial natriuretic factor (GCA-ANF receptor) were investigated in cultured glomerular mesangial and renomedullary interstitial cells from the rat. In these cells, the GCA-ANF receptor did not mediate internalization and lysosomal hydrolysis of 125I-ANF1-28 and did not undergo ligand-induced endocytosis. Glomerular mesangial cells were able, however, to mediate internalization and lysosomal hydrolysis of 125I-ANF1-28 via clearance ANF (C-ANF) receptors and to promote rapid receptor-mediated internalization and lysosomal hydrolysis of 125I-(Sar1) angiotensin II. Radioligand specifically bound to surface GCA-ANF receptors was rapidly dissociated at 37 degrees C (k(off) greater than 0.8 min-1), with a Q10(30-37 degrees C) greater than 6. The dissociation was markedly slower at subphysiological temperatures (Q10(4-30 degrees C), 2-3) or in the presence of 0.5 mM amiloride. The results demonstrate that the GCA-ANF receptor, contrary to C-ANF receptors and most other polypeptide hormone receptors, is a membrane resident protein that does not mediate internalization and lysosomal hydrolysis of ligand. The termination of the interaction of ANF with GCA-ANF receptors results from a physiological process that leads to rapid dissociation of receptor-ligand complexes. The unique dynamics of GCA-ANF receptor-ligand complexes are likely to contribute importantly to stimulus-response homeostasis of ANF."
https://openalex.org/W1650794073,"The correct intracellular sorting of lysosomal enzymes such as arylsulfatase A depends on the presence of mannose 6-phosphate residues on high mannose type oligosaccharides. The arylsulfatase A cDNA contains three potential N-glycosylation sites, two of which are utilized. We have mutated one or two of the N-glycosylation sites and analyzed the glycosylation, phosphorylation, and intracellular sorting of the mutant arylsulfatase A polypeptides. The results show that each of the three glycosylation sites (I, II, and III) can be glycosylated, but glycosylation at sites I and II is mutually exclusive. In mutants with one oligosaccharide side chain at positions I, II, or III all side chains can acquire mannose 6-phosphate residues irrespective of their location. This demonstrates spatial flexibility of the phosphotransferase, which specifically recognizes lysosomal enzymes and initiates the addition of mannose 6-phosphate residues on oligosaccharide side chains. However, these mutants have different intracellular sorting efficiencies and seem to use different (mannose 6-phosphate receptor-dependent and -independent) sorting pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1577813467,"The observation that tetanus toxin (TT) contains two sequences that show homology to known transglutaminase (TGase) substrate sites suggested that the toxin and TGase might interact. This prediction was confirmed by two pieces of evidence. First, TT potently stimulated the enzymatic activity of TGase. The effect was maximal at physiological (micromolar) concentrations of the endogenous TGase regulators calcium and GTP. Second, TT and TGase displayed marked variations of their intrinsic fluorescence properties when they were coincubated, indicating the occurrence of binding between them. TT-TGase binding and TGase activation occurred at similar concentrations of TT and are probably causally related. The activation of TGase, an enzyme present in nerve endings that, when activated, can irreversibly cross-link cellular proteins, might mediate the neurotoxic action of TT."
https://openalex.org/W1519072595,"GroEL140, a mutant Escherichia coli chaperonin unable to support bacteriophage lambda head assembly, was purified to near homogeneity and compared to wild type GroEL (cpn60). GroEL140 exhibited a 1.5-fold lower ATPase activity relative to the wild type protein. The hydrolysis of ATP by both polypeptides was fully inhibited by an excess of ATP gamma S and partially inhibited by ADP and 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate, suggesting that adenine nucleotides display different affinities for the ATP binding site of chaperonins. GroEL140 was more sensitive to trypsin digestion compared to wild type GroEL indicating that the mutation destabilized the conformation of the mutant. The proteolytic susceptibility of both chaperonins was similarly enhanced upon addition of ATP, ADP or non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, providing evidence (i) of a conformational change in the chaperonin structure which is likely to drive the protein discharge process, and (ii) that hydrolysis of ATP is not required to achieve topological modifications. GroEL140 retained its ability to bind non-native ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rbu-P2-carboxylase), but released bound proteins upon addition of ATP and GroES (cpn 10) 6-7-fold less efficiently compared to GroEL. This functional defect was shown to be related to a suboptimal, but not an absence of, interaction with GroES since (i) GroEL140 and GroES were unable to form a complex isolatable by size exclusion chromatography, and (ii) increasing the incubation time or the concentration of GroES enhanced the amount of refolded Rbu-P2-carboxylase discharged from GroEL140-Rbu-P2-carboxylase binary complexes. Pulse-chase experiments involving a double immunoabsorption technique confirmed that Rbu-P2-carboxylase remained associated two times longer with GroEL140 than with GroEL in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1568259561,"Abstract To examine the role of the transmembrane domain (TM) of the insulin receptor in insulin-induced receptor kinase activation, we prepared four mutated insulin receptors: 1) a Val938----Asp substitution (IR/TMv----D), 2) insertion of a 3-amino acid repeat (Val938-Phe939-Leu940) (IR/TM+3), or the entire TM was replaced by the corresponding domain of either the 3) platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (IR/TMPDGFR) or 4) c-neu/erbB2 proto-oncogene product (IR/TMc-neu). Each mutant receptor was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, insulin binding, and biosynthetic labeling. All mutant receptors exhibited normal affinity for insulin. Pulse-chase experiments showed that each proreceptor was processed into alpha- and beta-subunits, although the rate of IR/TMV----D conversion was reduced approximately 3-fold. With IR/TMPDGFR, IR/TMV----D, and IR/TM+3 basal and insulin-stimulated levels of autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activation were normal, both in wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-purified receptor preparations and intact cells. By contrast, following WGA purification or isolation of crude membranes, IR/TMc-neu was a constitutively active autokinase and substrate kinase in vitro. However, in intact cells insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation and kinase activity appeared normal. We conclude that although there is considerable latitude in acceptable structure, residues within the insulin receptor transmembrane domain can play a functional role in regulation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1508133206,"The insulin-, glucagon-, and somatostatin-producing cells in the pancreatic islets derive from a common precursor stem cell and differentiate sequentially during embryonic development, thereby providing an informative model for the study of the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the control of cell-specific gene expression. Relative to the early expression of the glucagon and insulin genes on embryonic days 10 and 12, respectively, the expression of the somatostatin gene is delayed (day 17). The relatively late expression of the somatostatin gene indicates the involvement of both negative and positive transcriptional control mechanisms. We show that the expression of the somatostatin gene in pancreatic islet cells is accomplished by the interplay of both positive and negative cis-regulatory DNA elements. We have characterized the functional properties of one of these positive control elements, the somatostatin gene upstream enhancer element (SMS-UE). The SMS-UE is a pancreatic islet D-cell-specific transcriptional regulator that acts synergistically with the cyclic AMP response element. Mutation-expression and cell-free transcription analyses show that the SMS-UE is a bipartite element with two interdependent functional domains. Our results indicate that the SMS-UE is part of a functional unit that includes other transcriptional control elements of the somatostatin gene proximal promoter, and that they act together to regulate the D-cell-specific transcription of the somatostatin gene in the islet cells of the pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1482931163,"A neu/erb B2 ligand growth factor (NEL-GF) was purified to homogeneity from bovine kidney by a procedure involving ammonium sulfate fractionation (35-70% saturation) followed by sequential column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (DE52), Sulfadex (sulfated Sephadex G-50), heparin-Sepharose 4B, and Superdex 75 (fast protein liquid chromatography). NEL-GF was found to be a 25-kDa polypeptide according to the analysis by gel filtration on Superdex 75 and 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. NEL-GF stimulated the tyrosine-specific autophosphorylation of the neu/erb B2 gene product purified by immunoabsorbent and tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of the neu/erb B2 gene product in intact dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR/G-8 cells (NIH 3T3 cells transfected with rat c-neu). NEL-GF also down-regulated the cell surface neu/erb B2 gene product in DHFR/G-8 cells. NEL-GF was mitogenic toward NIH 3T3 cells, DHFR/G-8 cells, A431 cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cells), and SK-BR-3 cells (human breast carcinoma cells) but inactive toward bovine aorta endothelial cells. NEL-GF was sensitive to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid but resistant to 5% beta-mercaptoethanol and appeared to be distinct from a neu protein-specific activating factor (Davis, J. G., Hamuro, J., Shim, C. Y., Samanta, A., Greene, M. I., and Dobashi, K. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 179, 1536-1542) and a 30-kDa glycoprotein which competed with a monoclonal antibody for binding to the neu/erb B2 gene product (Lupu, R., Colomer, R., Zugmaier, G., Sarup, J., Shepard, M., Slamon, D., and Lippman, M. E. (1990) Science 249, 1552-1555)."

https://openalex.org/W1664317205,"We have obtained highly purified preparations of the heme-controlled eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha-subunit (eIF-2 alpha) kinase (HCI) from rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing five different polypeptides. One of these is a 87-kDa (p87) phosphopeptide which appears to show an autokinase activity. The controlled digestion with trypsin of HCI preparations leads to the suggestion that phosphorylation of p87 is not needed for kinase activity and, furthermore, that another 89-kDa polypeptide could be the kinase catalytic subunit. In agreement with this, monoclonal antibodies directed against p87 do not interfere with eIF-2 alpha kinase activity. Moreover, the anti-p87 antibodies and those directed against the mammalian 90-kDa heat shock protein recognize the same p87 polypeptide from rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Upon incubation of the HCI preparation with hemin (5-10 microM), the eIF-2 alpha kinase is converted into an inactive form and appears to become associated with related peptides forming high molecular weight complexes which can be reversibly activated by 2-mercaptoethanol. The maintenance of the integrity of the porphyrin ring is absolutely required for kinase inactivation and although the presence of metal ion is not essential, the iron and cobalt metalloporphyrins are more effective than protoporphyrin IX. The formation of the inactive form of HCI by hemin is prevented by either N-ethylmaleimide, monoclonal antibodies directed against p87, or phosphorylation of p87. The data strongly suggest that hemin regulates eIF-2 alpha kinase activity by promoting formation of the inactive dimer HCI.p87 via disulfide bonds and direct binding of hemin. A model of HCI regulation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585856114,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E-4Philadelphia is a double mutant of apoE in which residue 13 of the mature protein, glutamic acid (GAG), is replaced by lysine (AAG) and amino acid 145, arginine (CGT), is converted to cysteine (TGT). These mutations result in two restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the enzymes AvaI and BbvI, a smaller apparent molecular weight of apoE-4Philadelphia on sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gels, and severe type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) in a 24-year-old homozygous female (Lohse, P., Mann, W. A., Stein, E. A., and Brewer, H. B., Jr. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10479-10484). In the current study, we have extended our analysis to include nine additional family members of the Philadelphia kindred spanning four generations. DNA and protein analysis demonstrated that the originally described propositus is a true homozygote for the epsilon-4Philadelphia allele and that six of the nine family members are heterozygous for the mutated allele and the normal epsilon-3 allele or, in one case, the epsilon-4 allele. Heterozygosity for apoE-4Philadelphia leads to the expression of a moderate form of type III HLP without clinical manifestations. These results are consistent with a dominant mode of inheritance of this dyslipoproteinemia. The simultaneous presence of unaffected individuals, heterozygotes, and a homozygote in the Philadelphia kindred makes it possible for the first time to demonstrate that the mutant apoE exhibits an incomplete or partial dominance of type III HLP. Heterozygosity for the normal epsilon-3 allele appears to have an influence on the expression of type III HLP, resulting in a phenotype intermediate between that of the two homozygous states."

https://openalex.org/W1596879001,"The role of the alpha-thyroid hormone receptor (TR alpha) in regulation of transcription of the gene for chicken malic enzyme was analyzed in fibroblast cell lines normally unresponsive to triiodothyronine (T3). The gene for this transcription factor was introduced stably and overexpressed using a replication-competent retroviral vector. In chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), overexpression of TR alpha decreased malic enzyme activity by 90% in the absence of T3. Addition of T3 almost completely restored malic enzyme activity to the level of similarly treated control CEF infected with virus lacking TR alpha. These TR alpha-induced changes in malic enzyme activity were mediated by alterations in transcription of the malic enzyme gene. Similar results were obtained when transcriptional activity of TR alpha was analyzed using a transient co-transfection system. Thus, the unliganded TR alpha is a transcriptional repressor of the malic enzyme gene; binding of T3 to the receptor abolishes this repression. In contrast, stable overexpression of TR alpha in QT6 cells had no effect on malic enzyme expression in the absence or presence of T3. Nuclear T3 binding was equally high in CEF and QT6 cells overexpressing TR alpha. These findings suggest that cell-specific factors control the ability of TR alpha to regulate the malic enzyme gene. Overexpression of TR alpha in CEF had no effect on the expression of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, lipogenic enzymes that are stimulated by T3 in hepatocytes in culture. Thus, gene-specific factors also may control the transcriptional activity of TR alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2103667692,"The brush border membrane of the proximal tubule contains two efflux pathways for organic cations from the cell to the tubular fluid: a P-glycoprotein and an organic cation/H+ exchanger. There is evidence that they transport many of the same substrates. Their structural relatedness is unknown and is the subject of this report. The experimental approach was to identify the exchanger with photoaffinity labeling reagents. The rationale was that if the P-glycoprotein and the organic cation/H+ exchanger transport many of the same substrates, then they might be photoaffinity labeled by the same reagents. [125I]Iodoarylazidoprazosin and [3H]azidopine are two reagents, which have been used, to photoaffinity label the P-glycoprotein. We found that several polypeptides were photolabeled in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The photoincorporation into only two of these polypeptides (41 and 28 kDa) was blocked extensively by the presence of known substrates for the exchanger. The photoaffinity labeling of only the 41-kDa polypeptide was affected by treatment with the chemical reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and dithiothreitol, which are known to affect the exchanger reaction. The findings are consistent with the interpretation that a 41-kDa polypeptide is, or is a component of, the exchanger."
