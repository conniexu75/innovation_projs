https://openalex.org/W1979420492,"Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) regulate pigmentation and adrenal cortical function, respectively. These peptides also have a variety of biological activities in other areas, including the brain, the pituitary, and the immune system. A complete understanding of the biological activities of these hormones requires the isolation and characterization of their corresponding receptors. The murine and human MSH receptors (MSH-Rs) and a human ACTH receptor (ACTH-R) were cloned. These receptors define a subfamily of receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that may include the cannabinoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1758789982,"In cells, stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) results in the dephosphorylation of specific residues proximal to the DNA binding domain of c-Jun, a major component of the AP-1 transcription factor. Since phosphorylation of this region of c-Jun inhibits interaction with DNA, this pathway may contribute to PKC activation of AP-1. To determine the mechanism(s) underlying this pathway, possible interactions between PKC and proteins implicated in c-Jun regulation are being investigated. Here it is shown that glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), a serine/threonine kinase that specifically targets the inhibitory c-Jun phosphorylation sites, is phosphorylated in vitro by particular forms of PKC (alpha, beta 1, gamma greater than beta 2; not epsilon). By contrast, the related GSK-3 alpha is not a substrate for any of these PKC isotypes. Phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta by PKC results in its specific inactivation. These results are consistent with a model in which activation of PKC stimulates c-Jun DNA binding by inhibiting its phosphorylation by GSK-3 beta."
https://openalex.org/W1523015514,"Abstract Initial autophosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) occurs at Thr286 (the site) and converts the kinase from a Ca(2+)-dependent to a partially Ca(2+)-independent or autonomous enzyme. After removal of Ca2+/calmodulin, the autonomous kinase undergoes a of inhibitory autophosphorylation at sites distinct from the autonomy site which may be masked in the presence of bound calmodulin. This burst of Ca(2+)-independent autophosphorylation blocks the ability of calmodulin to activate the kinase. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace putative inhibitory autophosphorylation sites within the calmodulin binding domain of recombinant alpha-CaM kinase with nonphosphorylatable alanines and examined the effects on autophosphorylation, kinase activity, and calmodulin binding. Although prominent Ca(2+)-independent autophosphorylation occurs within the calmodulin binding domain at Thr305, Thr306, and Ser314 in wild-type alpha-CaM kinase, the inhibitory effect on kinase activity and calmodulin binding is retained in mutants lacking any one of these three sites. However, when both Thr305 and Thr306 are converted to alanines the kinase does not display inhibition of either activity or calmodulin binding. Autophosphorylation at either Thr305 or Thr306 is therefore sufficient to block both binding and activation of the kinase by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thr306 is also slowly autophosphorylated in a basal reaction in the continuous absence of Ca2+/calmodulin. Autophosphorylation of Thr306 by the kinase in either its basal or autonomous state suggests that in the absence of bound calmodulin, the region of the autoregulatory domain surrounding Thr306, rather than the region near the autonomy site, lies nearest the peptide substrate binding site of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1565504291,"The determinants on the cytoplasmic tail of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) required for lysosomal enzyme sorting have been analyzed. Mouse L cells deficient in the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor were transfected with normal bovine CD-MPR cDNA or cDNAs containing mutations in the 67-amino acid cytoplasmic tail and assayed for their ability to target the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D to lysosomes. Cells expressing the wild-type bovine CD-MPR sorted 67 +/- 2% of newly synthesized cathepsin D compared with the base-line value of 47 +/- 1%. The presence of mannose 6-phosphate in the medium did not affect the efficiency of cathepsin D sorting, indicating that the routing of the ligand-receptor complex is completely intracellular. Mutant receptors with the carboxyl-terminal His-Leu-Leu-Pro-Met67 residues deleted or replaced with alanines sorted cathepsin D below the base-line value. A mutant receptor with the outermost Pro-Met residues replaced with alanines sorted cathepsin D better than the wild-type receptor, indicating that the essential residues for sorting are the His-Leu-Leu sequence. Disruption of a putative casein kinase II phosphorylation site at Ser57 had no detectable effect on sorting. The mutant receptor with the five-amino acid deletion was able to bind to a phosphopentamannose affinity column, proving that its ligand binding site was grossly intact. Resialylation experiments showed that this mutant receptor recycled from the cell surface to the Golgi at a rate similar to the normal CD-MPR, indicating that the defect in sorting is at the level of the Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1594159276,"The numerous biological activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) appear mediated by two types of receptors of 55 kDa (TR55) and 75 kDa (TR75) molecular mass. To test TR55 for its individual role in signaling across the membrane, a cDNA coding for the human TR55 was stably expressed in murine 70Z/3 pre-B cells, which lack binding sites for, and proved nonresponsive to human TNF. The transfected TR55 showed high affinity ligand binding and active internalization. It is demonstrated that the TNF signaling cascade, i.e. stimulation of protein kinase C, sphingomyelinase, and phospholipase A2, production of the second messengers diacylglycerol and ceramide, can occur completely through exclusive binding of TNF to TR55. The p55 TNF-binding site functions as an autonomous TNF receptor that mediates key signal transduction pathways, which may control the majority of TNF actions."
https://openalex.org/W1511386761,"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: beta-D-mannoside beta-1,4N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III: EC 2.4.1.144) catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine in beta 1-4 linkage to the beta-linked mannose of the trimannosyl core of N-linked sugar chains. The enzyme has been purified over 153,000-fold in 1.5% yield from a Triton X-100 extract of rat kidney by fractionation procedures utilizing QAE-Sepharose, Cu(2+)-chelating Sepharose, and affinity chromatography on UDP-hexanolamine and substrate-conjugated Sepharose. The purified protein migrates as one major and one minor band with apparent molecular masses of 62 kDa and 52 kDa, respectively. The purified enzyme was digested with trypsin, and the amino acid sequences of four peptides were determined. Oligonucleotide primers were designed according to those amino acid sequences and used in the polymerase chain reaction. Screening for the cDNA for GnT-III was carried out by plaque hybridization using a rat kidney cDNA library (lambda gt10) and a polymerase chain reaction product as the probe. Rat kidney GnT-III has 536 amino acids and three putative N-glycosylation sites. There is no sequence homology to other previously cloned glycosyltransferases, but the enzyme appears to be a type II transmembrane protein like the other glycosyltransferases. The GnT-III activity in transiently transfected COS-1 cells was found to be about 500-3600-fold as compared to that in non- or mock-transfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093602531,"A form of the human erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) was identified in which the cytoplasmic region is truncated by alternative splicing. The truncated form of the receptor (EPOR-T) is the most prevalent form of EPOR in early-stage erythroid progenitor cells, but the full-length EPOR (EPOR-F) becomes the most prevalent form in late-stage progenitors. EPOR-T can transduce a mitogenic signal. However, cells transfected with EPOR-T are more prone to programmed cell death than those expressing EPOR-F. EPOR-F may transduce a signal to prevent programmed cell death that is independent of the mitogenic signal, and alternative splicing of the EPOR gene may have an important role in erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1532539575,"M-CAT binding factor (MCBF) governs the activity of the cardiac troponin T gene promoter. M-CAT motifs have also been implicated recently in the regulation of other contractile protein genes which like cardiac troponin T, do not require direct interaction with MyoD1 or related factors for activity. Mutational analysis of the M-CAT motif revealed that it can be functionally replaced by a regulatory motif of the SV40 enhancer which binds human transcription factor TEF-1. Biochemical analyses show that MCBF from muscle nuclei is indistinguishable from TEF-1 in terms of specificity of binding site recognition, fractionation on DNA-agarose, and apparent molecular weight. In addition, antibodies raised against amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of human TEF-1 also bind to MCBF from chicken muscle. We conclude, therefore, that MCBF is closely related to TEF-1. Finally, MCBF/TEF-1 is highly enriched in the nuclei of striated muscle, as compared with other tissues, consistent with a role in muscle-specific promoter regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1590302505,"The soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) system, consisting of reductase, component B, and hydroxylase (MMOH), catalyzes NADH and O2-dependent monooxygenation of many hydrocarbons. MMOH contains 2 mu-(H or R)oxo-bridged dinuclear iron clusters thought to be the sites of catalysis. Although rapid NADH-coupled turnover requires all three protein components, three less complex systems are also functional: System I, NADH, O2, reductase, and MMOH; System II, H2O2 and oxidized MMOH; System III, MMOH reduced nonenzymatically by 2e- and then exposed to O2 (single turnover). All three systems give the same products, suggesting a common reactive oxygen species. However, the distribution of products observed for most substrates that are hydroxylated in more than one position is different for each system. For several of these substrates, addition of component B to Systems I, II, or III causes the product distributions to shift dramatically. These shifts result in identical product distributions for Systems I and III in which MMOH passes through the 2e- reduced state ([Fe(II).Fe(II)]) during catalysis. In contrast, System II (in which MMOH probably does not become reduced) generally gives a unique product distribution. It is proposed that changes in MMOH structure occurring upon diiron cluster reduction and/or component complex formation cause substrates to be presented differently to the activated oxygen species. Kinetic studies show that component B strongly activates System I and, in most cases, strongly deactivates System II. The effect of component B on product distribution of System I (and III) occurs at less than 5% of the MMOH concentration, while nearly stoichiometric concentrations are required to maximize the rate of System I. This shows that component B has at least two roles in catalysis. EPR monitored titration of reduced MMOH ([Fe(II).Fe(II)]) with component B suggests that the effect of substoichiometric component B on product distribution is due to hysteresis in the MMOH conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1576318972,"Oncostatin M (OM) is a multifunctional cytokine that is structurally and functionally related to interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The specific receptor for OM has been demonstrated (by chemical cross-linking) to be a 150-kDa protein in a number of cell lines. The IL-6 signal transducer, gp130, is also an affinity converter for the LIF receptor. It does not bind to either IL-6 or LIF, but associates with the alpha subunits of the receptors and transduces the signals. We examined the possible involvement of gp130 in OM binding and signaling. We demonstrate that: (a) anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) block the inhibitory effect of OM on A375 cell growth, (b) the binding and cross-linking of 125I-OM to H2981 cells are completely abolished by anti-gp130 mAbs, (c) the cross-linked OM-receptor complex is immunoprecipitated by anti-gp130 mAbs, and (d) COS-7 cells transfected with the full-length cDNA encoding gp130 exhibit increased OM binding and cross-linking, which are also blocked by anti-gp130 mAbs. Therefore, we conclude that the 150-kDa OM binding protein previously characterized in a variety of cell lines is gp130. OM is the natural ligand for gp130 and gp130 mediates the biological responses of OM."
https://openalex.org/W1541526229,"The TOP3 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was postulated to encode a DNA topoisomerase, based on its sequence homology to Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I and the suppression of the poor growth phenotype of top3 mutants by the expression of the E. coli enzyme (Wallis, J.W., Chrebet, G., Brodsky, G., Golfe, M., and Rothstein, R. (1989) Cell 58, 409-419). We have purified the yeast TOP3 gene product to near homogeneity as a 74-kDA protein from yeast cells lacking DNA topoisomerase I and overexpressing a plasmid-borne TOP3 gene linked to a phosphate-regulated yeast PHO5 gene promoter. The purified protein possesses a distinct DNA topoisomerase activity: similar to E. coli DNA topoisomerases I and III, it partially relaxes negatively but not positively supercoiled DNA. Several experiments, including the use of a negatively supercoiled heteroduplex DNA containing a 29-nucleotide single-stranded loop, indicate that the activity has a strong preference for single-stranded DNA. A protein-DNA covalent complex in which the 74-kDa protein is linked to a 5' DNA phosphoryl group has been identified, and the nucleotide sequences of 30 sites of DNA-protein covalent complex formation have been determined. These sequences differ from those recognized by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I but resemble those recognized by E. coli DNA topoisomerase III. Based on these results, the yeast TOP3 gene product can formally be termed S. cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase III. Analysis of supercoiling of intracellular yeast plasmids in various DNA topoisomerase mutants indicates that yeast DNA topoisomerase III has at most a weak activity in relaxing negatively supercoiled double-stranded DNA in vivo, in accordance with the characteristics of the purified enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1676002230,"The AdhE protein of Escherichia coli is a homopolymer of 96-kDa subunits harboring three Fe(2+)-dependent catalytic functions: acetaldehyde-CoA dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and pyruvate formatelyase (PFL) deactivase. By negative staining electron microscopy, we determined a helical assembly of 20-60 subunits into rods of 45-120 nm in length. The subunit packing is widened along the helix axis when Fe2+ and NAD are present. Chymotrypsin dissects the AdhE polypeptide between Phe762 and Ser763, thereby retaining the alcohol dehydrogenase activity on the NH2-terminal core, but destroying all other activities. PFL deactivation, i.e. quenching of the glycyl radical in PFL by the AdhE protein, was examined with respect to cofactor involvements (Fe2+, NAD, and CoA). This process is coupled to NAD reduction and requires the intact CoA sulfhydryl group. Pyruvate and NADH are inhibitors that affect the steady-state level of the radical form of PFL in a reconstituted interconversion cycle. Studies of cell cultures found that PFL deactivation in situ is initiated at redox potentials of greater than or equal to +100 mV. Our results provide insights into the structure/function organization of the AdhE multienzyme and give a rationale for how its PFL radical quenching activity may be suppressed in situ to enable effective glucose fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W1491464210,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are vasoactive peptides produced in cells of the cardiovascular system. We examined the effects of ANP on ET-1 transcription, production (translation), and secretion in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). ANP and C-ANP 4-23 (a specific ligand for the C or non-guanylate cyclase receptor) equipotently inhibited the synthesis of prepro-ET-1 and ET-1 proteins in BAEC by at least 50%. Both of these forms of ANP and another C receptor specific ligand, nanopiperazine ANP (11-15)-NH2, inhibited ET-1 secretion by as much as 55%. LY 83583, an inhibitor of ANP-induced cGMP generation, failed to reverse the ANP-induced inhibition of ET-1 secretion. This further indicated that the guanylate cyclase-linked B receptor is not involved. The decreased ET-1 secretion caused by C-ANP 4-23 was reversed by 8-bromo-cAMP or amiloride, which prevents ANP-induced inhibition of cAMP. We also found that ANP and C-ANP 4-23 augmented ET-1 mRNA levels in BAEC by prolonging the mRNA half-life. ANP or cycloheximide comparably inhibited ET-1 translation while increasing ET-1 mRNA levels, suggesting that the two events are related. These results indicate that ANP inhibits ET-1 protein production and secretion while stabilizing the ET-1 mRNA. The effects of ANP are mediated through the C receptor and are probably the result of ANP inhibiting the generation of cAMP. These findings suggest a potentially important new function for this receptor to mediate, in part, the interactions of ANP and ET in the vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W1594840269,"The addition of phorbol esters to U937 leukemic cells stimulates the phosphorylation of c-Jun on serines 63 and 73. To isolate the protein kinase which stimulates this phosphorylation, we have used heparin-Sepharose chromatography followed by affinity chromatography over glutathione-Sepharose beads bound with a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and amino acids 5-89 of c-Jun (GST-c-Jun). Using this procedure we purify a 67-kDa protein which is capable of phosphorylating GST-c-Jun as well as the complete c-Jun protein. By making mutations in serines 63 and 73 and then creating a fusion protein with GST (GST-c-Jun mut), we demonstrate that this protein kinase specifically phosphorylates these sites in the c-Jun amino terminus. Treatment of purified c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (cJAT-PK) with phosphatase 2A inhibits its ability to phosphorylate GST-c-Jun. This inactivated enzyme can be reactivated by phosphorylation with protein kinase C (PKC), although PKC is not capable of phosphorylating the GST-c-Jun substrate. Because v-Jun cannot be phosphorylated in vivo, we compared the ability of cJAT-PK to bind to GST-v-Jun or GST-c-Jun mut. The cJAT-PK bound 50-fold better to GST-c-Jun mut than GST-v-Jun suggesting that the delta domain which is missing in v-Jun plays a role in binding the cJAT-PK. These results suggest that there is a protein kinase cascade mediated by protein phosphatases and PKC which regulates c-Jun phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1550523741,"Jun homodimers and Fos/Jun heterodimers bind to the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) at three sites within the first 350 base pairs of the promoter. These include CRE-1 (-82 to -90), and P3(II) and P4 (-252 to -258 and -268 to -285, respectively). Over-expression of Jun in HepG2 cells resulted in a 10-15-fold increase in the level of transcription of a chimeric PEPCK (-490 to +73)-CAT gene, while expression of Fos decreased transcription and blocked the induction of transcription from the PEPCK promoter by Jun. The action of Fos and Jun on PEPCK gene transcription involved each of the Fos/Jun-binding sites and was modulated by additional transcriptional regulatory elements within the PEPCK promoter. The ability of Fos to inhibit PEPCK transcription was dependent upon P3(I), a region of the promoter which does not bind Fos/Jun heterodimers, but does bind members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors. Stimulation of PEPCK transcription by 8-Br-cAMP or by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was inhibited by Fos expression. The inhibitory effects of phorbol esters and protein kinase C on PEPCK gene expression may be mediated through the action of Fos and Jun."
https://openalex.org/W1506680557,"The mouse gene encoding a myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein expressed in type IIB fibers of adult skeletal muscle has been cloned and its promoter isolated. A number of DNA sequence motifs are found within the first 2.5 kilobases of the promoter which are similar to motifs present in the promoters of other muscle-specific genes. One sequence located at approximately -940 base pairs corresponds to the motif called MEF1 which has been shown in other muscle genes to bind the myogenic regulatory factors of which MyoD is one example. The MEF1 site of this adult IIB MHC promoter does indeed bind MyoD although this factor is normally thought to be involved in early muscle cell differentiation. The IIB MHC promoter also has several motifs located in the first 200 base pairs which are strikingly conserved between this mouse gene and several chicken skeletal MHC genes. Of these evolutionarily conserved sequences, two motifs rich in A and T residues appear to be major contributors to the muscle-specific transcriptional activity of the mouse IIB MHC promoter when transfected into quail myogenic and non-myogenic cells. These observations suggest an important functional role for these AT-rich sequence motifs in the regulation of genes of the MHC family."
https://openalex.org/W1597599799,"We present a new technique for the simultaneous measurement of cell volume changes and intracellular ionic activities in single cells. The technique uses measurement of changes in the concentration of intracellularly trapped fluorescent dyes to report relative cell volume. By using pH- or Ca(2+)-sensitive dyes and recording at the ion-sensitive and -insensitive (isosbestic) wavelengths, the method can measure both cell volume changes and intracellular ionic activities. The technique was used to study the mechanisms of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in the osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106-01 grown on cover slips. Swelling cells in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered hypotonic medium was followed by stable cytosolic acidification and a decrease in cell volume back toward normal. The recovery of cell volume could be blocked by depolarization, treatment with ouabain, or depletion of cell Cl-. These suggest the conductive efflux of K+ and Cl- during RVD. The cytosolic acidification that accompanied cell swelling was not blocked by amiloride, bafilomycin A, or removal of Cl- and could not be reproduced by depletion of cellular ATP. These findings exclude Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO-3 exchange, intracellularly generated acid, or increased metabolism, respectively, as the cause of the acidification. The cell swelling-induced acidification was inhibited by depolarization, suggesting the involvement of an electrogenic pathway. The acidification, as well as RVD, was inhibited by short incubation with deoxyglucose, and these effects could not be reversed by valinomycin. Thus, the anionic pathway(s) participating in RVD and the acidification are sensitive to the cellular level of ATP. Together, these studies indicate that RVD in UMR-106-01 cells in HEPES-buffered medium is mediated by the conductive efflux of K+, Cl-, and OH-."
https://openalex.org/W1556997704,"Hydroperoxides are known to induce the formation of tyrosyl free radicals in prostaglandin (PG) H synthase. To evaluate the role of these radicals in cyclooxygenase catalysis we have analyzed the temporal correlation between radical formation and substrate conversion during reaction of the synthase with arachidonic acid. PGH synthase reacted with equimolar levels of arachidonic acid generated sequentially the wide doublet (34 G peak-to-trough) and wide singlet (32 G peak-to-trough) tyrosyl radical signals previously reported for reaction with hydroperoxide. The kinetics of formation and decay of the doublet signal corresponded reasonably well with those of cyclooxygenase activity. However, the wide singlet free radical signal accumulated only after prostaglandin formation had ceased, indicating that the wide singlet is not likely to be an intermediate in cyclooxygenase catalysis. When PGH synthase was reacted with 25 equivalents of arachidonic acid, the wide doublet and wide singlet radical signals were not observed. Instead, a narrower singlet (24 G peak-to-trough) tyrosyl radical was generated, similar to that found upon reaction of indomethacin-treated synthase with hydroperoxide. Only about 11 mol of prostaglandin were formed per mol of synthase before complete self-inactivation of the cyclooxygenase, far less than the 170 mol/mol synthase produced under standard assay conditions. Phenol (0.5 mM) increased the extent of cyclooxygenase reaction by only about 50%, in contrast to the 460% stimulation seen under standard assay conditions. These results indicate that the narrow singlet tyrosyl radical observed in the reaction with high levels of arachidonate in this study and by Lassmann et al. (Lassmann, G., Odenwaller, R., Curtis, J.F., DeGray, J.A., Mason, R.P., Marnett, L.J., and Eling, T.E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20045-20055) is associated with abnormal cyclooxygenase activity and is probably nonphysiological. In titrations of the synthase with arachidonate or with hydroperoxide, the loss of enzyme activity and destruction of heme were linear functions of the amount of titrant added. Complete inactivation of cyclooxygenase activity was found at about 10 mol of arachidonate, ethyl hydrogen peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide per mol of synthase heme; maximal bleaching of the heme Soret absorbance peak was found with 10 mol of ethyl hydroperoxide or 20 mol of either arachidonate or hydrogen peroxide per mol of synthase heme. The peak concentration of the wide doublet tyrosyl radical did not change appreciably with increased levels of ethyl hydroperoxide. In contrast, higher levels of hydroperoxide gave higher levels of the wide singlet radical species, in parallel with enzyme inactivation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1654771309,"Insulin receptor (IR) is a glycoprotein possessing N-linked oligosaccharide side chains on both alpha and beta subunits. The present study focuses for the first time on the potential contribution of N-linked oligosaccharides of the beta subunit in the processing, structure, and function of the insulin receptor. To investigate this point, a receptor mutant (IR beta N1234) was obtained by stable transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells of an IR cDNA modified by site-directed mutagenesis on the four potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) of the beta subunit. The mutated receptor presents an alpha subunit of 135 kDa, indistinguishable from the wild type alpha subunit, but the beta subunit has a reduced molecular mass (80 kDa instead of 95 kDa) most likely due to the absence of N-glycosylation. Metabolic labeling experiments indicate a normal processing and maturation of this mutated receptor which is normally expressed at the surface of the cells as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. The affinity of the mutant for insulin (Kd = 0.12 nM) is similar to that of the wild type receptor (Kd = 0.12 nM). However, a major defect of the mutated IR tyrosine kinase was assessed both in vitro and in vivo by (i) the absence of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the poly(Glu-Tyr) substrate in vitro; (ii) the reduction of the insulin maximal stimulation of the mutated IR autophosphorylation in vitro (2-fold stimulation for the mutant receptor as compared to a 7-fold stimulation for the wild type); and (iii) a more complex alteration of the mutated receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation in vivo (3-fold increase of the basal phosphorylation and a 4-fold simulation of this phosphorylation as compared to the wild type receptor, the phosphorylation of which is stimulated 14-fold by insulin). The physiological consequences of this defect were tested on three classical insulin cellular actions; in Chinese hamster ovary IR beta N1234, glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and DNA synthesis were all unable to be stimulated by insulin indicating the absence of insulin transduction through this mutated receptor. These data provide the first direct evidence for a critical role of oligosaccharide side chains of the beta subunit in the molecular events responsible for the IR enzymatic activation and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1672142433,"The expression of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) genes has been implicated as a negative regulator of murine and human tumor metastases and is critical to proper development in Drosophila melanogaster. Molecular mechanisms for the role(s) of NDK in these complex processes have not yet been elucidated, but several reports have suggested that these and many other signal transduction pathways may be activated by NDK acting directly on a regulatory GTP-binding protein(s). To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of NDK to catalyze the phosphorylation of the GDP bound to the following three members of the superfamily of regulatory GTP-binding proteins: Gt, Ha-ras p21, and ARF. We have found no evidence to support the hypothesis that NDK can directly activate any GTP-binding protein. Rather, evidence is presented which clearly shows that all of the GTP formed upon incubation of GTP-binding proteins with NDK is the result of NDK utilizing free GDP as substrate. The GDP bound to the regulatory proteins is not a substrate for NDK under conditions in which free nucleotides are rapidly and efficiently phosphorylated. The importance of appropriate controls for dissociation of GDP from the regulatory proteins both during the NDK reaction and during the analysis of product is demonstrated. We believe there is currently no experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that NDK can directly activate a regulatory GTP-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1490531055,"Conjugative transfer of the self-transmissible IncP plasmid RP4 requires the product of the RP4 traK gene. By using the phage T7 expression system, the traK gene product was efficiently overproduced and purified to near homogeneity. traK encodes a basic protein (pI = 10.7) of 14.6 kDa that, as shown by DNA fragment retention assay, interacts exclusively with its cognate transfer origin. The apparent equilibrium constant K(app) for the complex of TraK and oriT-DNA was estimated to be 4 nM. Footprinting experiments using DNase I or hydroxyl radicals indicate that several TraK molecules interact specifically with an intrinsically bent region of oriT, covering a range of almost 200 base pairs. The TraK target sequence maps in the leading region adjacent to the relaxation nick site and recognition sequences involved in relaxosome formation but does not overlap them. Specific interactions between TraK and the DNA occur only on one side of the double helix. Electron microscopy of TraK-oriT complexes demonstrates that binding of TraK to its recognition region apparently shrinks the length of the target DNA, suggesting that the nucleic acid becomes wrapped around a core of TraK molecules. Formation of this structure could be favored by the presence of the sequence-directed bend in the TraK recognition region."

https://openalex.org/W1951707121,The ability of a eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I to catalyze DNA rearrangements was examined in vitro using defined substrates and purified enzyme. Site-specific DNA strand cleavage by vaccinia topoisomerase I across from a nick generated double-strand breaks that could be religated to a heterologous blunt-ended duplex DNA regardless of the sequence of the acceptor molecule. Topoisomerase bound covalently at internal positions could religate the bound strand to an incoming acceptor provided that DNA molecule had sequence homology to the region 3' of the scissile bond. These end-joining reactions suggest two potential modes of topoisomerase-mediated recombination that differ in their requirements for DNA homology.
https://openalex.org/W1606063661,"Abstract In PC12 cells, retinoic acid (RA) stimulates the expression of p75NGFR, a component of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, as indicated by a rapid increase in p75NGFR mRNA, an increase in the binding of 125I-labeled NGF to p75NGFR, and an increase in the binding of NGF to low affinity sites. RA-treated cells are more sensitive to NGF, but not to either fibroblast growth factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, showing that RA has a specific effect on the responsiveness of PC12 cells to NGF. Exposure to RA leads neither to an increase in the expression of mRNA for trk, another component of the NGF receptor, nor to an increase in binding to high affinity receptors, suggesting that an increase in the expression of p75NGFR is sufficient to make cells more sensitive to NGF. This work suggests that, in addition to having direct effects on gene expression, RA can indirectly modulate differentiation of neurons by modifying their expression of cell surface receptors to peptide growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1480030874,"Microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases form a group of serine/threonine kinases stimulated by various growth factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and hormones such as insulin. Interestingly, MAP kinases are thought to participate in a protein kinase cascade leading to cell growth as they have been shown to phosphorylate and activate ribosomal protein S6 kinase. To further evaluate the interactions between the different components of this cascade, we looked at the possible coprecipitation of MAP kinase activator(s) or MAP kinase substrate(s) with MAP kinase. Using antipeptides to the C terminus of the M(r) 44,000 MAP kinase, ERK1, and cell extracts from unstimulated or NGF-treated PC12 cells, we obtained in addition to MAP kinase itself coprecipitation of a protein with a M(r) in the 90,000 range. We further show that this protein is a protein kinase since it becomes phosphorylated on serine residues, after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. In vitro phosphorylation performed before sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrates NGF-sensitive phosphorylation of this 90-kDa protein on both serine and threonine; the serine phosphorylation is likely to be due to autophosphorylation, and the threonine phosphorylation due to phosphorylation by the copurifying MAP kinase. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of this 90-kDa protein was obtained with antibodies to S6 kinase II. Finally, using in situ chemical cross-linking, we were able to demonstrate in intact cells the occurrence of an anti-ERK1 immunoreactive species with a molecular mass of approximately 125,000 compatible with a complex between ERK1 and a 90-kDa S6 kinase. Taken together, our observations demonstrate that the 44-kDa MAP kinase is associated, in intact PC12 cells, with a protein kinase which is very likely to be S6 kinase II. In conclusion, our data represent strong evidence for a physiological role of the MAP kinase-S6 kinase cascade in PC12 cells. Finally, our antipeptides provide us with a powerful tool to search for additional physiologically relevant substrates for MAP kinase, a key integrator enzyme for growth factors and hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1535037813,"Using specific anti-BiP/Kar2 antibody as the probe, we have developed an efficient purification method of BiP/Kar2 protein from the total cell extract of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overproduction of BiP/Kar2 protein was achieved by the cloning of the KAR2 gene on multicopy plasmids and the treatment of cells harboring the cloned KAR2 gene with tunicamycin. Freeze-thaw treatment, hydroxyapatite high pressure liquid chromatography, and ATP-agarose column chromatography of crude extract yielded homogeneous BiP/Kar2 protein (including less than 0.2% of degradative derivative) with a 430-fold purification and 28% recovery. Edman degradation of purified BiP/Kar2 suggests that the mature protein corresponds to a processed product with the removal of a 42-amino acid presequence. It is active as a homodimer and exhibits ATPase activity with a specific activity of 2 pmol/min/micrograms of protein. Protease susceptibility indicated that the ADP form of BiP/Kar2 is more resistant than the ATP form to the chymotrypsin digestion and that BiP/Kar2 required the presence of ATP to avoid the irreversible denaturation. Synthesis of BiP/Kar2 was induced by the inducible expression of an aberrant heterologous protein, yeast killer prepro-signal mouse alpha-amylase fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W1567044759,"The high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin (Ig) E on mast cells, along with the antigen receptors on T and B cells and Fc receptors for IgG, belongs to a class of receptors which lack intrinsic kinase activity, but activate non-receptor tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Receptor engagement triggers a chain of signaling events leading from protein phosphorylation to activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, an increase in intracellular calcium levels, and ultimately the activation of more specialized functions. IgE receptor disengagement leads to reversal of phosphorylation by undefined phosphatases and to inhibition of activation pathways. Here we show that phenylarsine oxide, a chemical which reacts with thiol groups and has been reported to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases, uncouples the IgE receptor-mediated phosphorylation signal from activation of phosphatidyl inositol metabolism, the increase in intracellular calcium levels, and serotonin release. Phenylarsine oxide inhibits neither the kinases (tyrosine and serine/threonine) phosphorylating the receptor and various cellular substrates nor, unexpectedly, the phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation following receptor disengagement. By contrast, it abolishes the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1, but not phospholipase C activity in vitro. Therefore the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C likely requires a phenylarsine oxide-sensitive element. Receptor aggregation thus activates at least two distinct phosphorylation pathways: a phenylarsine oxide-insensitive pathway leading to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the receptor and of various substrates and a sensitive pathway leading to phospholipase C-gamma 1 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1570590300,"The regulation of extracellular Ca2+ entry into fura-2-loaded human platelets was examined following stimulation with thrombin. In the presence of external Ca2+, stimulation of platelets with thrombin resulted in a rapid increase, followed by a plateau, in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Pretreatment with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, suppressed only the plateau phase and had no effect on the initial rapid increase in [Ca2+]i. In Ca(2+)-free EGTA buffer, thrombin induced a transient and relatively small increase in [Ca2+]i caused by Ca2+ release from internal stores. When Ca2+ was added subsequently to the Ca(2+)-free medium within 10 min after thrombin activation, a marked increase in [Ca2+]i was seen, reflecting thrombin-stimulated external Ca2+ entry. With the Ca(2+)-free medium, wortmannin did not affect either the Ca2+ mobilization from the internal stores or the rapid external Ca2+ entry at early time points (within 5 s) after thrombin stimulation, whereas it significantly inhibited Ca2+ entry when Ca2+ was added later (at 3 min). Wortmannin inhibition of this late Ca2+ entry and that of 20-kDa myosin light chain phosphorylation after thrombin stimulation were dose- and preincubation time-dependent and correlated well with each other. These results suggest that two different channels are responsible for Ca2+ entry in human platelets at the early and late phases of thrombin stimulation and that the channel responsible for the late phase of Ca2+ entry may be activated by a mechanism involving myosin light chain kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1548815964,"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium perchlorate (MPDP+), an intermediate in the metabolism of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, was found to generate superoxide radicals during its autoxidation process. The generation of superoxide radicals was detected by their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c. Superoxide dismutase inhibited this reduction in a dose-dependent manner. The rate of reduction of ferricytochrome c was dependent not only on the concentration of MPDP+ but also on the pH of the system. Thus, the rate of autoxidation of MPDP+ and the sensitivity of this autoxidation to superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction were both augmented, as the pH was raised from 7.0 to 10.5. The rate constant (Kc) for the reaction of superoxide radical with ferricytochrome c to form ferricytochrome c was found to be 3.48 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. The rate constant (KMPDP+) for the reaction of MPDP+ with ferricytochrome3+ c was found to be only 4.86 M-1 s-1. These results, in conjunction with complexities in the kinetics, lead to the proposal that autoxidation of MPDP+ proceeds by at least two distinct pathways, one of which involves the production of superoxide radicals and hence is inhibitable by superoxide dismutase. It is possible that the free radicals so generated could induce oxidative injury which may be central to the MPTP/MPDP(+)-induced neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W1584957240,"In rat pituitary GH3 cells, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) down-regulates TRH receptor (TRH-R) mRNA (Fujimoto, J., Straub, R.E., and Gershengorn, M.C. (1991) Mol. Endocrinol. 5, 1527-1532), at least in part, by stimulating its degradation (Fujimoto, J., Narayanan, C.S., Benjamin, J.E., Heinflink, M., and Gershengorn, M.C. (1992) Endocrinology 130, 1879-1884). Here we show that TRH regulates RNase activity in GH3 cells and that specific mRNA sequences are needed for in vivo regulation of TRH-R mRNA by TRH. TRH affected RNase activity in a biphasic manner with rapid stimulation (by 10 min) followed by a decrease to a rate slower than in control lysates within 6 h. This time course paralleled the effects of TRH on degradation of TRH-R mRNA in vivo. The regulated RNase activity was in a polysome-free fraction of the lysates and was not specific for TRH-R RNA. A truncated form of TRH-R RNA that was missing the entire 3'-untranslated region (TRHR-R5) was more stable than full-length TRH-R RNA (TRHR-WT). In contrast to TRHR-WT mRNA, TRHR-R5 mRNA and TRHR-D9 mRNA, which was missing the 143 nucleotides 5' of the poly(A) tail, were not down-regulated by TRH in stably transfected GH3 cells as their rates of degradation were not increased. These data show that TRH regulates RNase activity in GH3 cells, that the 3'-untranslated region bestows decreased stability on TRH-R mRNA and that the 3' end of the mRNA is necessary for regulation by TRH of TRH-R mRNA degradation. We present an hypothesis that explains specific regulation of TRH-R mRNA degradation by TRH in GH3 pituitary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1622041951,"The effects of calcium depletion on the proteolytic cleavage and secretion of plasma protein precursors were investigated in primary cultured rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. When the cells were incubated with A23187, the calcium-specific ionophore, in a medium lacking CaCl2, precursors of serum albumin and the third and fourth components of complement, C3 and C4, respectively, were found to be released into the medium. The addition of ionomycin or EGTA to the medium inhibited the processing of pro-C3 as well. Blocking the secretory pathway either at the mixed endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi in the presence of brefeldin A or at the endoplasmic reticulum/tubular-vesicular structure at a reduced temperature caused accumulation of pro-C3 within hepatocytes or HepG2 cells, indicating that the cleavage of the precursor occurs at a later stage of the secretory pathway. Once the blockade was released by incubating the cells either in the brefeldin A-free medium or at 37 degrees C, the secretion of plasma proteins resumed, irrespective of the presence of A23187. However, the processing of pro-C3 was almost completely inhibited in the presence of A23187, with only the precursor being released into the medium, implying that a decline in Ca2+ levels within the cell modulates the activity of a Golgi endoprotease responsible for the cleavage of pro-C3. When incubated with isolated Golgi membranes, pro-C3 secreted from Ca(2+)-depleted cells was cleaved in vitro into their subunits in the presence of Ca2+ but not in its absence, pointing to the involvement of a Ca(2+)-dependent Golgi endoprotease in the processing of pro-C3. These results collectively suggest that calcium depletion blocks the proteolytic cleavages of plasma protein precursors presumably by exhausting a Ca2+ pool available to the Ca(2+)-dependent processing enzyme(s) located at the Golgi and/or trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W1577794730,"Abstract (7S,8S)--Dihydroxy--7,8--dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene ((+)-BP-7,8-diol) is epoxidized to (7S,8R)-dihydroxy-(9S,10R)-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ((+)-syn-BPDE) by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and to (7S,8R)-dihydroxy-(9R,10S)-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ((-)-anti-BPDE) by peroxyl free radicals. 32P postlabeling analysis of the diastereomeric BPDE-DNA adducts was used to investigate the pathways of (+)-BP-7,8-diol oxidation in mouse skin in vivo. The pattern of deoxynucleoside 3',5'-bisphosphate adducts in epidermal scrapings from female CD-1 mice indicated that cytochrome P-450 was the major oxidant. Similar results were obtained when the tumor-promoting phorbol ester tetradecanoylphorbolacetate (TPA) was coadministered with (+)-BP-7,8-diol. However, when animals were pretreated with TPA 24 h before coadministration of TPA and (+)-BP-7,8-diol, the pattern of BPDE-DNA adducts indicated that peroxyl radicals made a major contribution to (+)-BP-7,8-diol epoxidation. Peroxyl radical-dependent epoxidation was maximal when the time between the two TPA administrations was 24-72 h. No increase in (-)-anti-BPDE-DNA was observed when the non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester 4-O-methyl-TPA was substituted for TPA. The calcium ionophore A23187 stimulated peroxyl radical generation when substituted for the first, but not the second, TPA treatment. The antiinflammatory steroid fluocinolone acetonide inhibited (-)-anti-BPDE-DNA adduct formation when coadministered with the first but not the second TPA treatment. These findings demonstrate the existence of two independent pathways of metabolic activation of (+)-BP-7,8-diol in mouse epidermis, one dependent on cytochrome P-450 and the other dependent on peroxyl free radicals. The results also suggest that repetitive topical administration of tumor-promoting phorbol esters remodels epidermal metabolism leading to a significant increase in free radical generation."

The induction of TRE- and SRE-mediated gene expression by v-Src could be distinguished by a differential sensitivity to depleting cells of protein kinase C (PKC) and to a dominant negative Raf-1 mutant. Thus, PKC depletion and the dominant negative Raf-1 mutant were able to distinguish two intracellular signaling mechanisms activated by v-Src. Both of these v-Src-induced intracellular signals were sensitive to a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras. These data suggest that Ha-Ras functions to coordinately regulate multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms activated by v-Src."
https://openalex.org/W1508311009,"Phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme activity in rod outer segment (ROS) membranes bleached in the presence of ATP and GTP was assayed using exogenously added [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate vesicles as substrate. The addition of the soluble ROS protein arrestin (also known as S-antigen or 48K protein) to ROS membranes activated PLC 2-3.4-fold. This activation was dose-dependent, and maximal activation was observed at an arrestin concentration of congruent to 110-220 nM. PLC activation by arrestin was dependent on ROS protein concentration and free Ca2+. Soluble PLC (s-PLC) enzyme activity present in hypotonic extracts of bleached ROS was also activated 2-4-fold by arrestin. Maximum activation of s-PLC by arrestin was observed at free Ca2+ of 80 nM. Arrestin activation of s-PLC was not affected by urea-treated and extensively washed ROS membranes, suggesting that rhodopsin was not required for the observed effect of arrestin on s-PLC. The results are indicative of a direct interaction of arrestin with s-PLC, resulting in the activation of the latter. Based on these results and the documented binding of arrestin to bleached and phosphorylated rhodopsin, a model for the light activation of PLC in ROS is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1538191341,"The MutT protein, which prevents AT—-CG transversions during DNA replication, hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphates to yield nucleoside monophosphates and pyrophosphate. The hydrolysis of dGTP by the MutT protein in H(2)18O-enriched water, when monitored by high resolution 31P NMR spectroscopy at 242.9 MHz, showed 18O labeling of the pyrophosphate product, as manifested by a 0.010 +/- 0.002 ppm upfield shift of the pyrophosphate resonance, and no labeling of the dGMP product. This establishes that the reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic substitution at the beta-phosphorus of dGTP with displacement of dGMP as the leaving group. No exchange of 32P-labeled dGMP into dGTP was detected, indicating that water attacks dGTP directly or, less likely, an irreversibly formed pyrophosphoryl-enzyme intermediate. No exchange of 32P-labeled pyrophosphate into dGTP was observed, consistent with nucleophilic substitution at the beta-phosphorus of dGTP. Only six enzymes, all synthetases, have previously been shown to catalyze nucleophilic substitution at the beta-phosphorus of nucleoside triphosphate substrates. The MutT protein is the first hydrolase shown to do so."
https://openalex.org/W1580194375,"Bovine brain 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was purified to homogeneity and characterized. This bifunctional enzyme is a homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of 120,000, which is twice that of all other known bifunctional enzyme isozymes. The kinase/bisphosphatase activity ratio was 3.0. The Km values for fructose 6-phosphate and ATP of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase were 27 and 55 microM, respectively. The Km for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the Ki for fructose 6-phosphate for the bisphosphatase were 70 and 20 microM, respectively. Physiologic concentrations of citrate had reciprocal effects on the enzyme's activities, i.e. inhibiting the kinase (Ki of 35 microM) and activating the bisphosphatase (Ka of 16 microM). Phosphorylation of the brain enzyme was catalyzed by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase with a stoichiometry of 0.9 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit and at a rate similar to that seen with the liver isozyme. In contrast to the liver isozyme, the kinetic properties of the brain enzyme were unaffected by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation, and also was not a substrate for protein kinase C. The brain isozyme formed a labeled phosphoenzyme intermediate and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against the liver isozyme. However, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of a peptide generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the enzyme had no identity with any known bifunctional enzyme sequences. These results indicate that a novel isozyme, which is related to other 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isozymes, is expressed specifically in neural tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1570514744,"In saponin-permeabilized mouse lacrimal acinar cells, glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (GPIP2) activated the release of sequestered Ca2+ to the same extent as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ((1,4,5)IP3) but with a potency about 1/10 that of (1,4,5)IP3. In lacrimal gland homogenates, [3H]GPIP2 was metabolized to two compounds which upon anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography eluted at positions indicating that they were [3H]GPIP and [3H]GPIP3. The rate of metabolism of [3H]GPIP2 was much slower than that of [3H](1,4,5)IP3, and its rate of phosphorylation was less than 1% of that of [3H] (1,4,5)IP3. In intact lacrimal cells, photolysis of a microinjected derivative of GPIP2, 1-(alpha-glycerophosphoryl)-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate P4(5)-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester, resulted in sustained activation of Ca2+ signaling; i.e. intracellular Ca2+ release followed by increased entry of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. These findings indicate that caged GPIP2 should provide a useful tool for producing photolytically initiated, sustained activation of intracellular (1,4,5)IP3 receptors. They also provide strong support for the idea that sustained Ca2+ signaling can be achieved in lacrimal acinar cells by activation of intracellular receptors for (1,4,5)IP3 in the absence of stimulated production of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1575434638,"The regulated expression of mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II (M6P/IGF II) receptors in plasma membranes has previously been shown to be accompanied by marked changes in the phosphorylation state of the receptors (Corvera, S., Folander, K., Clairmont, K. B., and Czech, M. P. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 7567-7571). In the present study we show that protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates the human M6P/IGF II receptor in vitro. Incubation of human fibroblasts with okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of this phosphatase, resulted in a depletion of M6P/IGF II receptors at the cell surface without affecting their internalization kinetics. The phosphorylation state of the remaining cell surface receptors was 3-fold increased. Thus, the endocytosis rate of M6P/IGF II receptors appears to be unaltered by increased phosphorylation. While the decreased cell surface expression of receptors was reversible upon removal of okadaic acid the IGF II-induced redistribution of M6P/IGF II receptors to the plasma membrane (Braulke, T., Tippmer, S., Neher, E., and von Figura, K. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 681-686) was irreversibly inhibited by the phosphatase inhibitor. Receptor redistribution in response to protein kinase C activation was not affected by okadaic acid. These results suggest that the cell surface expression of M6P/IGF II receptor can be regulated by phosphatase-dependent and -independent pathways. In addition, the phosphorylation state and the steady-state cell surface number of transferrin receptors were not affected by okadaic acid, whereas it impaired the IGF II-stimulated receptor redistribution similarly as for M6P/IGF II receptors. The data indicate that okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases may play a general role in terms of IGF II-modulated receptor recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1509553844,"Receptors for the hematopoietic growth factors erythropoietin, interleukin 3 (IL-3), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are members of a structurally related receptor superfamily. Interestingly, while none of these receptors encode tyrosine kinase activities, induced tyrosine phosphorylation has been observed in various responsive cells stimulated with each factor. Toward defining possible common transduction pathways which are activated by these three cytokines, we have studied induced protein phosphorylation in murine myeloid FDC-P1 cells stably transfected with an erythropoietin receptor cDNA (FDC-ER cells). FDC-ER cells proliferate in response to erythropoietin (Quelle, D. E., and Wojchowski, D. M. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 4801-4805), and presently are shown to rapidly phosphorylate a M(r) 100,000 cytosolic protein (pp100) at tyrosine residues in response to this factor. Phosphorylation of pp100 also is induced in FDC-P1 and FDC-ER cells in response to IL-3 or GM-CSF. Importantly, quantitative analyses showed identical concentration dependencies for factor-induced pp100 phosphorylation and induced cell proliferation. Moreover, a selective loss of proliferative responsiveness to GM-CSF in FDC-ER cells was associated with a reduced capacity of GM-CSF to induce pp100 phosphorylation. Finally, limited differences in tryptic phosphopeptide maps of pp100 as isolated following exposure to erythropoietin, IL-3, or GM-CSF were observed, suggesting that these factors also may preferentially induce phosphorylation of pp100 at distinct sites. These findings are consistent with a role for pp100 as a common cytosolic transducer in the apparently convergent pathways of erythropoietin-, IL-3-, and GM-CSF-induced proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells."

Midpseudopregnant rabbit luteal extracts were further evaluated to determine the identity of the lipid-stimulated kinase. Results of low pH-activated phosphorylation were consistent with the identification of p76 as an autophosphorylated member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Partial purification of the luteal lipid-stimulated kinase was performed using sequential DEAE-cellulose/hydroxylapatite chromatographies and using gel filtration. Western immunoblot with type-specific anti-PKC delta antiserum showed coelution of kinase p76 activity with immunoreactive PKC delta. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that luteal levels of PKC delta were increased by estrogen treatment."

Both FGF-R alpha and FGF-R beta isoforms exhibit qualitatively similar ligand-binding activities. In this report, we show by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of ligand-binding activity in transfected cells that substitution of a cysteine that potentially forms an intra-loop disulfide in either juxtamembrane Loop II or III disrupted maturation and formation of the ligand-binding site in both FGF-R alpha and FGF-R beta isoforms. Neither three loop FGF-R alpha constructions coding for intact Loops I and II adjacent to defective Loop III nor intact Loops I and III separated by defective Loop II exhibited ligand-binding activity. In addition, a two-loop molecule of tandem Loops I and III was inactive. The results suggest that single Loops I, II, or III of FGF-R are insufficient to form a ligand-binding site. Loop I does not form an independent ligand-binding site with either Loop II or III, but interacts with a common ligand-binding site formed by Loops II and III (Xu, J., Nakahara, M., Crabb, J.

The latter method approached a cross-linking efficiency of 1 NTP/molecule of enzyme. Nucleotide competition experiments suggested that the same binding site is occupied by all NTPs. Analysis of peptides produced by proteinase Glu-C and trypsin digestion and labeled with [32P]GTP indicated that a lysine residue between Met-189 and Lys-228 in the polymerase was cross-linked to NTP. Nucleotide binding was exploited for rapid purification of the enzyme by GTP-agarose affinity chromatography. In addition, a set of cloned, modified polymerase molecules with reduced or absent polymerization activity was analyzed for binding efficiency to a GTP-agarose column. Some mutations eliminated GTP binding, whereas others generated proteins with varying affinities for GTP. Incubation of the poliovirus polymerase with high concentrations of NTP, particularly GTP, resulted in a dramatic protection against heat denaturation and activity loss. These data suggest that nucleotide binding results in an alteration of the enzyme conformation or the stabilization of an ordered conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1485504631,"Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products."
https://openalex.org/W15094655,"The technique for the simultaneous recording of cell volume changes and pHi in single cells was used to study the role of HCO3- in regulatory volume decrease (RVD) by the osteosarcoma cells UMR-106-01. In the presence of HCO3-, steady state pHi is regulated by Na+/H+ exchange, Na+ (HCO3-)3 cotransport and Na(+)-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange. Following swelling in hypotonic medium, pHi was reduced from 7.16 +/- 0.02 to 6.48 +/- 0.02 within 3.4 +/- 0.28 min. During this period of time, the cells performed RVD until cell volume was decreased by 31 +/- 5% beyond that of control cells (RVD overshoot). Subsequently, while the cells were still in hypotonic medium, pHi slowly increased from 6.48 +/- 0.02 to 6.75 +/- 0.02. This increase in pHi coincided with an increase in cell volume back to normal (recovery from RVD overshoot or hypotonic regulatory volume increase (RVI)). The same profound changes in cell volume and pHi after cell swelling were observed in the complete absence of Cl- or Na+, providing HCO3- was present. On the other hand, depolarizing the cells by increasing external K+ or by inhibition of K+ channels with quinidine, Ba2+ or tetraethylammonium prevented the changes in pHi and RVD. These findings suggest that in the presence of HCO3-, RVD in UMR-106-01 cells is largely mediated by the conductive efflux of K+ and HCO3-. Removal of external Na+ but not Cl- prevented the hypotonic RVI that occurred after the overshoot in RVD. Amiloride had no effect, whereas pretreatment with 4,4‘-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid (DIDS) strongly inhibited hypotonic RVI. Thus, hypotonic RVI is mediated by a Na+(out)-dependent, Cl(-)-independent and DIDS-inhibitable mechanism, which is indicative of a Na+(HCO3-)3 cotransporter. This is the first evidence for the involvement of this transporter in cell volume regulation. The present results also stress the power of the new technique used in delineating complicated cell volume regulatory mechanisms in attached single cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514344537,"The silk gland of Bombyx mori is a terminally differentiated tissue in which DNA replication continues without cell or nuclear division during larval development. DNA polymerase-delta activity increases in the posterior and middle silk glands during the development period, reaching maximal levels in the middle of the fifth instar larvae. The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity by a series of column chromatographic and affinity purification steps. It is a multimer comprising of three heterogeneous subunits, M(r) 170,000, 70,000, and 42,000. An auxiliary protein from B. mori silk glands, analogous to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, enhances the processivity of the enzyme and stimulates catalytic activity by 3-fold. This auxiliary protein has also been purified to homogeneity. It is a dimer comprised of a single type M(r) 40,000 subunit. Polymerase-delta possesses an intrinsic 3'----5' exonuclease activity which participates in proofreading by mismatch repair during DNA synthesis and is devoid of any primase activity. DNA polymerase-delta activity could be further distinguished from polymerase-alpha from the same tissue based on its sensitivity to various inhibitors and polyclonal antibodies to the individual enzymes. Like DNA polymerase-alpha, polymerase-delta is also tightly associated with the nuclear matrix. The polymerase alpha-primase complex could be readily separated from polymerase-delta (exonuclease) in the purification protocol adopted. DNA polymerase-delta from B. mori silk glands resembles the mammalian delta-polymerases. Considering that both DNA polymerase-delta and -alpha are present in nearly equal amounts in this highly replicative tissue and their close association with the nuclear matrix, the involvement of both the enzymes in the chromosomal endoreplication process in B. mori is strongly implicated."
https://openalex.org/W1555878818,"Abstract The lytic-lysogenic switch in transposable, Mu-like bacteriophage D108 is governed by two divergent and slightly overlapping transcription units originating from the Pe and Pc promoters. DNase I footprinting and in vivo mutational analysis suggest that lysogeny is maintained by c-repressor occupancy of the O2 operator, which precludes RNA polymerase from binding to Pe. Lytic development is controlled by the Ner repressor, which binds to a site symmetrically situated between the converging promoters and, in the absence of other factors, prevents RNA polymerase from binding to either Pc or Pe. DNase I protection and potassium permanganate hypersensitivity in the presence of integration host factor (IHF), which binds and alters the DNA structure upstream of Pe, revealed that RNA polymerase was able to bind Pe irrespective of the Ner.DNA-bound complex, and partially unwind the Pe -10 region. Ner repression of Pe transcription in vitro was significantly more effective in the absence of IHF. Using a cloned D108 early region-lacZ fusion in IHF-deficient and -proficient backgrounds, we also demonstrate this host factor's affect on ner-repressed Pe in vivo, and generate a system for isolating mutants in the regulatory genes and sites controlling this genetic switch. D108 lytic growth is proposed to occur through IHF-mediated activation of the phage Ner-repressed early operon."
https://openalex.org/W1545847233,"We have obtained iron K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectra of the plant mitochondrial aconitase in its active state, in the presence (aconitase (+)) and absence (aconitase (-)) of the substrate citrate. Analysis of the data indicates that oxygens are present in the first coordination shell, at an average Fe-O distance of 1.96/1.98 A (aconitase (+)/aconitase(-)). Part of these oxygens is provided by the citrate, which binds at 1.99 A from the iron in aconitase (+). The second shell (sulfur) contribution is split and is consistent with Fe-S distances of 2.30/2.29 and 2.56/2.59 A, and the third shell (iron) is consistent with an Fe-Fe distance of 2.83/2.84 A. Both Fe-S and Fe-Fe distances are longer than similar distances found in most Fe-S centers. A strong scattering at approximately 5 A has been identified as originating from an iron atom which is near to, but not part of, the Fe-S cluster. These data indicate that active plant mitochondrial aconitase contains a novel type of iron center."
https://openalex.org/W1560115326,"DNA polymerase I (pol I) from Escherichia coli has three well-defined activities: DNA polymerase, 3'-5' exonuclease, and 5'-3' exonuclease. We have raised monoclonal antibodies to pol I which selectively neutralize each of these three activities, thus supporting the model of separate active sites for each activity, heretofore exclusively demonstrated with proteolytic fragments of pol I. Antibodies from each class could bind pol I in the presence of antibodies of another class, indicating the existence of significant spatial separation between each of the three sites. In addition, several of the neutralizing antibodies were able to distinguish particular activities of the 5'-3' exonuclease. One of them, for example, inhibited the RNase H activity but not the DNase activity. Two other antibodies could, in addition to inhibiting the polymerase and the 3'-5' exonuclease, either stimulate or inhibit the 5'-3' exonuclease depending upon the assay conditions, particularly the ionic strength."
