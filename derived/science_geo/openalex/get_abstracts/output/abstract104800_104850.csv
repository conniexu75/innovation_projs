Each of the conditions leading to inhibition of autophagic proteolysis was found to be associated with phosphorylation of a 31-kDa protein that we identified as ribosomal protein S6. A combination of leucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, which efficiently inhibits autophagic proteolysis, was particularly effective in stimulating S6 phosphorylation. The relationship between the percentage inhibition of proteolysis and the degree of S6 phosphorylation was linear. Thus, inhibition of autophagy and phosphorylation of S6 are under the control of the same signal transduction pathway. Stimulation of S6 phosphorylation by the presence of amino acids was due to activation of S6 kinase and not to inhibition of S6 phosphatase.The inhibition by amino acids of both autophagic proteolysis and autophagic sequestration of electro-injected cytosolic [14C]sucrose was partially prevented by rapamycin, a compound known to inhibit activation of p70 S6 kinase. In addition, rapamycin partially inhibited the rate of protein synthesis.We conclude that the fluxes through the autophagic and protein synthetic pathways are regulated in an opposite manner by the degree to which S6 is phosphorylated.

INTRODUCTIONDuring autophagy, part of the cytoplasm is surrounded by a membrane to form an autophagosome in which, upon fusion with a lysosome, degradation of macromolecular material occurs(1Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 2Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The origin of the autophagosomal membrane is the ribosome-free part of the rough endoplasmic reticulum(3Dunn W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 4Furuno K. Ishikawa T. Akasaki K. Lee S. Nishimura Y. Tsuji H. Himeno M. Kato K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 189: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). During starvation, autophagic degradation of protein is accelerated in order to produce amino acids for gluconeogenesis and other essential metabolic pathways. Regulation of autophagy has mostly been studied in the liver of rats and mice (cf. (1Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and (2Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In these animals, during the first 48 h of starvation, autophagic breakdown of protein in the liver is higher than in other tissues(1Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Autophagic flux is inhibited by amino acids(1Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 2Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Insulin (1Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R.

Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and cell swelling (5Meijer A.J. Gustafson L.A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. Caro L.H.P. van Woerkom G.M. Spronk C. Boon L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) promote inhibition by low concentrations of amino acids, whereas glucagon (1Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) reduces it. However, little is known about the mechanism by which these factors interact with the autophagic system except that they primarily affect the first step in the pathway, i.e. the formation of initial autophagosomes(1Mortimore G.E. Pösö A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 2Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that amino acids added alone or in combination with insulin, hypotonic cell swelling, or glucagon also affect phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. In the literature it is generally assumed that S6 phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis(6Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Evidence is now provided suggesting that S6 phosphorylation is also directly involved in the control of autophagic sequestration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of HepatocytesHepatocytes were isolated from 18-24 h starved male Wistar rats (200-250 g) as described by Groen et al.(8Groen A.K. Sips H.J. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Determination of Protein PhosphorylationFor measurement of protein phosphorylation, hepatocytes were incubated at 37°C for 50 min (9Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7091-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (unless otherwise indicated) in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium (2 ml; gas phase, O2/CO2 = 95:5) plus 20 mM glucose, 0.2 mM [P]phosphate (100 μCi), and the additions indicated in the legends to the figures. At the end of the incubations, cells were diluted 5-fold with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium and collected by centrifugation (2 min, 50 ×g). The cell pellets were extracted with 0.6 ml of sample buffer (10Jonsson L.M.V. Murray G.J. Sorrell S.H. Strijland A. Aerts J.M.F.G. Ginns E.I. Barranger J.A. Schram A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and brought to 90°C for 5 min; an amount equivalent to about 100 μg of protein was analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis. Gel slabs were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Protein phosphorylation was quantified with a PhosphorImager™ (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.).Measurement of ProteolysisProteolysis was measured as production of valine (11Leverve X.M. Caro L.H.P. Plomp P.J.A.M. Meijer A.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) after 90 min of incubation at 37°C in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium plus 20 mM glucose, 25 μM cycloheximide. and the additions or omissions indicated in the legends to the figures. Cycloheximide was present in order to prevent simultaneous protein synthesis. At this concentration, cycloheximide did not affect flux through the autophagic pathway(5Meijer A.J. Gustafson L.A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. Caro L.H.P. van Woerkom G.M. Spronk C. Boon L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Measurement of Protein SynthesisProtein synthesis was measured as incorporation of L-[3H]valine according to Meijer and Hensgens (12Hensgens H.E.S.J. Meijer A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 582: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Composition of the Complete Mixture of Amino AcidsThe concentration of each amino acid in this mixture was equal to either 1 (1 × amino acids) or 4 (4 × amino acids) times its concentration in the portal vein of a starved rat. The composition of the 1× mixture was as described in (13Meijer A.J. Lof C. Ramos I.C. Verhoeven A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of leucine was 250 μM. When proteolysis was measured, valine was omitted from the mixture because its production was used to monitor proteolytic rates.Determination of the Intracellular Localization of the Phosphorylated 31-kDa ProteinCells were collected by centrifugation (2 min, 50 ×g) and resuspended in 4 ml of an ice-cold medium containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mM NaF, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (medium A). After homogenization of the cells with a Dounce homogenizer, 1 ml of 1.25 M sucrose in medium A was added to bring the final concentration of sucrose to 250 mM. Cell ghosts were removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 1 s. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged (5 min, 1000 ×g) to obtain nuclei and plasma membranes. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged (10 min at 10,000 ×g) to obtain the mitochondrial/lysosomal fraction. One part of the postmitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged (150 min, 105,000 ×g) to obtain microsomes and cytosol. Another part of the postmitochondrial supernatant was treated with a mixture of 1% Triton X-100 and 1% deoxycholate, layered over 5 ml of 0.5 M sucrose in medium A, and centrifuged (150 min, 105,000 ×g) to obtain ribosomes. The various fractions were characterized by measurement of specific marker enzymes and of ribosomal RNA (not shown).Immune Precipitation of the Ribosomal 31-kDa ProteinRibosomes were suspended in medium A, supplemented with 1% SDS, and brought to 90°C (5 min). 60 μg of ribosomal protein (5 μl) was diluted 40-fold with a solution containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 1% Nonidet-P40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (medium B). 5 μl of either preimmune serum or antiserum was then added and allowed to interact with the ribosomal protein for 2 h at 0°C. 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (prewashed in medium B) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After this period, the Sepharose particles were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 1 s, washed 6 times with 1-ml portions of medium B followed by a washing step with 1 ml of a medium containing 20 mM Mops 1The abbreviation used is: Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.(pH 7.5), 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10 mM MgCl2. The final pellet was dissolved in sample buffer (10Jonsson L.M.V. Murray G.J. Sorrell S.H. Strijland A. Aerts J.M.F.G. Ginns E.I. Barranger J.A. Schram A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and brought to 90°C for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis. The gel slab was dried and subjected to autoradiography.Measurement of [14C]Sucrose SequestrationLoading of hepatocytes with [14C]sucrose and its autophagic sequestration was carried out with the electropermeabilization procedure as described by Seglen and Gordon (14Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Statistical DeterminationStatistical significance was determined using Student's t test (p≤ 0.05).Materials RapamycinRapamycin was a gift from Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Princeton, NJ. Rapamycin was dissolved in Me2SO. Control incubations received equal amounts of Me2SO (final concentration, 0.5% v/v), which did not affect the processes tested.[14C]Sucrose[14C]Sucrose (specific activity 630 μCi/μmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp.[3H]Valine[3H]valine was obtained from Amersham Corp.RESULTSIncubation of rat hepatocytes with [P]phosphate in the presence of a complete mixture of amino acids greatly enhanced the phosphorylation of a protein with a molecular mass of 31 kDa (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of this protein in the presence of amino acids was completed in 20-30 min (Fig. 1B).Cell fractionation showed that the protein was exclusively localized in the ribosomal fraction. Because the molecular mass of the protein was close to that of ribosomal protein S6, we suspected that it was identical to S6. Indeed, immune precipitation of the [P]phosphate-labeled protein with an antibody directed against the C-terminal part (Arg-Lys) of S6 confirmed this (data not shown). An additional argument that the 31-kDa protein was identical to S6 was provided by the observation that its phosphorylation was completely prevented by low concentrations of rapamycin (Fig. 2), which is an inhibitor of the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of p70 S6 kinase(15Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 16Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Inhibition by high concentrations of rapamycin was complete (Fig. 2) and almost instantaneous (within 1-2 min, not shown).Figure 2:Effect of rapamycin on the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in isolated rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes (5 mg of dry mass•ml), were incubated with [P]phosphate (100 μCi) in the presence of 4 × the complete mixture of amino acids. Rapamycin was added at the concentrations indicated at the top of the lanes. After 90 min of incubation, cells were collected and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In perfused rat liver, cell swelling mimicks the antiproteolytic effect of insulin(17vom Dahl S. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Incubation of isolated hepatocytes under hypo-osmotic conditions enhances the sensitivity of autophagic proteolysis to inhibition by amino acids(5Meijer A.J. Gustafson L.A. Luiken J.J.F.P.

Chem. 1987; 262: 16322-16327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (cf. Fig. 3, F and H). However, insulin and hypo-osmolarity have no effect on their own, i.e. in the absence of amino acids. Exactly the same phenomenon was observed with regard to the phosphorylation of S6. Both hypo-osmolarity and insulin increased phosphorylation of S6 at low, but not at high, concentrations of amino acids while having no effect in the absence of amino acids (Fig. 3, B and D).Figure 3:Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and inhibition of proteolysis. Hepatocytes (5 mg of dry mass•ml) were incubated and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Hypo-osmolarity was obtained by decreasing the NaCl concentration of the incubation medium from 120 mM (A, B, E, and F) to 70 mM (C, D, G, and H). The concentrations were as follows: leucine (L), 1000 μM; phenylalanine (F), 200 μM; tyrosine (Y), 300 μM. These concentrations are identical to the concentrations of these amino acids in a 4 × complete mixture of amino acids. Other concentrations were as follows: insulin (INS), 10M; glucagon (GLCN), 10M; 3-methyladenine (3MA), 10 mM. All indicates a complete 4× mixture of amino acids. In B, D, F and H: hatchedbars, no amino acids added; whitebars, a complete 1× amino acid mixture added; blackbars, a complete 4× amino acid mixture added. In I, ○ indicates iso-osmotic conditions, and indicates hypo-osmotic conditions. The degree of S6 phosphorylation under all conditions was related to that observed in the absence of added amino acids under iso-osmotic conditions. Phosphorylation was measured after 50 min of incubation (A-D). Proteolysis was measured after 90 min of incubation (E-H). The basal rate of proteolysis under iso-osmotic conditions, in the absence of added amino acids (0% inhibition), was equal to 16.6 ± 0.9 μmol valine produced per g of dry mass of cells/90 min. In the absence of cycloheximide (-CH), production of valine does not indicate the true proteolytic rate because of simultaneous protein synthesis; for this reason, valine production data were not plotted under these conditions (F and H). Data are the means (±S.E.) from experiments carried out with 3-5 different hepatocyte preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to insulin and cell swelling, glucagon decreases the sensitivity of autophagic proteolysis to inhibition by amino acids ((20Schworer C.M. Mortimore G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3169-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); Fig. 3F). Likewise, in the presence of low, but not of high, concentrations of amino acids, phosphorylation of S6 was decreased by glucagon (Fig. 3B). In the absence of added amino acids, little effect of glucagon was noted, either on the phosphorylation of S6 (cf. (9Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7091-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or on autophagic proteolysis.From our previous results with cultured hepatocytes isolated from perinatal rats, we concluded that among the 20 amino acids, a combination of 3 amino acids, i.e. leucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, is particularly effective in inhibiting autophagic proteolysis(21Blommaart P.J.E. Zonneveld D. Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This specificity also applied to the phosphorylation of S6 in hepatocytes isolated from adult rats (Fig. 3, A, C, E, and G); especially under hypo-osmotic conditions, the phosphorylation of S6 in the presence of a complete mixture of amino acids could (like the inhibition of proteolysis) largely be mimicked by the combination of these 3 amino acids or by the combination of leucine with either phenylalanine or tyrosine. Even leucine alone had some effect (Fig. 3, C and G).Fig. 3I shows the relationship between the phosphorylation of S6 and the percentage inhibition of autophagic proteolysis under the conditions discussed. A striking linear relationship between the two parameters was observed.Because cycloheximide was included in our measurements of proteolytic rates (cf. (5Meijer A.J. Gustafson L.A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. Caro L.H.P. van Woerkom G.M. Spronk C. Boon L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we tested whether or not deletion of this compound from the incubations had any effect on S6 phosphorylation. At 25 μM, a concentration sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis by more than 95% and with no effect on the rate of proteolysis(5Meijer A.J. Gustafson L.A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. Caro L.H.P. van Woerkom G.M. Spronk C. Boon L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), cycloheximide did not affect phosphorylation of S6, neither in the absence nor in the presence of amino acids (Fig. 3, B and D).3-Methyladenine, often used as a specific inhibitor of autophagic sequestration(2Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), strongly inhibited proteolysis but had no effect on the phosphorylation of S6 (Fig. 3, A, C, E, G, and I). Apparently, the mechanism by which this compound inhibits autophagy is unrelated to that caused by amino acids. This result also rules out the possibility that increased phosphorylation of S6 by amino acids was the consequence of the antiproteolytic effect of amino acids.Because the linear relationship between S6 phosphorylation and the inhibition of autophagic proteolysis demonstrated that these two processes are controlled by the same regulatory factors, the question arose whether S6 phosphorylation was directly involved in the control of autophagic proteolysis. Rapamycin, which inhibits S6 phosphorylation (cf. Fig. 2), could provide an answer to this question. Fig. 4 shows that rapamycin stimulated proteolysis especially in the presence of a complete mixture of amino acids. However, the inhibitory effect of amino acids was only partially relieved by rapamycin. The stimulation of proteolysis by rapamycin was prevented by 3-methyladenine (not shown), indicating that autophagic proteolysis is involved in this stimulation. Direct measurement of autophagic sequestration by sequestration of cytosolic [14C]sucrose confirmed that rapamycin stimulates the autophagic process (Fig. 5).Figure 4:Effect of rapamycin on autophagic proteolysis. Hepatocytes (5-10 mg of dry mass•ml) were incubated in the absence or presence of the complete mixture of amino acids and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Hypo-osmolarity was obtained by decreasing the NaCl concentration of the incubation medium from 120 mM to 70 mM. Whitebars, rapamycin absent; blackbars, rapamycin (100 nM) added. Proteolysis was measured after 90 min of incubation. The basal rate of proteolysis under iso-osmotic conditions, in the absence of added amino acids (0% inhibition), was equal to 16.6 ± 0.9 μmol valine produced per g of dry mass of cells/90 min.

Gordon P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). [14C]Sucrose, normally impermeant and inert to hepatocytes, was injected into the cytosol by electropermeabilization. Preloaded cells were then incubated, and [14C]sucrose was taken up by the autophagic system. About 50% of the radioactivity was taken up by the mitochondria (not shown) and was resistant to inhibition by amino acids, in agreement with the data of Seglen and Gordon(14Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The amount of [14C]sucrose sequestered in the lysosomal fraction in a certain period of time, is a measure of the rate of autophagic sequestration. As shown in Fig. 5, amino acids strongly inhibited autophagic sequestration. The effect of amino acids was comparable with the effect of 3-methyladenine (cf. (14Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Rapamycin partially reversed inhibition of autophagic sequestration by amino acids. Addition of methylamine, a lysosomotropic agent, did not affect the rate of autophagic sequestration (Fig. 5) but strongly inhibited proteolysis (not shown).In order to gain insight into the underlying mechanism by which amino acids increase the phosphorylation state of S6, i.e. either by activation of S6 kinase, by inhibition of S6 phosphatase, or by a combination of both, the following experiment was performed. Hepatocytes were prelabeled with [P]phosphate in the presence of high concentrations of amino acids. These preloaded cells were then further incubated with rapamycin (to block S6 kinase) in the absence or presence of amino acids, and the phosphorylation state of S6 was followed in time. In the presence of rapamycin, S6 became rapidly dephosphorylated to its basal level in 20-30 min (Fig. 6). The rate of dephosphorylation was not significantly affected by the presence of amino acids or by hypo-osmolarity. Thus, the stimulation of S6 phosphorylation by amino acids and hypo-osmolarity must have been due to stimulation of p70 S6 kinase rather than to inhibition of S6 phosphatase.Figure 6:Amino acids do not affect S6 dephosphorylation. Hepatocytes were incubated under iso-osmotic conditions with [P]phosphate (100 μCi•ml) for 50 min in the presence of 4 times the complete mixture of amino acids. After this period, cells were washed (time zero in the graph) and re-incubated under iso-osmotic (A) or hypo-osmotic (B) conditions in the absence (□, ) or presence of 4 times the complete mixture of amino acids (▿, ), and both in the absence (opensymbols) or presence (filledsymbols) of rapamycin (100 nM). Phosphorylation of S6 was measured at the time points indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the literature, it is generally assumed that S6 phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis(6Morley S.J.

Measurement of protein synthesis in our experimental system revealed that under some conditions there may be a correlation between the rate of protein synthesis and S6 phosphorylation but that this does not apply to all conditions. As shown in Table 1, under iso-osmotic conditions with increasing amino acid concentrations, there was indeed a correlation between S6 phosphorylation and protein synthesis. However, under hypo-osmotic conditions in the absence of amino acids, when phosphorylation of S6 was unchanged, protein synthesis was higher than under iso-osmotic conditions (Table 1; cf. (5Meijer A.J. Gustafson L.A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. Caro L.H.P. van Woerkom G.M. Spronk C. Boon L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

Because serum contains amino acids and because effects of growth factors and insulin have not been reported in the absence of amino acids, it is likely that phosphorylation of S6 was mediated, either directly or indirectly, by amino acids.Phosphorylation of S6 occurs at several serine residues; 1 or 2 of these are phosphorylated by protein kinase A (which are probably not involved in the control of protein synthesis(26Palen E.

https://openalex.org/W1969637387,"We have previously shown that alkaline treatment of NADP generates a derivative which can mobilize Ca from sea urchin egg homogenates (Clapper, D. L., Walseth, T. F., Dargie, P. J., and Lee, H. C.(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9561-9568). In this study, the active derivative was purified and shown by high pressure liquid chromatography to be distinct from NADP and NADPH. However, its proton NMR spectrum was virtually identical to that of NADP. The mass of its molecular ion was measured by high resolution mass spectrometry to be 743.0510, one mass unit larger than the corresponding ion of NADP. These results are consistent with the active derivative being nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). Ca release induced by NAADP was saturable with a half-maximal concentration of about 30 nM. The release was specific since NADP and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide were ineffective even at 10-40-fold higher concentrations. The NAADP-dependent Ca release showed desensitization and was insensitive to heparin and a specific antagonist of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), 8-amino-cADPR. The release mechanism did not require calmodulin. This is similar to the inositol trisphosphate-sensitive release but distinct from that of cADPR. That the NAADP-sensitive Ca stores were different from those sensitive to inositol trisphosphate- or cADPR was further indicated by their differences in distribution on Percoll density gradients. Microinjection of NAADP into live sea urchin eggs induced transient elevation of intracellular Ca and triggered the cortical reaction, indicating the NAADP-dependent mechanism is operative in intact cells.

https://openalex.org/W1531318383,"Exposure to various forms of mild oxidative stress significantly increased the intracellular degradation of both “short-lived” and “long-lived,” metabolically radiolabeled, cell proteins in cultures of Clone 9 liver cells (normal liver epithelia). The oxidative stresses employed were bolus H2O2 addition; continuous H2O2 flux; the redox cycling quinones, menadione and paraquat; and the aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal, malonyldialdehyde, and hexenal. In general, exposure to more severe oxidative stress produced a concentration-dependent decline in intracellular proteolysis, in some cases to below baseline levels. Oxidatively modified “foreign” proteins (superoxide dismutase and hemoglobin) were also selectively degraded, in comparison with untreated foreign proteins, when added to lysates of Clone 9 liver cells. As with intracellular proteolysis, the degradation of foreign proteins added to cell lysates was greatly increased by mild oxidative modification, but depressed by more severe oxidative modification. The proteinase activity was recovered in >300-kDa cell fractions, and inhibitor profiles and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the multicatalytic proteinase complex, proteasome, was responsible for most of the selective degradation observed with mild oxidative stress; up to approximately 95% for intracellular proteolysis and 65-80% for degradation of foreign modified proteins. Seven days of daily treatment with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, directed against the initiation codon region of the proteasome C2 subunit gene, severely depressed the intracellular levels of several proteasome subunit polypeptides (by Western blot analysis), and also depressed the H2O2 induced increase in intracellular proteolysis by approximately 95%, without significantly affecting baseline proteolytic rates. Extensive studies revealed only small or no increases in the overall capacity of oxidatively stressed cells to degrade oxidatively modified protein substrates; a finding supported by both Western blot and Northern blot analyses which revealed no significant increase in the levels of proteasome subunit polypeptides or mRNA transcripts. We conclude that mild oxidative stress increases intracellular proteolysis by modifying cellular proteins, thus increasing their proteolytic susceptibility. In contrast, severe oxidative stress diminishes intracellular proteolysis, probably by generating severely damaged cell proteins that cannot be easily degraded (e.g. cross-linked/aggregated proteins), and by damaging proteolytic enzymes. We further conclude that the multicatalytic proteinase complex proteasome is responsible for most of the recognition and selective degradation of oxidatively modified proteins in Clone 9 liver cells.

We undertook the present investigation with two major goals: first, to test the hypothesis that low-level oxidative stress can result in increased intracellular proteolysis, in dividing mammalian cells: and second, to test the possible involvement/importance of proteasome in this process. Since liver cells are continuously exposed to oxidative stress through the metabolism of numerous endogenous and exogenous toxicants, at least two reports have suggested the degradation of oxidatively modified proteins by proteasome in primary cultures of hepatocytes(31Rivett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 300-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rivett A.J. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1989; 268: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 36Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), we selected an immortalized liver cell culture line for our studies. Clone 9 liver cells (normal rat liver epithelia) were obtained from American Tissue and Cell Culture (ATCC CRL 1439). The cells were cultured in 90% Ham's F-12K medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were initially plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2, grown for 3 days, and then replated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 for a further 2 days of growth before oxidative stress studies. Proteolysis studies involved either the degradation of metabolically radiolabeled cellular proteins, or the degradation of radiolabeled “foreign” proteins or peptides during incubation with (non-labeled) cell lysates. Metabolic radiolabeling of intracellular proteins was achieved during either a 2-h labeling procedure or a 16-h labeling procedure (followed by a 2-h “cold chase”). Cell proteins were metabolically radiolabeled by incorporation of a [S]methionine/cysteine mixture (14Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) using subconfluent monolayers of cells in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential Eagle's medium. After 2 or 16 h of exposure the labeling mixture was removed and the cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing excess unlabeled methionine/cysteine (as a “chase”). The 2-h labeling procedure was considered to generate mostly “short-lived” radiolabeled proteins, whereas the 16-h labeling procedure was considered to generate predominantly “long-lived” radiolabeled cell proteins. The degradation of metabolically labeled cell proteins was assessed by release of acid-soluble counts from, previously acid-precipitable, cell proteins. The degradation of radiolabeled foreign proteins, and of foreign peptides was assessed following addition of these substrates to unlabeled cell lysates. Cells were lysed by a 1-h incubation in water, supplemented with 1.0 mM dithiothreitol. Membrane debris, nuclei, organelles, and unlysed cells were then removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g. Subconfluent monolayers of cells (3 × 105 cells/cm2) were exposed to bolus additions of H2O2, paraquat (methylviologen), menadione (vitamin K3), hexenal, malonyldialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, or to continuous H2O2 production by the enzyme glucose oxidase. Exposures were conducted for 30 min at 37°C, in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). After exposure to oxidative stress, cells were washed twice and then incubated in tissue culture medium (90% Ham's F-12K medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) for proteolysis measurements. The cumulative degradation of short-lived proteins (those labeled during a 2-h [S]Met/Cys incorporation) was strongly affected by exposure of Clone 9 liver cells to H2O2 (Fig. 1). Proteolysis gradually increased with H2O2 concentrations from 20 μM to 0.4 mM, by as much as 150% (Fig. 1A). At the high H2O2 concentration of 1.0 mM, however, protein degradation actually decreased by as much as 50% (Fig. 1A). Optimal H2O2 concentrations for increased proteolysis after 6-24 h incubation ranged from 0.25 to 0.4 mM. At these same concentrations, however, a decrease in proteolysis actually appeared to occur in the first hour of incubation after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1A). To further investigate this phenomenon we next measured actual rates of protein degradation for 7 h after H2O2 treatment. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of cells with 0.4 mM H2O2 caused a transient depression of proteolytic rates in the first hour after exposure, but thereafter proteolysis was significantly increased over basal rates. Since H2O2 exposures in vivo are more likely to involve sources of continuous H2O2 production, rather than a bolus addition, we also tested the effects of continuous H2O2 production by the enzyme glucose oxidase. As shown in Fig. 1C, continuous exposure to H2O2 production, over a 30-min glucose oxidase treatment, caused a generalized increase in subsequent proteolysis at all H2O2 exposure rates tested. Proteolysis began to increase at 50 nm"

The deduced protein sequence was 88% homologous to that of hNUC I, isolated from human osteosarcoma cells. FAAR mRNA was abundant in adipose tissue, intestine, brain, heart, and skeletal muscles and less abundant in kidney, liver, testis, and spleen. The mRNA was undetectable in growing Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, was strongly induced early during differentiation, and was increased by fatty acid. Transcription assays using hybrid receptor showed strong stimulation by fatty acid and weaker induction by fibrates. Transfection of 3T3-C2 fibroblasts, with a FAAR expression vector, conferred fatty acid inducibility of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein and the fatty acid transporter. Transcriptional induction of these genes exhibited inducer specificity identical to that described in preadipocytes.

Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To elucidate the relation of structure and function of the DnaK system we analyzed in detail the quaternary structures of DnaK, GrpE, and DnaK-GrpE complexes with a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods. The hydrodynamic parameters determined in the present study offer new insight into the quaternary structures of these proteins and the role of DnaK-GrpE interactions in the functional cycle of the DnaK chaperone system. DnaK and GrpE were overproduced in E. coli cells (strain W3110) carrying pDS56/RBSII (dnaK) or pDS56/RBSII (grpE) upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-induction of expression of the plasmid-encoded chaperone genes(11Caspers P. Stieger M. Burn P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 635-644PubMed Google Scholar). The chaperones were purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (only GrpE), DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, ATP-agarose chromatography (only DnaK), hydroxylapatite chromatography, and Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration according to published procedures (7Zylicz M.

The DnaK and GrpE preparations are homogeneous as determined by amino acid analysis, mass spectroscopy and N-terminal sequencing and more than 98% pure as determined by densitometric analysis of the proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE 3The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisQLSquasi-elastic light scattering.(Fig. 1A). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis quasi-elastic light scattering. The 44-kDa ATPase fragment of DnaK (DnaK1-385) was overproduced in E. coli cells (strain MC4100) carrying pUHE21-2fdΔ12 (dnaK1-385) (13Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B.

Reinstein and will be described elsewhere. 4J. Reinstein et al., manuscript in preparation. Protein concentrations were determined by colorimetric assays (BCA protein assay; Pierce) and calibrated by amino acid analysis. Purified DnaK and GrpE were fully active by several criteria, including chaperone-mediated refolding of firefly luciferase (DnaK and GrpE), ATPase activity (DnaK and DnaK1-385), and substrate binding (DnaK)(6Schröder H.

In standard gel filtration experiments, aliquots of 50 μl of protein samples were loaded onto a Superose 12 column (1 × 30 cm; Pharmacia LKB) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl at room temperature and were chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For experiments with nucleotide-free DnaK or with peptide C, a Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm; Pharmacia LKB) equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol was used. Fast gel filtration was performed at 1 ml/min where indicated. Elution profiles where detected at 278 nm. Gel filtration standards were from Bio-Rad. Samples were filtered through 0.2-μm pore-sized Nucleopore membranes (Nucleopore, Cambridge, MA) into the cylindrical measuring cell placed in a temperature-controlled toluene bath (20°C) and examined with the ALV-3000 laser-scattering system (ALV, Langen, Federal Republic of Germany). Correlation functions were recorded at a scattering angle of 90° and analyzed with the program CONTIN(14Provencher S. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). When the distribution of diffusion coefficients was unimodal and narrow, the mean value (quoted in Table 1) was calculated as the second moment of the distribution. When it was unimodal and broad, the first and third moment was taken to indicate the range of compatible values of the diffusion coefficient. When more than one peak was present, each peak was quantified by its second moment. The diffusion coefficient D is related to the hydrodynamic radius R by the Stokes-Einstein relation,D=kT/(6πηR)(Eq. 1) where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and the viscosity of the solvent ( = 1.017 mPa s at 20°C). For a globular protein of mass M the radius R can be estimated from the following equation,4πR3/3=mv¯h/Nav(Eq. 2) where v is the partial specific volume (v = 0.735 cm/g), h the hydration of typical proteins (h = 1.3), and NAvogadro's number.Table 1 Open table in a new tab Measurements were made with the analytical ultracentrifuge Optima XL-A (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Sedimentation velocity runs were carried out at 40,000 rpm and 20°C using a 12-mm double sector cell. Samples (about 350 μl) were analyzed at 1 mg/ml (DnaK), 0.6 mg/ml (GrpE), and 1.6 mg/ml (DnaK-GrpE mixture), respectively. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were done at 7,000 rpm and 20°C with sample volumes of about 100 μl. Equilibrium profiles recorded at 280 nm were analyzed as published (15Schuck P. Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1994; 94: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). From the observed diffusion coefficients D obtained in light scattering and the sedimentation velocities s the mole masses were calculated using the following Svedberg equation,M=s/D×RT/(1−ν¯ρ)(Eq. 3) where R is the gas constant and the density of the buffer ( = 0.999 g/cm3). Denaturing SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed under reducing conditions using precast gels (16% Tris-glycine gel; Novex, San Diego, CA) running at 150 V for 1.5 h. Gels were stained with Serva Blue R (Serva, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany). Protein standards were from Novex (Mark 12). Quantification of stained bands was performed using a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nondenaturing PAGE (8% acrylamide) was performed as described(10Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the relative amounts of GrpE, DnaK, and GrpE-DnaK complexes were determined using a Hirschmann Elscript 400 scanner. The quaternary structures of GrpE, DnaK, and DnaK-GrpE complexes were analyzed by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation. In gel filtration experiments, GrpE eluted as a single symmetrical peak after injection into a Superose 12 column (Fig. 1B). The elution volume of the peak maximum corresponds to an apparent mole mass of 190 kDa, relative to globular reference proteins. When GrpE was analyzed by gel filtration in the presence of 1 M NaCl, the position of the eluted peak was not significantly changed relative to reference proteins (not shown). In quasi-elastic light scattering (QLS) experiments, the correlation functions obtained indicate a slightly broader size distribution of GrpE than expected for a strictly monodisperse sample of globular protein. When the data were fitted to a single exponential, diffusion coefficients of 4.8-5.6 × 10 cm2 s were obtained for different preparations of GrpE at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml (Table 1). Sedimentation velocity centrifugation of GrpE at the concentration used for QLS experiments yielded a single band with a velocity s of 2.7 S (Table 1). Knowledge of the s value as well as the diffusion coefficient determined by QLS permitted usage of the Svedberg equation to calculate a mole mass for GrpE of 44-51 kDa. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation of GrpE at the same concentration yielded mole masses for GrpE of 38.0 and 40.2 kDa (Table 1). When subjected to Superose 12 gel filtration, DnaK eluted with three different maxima: I, II, and III (Fig. 1B). Their positions corresponded to apparent mole masses of >2000, 440 and 130 kDa, respectively, relative to globular reference proteins. The relative areas of the different peaks did not vary significantly between different DnaK preparations, but they depended on storage time at 4°C after thawing, incubation temperature of the sample prior to injection into the column, DnaK concentration, and salt concentration. Peaks I and II increased and peak III decreased with storage time at 4°C. With respect to the DnaK concentration, at 0.5 mg/ml, peak I was very small, being close to the detection limit, and peak III was the main peak (Fig. 2). By increasing the DnaK concentration up to 16 mg/ml, material in peak III became increasingly shifted to peaks I and II. With respect to the salt concentration, we observed that in the presence of 1 M NaCl there was no material detected corresponding to peak I found at a low salt concentration and the relative positions of peaks II and III were significantly shifted to higher elution volumes, indicating lower hydrodynamic radii of the molecules (elution volumes at 1 M NaCl were corrected for gel shrinking effects by a calibration in the presence of 1 M NaCl). It is likely that the different forms of DnaK are in equilibrium with each other. To test this possibility, we fractionated the eluate of a gel filtration run with DnaK injected into the Superose 12 column at a concentration of 16 mg/ml. The DnaK concentrations in fractions containing the peak maxima were estimated to be more than 100-fold lower (<0.1 mg/ml) than in the injected sample. After equilibration for about 3 h at room temperature, fractions containing the maxima of peaks I, II, and III were injected into the column. The elution profiles showed mainly a single peak at the position of the original peak III (Fig. 3). Analysis of peak I showed an additional minor peak at the position of former peak II. This additional peak was not observed when the material was equilibrated overnight before analysis (data not shown). In QLS analysis, DnaK at a concentration of 1 mg/ml showed a broad size distribution yielding diffusion coefficients from 3.4 to 4.3 × 10 cm2 s. In sedimentation velocity centrifugation, DnaK yielded two bands of 4.0 and 6.3 S (Table 1). When these two sedimentation velocities were combined with the upper and lower limits of the diffusion coefficients observed in QLS, mole masses of 85 and 165 kDa were calculated using the Svedberg equation. The DnaK profile observed in equilibrium centrifugation did not fit with a single exponential. When fitted with two exponentials, mole masses of 67 and 180 kDa were obtained with optical density contributions of 75 and 25%, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the data fitted well with a model assuming coexistence of monomers, dimers and trimers with weight percentages of 75, 12, and 14%, respectively. To investigate DnaK-GrpE complex formation by gel filtration, DnaK and GrpE were mixed at 1:0.5 to 1:4 molar ratios, equilibrated overnight, and then injected into a Superose 12 column. The corresponding elution profiles (Fig. 4) show that the individual DnaK (e.g.K(I), K(III)) and GrpE (E) peaks diminished in size when going from DnaK:GrpE ratios of 1:0.5 to 1:1 and a new peak (C) appeared. Peak C was positioned between the DnaK peak K(II) and the GrpE peak at an apparent mass of 290 kDa. At the DnaK:GrpE ratio of 1:2, virtually all loaded protein eluted in peak C. When the DnaK:GrpE ratio was further decreased, peak C became progressively asymmetric. At a 1:3 ratio a shoulder was observed at the GrpE position which was even more prominent at a 1:4 ratio. Gel filtration of DnaK and GrpE incubated at 1:2 ratio in the presence of 1 M NaCl also yielded one symmetric peak which, however, was significantly shifted to higher elution volumes compared with the peak C obtained at low salt conditions (not shown). For QLS and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses, DnaK and GrpE were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:2 (1.0 mg/ml DnaK and 0.63 mg/ml GrpE) and equilibrated overnight prior to the analyses. In QLS, the size distribution of the mixture was more narrow than that of DnaK alone and yielded a diffusion coefficient of 3.7 × 10 cm2 s (Table 1). In sedimentation velocity centrifugation, the proteins exhibited a single migrating band with 4.8 S. Using the Svedberg equation we calculated a mole mass of the DnaK-GrpE complex of 117 kDa. In sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, the equilibrium profile of the complex was fitted to a single exponential, corresponding to a mole mass of 116 kDa (121 kDa, respectively, for an independent second experiment). In order to investigate the time course of DnaK-GrpE complex formation, DnaK and GrpE were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:2 (1.0 mg/ml DnaK and 0.63 mg/ml GrpE), incubated at 20°C, and injected at different time points into a Superose 12 column. To reduce the time required for gel filtration analysis, the column was operated at a higher flow rate of 1 ml/min, resulting in complete elution of DnaK after 12 min. The elution profiles of the DnaK/GrpE mixture after 1, 16, and 46 min and 15 h of preincubation were determined and are shown in Fig. 5. The individual DnaK and GrpE peaks gradually disappeared with increasing incubation time and peak C of the DnaK-GrpE complex increased at the 290-kDa position (relative to globular reference proteins). More than 1 h of incubation time was required to complete the complex formation. DnaK in the absence of GrpE did not alter its elution profile within the time course of the experiment (data not shown). Interestingly, although the oligomeric forms of DnaK (peaks I and II) were slowly converted by GrpE to DnaK-GrpE complexes, they had a limited capability of binding GrpE, as revealed by the following experiment. DnaK and GrpE were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:2 but, in order to increase the fraction of oligomeric DnaK, on ice and at higher concentrations (9.2 mg/ml DnaK and 5.8 mg/ml GrpE). After 1 min the mixture was injected into a Superose 12 column operated at high flow rate (1 ml/min), and the eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained GrpE and DnaK bands were quantified by densitometry, and their ratios were plotted against fraction numbers. GrpE was also detected in fractions containing oligomeric DnaK (Fig. 6A). The molar ratio DnaK/GrpE decreased with increasing fraction numbers proportional to elution volumes and approximated the value 1:2 in the region of peak C (Fig. 6B). GrpE has been reported to interact stable with a 44-kDa amino-terminal fragment of DnaK (DnaK1-385) comprising the ATPase domain(10Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this interaction was similar to the interaction of GrpE with DnaK, we determined the stoichiometry of this complex. DnaK or DnaK1-385 was incubated with different molar ratios of GrpE and complex formation was analyzed by non denaturing PAGE which allowed the differentiation of complexes of GrpE with DnaK or DnaK1-385 from free DnaK and GrpE(10Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All GrpE was complexed with DnaK (Fig. 7, upper) or DnaK1-385 (Fig. 7, lower) when present at an up to 2-fold molar excess over DnaK. Further increases in GrpE concentrations relative to DnaK did not increase the amount of GrpE-DnaK•DnaK1-385 complexes and yielded free GrpE. The behavior of DnaK and DnaK1-385 were indistinguishable with regard to complex formation. Although it is known that GrpE-DnaK complexes are dissociated by ATP(8Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether GrpE binding to DnaK requires the presence of nucleotides bound to DnaK. Furthermore, it is unknown whether GrpE-DnaK complex formation is affected by the presence of DnaK substrates. Both questions are relevant to understanding the role of GrpE in the functional cycle of the DnaK chaperone system. Using gel filtration we evaluated the ability of GrpE to form complexes with DnaK that was free of bound nucleotides. Nucleotide-free DnaK and GrpE were incubated for 30 min at 30°C at a molar ratio of 1:2 and then subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration. The loaded proteins eluted from the column as a single symmetrical peak corresponding to peak C in Fig. 4, produced by complexes of GrpE with nucleotide-containing DnaK purified by the standard procedure (chromatogram not shown). Incubation of the samples at 30°C instead of the standard 20°C used in the experiments shown in Fig. 5 increased the speed and degree of deoligomerization of DnaK. 5J. McCarty, B. Bukau, and H.-J. Schönfeld, unpublished data. The effects of the presence of DnaK substrates on GrpE binding were tested by pre incubating DnaK with saturating amounts of the well characterized DnaK/Hsp70 substrate peptide C of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein(17Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This 13 -mer peptide binds to DnaK with a Kd of 2.6 μM(13Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GrpE was added at a 2-fold molar excess with respect to DnaK. After incubation of the samples for 30 min at 30°C, they were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in 20 μM peptide C containing running buffer. The obtained chromatogram was not different compared with that obtained from an experiment omitting peptide C during the preincubation of DnaK and in the running buffer, indicating that GrpE-DnaK complexes formed with the same efficiency and characteristics in the presence as in the absence of peptide substrate (chromatograms not shown). Biochemical and biophysical analyses of the quaternary structures of GrpE and DnaK identified GrpE as a dimer and DnaK as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and higher oligomers which are in a slow equilibrium. DnaK oligomers were dissociated in the presence of GrpE. Furthermore, DnaK-GrpE complexes were shown to consist of one molecule DnaK and two molecules GrpE and to be formed independently of the presence of peptide substrates or DnaK-bound nucleotides. These results provide novel insight into the structural and functional relationships of this chaperone system. Determination of the quaternary structure of GrpE was complicated by its nonglobular shape. GrpE migrates in SDS-PAGE significantly slower than expected for a monomer with the mole mass of 22 kDa and elutes in gel filtration at an apparent mole mass of 190 kDa, suggesting octameric conformation in solution. However, mass determination by gel filtration is problematic, since the shape of the analyzed molecule and its interaction with the column support influence its elution behavior(18Schönfeld H.J. Pöschl B. Frey J.R. Loetscher H. Hunziker W. Lustig A. Zulauf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the mole mass of GrpE; this method allows determination of mole masses without using reference proteins for calibration. The sedimentation coefficient determined by ultracentrifugation together with the diffusion coefficient determined using QLS indicated a mass for GrpE of 44-51 kDa, suggesting a dimeric state in solution. This result was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation of GrpE, resulting in mole masses of 38.0 and 40.2 kDa, which are only slightly lower than the 43.6 kDa expected for a GrpE dimer (referred to as GrpE2). The latter methodology does not involve hydrodynamic motion and is considered to provide the most accurate determination of mole mass. The sedimentation coefficient that we determined (sw = 2.7) is in good agreement with the sedimentation coefficient for GrpE obtained from glycerol gradient centrifugation (sw = 2.5); however, these data were interpreted by assuming a globular shape for GrpE (calibration with globular reference proteins) and, consequently, a monomeric structure for GrpE was proposed(8Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate a nonglobular, possibly elongated, shape of GrpE2, since it elutes in gel filtration as a 190-kDa species, its diffusion coefficient is higher and sedimentation velocity is smaller than expected for globular proteins of 44 kDa, and the dissociated molecule migrates slower than expected in SDS-PAGE. Finally, our result agrees with results from glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments ((25Ang D. The Role of the Escherichia coli Heat Shock Protein, grpE, in Escherichia coli growth and DNA Replication. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT1988Google Scholar) as reviewed by Georgopoulos et al.(19Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 191-221Google Scholar). DnaK appears homogeneous in SDS-PAGE, migrating with the expected monomer mole mass of 69 kDa. The heterogeneity of the quaternary structure of DnaK was indicated by several lines of evidence. In gel filtration, DnaK eluted as multiple peaks. In QLS and analytical ultracentrifugation, the diffusion and sedimentation coefficients were broadly distributed and could not be attributed to a single species. Assuming bimodality, mole masses in the range between monomeric and trimeric DnaK were computed using the Svedberg equation. Furthermore, data obtained from sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation fitted well with models assuming coexistence of monomers and smaller amounts of dimers or dimers and trimers. Ultracentrifugation results led us to conclude that peak III obtained from gel filtration consists of DnaK monomers, peak II mainly of unresolved dimers and trimers, and peak I of higher mole mass forms of DnaK which were not detectable at the concentration of 1 mg/ml used in the ultracentrifugation experiments. The low peak elution volumes relative to globular reference proteins and the low diffusion coefficients suggested elongated shapes for DnaK molecules. In contrast to the GrpE2 peak, however, DnaK peaks II and III were significantly shifted to higher elution volumes when gel filtration was performed in the presence of high salt concentrations, indicating a more flexible structure for DnaK than for GrpE2. The different forms of DnaK are in a slow equilibrium for which oligomerization is favored upon increasing the concentration of DnaK. Similar concentration-dependent distributions of oligomeric states of DnaK were found in size exclusion HPLC and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis(20Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DnaK oligomers obtained after gel filtration were quantitatively converted to monomers as shown by chromatography. This conversion resulted from establishment of the equilibrium after removal of the monomers and dilution of DnaK by a factor of more than one-hundred during the experiment. The time required for establishment of the equilibrium is long (>1 h) compared with the time needed for fast gel filtration of DnaK (less than 12 min). The presence of GrpE2 causes dissociation of DnaK oligomers, as revealed by the decrease of DnaK oligomer peak I in the presence of even subequimolar amounts of GrpE2, and by the mole masses derived from equilibrium ultracentrifugation of GrpE/DnaK mixtures which excluded the existence of DnaK oligomers. Dissociation occurs with a slow kinetics similar to that of dissociation of DnaK oligomers upon dilution, suggesting that GrpE2 does not actively disrupt DnaK oligomers but rather stabilizes monomeric DnaK in a heterologous complex. The oligomer dissociating activity of GrpE2 thus may indicate that GrpE2 confers to DnaK a conformation incompatible with stable oligomerization, and it indicates that the heterologous complex was thermodynamically more stable than coexistence of GrpE dimers and DnaK oligomers. However, GrpE2 can also bind to at least a subpopulation of DnaK molecules present in oligomers, since it was found in sub stoichiometric amounts in gel filtration fractions containing DnaK oligomers. Reduced efficiency of GrpE2 binding to DnaK oligomers might have been due to limited accessibility of GrpE2 binding sites within the DnaK oligomers or to lower affinity of GrpE2 for the oligomeric form of DnaK. The conclusion that the stable complex formed by DnaK and GrpE2 consists of one DnaK and one GrpE2 (DnaK-GrpE2) is based on the following findings. First, in gel filtration chromatography of DnaK-GrpE mixtures the most narrow and symmetrical peak of the complex is obtained in the presence of a 1:2 molar ratio of the components. Second, when DnaK-GrpE mixtures at a molar ratio of 1:2 are analyzed by light scattering or analytical ultracentrifugation a narrow size distribution and a single species was observed. The mole mass of this species was 117 kDa (Svedberg equation) or 116 and 121 kDa (sedimentation equilibrium), which are similar to the expected 113 kDa of a DnaK-GrpE2 complex. The same stoichiometry of 1:2 was observed for complexes between the ATPase domain (DnaK1-385) and GrpE, supporting previous findings (10Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and indicating that the regular binding site for GrpE2 is within the ATPase domain of DnaK. Our experiments identify the GrpE dimer as the functionally active species. Its mode of binding to the ATPase domain of a DnaK monomer remains unclear. A GrpE dimer might have a single DnaK binding site or, alternatively, two binding sites which, however, cannot bind two DnaK molecules simultaneously with high affinity as we did not observe DnaK2-GrpE2 complexes at 1:1 stoichiometry. The functional cycle of the DnaK chaperone system involves DnaK, GrpE, and DnaJ, the latter not being a subject of the present investigation. Our studies revealed the existence of monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric DnaK, dimeric GrpE, and DnaK-GrpE2 complexes, raising the number of molecular components involved in the DnaK machinery (21Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) to at least six. DnaK chaperone activity involves the binding of unfolded protein (substrate), the folding of this protein and the subsequent release of the folded protein. It is presently unclear what molecular species of the machinery are involved in these different steps of the folding reactions in vivo or in vitro. We and others showed that in solutions containing only DnaK, the fraction of dimeric and oligomeric DnaK increases with DnaK concentration. There are at least four factors which drive the slow equilibrium of the DnaK oligomers toward monomeric DnaK: the presence of MgATP(20Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), an increase of temperature,5 the presence of peptide substrates 6J. McCarty and B. Bukau, unpublished data. and the presence of GrpE2. The first three factors were also reported for other members of the Hsp70 family. For example, peptide substrates binding to oligomeric and monomeric forms of BiP yielded exclusively monomeric BiP-substrate complexes at equilibrium(22Blond Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although monomerization of BiP by substrate appears to be comparable with the monomerization of DnaK by GrpE2 that we observed, the molecular mechanisms are probably different. In particular, we showed that GrpE2 binds to the NH2-terminal region of DnaK, whereas peptide substrates bind to C termini of Hsp70 proteins(13Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

We suggest that monomeric DnaK is the active molecule in DnaK-mediated protein folding. Oligomeric DnaK would constitute a pool of latent chaperone being activated during heat stress (temperature increase, increasing amounts of unfolded protein, increase of GrpE2 expression(19Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 191-221Google Scholar). We showed that GrpE2 also has affinity for a DnaK-substrate complex. This result leads us to suggest that GrpE2 plays a role not only in the named housekeeping of DnaK monomers but also in subsequent interactions involving DnaK; much evidence suggests that this is related to the nucleotide binding by DnaK. GrpE accelerates the release of ATP or ADP bound to DnaK(3Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Our data show that GrpE2 was bound to the ATPase domain of DnaK, regardless of whether nucleotide (ADP) was prebound to DnaK or peptide substrate was present. It is therefore possible that GrpE2 binds to DnaK-substrate complexes and dissociates DnaK-bound nucleotides (ADP), functioning as a nucleotide exchange factor. Although GrpE2 remains bound to the DnaK-substrate complexes rebinding of ATP might then induce dissociation of GrpE2 and substrate from DnaK. Whether the observed stoichiometry of the DnaK-GrpE2 complex has any implications for protein folding in vitro and the role of DnaJ are subjects of our present investigations. We are grateful to M. Zulauf for light scattering measurements and his help with the interpretation of data from analytical ultracentrifugation. We thank H. Bujard for continuous support and J.

For this group of proteins, binding and release of target polypeptides is tightly coupled to binding and hydrolysis of ATP.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the protein. The dependence of the steady-state, peptide-independent ATPase activity of this fragment on monovalent ions parallels that of full-length Hsc70(34O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol.

McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The tertiary fold is almost identical to that of actin(10Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C.

A. 1991; 88: 5041-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar); furthermore, the nucleotide binding subdomains of actin and the Hsc70 ATPase fragment are similar to those of hexokinase (12Fletterick R.J. Bates D.J. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and glycerol kinase(13Hurley J.H. Faber H.R. Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Pettigrew D.W. Remington S.J.

Many of the amino acid residues in the nucleotide binding sites of actin and Hsc70 are identical(11Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Crystallographic and kinetic studies of both wild-type Hsc70 ATPase fragment and a series of active site point mutants have shown how the hydrolysis products, MgADP + Pi, bind at the active site; they have also shown at least one conformation in which MgATP and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs bind(8Wilbanks S.M.

These results provided the basis for a suggested mechanism of ATP hydrolysis involving in-line attack by an H2O molecule or OH ion on the -phosphate of the nucleotide; the role of Mg to form a β,-bidentate complex with the nucleotide and stabilize a transition state was essential to the suggested mechanism. No efforts had been made to identify monovalent ions in previous structural studies; here, we report anomalous scattering measurements that identify specifically bound K ions in the active site region of the ATPase fragment and suggest how K may be involved in the hydrolytic mechanism. A number of enzymes, including many phosphotransferases, require particular monovalent ions for optimal activity (see (16Suelter C.H. Science. 1970; 168: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) for review); the structural results presented here, in conjunction with the accompanying kinetic studies(34O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggest that direct participation of monovalent ions as cofactors in phosphotransferase reactions may be a common phenomenon.

Briefly: the amino-terminal ATPase domain (amino acid residues 1-386) of bovine Hsc70 was expressed in Escherichia coli from a pT7-7-based vector. Protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography (DE52; Whatman), affinity chromatography (ATP-agarose; Sigma), chromatofocusing (Mono-P; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and gel-filtration (Superdex-75, Pharmacia). Protein was essentially homogenous as judged by Laemmli gels and uncontaminated by DnaK as judged by Western blot. Crystals were grown essentially as described (17DeLuca-Flaherty C. Flaherty K.M. McIntosh L.J. Bahrami B. McKay D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (crystallized from 20% PEG-8000, 1.0 M NaCl, 50 mM CAPS adjusted to pH 9.5 with NaOH, with 1 mM MgATP) and appeared identical to those obtained previously. To adapt crystals to more physiological conditions (pH 7.0 in the presence of potassium) and further to adapt crystals to a cryosolvent that allows flash-freezing, they were shifted to 5% ethylene glycol, 20% PEG-8000-1.0 M KCl, 50 mM HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH), 1 mM MgATP and then to progressively higher ethylene glycol (10, 15, and 20%) in the same mother liquor. Crystals were soaked at least one hour at each intermediate ethylene glycol concentration to avoid cracking. A crystal that had been stored 12 days in 20% ethylene glycol mother liquor at 4°C was flash-frozen to 100 K in a stream of cold N2 gas. Data were collected with a Rigaku R-axis image plate system using Cu K radiation monochromatized with graphite. Data collection parameters were: crystal-to-detector distance, 115 mm; detector swing, 13°; oscillation range and exposure time, 1.2° and 30 min when a∗ axis was greater than 60° from direct beam and 0.7° and 18 min when a∗ axis was less than 60° from direct beam. Crystal orientation and unit cell parameters were determined with the Molecular Structure Corp. R-axis software; the unit cell axes of the frozen crystals were a = 143.9 Å, b = 63.7 Å, c = 46.2 Å, which are changed significantly from the room temperature values of a = 145.3 Å, b = 65.0 Å, c = 46.9 Å. Integrated intensities were extracted from data frames and scaled with DENZO, giving R = 0.054 for data for 174,376 measurements with I≥ 2 encompassing 39,253 unique reflections to a resolution of 1.7 Å (the resolution shell at which observed data are 50% complete). Standard crystallographic computations were performed using PROTEIN(18Steigemann W.

Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) was used for model refinement by both simulated annealing and positional restrained least squares minimization. Model building was done with the program CHAIN (Rice version ESVAIN 2.2) on an Evans and Sutherland ESV(20Jones T.A. Thirup S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Our earlier model for wild-type ATPase fragment with MgADP and Pi bound (15Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was positioned in the asymmetric unit of the frozen crystal by rigid body refinement in XPLOR; this required translations of −0.19, −0.67, +0.08 Å in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, and rotations of +0.08°, +0.20°, and +0.78° around those same axes. One cycle of simulated annealing using data from 6.0 to 2.0 Å reduced the R factor to below 0.26. Multiple rounds of manual, positional and B-factor refinement were used to adjust the protein model, place metal ions that could be confirmed on the basis of anomalous scattering signals and reasonable ligand distances, and place water molecules in well defined peaks of density found at reasonable distances (2.5-3.1 Å) from polar groups. The current model includes amino acid residue 4-381, one ADP, one Pi, one Mg ion, two K ions, a single Cl ion, and 431 water molecules. The position of side chains of the following surface residues could not be determined and are modeled as alanine: Arg-77, Arg-100, Lys-137, Lys-188, Lys-248, Lys-250, and Arg-264. Refinement statistics for the model are: R-factor = 0.205 for 38,150 reflections with I≥ 2 between 6.0 and 1.7 Å resolution with root mean square deviation from ideal geometry of 0.007 Å for bonds and 1.33° for angles. Luzzati plots estimate the coordinate error as <0.20 Å for the model. The unambiguous identification of two K sites in the ATPase fragment structure, based on anomalous difference Fourier peaks, allowed identification of Na sites in the earlier model of the ATPase fragment derived from data collected using crystals in a mother liquor containing 1 M NaCl. Two Na ions placed in electron density peaks near the K ion sites have interaction distances to nearby oxygens that are too short for H2O molecules and closer to what is expected for a Na ion (2.4-2.8 Å). One cycle of positional restrained least squares refinement of the model gave R-factor = 0.210 for 21,926 reflections between 6.0 and 1.9 Å resolution (resolution shell of 50% completeness = 2.1 Å), with root mean square deviation from ideal geometry of 0.007 Å for bonds and 1.37° for angles. Coordinates for both models have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. In conjunction with our studies of the effect of monovalent ions on the ATPase activity of Hsc70 and its 44-kDa ATPase fragment, we have examined the crystallographic structure of wild-type Hsc70 ATPase fragment in the presence of 1.0 M KCl, at pH 7.0 (referred to below as the “KCl structure”), and compared it with the structure previously determined in the presence of 1.0 M NaCl at pH 9.5 (15Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (referred to as the “NaCl structure”). As stated explicitly in the previous publication(15Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no attempt had been made to distinguish between solvent molecules and monovalent ions in the NaCl structure. Flash-freezing of crystals has allowed us to collect data to significantly higher resolution, 1.7 Å, as compared with 2.1 Å for the NaCl structure determined at room temperature. This has resulted in a substantially more precise molecular model. There is an apparent shift of 0.70 Å in the position of the molecule in the crystal due primarily to the change of the unit cell upon freezing. The root mean square difference in position between the backbone atoms of the room temperature NaCl model and the KCl model derived from crystals chilled to 100 K is 0.41 Å. The major differences between the two structures are 1) reorientation of surface exposed loops which have relatively high temperature factors in the NaCl structure and 2) rotation of the β-phosphate of ADP (discussed in detail below). Beyond this, the overall tertiary conformation of the molecule shows little change between the KCl structure and the NaCl structure. Data collection of Bijvoet pairs of reflections allowed us to compute an anomalous difference Fourier which show peaks that may be ascribed to phosphorus (Δf″ = 0.43 e at = 1.54 Å,(21Ibers J. A. Hamilton W. C. (1974) International Tables for X-ray Crystallography, Vol. IV, p. 149, Birmingham, United KingdomGoogle Scholar), sulfur (Δf” = 0.56), chlorine (Δf” = 0.70), or potassium (Δf” = 1.07) atoms. The elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sodium have Δf” < 0.12 and are not expected to show significant anomalous scattering. Significant peaks in the anomalous difference Fourier, taken as those positive peaks that are larger than 5 ( = standard deviation of the map from its mean), the absolute value of the largest negative peak, are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Open table in a new tab The strongest three peaks in the anomalous difference Fourier have been assigned to K or Cl, based on both ligand distance criteria, peak height, and whether the nearby ligands are predominantly electronegative or electropositive. By these criteria, two peaks of height 22.8 and 22.3 have been assigned to K ions. One peak of height 13.9 has been assigned to a Cl ion bound in a loop region on the surface of the protein. The peaks of height 11.8-5.9 include those that can be assigned to the three phosphorus atoms of ADP and Pi, both sulfur atoms of the 2 cysteine residues, and all but one of the sulfur atoms of the methionines. The side chain of Met-93, whose sulfur does not show a significant peak by this criterion, is on the surface of the protein and is somewhat disordered. A peak of height 5.6 has been attributed to the sulfur of an ordered molecule of HEPES; the remainder of the HEPES molecule is apparent in difference Fourier maps. There are seven other peaks ranging 8.4-5.2 on the surface of the protein; these appear to be weakly bound ions with low occupancy or high temperature factors. They have been modeled as solvent at this time. Wild-type ATPase fragment has ADP, Pi, and an octahedrally coordinated Mg ion in the active site. The Mg ligands include one oxygen of the β-phosphate of ADP, one oxygen of Pi, and four H2O molecules; we refer to the Mg ion and its six oxygen ligands as the “Mg cluster.” The anomalous difference Fourier (shown in Fig. 1a) clearly shows peaks for two K ions in the active site, along with three smaller peaks centered on the phosphorus atoms of ADP and Pi. The two K ions on opposite sides of the Mg cluster are prominent as the highest peaks in map. The first site (site 1; Fig. 1b and Fig. 2) corresponds to a peak previously modeled as a solvent molecule in the NaCl structure and labeled “w1” in a previous publication(15Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K ion at site 1 has eight oxygen ligands at distances ranging 2.57-3.22 Å (Table 2); allowing for the level of error in the coordinates (0.20 Å), these values are in general agreement with the range found for K-O distances from high resolution structures of small molecule complexes, 2.6-3.0 Å(22Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three K ligands are provided by two oxygens of Pβ and the Pα-Pβ bridging oxygen of ADP. The H2O molecules at the +x and +y positions of the octahedral Mg cluster provide ligands, as does one carboxyl oxygen of Asp-10. The two additional ligands of the K ion are the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-15 and a full-occupancy internal H2O molecule.Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab By comparison, only six of the eight oxygens that coordinate the K ion ligate the Na ion at this site in the NaCl structure. The six Na ion ligands include a carboxyl of Asp-10, the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-15, the two H2O molecules of the Mg cluster, the internal H2O molecule, and one oxygen of the β-phosphate of ADP. However, the phosphates of the ADP are rotated such that neither the second oxygen of the β-phosphate nor the bridging oxygen between Pα and Pβ is close enough to coordinate the Na ion. Thus, the interactions of Na and K with the protein and the H2O molecules of the Mg cluster are very similar, whereas their interactions with the ADP phosphates are significantly different. The Na-O distances range 2.32-3.09 Å, consistent with ligand distances of 2.4-2.8 Å expected from small molecule studies(22Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of the Na-O(+y) distance of 3.09 Å. The K ion in the second site (site 2; Fig. 1b and 3a), appears to be in a “looser” environment; there are seven oxygens at distances ranging 2.67-3.43 Å from it. The K at site 2 coordinates the oxygen of Pi that is in the -x position of the Mg cluster octahedron; it also ligates the H2O molecule in the -y position. Additionally, it coordinates the hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygens of Thr-204 and (at a greater distance) both carboxyl oxygens of Asp-199 and one carboxyl oxygen of Asp-206. In the NaCl structure, there are two peaks of density in the vicinity of site 2. The most credible model for this density, based on distances to nearest neighbor atoms, is a Na ion at one peak and an H2O molecule at the other (Fig. 3b). The Na ion coordinates one oxygen each of the ADP Pβ and Pi, the H2O at the -y site of the Mg cluster, and the hydroxyl of Thr-204, as well as the H2O molecule in the second electron density peak. This H2O molecule interacts with one carboxyl oxygen each of Asp-199 and Asp-206, the hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygens of Thr-204, and reciprocally, with the Na ion. Hence, the K site is filled by a NaH2O pair in this case, with the Na binding closer to the ADP and Pi ligands, whereas the H2O molecule binds more closely to the Asp-199 and Asp-206 ligands. In summary, there are two monovalent ion sites in the active site of the Hsc70 ATPase fragment. In the wild-type protein with MgADP and Pi bound, the first site is at the interface between the protein and the β-phosphate of the MgADP complex; the second is at the interface between protein and Pi. The third highest peak in the anomalous difference Fourier maps lies in the solvent exposed pocket formed by an α-helix (residues 122-134) and the residues 31-33, the “insertion loop” (Fig. 4). The closest interaction for an atom in this position are with the N of Lys-126 (3.25 Å), the amide of Asp-32 (3.35 Å), and the N of Gln-33 (3.44 Å). A fourth nitrogen, N of Asn-31 (4.23Å), is further away. The magnitude of the anomalous signal, and the overall positive ligand environment, suggest this position is occupied by a Cl ion. Furthermore, the ligand distances are approximately equal to the sum of the Cl ionic radius (1.81 Å) and the effective bonding distance of nitrogen or oxygen (1.4 Å) and are longer than would be expected for K, whose ionic radius is 1.33 Å. This pocket is partially closed by the carboxylate of Asp-32, the oxygens of which are each 3.9 Å distant from the chloride ion. No equivalent electron density was observed in the room temperature NaCl structure at pH 9.5, possibly because Lys-126 may be unprotonated, and unable to form a salt bridge, at the higher pH. The anomalous scattering signals of potassium and chlorine have been used to distinguish monovalent ions from solvent H2O molecules in crystals of Hsc70 ATPase fragment. A chloride ion is specifically bound under the insertion loop. The insertion loop resides in an 8-residue insertion in the third β-strand of the Hsc70 ATPase fragment. This insertion is present in the sequences of other 70-kDa heat shock proteins but absent in actin and hexokinase. The residues within this loop which appear to interact with the chloride ion (NDQ) are completely conserved among the cytosolic eukaryotic hsp70s (and occurs as either NDQ or NEQ in the family members found in the endoplasmic reticulum) but occurs as NXQ (X = S, T, A, or G) in bacterial, mitochondrial, and most chloroplastic dnaKs. This loop is of interest because it is, in dnaK, the site of interaction with the nucleotide exchange factor grpE(23Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Whether the ion binding property of this loop has physiological significance, or is merely a fortuitous circumstance of the crystallization conditions, remains an open question. The primary purpose of our experiment was identification of ions within the active site. Two specific binding sites for monovalent cations were found in the nucleotide binding site of the protein. K at site 1 interacts with the β-phosphate oxygens of the nucleotide, as well as with protein ligands and water molecules in the Mg cluster; K at site 2 interacts with a Pi oxygen, in addition to ligands from the protein and the Mg cluster. Na has a substantially smaller ionic radius (0.95 Å) than K (1.33 Å) and an accordingly lower preferred coordination number (typically 6 for Na as compared with 8 for K, as revealed by structures of small molecule complexes(22Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 M NaCl, Na ions are found in both of the monovalent ion binding sites; however, Na is an imperfect mimic of K. Na at site 1 binds the same ligands from the protein and Mg cluster as K. However, the Pβ of ADP is rotated such that only one oxygen coordinates Na. Na binding at site 2 differs substantially from K binding; the K ion is replaced by a NaH2O pair, with the Na ion binding oxygens of Pi and Pβ, the hydroxyl of Thr-204, and the H2O molecule of the Mg cluster; although the H2O molecule interacts primarily with the protein ligands that would otherwise bind K. At both sites, discrimination between Na and K appears to be based on differences in ionic radius. A model for the pathway of ATP hydrolysis which we presented previously (15Flaherty K.M. Wilbanks S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12899-12907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that hydrolysis proceeds with formation of a β,-bidentate complex between the triphosphate and Mg, followed by in-line nucleophilic attack by an H2O molecule or OH ion on the -phosphate to form a pentavalent transition state. This scheme can be reconciled with a role for K ions in hydrolysis. A model for the postulated bidentate MgATP complex, showing probable interactions of the two K ions with the phosphate oxygens, is shown in Fig. 5. The K ion at site 2 may facilitate an early step of hydrolysis by stabilization of partial negative charges on the oxygens of the -phosphate (through electrostatic interaction), thereby “deshielding” the target phosphorus atom and making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Model building suggests that the K ion at site 2 would be likely to coordinate two of the oxygens attached to P for both ATP (as shown in Fig. 5) and for the transition state. Subsequently, the active site cations may contribute to the electrostatic stabilization of the pentavalent transition state, particularly through interaction of both K at site 1 and Mg with the α- and β-phosphates. This is in addition to any contribution made by the mainchain amides: within the loops which most closely approach the phosphate moiety (residues 13-15, 202-204, and 339 and 340) all amide hydrogens point toward the phosphates. K at site 1 would bind an oxygen of the β-phosphate and may bridge between the α- and β-phosphates to form a bidentate complex similar to that observed in small molecule crystals of K-ADP complexes(24Adamiak D.A. Saenger W. Acta Crystallogr. 1980; B36: 2585-2589Crossref Google Scholar, 25Swaminathan P. Sundaralingam M. Acta Crystallogr. 1980; B36: 2576-2584Google Scholar). It is worthy of mention that other phosphotransferases possess lysine residues with -amino groups situated to act in place of the potassium ions found in Hsc70. The -amino group of Lys-18 in actin forms salt bridges to oxygens of the α- and β-phosphates of ADP(10Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar); it could fulfill the identical role proposed for K at site 1 in Hsc70. Hsc70 has cysteine at the residue equivalent to Lys-18 of actin; it does not have a positively charged residue at this site that could perform this function. Similarly, Lys-16 within the conserved phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of H-ras p21 forms a β,-bidentate complex with adenyl-5′-yl β,-imidodiphosphate(26Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The ability of a particular ion to facilitate hydrolysis by either deshielding or electrostatic stabilization is expected to increase as ionic radius decreases, providing a rationale for this enzyme's greater activity in the presence of potassium relative to larger monovalent cations. In addition, the active site may contain geometric constraints (e.g. location of -phosphate and H2O for in-line attack) which are better met by K than Na. The repositioning of the β-phosphate in the sodium structure relative to the potassium structure indicates the importance of cations in establishing phosphate position. The suggestion from the structural results presented here, that facilitation of ATP hydrolysis will depend on the ionic radius of the monovalent cations at the active site of the protein, correlates with the observation that the ATP hydrolysis rate and the steady-state ATPase activity of Hsc70 are activated by monovalent ions and show a preference for K, with ions of either larger or smaller ionic radius being less effective in activation(34O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The monovalent cation requirement of certain enzymes, including many phosphotransferases has long been recognized (cf. (27Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1170-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and attributed either to a structural requirement for potassium at sites (perhaps on the protein surface) distant from the active site (28Evans H.J. Sorger G.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1966; 17: 47-76Crossref Google Scholar), or to a role for potassium in contact with the substrate and catalytic residues(16Suelter C.H. Science. 1970; 168: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Toney et al.(29Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Cowan S.W. Jansonius J.N. Science. 1993; 261: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reported the structural basis for potassium activation of dialkylglycine decarboxylase, basing their identification of K and Na ions on bond distances and the refined temperature factor of the atom. In this case, a specific cation binding site is adjacent to but separate from the active site; it is an example of activation “at a distance” by a monovalent cation. K binding at this site activates the enzyme through a local conformational shift; Na deactivates it. Discrimination between the two cations is on the basis of ionic radius; the ligand distances are 2.7 ± 0.1 for K-O and 2.3 ± 0.2 for Na-O, and binding of the smaller Na results in the displacement of one of the six oxygen ligands of K. Recently, the structure of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase bound to pyruvate, Mn, and K was reported(30Larsen T.M. Laughlin L.T. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The single K ion does not interact directly with pyruvate, one of the products of the enzymatic phosphorylation of ADP by phosphoenolpyruvate. It remains to be determined whether the K ion interacts directly with the nucleotide or at a distance from both substrates. In the case of Hsc70, it appears that monovalent ions exert their effect through direct interaction with phosphates of the nucleotide substrate, just as Mg does. This raises the possibility that direct interaction of monovalent ions with substrates may be an essential feature of a significant number of enzymatic phosphotransferase reactions. Data from small molecule crystal structures and solution studies may be cited to corroborate this suggestion. Structures of polyphosphate in complexes with cations show that the geometry of a complex is sensitive to the ionic radius of the cation(24Adamiak D.A. Saenger W. Acta Crystallogr. 1980; B36: 2585-2589Crossref Google Scholar, 25Swaminathan P. Sundaralingam M. Acta Crystallogr. 1980; B36: 2576-2584Google Scholar, 31Merritt E.A. Sundaralingam M.

A. 1972; 325: 401-438Google Scholar). Also, non-enzymatic transphosphorylation of orthophosphate by ATP requires both a divalent and monovalent cation, with K being the most effective monovalent cation(33Lowenstein J.M. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Those studies together with the present work provide a structural basis for the hypothesis that the monovalent ion dependence of many phosphotransferase enzymes is a manifestation of precise geometric constraints on the interaction of both divalent and monovalent ions with nucleotide phosphates at the enzyme-substrate interface.

This data suggest that a pool GAD65, but not GAD67, is associated with membrane compartments. After Triton X-114 extraction and phase separation, a pool of both soluble and particulate GAD65 partitions in the detergent phase, whereas soluble GAD67 is recovered only in the aqueous phase(14Christgau S.

Immunocytochemical studies using antibodies which recognize both GAD isoforms or exclusively GAD65 demonstrated that GAD is localized in close proximity of neuronal synaptic vesicles (SVs) (17McLaughlin B.

A fraction of GAD67 was found to be concentrated in nerve terminals (3Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), reflecting an interaction with other cell components, possibly GAD65 itself, since GAD65 and GAD67 were reported to form dimers and heterodimers(11Butler M. Solimena M. Dirkx R. Hayday A. De Camilli P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the possible interaction of GAD67 with GAD65 in transfected fibroblasts as well as in neurons and pancreatic β-cells. Our data demonstrate that the two proteins are associated and that because of its interaction with GAD65 also GAD67 is targeted to intracellular membrane compartments. An anti-GAD67 specific antiserum (serum 9886) was raised by immunizing a rabbit with a peptide corresponding to amino acids 2-19 of GAD67(22Li L. Hagopian W.A. Brashear H.R. Daniels T. Lernmark Å. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 930-934PubMed Google Scholar), a region of the protein which has no homology with GAD65. Rabbit serum 7673, which recognize both GAD isoforms, was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 577-593 of rat GAD67(15Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M.

Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. D. Gottlieb (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). A commercial monoclonal antibody against β-galactosidase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lens culinaris was purchased from E-Y Laboratories (San Mateo, CA). Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores (fluorescein and lissamine rhodamine) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). The cloning of a rat GAD65 cDNA has been reported previously(15Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. De Camilli P. Hayday A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The GAD67 and GAD65 constructs in the pRC/RSV expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) have been described previously(15Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. De Camilli P.

COS-7 and CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 34 μg/ml proline. GAD constructs in the pRC/RSV expression vector were transiently transfected into COS cells by a Ca2+-phosphate procedure(25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar, 26Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Transfection of CHO cells using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was performed as described previously(15Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. De Camilli P. Hayday A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Co-transfections were carried out using a mixture containing 15 μg of each plasmid DNA. All biochemical procedures were performed at 4°C, unless otherwise specified. Rat brain homogenates prepared in homogenization buffer (HB) (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and aprotinin) were spun at 3,000 ×g for 10 min. 1-ml aliquots of postnuclear supernatant were further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min in a TLA 100.2 rotor using a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) to generate a high speed pellet and supernatant. For Triton X-114 extraction assays, aliquots of the postnuclear supernatant were extracted with 2% precondensed Triton X-114 (Pierce) for 90 min. Triton X-114-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min and resuspended in HB with 2% Triton X-114 to the original volume. The soluble material was phase-partitioned at 37°C for 5 min as described previously(15Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. De Camilli P. Hayday A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, rat brain homogenates prepared as described above were first spun at 1,000 ×g for 10 min to generate a P1 pellet and a S1 supernatant. Centrifugation of S1 at 36,000 ×g for 30 min in a SS-34 rotor (Sorvall, Boston, MA) generated a P2 pellet and a S2 supernatant. Centrifugation of S2 at 170,000 ×g for 2 h in a 50 Ti Beckman rotor produced a P3 pellet and a S3 supernatant. Each pellet was brought back to the original volume in HB. Aliquots of all fractions were solubilized with 2% Triton X-114 and phase-partitioned as described above. Equal volumes of each subcellular fraction and Triton X-114 extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose according to standard procedures(28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar, 29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44911) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using serum 7673, serum 9886, and GAD6 ascites at dilutions of 1:250. Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) (Sigma) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Corp.). Alternatively, rabbit immunoglubulins were revealed by 125I-protein A radioimmunolabeling (105 cpm/ml) (Amersham) and autoradiography. Seventy-two hours after transfection, COS cells were solubilized with 1 ml of HB containing 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 90 min. One confluent 10-cm dish of transfected cells was used per immunoprecipitation. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation 15,000 ×g for 10 min. In some experiments Triton X-100 extracts from GAD67- and GAD65-COS cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and used as a starting material for immunopreciptation. The Triton X-100-soluble material was precleared with 125 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose CL-4 beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 750 ×g for 1 min, and the resulting supernatants were used as a starting material for immunoprecipitation with 10 μl of GAD6 ascites as described previously(18Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with serum 7673 as described above. Double immunofluorescence on transfected CHO cells and 10-μm cryostat sections of rat brain or pancreas was performed as described previously (30Cameron P.L. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 31De Camilli P. Cameron R. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1337-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Dilution of primary antibodies were as follows: serum 9886, 1:100; GAD6 ascites, 1:50; β-galactosidase, 1:100. Fluorescein-conjugated lentil lectin was used at 20 μg/ml. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 system (Bio-Rad) equipped with an argon ion laser connected to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Acquired images were processed as described previously(32Xu T. Caron L. Fehon G. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 913-922PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation of rat brain postnuclear supernatant at 100,000 ×g, both GAD isoforms were partially recovered in the high speed pellet (Fig. 1A, lane 2), indicating that in neurons not only GAD65, but also GAD67, may be associated with membranes, as suggested previously (23Chang Y.-C. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that sedimentable GAD67 corresponds only to a pool of the soluble enzyme entrapped in synaptosomes or other resealed cell fragments, rat brain homogenates were further analyzed by differential subcellular fractionation. As shown in Fig. 1B, GAD67 was recovered together with GAD65 in all pellet fractions (P1, P2, P3), including P3 (lane 21), which contains only small vesicles including SVs, and virtually no soluble proteins(33Huttner W. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Moreover, following Triton X-114 extraction a significant amount of GAD67 from postnuclear supernatant partitioned in the detergent phase (Fig. 1A, lane 5). A similar partitioning of GAD67 was observed in Triton X-114 extracts of all pellet (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9, 19, and 29) and supernatant (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4, 14, and 24) fractions obtained by differential centrifugation of brain homogenates. The recovery of GAD67 together with GAD65 in pellet fractions and detergent phases may be due to an interaction of GAD67 with GAD65, because the two proteins were reported to co-immunoprecipitate(11Butler M. Solimena M. Dirkx R. Hayday A. De Camilli P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Chang Y.-C. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction between GAD67 and GAD65, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments from Triton X-100 extracts of COS cells transiently transfected with GAD67, GAD65, or both isoforms using the anti-GAD65 specific antibody GAD6. Levels of expression of GAD65 and GAD67 in single (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2) and double-transfected (Fig. 2, lane 3) COS cells were comparable, as shown by Western blot using serum 7673, which recognizes both proteins equally. As reported previously(11Butler M. Solimena M. Dirkx R. Hayday A. De Camilli P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Chang Y.-C. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GAD6 was able to immunoprecipitate GAD67 together with GAD65 from rat brain extracts (Fig. 2, lane 4) but not from COS cells transfected with GAD67 only (Fig. 2, lane 5). However, GAD6 co-immunoprecipitated GAD67 together with GAD65 from extracts of COS cells co-transfected with the two isoforms (Fig. 2, lane 7). Conversely, GAD6 did not co-immunoprecipitated GAD67 with GAD65 when GAD67 COS and GAD65 COS cell extracts were mixed and used as a starting material for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, lane 6). Thus, the association of GAD67 with GAD65 occurs before extraction, i.e. within living cells expressing both proteins. Following affinity purification from rat brain extracts on a GAD6 column, no bands other than GAD65 and GAD67 were visualized in the eluate by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE (23Chang Y.-C. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2M. Butler, R. Dirkx, Jr., P. De Camilli, and M. Solimena, unpublished observations. This finding suggests GAD67 and GAD65 interact directly and not via another protein. Next, we used a GAD67 specific antiserum (serum 9886) (22Li L. Hagopian W.A. Brashear H.R. Daniels T. Lernmark Å. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 930-934PubMed Google Scholar) to compare the intracellular distribution of GAD67 when expressed alone or together with GAD65 in CHO cells. Serum 9886, unlike other antibodies used until now for the immunocytochemical detection of GAD67(3Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), recognizes exclusively GAD67, as shown by Western blot on rat brain postnuclear supernatants (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and by immunocytochemistry on CHO cells transfected either with GAD67 (Fig. 3B, left panel) or GAD65 (Fig. 3B, right panel). In CHO cells transfected only with GAD67, this protein appeared homogeneously distributed in the cytosol, as expected for a soluble protein and as reported previously(15Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. De Camilli P. Hayday A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In GAD67 GAD65 co-transfected CHO cells, however, a pool of GAD67 (Fig. 4, A and C) was concentrated together with GAD65 (Fig. 4B) in a region of the Golgi apparatus, as shown by its co-localization with lentil lectin (Fig. 4D). Lentil lectin binding sites are concentrated in the Golgi complex(34Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, upon co-expression and interaction with GAD65, GAD67 is targeted to intracellular vesicular compartments.Figure 4:Localization of GAD67 in GAD67 + GAD65-co-transfected CHO cells. Double immunofluorescence with serum 9886 (A, C), GAD6 (B), and fluorescein-conjugated lentil lectin (D). In GAD67 + GAD65 co-transfected CHO cells, a pool of GAD67 was co-localized with GAD65 in the region of the Golgi complex. Bar, 24 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next mapped the domain of GAD65 responsible for the interaction with GAD67. In previous experiments we found that only two anti-GAD sera, N65 and 9057, among a large number tested, were not able to co-immunoprecipitate GAD67 with GAD65 from rat brain extracts. Both N65 and 9057 sera contain antibodies directed against epitopes localized within amino acids 1-95 of GAD65. The lack of GAD67 in immunoprecipitates produced by these antibodies suggested that their epitope(s) is(are) hidden in the GAD65-GAD67 complex, i.e. that the NH2-terminal region of GAD65 may be involved in binding GAD67. To test this hypothesis GAD67 was co-transfected in CHO cells either with β-galactosidase or with GAD65(1-83)/β-gal, a fusion protein in which amino acids 1-83 of GAD65 are fused to the NH2-terminus of β-galactosidase. We have shown previously that in transfected CHO cells, β-galactosidase is evenly distributed in the cytosol, whereas GAD65(1-83)/β-gal is concentrated in the Golgi complex region(21Solimena M. Dirkx R. Radzynski M. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating that amino acids 1-83 of GAD65 contain a signal which is sufficient to target an unrelated soluble protein to this intracellular compartment. Upon co-transfection with GAD65(1-83)/β-gal, GAD67 (Fig. 5A) co-localized with the GAD65/β-gal chimera (Fig. 5B) in the region of the Golgi complex, indicating that amino acids 1-83 of GAD65 contain the GAD67-binding domain. On the other hand, GAD67 was diffusely distributed (Fig. 5C) when co-transfected with β-galactosidase (Fig. 5D). In addition, a pool of GAD67 (Fig. 5E) was concentrated in the Golgi complex region when co-transfected in CHO cells with GAD65(S1-6), a GAD65 mutant which cannot undergo thiopalmitoylation (21Solimena M. Dirkx R. Radzynski M. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) because of the site-directed mutagenesis of all cysteines within its NH2-terminal region. Therefore, NH2-terminal palmitoylation of GAD65 is not required for association of the two proteins. Double immunostaining of rat brain sections with serum 9886 and GAD6 demonstrated that both GAD67 and GAD65 are abundant in nerve terminals. As described previously (3Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 35Esclapez M. Tillakaratne N.J.K. Kaufman D.L. Tobin A.J. Houser C.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1834-1855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) GAD67 appeared slightly enriched in the perikaryal-dendritic region of GABA-ergic neurons (Fig. 6), 3R. Dirkx, Jr., P. DeCamilli, and M. Solimena, unpublished observations. whereas GAD65 is more enriched than GAD67 in synapses. In addition, we observed that in neuronal cell bodies, as in GAD65-GAD67 co-transfected CHO cells, a pool of GAD67 was co-localized with GAD65 in the Golgi complex region (Fig. 6, arrow). Nerve terminals were either positive for both isoforms (Fig. 6, arrowheads) or exclusively contained GAD65, whereas no synaptic terminals appeared positive for GAD67 in the absence of GAD65. Immunofluorescence in rat pancreatic islets demonstrated that the expression of GAD673 and GAD65 (6Bækkeskov S. Aanstoot H.J. Christgau S. Reetz A. Solimena M. Cascalho M. Folli F. Richter-Olesen H. De Camilli P. Nature. 1990; 347: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) was restricted to β-cells. GAD67 was detected in all β-cells (Fig. 7C),3 although in the majority of the cells immunoreactivity for GAD65 was predominant (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, a few β-cells strongly positive for GAD67 (Fig. 7, A and B, arrowheads) were negative for GAD65 (Fig. 7C, arrowheads). In some β-cells the two proteins appeared co-localized in the perinuclear region (Fig. 7A, arrow), presumable in correspondence of the Golgi apparatus. Previous studies have indicated GAD may exist as a dimer (reviewed in (36Erlander M.G. Tobin A.J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar)). GAD was detected as a doublet with molecular weight of 120,000 and 115,000 ± 5,000 (37Legay F. Henry S. Tappaz M. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) following SDS-gel electrophoresis of rat brain homogenates in nonreducing conditions, suggesting that GAD isoforms may associate in a homodimeric complex. Other evidence suggested that GAD forms heterodimers(11Butler M. Solimena M. Dirkx R. Hayday A. De Camilli P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Chang Y.-C. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these experiments did not examine whether the two proteins interact in vivo. Here, we definitively demonstrate that GAD67 binds to GAD65 in vivo. Our results indicate that GAD67 interacts with both the soluble and the particulate forms of GAD65 and that this interaction has implications for the targeting of GAD67. We have also shown that GAD67, in agreement with our previous suggestion(11Butler M. Solimena M. Dirkx R. Hayday A. De Camilli P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), binds to the NH2-terminal region of GAD65, a region with low homology to the corresponding region of GAD67 and which contains the information required for the targeting to intracellular membrane compartments (14Christgau S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that preventing the palmitoylation of GAD65 does not abolish its interaction with GAD67. In particular, GAD67 binds to GAD65 (S1-6), a GAD65 construct in which all 6 cysteines at the NH2-terminal region were mutagenized (21Solimena M. Dirkx R. Radzynski M. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that formation of GAD65-GAD67 complexes is not due to disulfide bridges, as reported previously(38Bækkeskov S. Warnock G. Christie M. Rajotte R.V. Aagaat L. Diabetologia. 1988; 31: 466A-467AGoogle Scholar). Although the presence of disulfide bridges between the two GAD isoforms in nonreducing conditions is clearly an artifact generated by exposing the two proteins to an oxidative environment upon homogenization, this artifact clearly reflects the close association of the two proteins in vivo. As a result of its association with GAD65, a pool GAD67 is targeted to the Golgi complex region in double-transfected CHO cells as well as in GABA-ergic neurons and in rat pancreatic β-cells. Analysis of rat pancreatic β-cells by confocal microscopy has shown previously that a pool of GAD is concentrated in the Golgi complex region(39Sorenson R.L. Garry D.G. Brelje T.C. Diabetes. 1991; 41: 1365-1374Crossref Google Scholar). Those experiments, however, were performed using a serum (serum 1440) (40Öertel W.H. Schmechel D.E. Tappaz M.L. Kopin I.J. Neuroscience. 1981; 6: 2689-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) which recognizes both GAD isoforms and therefore could not address the molecular mechanism/s responsible for the targeting of either isoforms to membrane compartments. Recovery of GAD67 in the P3 pellet following differential subcellular fractionation of rat brain homogenates strongly suggests that a pool of the protein is associated with SVs, and by analogy, with SLMVs of pancreatic β-cells. This association is most likely mediated by its interaction with GAD65. Consistent with this idea, synaptic terminals were found to contain either both proteins or GAD65, but never GAD67 in the absence of GAD65 ((35Esclapez M. Tillakaratne N.J.K. Kaufman D.L. Tobin A.J. Houser C.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1834-1855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this study). The interaction of GAD with SVs and SLMVs may be instrumental for the rapid uptake of the newly synthesized GABA into these secretory organelles(18Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 19Maycox P.R. Hell J.W. Jahn R. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 83-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis suggests that GAD67 is differentially distributed in rat brain and pancreatic islets. Upon subcellular fractionation and Triton X-114 extraction of brain homogenates, a pool of GAD67 is found in pellets and in Triton X-114 detergent phases (23 and this study). In contrast, GAD67 from pancreatic islets was reported to be present in the high speed supernatant and in the Triton X-114 aqueous phase(13Christgau S. Schierbeck H. Aanstoot H.-J. Aagaard L. Begley K. Kofod H. Hejnaes K. Bækkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21257-21564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Christgau S. Aanstoot H.-J. Schierbeck H. Begley K. Tullin S. Hejnaes K. Bækkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results can be reconciled, however, when the different levels of GAD67 and GAD65 co-expressed in GABA-ergic neurons and pancreatic β-cells are taken into account. The high level of both GAD isoforms in most GABA-ergic neurons ((35Esclapez M. Tillakaratne N.J.K. Kaufman D.L. Tobin A.J. Houser C.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1834-1855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this study) allows GAD65-GAD67 complexes to be easily detected, which, in turn, explains the partial recovery of GAD67 in pellet and hydrophobic fractions. On the other side, the low amount of GAD67 in rat pancreatic islets, together with its limited co-expression with GAD65 within the same β-cells, may explain the virtual absence of GAD67 in pellet and hydrophobic fractions of rat pancreatic islets. Previous studies have emphasized the different biochemical properties of GAD65 and GAD67 with implication for their intracellular targeting. In this study we have demonstrated that, in spite of their differences, a substantial pool of the two proteins co-localizes in vivo due to their association. It has been proposed that the differential interaction of GAD67 and GAD65 with pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, the co-factor required for GAD activity, provides a mechanism for modulating GABA synthesis at nerve terminals(3Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 4Martin D.L. Martin S.B. Wu S.J. Espina N. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Martin D.L. Martin S.B. Wu S.J. Espina N. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GABA content of neuronal synaptic vesicles and β-cell synaptic like microvesicles may be further controlled by regulating the association of GAD65 with membranes and the interaction of GAD67 with GAD65. In this context it is interesting that the NH2-terminal region of GAD65 is involved in membrane association as well as in binding to GAD67. The physiological significance of the concentration of GAD67 and GAD65 in the region of the Golgi complex remains to be established. The most likely possibility is that the targeting of the two proteins to the Golgi compartment is an intermediate step in their route toward SVs and SLMVs. GAD oligomers may associate at this stage with precursors of SVs and SLMVs which bud from the Golgi complex and are then directed to the cell periphery(41Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Targeting to the Golgi complex region may also be required for post-translational modifications of GAD65(21Solimena M. Dirkx R. Radzynski M. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation increases the hydrophobicity of GAD65 and might further strengthen the association of both GAD65 and GAD65-GAD67 complexes to membrane organelles, including SVs and SLMVs.

They were markedly stabilized by synthetic peptides, designed after the sequence around the autophosphorylation site in the autoinhibitory domain, such as autocamtide-2 and CaMK-(281-309), but such marked stabilizations were not observed with the ordinary exogenous substrates, such as syntide-2. These results suggest that the autoinhibitory domain of CaM kinase II plays a crucial role in stabilizing the enzyme. A nonphosphorylatable analog of autocamtide-2, AIP, strongly inhibited the activity of the 30-kDa fragment. Kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition by AIP was competitive with respect to autocamtide-2 and CaMK-(281-289) and noncompetitive with respect to syntide-2 and ATP/Mg, suggesting that CaM kinase II possesses at least two distinct substrate-binding sites; one for ordinary exogenous substrates such as syntide-2 and the other for an endogenous substrate, the autophosphorylation site (Thr/Thr) in the autoinhibitory domain. Fluorescence analysis of the binding of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl labeled AIP to the 30-kDa fragment also supported this contention.

Each subunit has the consensus ATP-binding domain near the amino terminus, the catalytic domain in the amino-terminal region, and the regulatory domain consisting of the autoinhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains in the central region of the protein(1Hanson P.I.

Upon binding Ca/calmodulin in the presence of ATP/Mg, CaM kinase II undergoes a rapid autophosphorylation on Thr/Thr (in α/β, , and isoforms) located within the autoinhibitory domain, leading to the full activation of the enzyme (18Kwiatkowski A.P.

Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Further autophosphorylation of the enzyme following the initial rapid autophosphorylation on Thr results in a gradual loss of the enzymatic activity(26Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) have suggested that the inactivation may be a consequence of a decrease in the thermal stability of the enzyme. Colbran (30Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7163-7170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has reported that basal autophosphorylation at Thr in the calmodulin-binding site blocks calmodulin binding, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme. We have recently reported that incubation of the enzyme with Ca/calmodulin causes a marked inactivation of the enzyme and that the inactivation was prevented by autocamtide-2, a synthetic substrate peptide modeled after the sequence around the autophosphorylation site (Thr) within the autoinhibitory domain, but not prevented by syntide-2, a synthetic substrate peptide modeled after a phosphorylation site of glycogen synthase(31Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These observations led us to a postulation that there are two distinct substrate-binding sites in CaM kinase II, one for ordinary exogenous substrates and the other for the endogenous substrate, the autophosphorylation site (Thr) in the autoinhibitory domain, and that the latter may be involved in stabilizing the enzyme. The present paper describes several experimental data supporting this contention. Thus, the autoinhibitory domain of CaM kinase II appears to play a crucial role in stabilizing the enzyme as well as in inhibiting the catalytic activity of the enzyme, keeping the enzyme inactive and stable. Similar stabilizing and inhibitory effects have been observed with the pseudosubstrate domain of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase(32Faux M.C. Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

All these peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Concentrations of the peptides were determined by amino acid analysis. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) was purified from porcine brain as described previously(37Katoh T. Fujisawa H. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II was purified from rat cerebral cortex as described previously(31Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that H-9-Sepharose chromatography was omitted. An active 30-kDa proteolytic fragment of CaM kinase II was prepared according to the method of Yamagata et al.(41Yamagata Y. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Biol.

The fragment thus obtained gives a single polypeptide band, corresponding to 30 kDa, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exhibits a completely Ca/calmodulin-independent protein kinase activity, and it should be the fragment of amino acid residues 1-271 of CaM kinase II(31Ishida A.

The inactivation reaction was carried out in a mixture containing 85-556 nM CaM kinase II fragment, 40 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0), 0.01% Tween 20, and 0.1 mM EGTA, with the indicated additions. Polypropylene tubes (Eppendorf) were used, because the enzyme protein was adsorbed on glass tubes. Unless otherwise stated, the reaction was carried out at 30°C. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme to the mixture, and aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times, followed by immediate dilution with 19 volumes of ice-cold 40 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1 mM EGTA (stop buffer). For determination of the original activity, the enzyme was added to the incubation mixture on ice and aliquots were withdrawn, followed by immediate dilution with the ice-cold stop buffer. The activity of the diluted enzyme was immediately measured as described below. Unless otherwise specified, syntide-2 was used for substrate. The remaining activity was expressed as a percentage of the original activity. Approximately 0.22-0.24 μM CaM kinase II (the concentration as holoenzyme) was incubated at 5°C for 10 min in the reaction mixture containing 40 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0), 50 μM ATPS, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 μM calmodulin. Under the conditions used, autothiophosphorylation should occur only at Thr(24Ikeda A. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11582-11588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The autothiophosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA. A control experiment was done by adding EDTA/EGTA before starting the reaction by the addition of the enzyme. After reaction for autothiophosphorylation, 3-μl aliquots of the incubation mixture were withdrawn and incubated in order to observe inactivation at 30°C in the mixture containing 40 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Tween 20, with the indicated additions, in a total volume of 30 μl. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn, diluted 20-fold with the ice-cold stop buffer, and immediately assayed for CaM kinase II activity as described below, with syntide-2 as substrate. The remaining activity was expressed as a percentage of the original activity. The activities of autothiophosphorylated CaM kinase II and the active 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II were measured by the phosphocellulose paper method of Roskoski(42Roskoski Jr., R.

(Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Autothiophosphorylated CaM kinase II was assayed in the presence of Ca/calmodulin, and the CaM kinase II fragment was assayed in the absence of Ca/calmodulin. Labeling of AIP was achieved essentially as described by Rapaport and Shai(43Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 24°C for 66 h, followed by precipitation with diethyl ether. The precipitate was washed once with diethyl ether and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The yellow powder thus obtained was dissolved into 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column. Positive-ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrum of the purified peptide, measured with a JEOL JMS-SX102 mass spectrometer, showed a prominent peak at m/e 1661, indicating that 1 mol of NBD was introduced into 1 mol of AIP. The concentration of the labeled peptide was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorption coefficient, A, of 26,650 M cm as described by Allegrini et al.(44Allegrini P.R. Sigrist H. Schaller J. Zahler P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra of 0.2 μM NBD-AIP were measured in the mixture consisting of 40 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0) and 0.01% Tween 20, with the indicated additions, before and after the addition of 0.23 μM of the active 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II, with a Hitachi F-3000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 30°C, with an excitation wavelength of 472 nm. Changes in relative fluorescence intensity at an emission wavelength of 521.6 nm (ΔF) were calculated according to,ΔF521.6(%)=100×(Fbefore−Fafter/Fbefore)(Eq. 1) where F and F are the relative fluorescence intensities at 521.6 nm before and after the addition of the 30-kDa fragment, respectively. The values were corrected for dilution. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). The concentrations of CaM kinase II and calmodulin were determined spectrophotometrically using absorption coefficients, A(1 mg/ml), of 1.30 and 0.21, respectively, as described previously(37Katoh T. Fujisawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other proteins were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(46Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Peterson (47Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fluorography was carried out by the method of Chamberlain(48Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). The molecular weights for CaM kinase II, the 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II, calmodulin, and MAP2 were taken as 540,000, 30,000, 17,000, and 300,000, respectively. Fig. 1 shows thermal stabilities of the active 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II and the autothiophosphorylated CaM kinase II, compared with the original native enzyme. Incubation of the native enzyme for 3 min caused no significant change in the activity over the incubation temperature range from 0 to 40°C. In contrast, incubation of the 30-kDa fragment resulted in a progressive decrease in the activity with increasing the incubation temperature at above 20°C, and more than 90% of the original activity was lost at 40°C, as shown in Fig. 1A. When the effect of the concentration of the fragment on the rate of the inactivation was examined at two different concentrations of the fragment, 85 nM and 556 nM, no significant difference between the former and the latter was observed (data not shown), suggesting that the inactivation was not affected by concentrations of the fragment ranging from 85 nM to 556 nM. No molecular size difference was observed between the active and the inactivated 30-kDa fragments, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the inactivation was not due to proteolysis. Thus, the removal of the region corresponding to the C-terminal side of the residue 271(41Yamagata Y. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15391-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which autoinhibitory domain was included, led to a dramatic decrease in the thermal stability of CaM kinase II. The susceptibility of the inactivated 30-kDa fragment to tryptic digestion was significantly higher than that of the active fragment (Fig. 2C), indicating that a conformational change occurred during the inactivation process.Figure 2:Analyses of the inactivated 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II and its susceptibility to tryptic digestion on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A, the 30-kDa fragment (407 nM) of CaM kinase II was incubated at 30°C for inactivation, and after incubation for 0, 2, 5, and 10 min (lanes 1-4, respectively), aliquots were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, followed by silver staining. B, the 30-kDa fragment (167 nM) was incubated at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40°C (lanes 1-5, respectively) for 3 min, and aliquots were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, followed by silver staining. C, approximately 980 ng of the active 30-kDa fragment (lanes 1-5) or the inactivated 30-kDa fragment (lanes 6-10), obtained by incubation for 10 min at 30°C as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was incubated with 21 ng of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin at 0°C. After incubation for 0 (lanes 1 and 6), 5 (lanes 2 and 7), 30 (lanes 3 and 8), 60 (lanes 4 and 9), and 120 min (lanes 5 and 10), aliquots were mixed with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (10 mM) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, followed by silver staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1B shows that autothiophosphorylation of CaM kinase II resulted in a decrease in the thermal stability of the enzyme. Under the experimental conditions used, autothiophosphorylation should occur only at Thr(24Ikeda A. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11582-11588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is located in the autoinhibitory domain of the enzyme. Thus, not only the removal of the autoinhibitory domain but also the thiophosphorylation of Thr in the autoinhibitory domain led to a large decrease in the thermal stability of CaM kinase II. Fig. 3 shows protective effects of the two synthetic peptide substrates, syntide-2 and autocamtide-2, on the inactivation of the active 30-kDa fragment and the autothiophosphorylated enzyme. Although both peptides have so far been commonly used as substrate for CaM kinase II, there are marked differences in their structural designs; syntide-2 was designed after the sequence of the phosphorylation site of glycogen synthase(33Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and autocamtide-2 was modeled after the sequence of the autophosphorylation site (Thr) in the autoinhibitory domain of CaM kinase II (34Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The addition of 1 μM and 5 μM autocamtide-2 markedly stabilized the 30-kDa fragment (Fig. 3A) and the autothiophosphorylated enzyme (Fig. 3B), respectively. In contrast, syntide-2, even at 0.3 mM, only slightly stabilized the 30-kDa fragment and did not stabilize the autothiophosphorylated enzyme at all. These results suggest that the autoinhibitory domain of CaM kinase II stabilizes the enzyme. In order to confirm the involvement of the autoinhibitory domain in stabilizing the enzyme, effects of various compounds, including CaMK-(281-309), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequences of the regulatory domain of the enzyme, and several ordinary substrates such as MAP2, myosin light chain, syntide-2, and synapsin I site 3 peptide, on the thermal stabilities of the 30-kDa fragment and the autothiophosphorylated enzyme were studied, as summarized in Table 1. Among a number of compounds tested, CaMK-(281-309) and autocamtide-2 were most effective in stabilizing both the 30-kDa fragment and the autothiophosphorylated enzyme. ATP/Mg was also highly effective in stabilizing the 30-kDa fragment, but its stabilizing effect on the autothiophosphorylated enzyme could not be examined, because the reaction was carried out in the presence of 6 mM EDTA to prevent further autothiophosphorylation. CaMK-(281-289), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the short segment of the sequence around the autophosphorylation site, also significantly stabilized the enzyme. In contrast to CaMK-(281-309) and autocamtide-2, ordinary exogenous substrates for the enzyme, such as MAP2, myosin light chain, syntide-2, and synapsin I site 3 peptide, showed no or little, if any, effect on stabilizing the enzyme.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab In order to estimate affinities of CaMK-(281-309) and autocamtide-2 for the 30-kDa fragment, the effect of varying their concentrations on the thermal stability of the fragment was examined as shown in Fig. 4. Under our experimental conditions, the concentration of the 30-kDa fragment required for accurate determination of the remaining activity was at least 85 nM. Both CaMK-(281-309) and autocamtide-2 almost completely protected 85 nM enzyme against inactivation at concentrations as low as about 100 nM, indicating that the two peptides have very high affinities for the enzyme. The observation that synthetic peptide substrates designed after the sequence around the autophosphorylation site in the autoinhibitory domain of CaM kinase II, such as autocamtide-2, CaMK-(281-309), and CaMK-(281-289), stabilized both the 30-kDa fragment and the autothiophosphorylated enzyme, but that ordinary exogenous substrates, such as syntide-2, MAP2, myosin light chain, and synapsin I site 3 peptide did not, led us to the notion that the binding site for the autophosphorylation site in the autoinhibitory domain (the endogenous substrate) is distinct from that for ordinary exogenous substrates. In order to prove this hypothesis, a kinetic analysis of the activity of the active 30-kDa fragment was carried out using a novel synthetic peptide inhibitor, AIP (KKALRRQEAVDAL), which was made by the substitution of Ala for Thr9 of autocamtide-2 (KKALRRQETVDAL), as shown in Fig. 5. As expected, AIP was a potent inhibitor of the 30-kDa fragment of the enzyme with a Ki value of about 2-8 nM, the inhibition being competitive with respect to autocamtide-2 (Fig. 5B) and CaMK-(281-289) (Fig. 5C) and noncompetitive with respect to syntide-2 (Fig. 5A) and ATP (Fig. 5D). Thus, the binding site for AIP may be the same as those for autocamtide-2 and CaMK-(281-289) and distinct from those for syntide-2 and ATP. Kinetic studies of the inhibition of the activity of the 30-kDa fragment by CaMK-(281-309), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the regulatory domain of the enzyme, indicated that CaMK-(281-309), in contrast with AIP, inhibited the enzyme, competitively with respect to both autocamtide-2 and ATP but noncompetitively with respect to syntide-2, as shown in Fig. 6, in agreement with earlier observations (49Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M. Fong Y -L. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4800-4804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that CaMK-(281-309) inhibits a Ca/calmodulin-independent form of CaM kinase II, the inhibition being noncompetitive with respect to peptide substrate (syntide-2) but competitive with respect to ATP. The apparent Ki values for CaMK-(281-309) were estimated from the results of Fig. 6 to be 166 nM for the competitive inhibition with respect to autocamtide-2 (Km = 0.4 μM), 19 nM for the competitive inhibition with respect to ATP (Km = 30 μM), and 20 nM for the noncompetitive inhibition with respect to syntide-2 (Km = 8.5 μM), respectively. Thus, CaMK-(281-309), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain, interacts with the substrate-binding site for the autophosphorylation site (Thr) as well as ATP-binding site.Figure 6:Kinetic analyses of the inhibition of the 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II by CaMK-(281-309). The activity of the 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II was measured at varying concentrations of the indicated substrates at four or five different fixed concentrations of CaMK-(281-309), and the data were plotted as a double-reciprocal plot. A, assayed at varying concentrations of syntide-2 in the presence of 0 (•), 0.05 (○), 0.1 (), and 0.2 μM () of CaMK-(281-309). B, assayed at varying concentrations of autocamtide-2 in the presence of 0 (•), 0.1 (○), 0.2 (), 0.3 (), and 0.5 μM (□) of CaMK-(281-309). C, assayed at varying concentrations of ATP in the presence of 0 (•), 0.05 (○), 0.1 (), 0.2 (), and 0.3 μM (□) of CaMK-(281-309), using syntide-2 (200 μM) as a peptide substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further experimental support for our contention was provided by fluorescence analysis of the binding of NBD-AIP to the 30-kDa fragment. Fig. 7 shows the emission spectra of NBD-AIP at an excitation wavelength of 472 nm before and after the addition of the 30-kDa fragment. Both spectra showed maxima at 521.6 nm, but the addition of the 30-kDa fragment caused a significant decrease in the fluorescence, while bovine serum albumin caused no fluorescence change (data not shown), indicating the specific interaction of the fragment with NBD-AIP. Effects of various substrates on the interaction between NBD-AIP and the fragment were examined by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence intensity at 521.6 nm at an excitation wavelength of 472 nm, as summarized in Table 2. The addition of micromolar concentrations of autocamtide-2 and CaMK-(281-309) completely blocked the quenching of the NBD-AIP fluorescence induced by the binding of the 30-kDa fragment, whereas syntide-2, synapsin I site 3 peptide, and ATP/Mg did not significantly affect the quenching even at millimolar concentrations, suggesting that autocamtide-2 and CaMK-(281-309) competed with NBD-AIP for binding to the 30-kDa fragment but the other substrates did not, in good agreement with the results of the kinetic analyses as shown in Fig. 5 and 6.Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Since our experimental results so far described indicate that the binding site of CaM kinase II for the autophosphorylation site (Thr) in the autoinhibitory domain is distinct from that for the ordinary exogenous substrate, it would be expected that autocamtide-2 is a more potent inhibitor for the autothiophosphorylation than is syntide-2. As shown in Fig. 8, the autothiophosphorylation, which should occur only at Thr under the experimental conditions used(24Ikeda A. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11582-11588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was markedly inhibited by as little as 9 μM autocamtide-2, but such a marked inhibition was not observed with as much as 0.3 mM syntide-2. The Km values of the native CaM kinase II for autocamtide-2 and syntide-2 were estimated to be 2.3 and 7.7 μM, respectively (data not shown). These results also support for the contention that the binding site of CaM kinase II for the autophosphorylation site (Thr) is distinct from the ordinary substrate-binding site. Previous reports from our own and other laboratories(26Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Kuret J. Schulman H. J.

Cell. 1986; 44: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) demonstrated that autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II, presumably occurring at multiple sites of the enzyme, causes a progressive decrease in the enzyme activity, and thereafter Lai et al.(29Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) suggested that the inactivation is due to a decrease in the thermal stability of the autophosphorylated enzyme. More recently, Colbran (30Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7163-7170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that autophosphorylation at Thr, gradually occurring in the absence of Ca/calmodulin, results in inactivation of the enzyme. In the present paper, we show that autothiophosphorylation at Thr, which is involved in the activation of the enzyme(18Kwiatkowski A.P. Shell D.J. King M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11582-11588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused a marked decrease in the thermal stability. The active 30-kDa chymotryptic fragment of CaM kinase II(31Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Yamagata Y. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15391-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), devoid of the autoinhibitory domain containing the calmodulin-binding and inhibitory domains and also the autophosphorylation site of Thr, was also very labile (Fig. 1). The thermal inactivation of the two labile CaM kinase II preparations, the autothiophosphorylated enzyme and the 30-kDa fragment, was prevented by autocamtide-2 and CaMK-(281-289), synthetic peptides modeled after the sequence around the autophosphorylation site of Thr, and CaMK-(281-309), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the autoinhibitory domain, but it was not prevented by ordinary protein and peptide substrates such as MAP2, myosin light chain, syntide-2, and synapsin I site 3 peptide, while it was also prevented by ATP/Mg (Fig. 3 and 4, and Table 1). These results, taken together with the general contention that the autoinhibitory domain of CaM kinase II suppresses the enzyme activity by interaction with the catalytic site(50Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1823-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that the autophosphorylation site located in the autoinhibitory domain not only inhibits the enzyme activity but also stabilizes the enzyme by interacting with the second substrate-binding site specific for the autophosphorylation site, which is distinct from the substrate-binding site for ordinary exogenous substrates such as MAP2, myosin light chain, syntide-2, and so on. The possibility of the existence of the two distinct substrate-binding sites in the catalytic site of CaM kinase II, one for ordinary exogenous protein and peptide substrates and the other for the endogenous substrate, the autophosphorylation site (Thr), has been suggested from our previous observation (31Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the inactivation of CaM kinase II by Ca/calmodulin is prevented by autocamtide-2 but not by syntide-2 or MAP2. In the present study, this was confirmed by the kinetic data that the inhibitions of the enzyme by AIP and CaMK-(281-309), respectively, were competitive with respect to autocamtide-2 but noncompetitive with respect to syntide-2 (Fig. 5 and 6), and was further confirmed by the fluorescence analysis that the quenching of NBD-AIP induced by the 30-kDa fragment of CaM kinase II was completely blocked by autocamtide-2 or CaMK-(281-309) but was not affected by syntide-2 or synapsin I site 3 peptide at all (Table 2). This was also suggested by the fact that autocamtide-2 inhibited the autothiophosphorylation of Thr much more strongly than did syntide-2 (Fig. 8). The Km value for autocamtide-2 was reduced from 2.3 μM to 0.4 μM by truncation of the autoinhibitory domain, whereas the Km for syntide-2 was not changed significantly. This observation might be explained by two different substrate-binding sites; the binding of autocamtide-2 to its binding site is inhibited by the autoinhibitory domain in the native enzyme, but the binding of syntide-2 to its binding site is not inhibited. Of particular interest is a novel synthetic peptide inhibitor, AIP (KKALRRQEAVDAL), which was made by the substitution of Ala for the phosphorylation site of autocamtide-2 (KKALRRQETVDAL), Thr9. This peptide was a potent inhibitor with a Ki value as low as 2-8 nM for the 30-kDa fragment of the enzyme. The kinetic data of the inhibition by AIP (Fig. 5) and the results of fluorescence analysis with NBD-AIP (Table 2), together with the results that autocamtide-2 inhibited the autothiophosphorylation of Thr more strongly than did syntide-2 (Fig. 8), indicated that AIP may bind to the substrate-binding site for the autophosphorylation site (Thr) but not bind to the substrate-binding site for the ordinary exogenous substrates, thereby inhibiting the enzyme activity. Thus, AIP will be a useful tool for studying the regulatory mechanism of CaM kinase II through the autophosphorylation of Thr in the autoinhibitory domain of the enzyme. It will be also interesting to examine the question of whether AIP is a specific inhibitor for CaM kinase II, because no real specific inhibitor for CaM kinase II has so far been reported(51Hvalby Ø. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Paulsen O. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Godfraind J.-M. Jensen V. Raastad M. Storm J.F. Andersen P. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The specificity and the detailed mechanism for the inhibition by AIP are under investigation in this laboratory. In contrast to AIP, CaMK-(281-309), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the autoinhibitory domain containing the autophosphorylation site and calmodulin-binding site, inhibited the enzyme activity in a competitive manner with respect not only to autocamtide-2 but also to ATP, while it inhibited the enzyme in a noncompetitive manner with respect to syntide-2 (Fig. 6), suggesting that the autoinhibitory domain of the enzyme may interact with both the substrate-binding site for the autophosphorylation site (Thr) and the ATP-binding site. Pears et al.(52Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) found that deletion of the pseudosubstrate sequence of protein kinase C made it so unstable that it was not possible to purify the recombinant enzyme. More recently, Faux et al.(32Faux M.C. Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12484-12491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the pseudosubstrate sequence of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase plays an important role in stabilizing the enzyme, and they predicted that other enzymes regulated by pseudosubstrate mechanism may also utilize the pseudosubstrate sequence to stabilize the structure. Here we show that CaM kinase II was also stabilized by a similar mechanism, utilizing the autophosphorylation site, the endogenous substrate, instead of the endogenous pseudosubstrate sequence. Knighton et al.(53Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have proposed a model for the regulatory mechanism of myosin light chain kinase by the pseudosubstrate sequence that the pseudosubstrate sequence occupies the substrate binding site. However, the results that substrate peptides, such as MLC-(1-23) and MLC-(11-23)A, can protect the enzyme from thermal inactivation but their potency is not as great as that of the pseudosubstrate sequence (32Faux M.C. Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12484-12491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may reflect the existence of the endogenous pseudosubstrate-binding site different from the ordinary substrate-binding site.

These observations indicate that heparin is an important cofactor in the prochymase activation process and explain how dipeptidylpeptidase I, a nonspecific processing enzyme, can effect a specific cleavage of the zymogen propeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1976991333,"Microwave propagation experiments performed with Voyager 2 at Neptune revealed sharp layers of electrons in Neptune's lower ionosphere with densities of ∼104 per cubic centimeter. These layers are reminiscent of the sporadic-E layers in the Earth's ionosphere, and when taken together with data from the other giant planets, these data confirm the importance of the magnetic field in layer formation. A photochemical model that incorporates species produced by meteoroid ablation predicts that singly ionized magnesium is the most likely metal to be found in the layers, although laboratory data on the kinetics of metallic atoms and ions in a reducing environment are lacking. The metal chemistry discussed here is directly relevant to the abundant metals observed at the impact site of the G fragment of comet Shoemaker Levy 9 on Jupiter."

The cells were also cross-resistant to the highly specific nucleoside analog inhibitor of AdoMetDC, MDL-73811. These unique cells stably overexpress AdoMetDC due to a 10-16-fold amplification of the AdoMetDC gene, which resulted in a similar increase in AdoMetDC transcript levels. In the presence of 100 μM CGP-48664, the CHO/664 cells displayed AdoMetDC activities similar to the parental line. Following removal of the inhibitor, AdoMetDC activity increased steadily over 20 days to 10-12 times that found in parental CHO cells. Decarboxylated (dc) AdoMet pools accumulated rapidly from <5 pmol/106 cells to 1000-1500 pmol/106 cells at 3 days due to diffusion away of intracellular inhibitor and to the depletion of putrescine and spermidine as aminopropyl acceptors in dcAdoMet-mediated synthase reactions. Polyamine pools shifted as putrescine, and spermidine pools were processed forward to spermine. During the period from 3 days to 20 days, dcAdoMet pools fell steadily and eventually stabilized at 100-200 pmol/106 cells. Providing excess putrescine at this time as an aminopropyl acceptor rapidly lowered dcAdoMet pools and led to a near normalization of polyamine pools, indicating that both dcAdoMet and putrescine are essential in maintaining steady-state polyamine pool profiles. As with cell line variants that overproduce ornithine decarboxylase, polyamine transport was found to be increased in CHO/664 cells due to an apparent inability of the system to down-regulate polyamine transport in response to polyamine excess. Given the unique metabolic disturbances seen in these cells, we anticipate that in addition to providing a useful system for evaluating the specificity of newly developed AdoMetDC inhibitors, they will undoubtedly prove valuable for investigating the various regulatory interrelationships involved in polyamine homeostasis and possibly other aspects of purine metabolism.

Recombinant mutants of LCa, with deletions spanning the entire sequence, were tested for binding to calmodulin-Sepharose. Those mutants retaining structural integrity, as assessed by the binding of a panel of monoclonal antibodies, exhibited varying amounts of calmodulin binding activity. However, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 20 residues abolished calmodulin interaction. Thus, the carboxyl terminus of LCa appears to constitute a calmodulin-binding site.

Three classes of deletions were obtained: those affecting bidirectional transcription, those predominantly affecting GPAT transcription, and those predominantly affecting AIRC transcription. Defects in bidirectional transcription resulted from removal of an initiator-like element overlapping the AIRC transcription start site, as well as deletions removing a series of GC and CCAAT boxes from the AIRC proximal half of the promoter and a CCAAT-containing segment from the GPAT side. Several regions in the GPAT proximal half of the promoter, including an octamer-like motif downstream from the transcription start site, were required predominantly for GPAT expression. Evidence for interaction of HeLa nuclear proteins with some of these sites was obtained by gel retardation, DNase I, and methylation interference assays.

It is not clear how these model proteins are degraded and there is no indication that such aggregated proteins are substrates of the pre-Golgi degradative pathway. In contrast, subunits of multimeric proteins which remain unassembled appear to be handled differently(29Leavitt R. Schlesinger S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

The unassembled subunits, though retained in the ER, are usually not found in highly aggregated states and they retain the capability of assembling into multimers for long periods of time (29Leavitt R.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In general, unassembled subunits appear to interact with BiP, but these interactions are less avid and more reversible than BiP interactions with highly aggregated proteins(28Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The pre-Golgi degradative pathway is thought to degrade proteins which are misfolded, but it is unclear how unfolded proteins are recognized and once recognized, selectively sorted for disposal. It has been suggested that the ER chaperones such as BiP may play a role in the determining a protein's fate toward native conformation(16Kim P.S. Bole D. Arvan P. J.

Although much progress has been made in understanding the functions of the ER resident chaperones, the potential role of ER resident chaperones in either identifying or targeting misfolded proteins for degradation has not been fully explored. Here we have examined the possible role of one ER stress protein, BiP, in determining the fate of DRβ chains destined for degradation. We find that BiP initially interacts transiently with DRβ chains shortly after their synthesis but at a time when no DRβ degradation takes place, suggesting that binding of BiP to DRβ chains per se does not target them for degradation. However, at later times, multiple copies of BiP bind to DRβ monomers, resulting in the formation of tightly associated high molecular weight oligomers. The aggregation of DRβ chains into high molecular weight BiP•DRβ complexes suggests a means by which DRβ chains are segregated within the ER and targeted for degradation. The monoclonal antibodies used were W6/32, specific for HLA class I dimers(37Barnstable C. Bodmer W.F. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams C.F. Ziegler A.

Antibodies were centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 5 min after thawing to remove aggregated or denatured immunoglobulin that potentially would bind BiP. 9.22.3 is a B cell line with a homozygous deletion of DRA but which synthesizes normal levels of DR3β mRNA and β chains(40Pious D.

SC-JB is a DR3 homozygous cell which expresses twice the level of DR3 as the 9.22.3 progenitor 8.1.6 and was therefore used to examine the role of BiP in DR assembly(41Cotner T. Charbonneau H. Mellins E. Pious D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11107-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments were performed (12Cotner T. J.

Cells (107/ml) were labeled for 10-20 min in methionine RPMI 1640 containing 1 mCi/ml [S]methionine and then diluted to a cell concentration of 2 × 106/ml into RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 mM methionine. Cells were harvested at the times indicated and processed as below. Steady-state labeling conditions were carried out for 4 days in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2 mCi/ml [S]methionine using an initial concentration of 0.8 × 106 cells/ml. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitations were carried out as previously described(12Cotner T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2163-2168PubMed Google Scholar, 42Cotner T. Mashimo H. Kung P.C. Goldstein G. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the immune complexes were captured on protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed in buffers without EDTA(42Cotner T. Mashimo H. Kung P.C. Goldstein G. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the material was electrophoresed on 10 or 12% gels, fixed, placed in Amplify (Amersham Corp.), dried, and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film. Computer densitometric analysis of gels was performed with a whole band analyzer (BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI). In some cases, quantitation of fixed and dried gels was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using the ImageQuant software program. The following pre-stained molecular mass markers were used: phosphorylase B (106 kDa), bovine serum albumin (80 kDa), ovalbumin (49.5 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (32.5 kDa), soybean trypsin (28.5 kDa), and lysozyme (18.5 kDa), all from Bio-Rad. Detergent-soluble extracts of both unlabeled or S-labeled proteins were analyzed on 5-30% sucrose gradients. Samples containing 100 μl of extract (20-40 × 106 unlabeled cells or 4 × 106 labeled cells) were overlaid on a 4.6-ml 5-30% sucrose gradient containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 47,000 rpm in a SW 50.1 rotor for 16 h at 4°C. Nineteen fractions (0.25 ml) were collected from the bottom, and labeled extracts were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The following marker proteins (20-100 μg) were centrifuged in parallel, and the resulting fractions were analyzed by Coomassie staining of SDS gels: cytochrome c (1.83 S), bovine serum albumin (4.5 S), rabbit muscle aldolase (7.35 S), catalase (11.3 S), and α2-macroglobulin (20 S), all from Sigma. To investigate whether the ER resident protein BiP plays a role in determining the fate of DRβ chains, the DRα-deficient 9.22.3 cell line was metabolically labeled for 3 h with [S]methionine and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to either DRβ or to BiP. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The anti-DRβ monoclonal antibody, in addition to precipitating the DRβ monomer, also coprecipitated the Ii chain (Mr 31,000) and a strong band of Mr 78,000 with a mobility identical to that of BiP (Fig. 1). With long labeling periods, DRβ migrates as two bands (29,000 and 27,500, hereafter referred to as p29 and p27), corresponding in size to the two forms of DRβ found in 9.22.3 cells(12Cotner T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2163-2168PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated, using pulse-chase analysis, that a precursor-product relationship existed between the 29,000 and 27,000 forms of DRβ(11Forsayeth J.R. Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 27,000 form appeared to be generated from the 29,000 form by the action of one or more endogenous glycosidases, since endoglycosidase H treatment completely converted both forms to a single, 26,000-27,000 band (see Fig. 1A, Fig. 2, and Fig. 5 of (11Forsayeth J.R. Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In short labeling periods, only p29 is evident, whereas p27 is quite prominent with the long labeling period employed in Fig. 1. The p27 form of DRβ probably reflects the age of the molecule and may not be a necessary intermediate of pre-Golgi degradation. Importantly, analysis of anti-BiP immunoprecipitates revealed that the p27 form of DRβ was more prominently coprecipitated by anti-BiP antibody than p29. This suggests BiP either preferentially binds to or is more stably associated with the smaller, more mature form of DRβ.Figure 2:BiP binding to DRβ is biphasic. 9.22.3 cells were pulsed with [S]methionine for short periods (A) or longer periods (B) and chased for the times indicated. Cells were pulsed for 8 or 10 min in (A) or for 20 min in (B). Samples were immunoprecipitated with HB10.A and the BiP and DRβ regions of the gel were quantitated by PhosphorImager-based analysis. The BiP/DRβ ratios, uncorrected for methionine content, were normalized to the BiP/DRβ ratios found at 0 chase time. The initial decline in BiP/DRβ ratio was seen in five of five experiments and the extent of decline appeared to relate to the length of the pulse. It is likely that with the longer pulse time shown in B, the secondary increase of BiP binding tends to mask the initial decline in BiP/DRβ ratio.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5:Size distribution of DRβ complexes in wild type cells. 8.1.6 cells (8 × 106) were pulsed for 15 min (Panel A) or pulsed and chased for 2 h (Panel B) and analyzed in sucrose gradients by immunoprecipitation with HB10.A as in Fig. 3. In A, note that not much assembly of DR dimers has occurred during the pulse. In A, Ii is the most prominent band, followed by DRβ, with small amounts of DRα seen only in fractions 8-11. Quantitation of DRβ is shown in C. Note that the average size DRβ complex in wild type cells becomes smaller with time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The coprecipitation of BiP by anti-DRβ antibody does not appear to be simply the gratuitous interaction with an abundant ER protein. Evidence that the interaction was not gratuitous was that binding exhibited both a high degree of specificity and was strong. No BiP was immunoprecipitated with normal mouse IgG (lane 7), indicating that coprecipitation of BiP with anti-DR antibody was not due to the well known ability of BiP to bind to free or partially denatured immunoglobulin heavy chains(16Kim P.S. Bole D. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, BiP was not detected in immunoprecipitates using antibodies to fully assembled DR dimers from wild type cells (lane 8). Trace amounts of BiP, constituting some 4% of that seen in anti-DRβ immunoprecipitates, was coprecipitated from 9.22.3 cells with antibodies to MHC class I molecules (lanes 5 and 6). The coprecipitation of BiP by anti-DRβ antibodies was quite strong; it did not require the use of chemical cross-linkers, and BiP•DRβ complexes were resistant to stringent wash conditions of either 0.5 M LiCl or 0.65 M NaCl (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). DRβ was a prominent band in the anti-BiP immunoprecipitate, comprising 6% of the total non-BiP material. This value seems unexpectedly high, given that DRβ chains make up only 0.1% of the total mRNA and protein in wild type B cell lines(41Cotner T. Charbonneau H. Mellins E. Pious D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11107-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus DRβ chains, when they exist as monomers, are more likely to bind to or interact more stably with BiP than the average membrane protein. The corollary of this is that some membrane proteins would be expected either not to interact with BiP or to interact only very transiently. In support of this, neither proteins the size of Ii or MHC class I were evident in anti-BiP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4). An estimate by another method, quantitative Western blotting, of the BiP found in anti-DRβ immunoprecipitates compared to the BiP found in the starting cellular extract indicated that, under steady state conditions, 3% of the total BiP was complexed with DRβ monomers in DRα-deficient cells (data not shown). Preliminary experiments indicated that BiP association with DRβ monomers was biphasic. BiP binding to DRβ appeared to peak during the pulse, followed by a decline at early chase times (Fig. 2A). This was followed by a secondary 2.3-4 fold increase in the BiP/DRβ ratio over the next 45-120 min. The initial decline in BiP associated with DRβ was most pronounced during short pulses (Fig. 2A). With longer pulse times, the initial decline in BiP associated with DRβ was not as evident, probably because the longer pulse time encompassed the time the secondary wave of BiP binding occurred (Fig. 2B). The secondary increase in BiP binding to DRβ was only noted in DRα deficient 9.22.3 cells; it was not seen in wild type cells, suggesting that only those DRβ monomers destined for degradation become increasingly complexed with BiP. The detection of a secondary increase in DRβ-BiP complexes after 10-20 min of DRβ synthesis suggested that the ratio of BiP to DRβ might be increasing during this time. Therefore we measured the ratio of DRβ to BiP as a function of time following DRβ synthesis in DRα-deficient 9.22.3 cells. The BiP to DRβ ratio was measured at three different times: during a 10-min pulse, at 3 h when DRβ but not BiP is labeled to equilibrium, and at 48 h, a time when the labeling of BiP approached equilibrium. 2T. Cotner, unpublished results. The amounts of DRβ and BiP coprecipitated by anti-BiP and anti-DRβ, respectively, were quantitated by densitometry and corrected for the relative methionine content of the two proteins as previously described(15Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The BiP to DRβ ratio went from 0.2 after a 10-min pulse, to 0.9 after 3 h and increased to an average (in three experiments) of 2.2 at 48 h. These data indicate that, at equilibrium in the absence of DRα chains, the average DRβ molecule is in a complex with about 2 BiP molecules. The intensity of the BiP band coprecipitated by anti-DRβ antibody probably significantly underestimates the stoichiometry of the DRβ•BiP complex for short labeling periods because it does not account for the large amount of unlabeled BiP present in the anti-DRβ immunoprecipitate. The kinetics of BiP binding to DRβ in DRα deficient cells and a BiP/qDRβ ratio of about 2 at steady state suggested that, in the absence of DRα chains, DRβ monomers increasingly enter into a complex with BiP. The fact that the initial association/dissociation of BiP with DRβ chains appears equivalent in DRα deficient and wild type cells at very early times suggests that some other signal must be employed to target misfolded or incompletely folded DRβ chains for degradation. One possibility is that DRβ chains undergo a change of state. An abrupt change of state would result if DRβ chain became aggregated. To examine this possibility, we compared the aggregation state of DRβ chains from 9.22.3 cells which were either pulsed briefly or pulsed and chased for either 1 or 2 h. Extracts were prepared and centrifuged on 5-30% linear sucrose gradients and then analyzed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to DRβ chains or, as an internal control, antibodies to MHC class I. During the pulse, DRβ chains from 9.22.3 sedimented heterogeneously with an average complex of 5-6 S, with only 25% larger than 7S (Fig. 3; see Table 2). Very little DRβ sedimented in monomeric form (<4 S) in any experiments and only 13% of DRβ sedimented at 10 S or greater (Fig. 3A; see Table 2). By 1 h, the percentage of DRβ complexes sedimenting faster than 10 S had increased from 13 to 28% and by 2 h over 40% of DRβ sedimented faster than 10 S (Figure 3:, Figure 4:; Table 1). One possibility to explain the kinetics of formation of 10 S DRβ complexes is that DRβ chains enter into the 10 S complex soon after synthesis but that the initial complex is labile and that partial dissociation of the complexes occurs during the time of the sucrose gradient, causing it to sediment as a 5-6 S complex. To determine if DRβ entered into a"

It has been shown that transcription of linear templates generates apparent run-off RNAs, which are nevertheless truncated upon incubation with SII. By using high resolution gels, we demonstrate that transcription of blunt or 3′-overhung templates with RNA polymerase II generates two populations of ternary complexes. The first class pauses 5-10 bases prior to the end of the template strand. These complexes respond to SII by cleaving approximately 9-17 nucleotide RNAs from their 3′-ends and therefore may be termed arrested. A second class of complexes, which fail to respond to SII, transcribe to within 3 bases of the end of the template strand. These complexes appear to have run off the template since they have released their nascent RNAs. Run-off transcription occurs on all types of templates, but it is the predominant reaction on DNAs with 5′-overhung ends. Thus, RNA polymerase II ternary complexes that retain 5-10 bases of contact with the template strand downstream of the catalytic site become arrested. Further reduction of downstream template contacts can lead to termination. We also show that the addition of Sarkosyl to the elongation reactions significantly changes the pattern of transcriptional arrest near the end of linear templates."

GM-CSF interacts with specific high affinity cell surface receptors (GM-Rαβ, K 5 × 10M) that are complexes containing at least two subunits, both of which are members of the cytokine receptor superfamily(3Bazan J.F.

The receptor α chain (GM-Rα) binds GM-CSF specifically with low affinity (K 3 × 10M), whereas the receptor β chain (GM-Rβ), common to the receptors for GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5, does not bind this protein detectably by itself, but confers high affinity binding when co-expressed with GM-Rα(4Hayashida K.

These studies suggest the functional importance of the first and fourth helix of GM-CSF; in particular, the N-terminal helix of mGM-CSF interacts directly with mGM-Rβ in the context of mGM-Rαβ to form the high affinity ligand-receptor complex(15Shanafelt A.B. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Kastelein R.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region identified Glu as essential for this interaction in both mouse and human GM-CSF(16Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol.

Although substitution of Glu with alanine in mGM-CSF results in a loss of high affinity binding, biological activity remains essentially intact. The biological activity of hGM-CSF Glu substitution proteins is reduced, and a basic side chain at this position causes the most severe defect(18Lopez A.F. Shannon M.F. Hercus T. Nicola N.A. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Layton M.J. Eglinton L. Vadas M.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).In this report we examine further the biological and receptor binding properties of mGM-CSF mutant proteins with substitutions at residues in the first helix of mGM-CSF. We show that all Glu substitution proteins display only low affinity binding, but that the biological activity depends on the nature of the substituted side chain. Substitutions at several other examined residues lead to a loss in either high or low affinity binding. We also show that this knowledge can be used to design mGM-CSF derivatives with antagonistic properties.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Host Strains, Cell Lines, and VectorsThe Escherichia coli K12 strains XL-1 (Stratagene) and JM101 (22Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar) were used as host strains for the propagation and maintenance of plasmid and M13 DNA. Strain CJ236 (23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar) was used to prepare uracil-DNA for use in site-directed mutagenesis procedures. M13mp19 containing the ompA leader sequence and the entire mGM-CSF gene was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis(24Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Strain AB1899 (25Howard-Flanders P. Simson E. Theriot L. Genetics. 1964; 49: 237-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the host for expression of mutant GM-CSF proteins. The plasmid pINIIIompA2 (26Lundell D. Greenberg R. Alroy Y. Condon R.

The use of this secretory E. coli system to express biologically active, mature GM-CSF has been described elsewhere (27Greenberg R. Lundell D. Alroy Y. Bonitz S. Condon R. Fossetta J.D. Frommer B.

A mouse GM-CSF-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line, NFS60, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence of mGM-CSF (1 ng/ml) (Schering-Plough).Construction of mGM-Rα Expression Plasmid and Transfection to Mouse L-cellsThe mouse GM-Rα clone 71 cDNA (6Park L.S.

Park, Immunex) was inserted downstream of the SRα promoter in the expression vector pME18-Neo, a neomycin-resistant derivative of the vector pCEV4 (28Itoh N. Yonehara S. Schreurs J. Gorman D.M.

Mouse L-cells washed with 20 mM HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.1) were resuspended at 107 cells/ml, and 50 μg of linearized plasmid DNA was added to 0.8 ml of cell suspension in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 960 microfarads and 400 V. Transfectants were selected with G418 (1.5 mg/ml) (Schering-Plough) and cells expressing mGM-Rα were confirmed by their ability to bind I-mGM-CSF.Mutagenesis, Recombinant DNA, and Sequencing ProtocolsSite-directed mutagenesis was performed using the method described by Kunkel et al.(23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides, 21 nucleotides in length, corresponding to mGM-CSF sequences incorporating the desired amino acid substitution were used as primers in the mutagenesis reactions. Individual clones were sequenced using the method and modifications described in the Sequenase (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) protocol(29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52338) Google Scholar). M13 (replicative form) DNA containing confirmed mutations was digested with XbaI and BamHI and subcloned into pINIIIompA2.Preparation and Quantitation of Protein SamplesExpression and quantitation of mutant proteins has been described previously(24Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli AB1899 and periplasmic extracts were generated by osmotic shock. The concentration of mutant protein in the periplasmic extracts was determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis. Extracts were titrated along with a standard curve of purified E. coli derived recombinant GM-CSF. Either hybridoma mg 1.8.2 (30Miyajima A. Otsu K. Schreurs J. Bond M.W. Abrams J.S. Arai K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or 22E9 (31Abrams J.S. Roncarolo M-G. Yssel H. Andersson U. Gleich G.J. Silver J.E. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 5-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were used as primary antibody, and the secondary antibody was I-labeled sheep anti-rat IgG (Amersham Corp.). The amount of immunoreactive protein was quantified by integrating the area × density from an exposed screen using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The error in the calculated concentrations of GM-CSF mutant proteins by this method did not exceed 2-fold based on repetitive analysis of individual samples.Biological Assays for GM-CSF ActivityProtein extracts were assayed for their ability to stimulate the proliferation of the mouse GM-CSF- dependent cell line NFS60. Samples were titrated in quadruplicate using serial 3-fold dilutions. The 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) assay (32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45437) Google Scholar) was used to measure the extent of proliferation, and the absorbance value difference of 570-650 nm was measured with a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of each mutant and wild-type mGM-CSF protein that gave 50% maximal response was determined using the Softmax program (Molecular Devices). The correlation coefficient of the 4-parameter curve fit to the measured values exceeded 0.990 for all curves presented. Protein extracts were assayed for their ability to antagonize the GM-CSF proliferative response of NFS60 cells. Samples were titrated in quadruplicate using serial 3-fold dilutions in the presence of 3.5 × 10M mGM-CSF using the MTT assay format.Competitive Receptor Binding Assays of Mutant GM-CSF ProteinsMouse GM-CSF was labeled with I using the Bolton and Hunter reagent (Amersham; specific activity 400 mCi/mmol) to a specific activity of 20-40 μCi/μg as described previously(16Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25466-25472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competition binding assays were performed as follows: NFS60 cells maintained in media containing mGM-CSF were harvested, washed, and incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mM NaPO4, 150 mM NaCl (pH 3.0) for 2 min then diluted to 50 ml with 10 mM NaPO4, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.0). Following centrifugation the cells were resuspended in 1 × Hanks' balanced salts solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) (HBAH buffer). 2.5 × 106 cells in 200 μl of HBAH buffer were incubated with decreasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor in the presence of 3.0 × 10MI-mGM-CSF at 4°C with continuous agitation for 4 h. Samples were titered in triplicate using serial 3-fold dilutions. Nonspecific binding was determined from the data collected for the competition of unlabeled wild-type mGM-CSF. Cell-bound radioactivity was separated from free ligand by centrifugation at 4°C (2 min, 12,000 ×g) through dioctylphthalate/dibutylphthalate (2:3). Bound and total radioactivity was measured with a Cobra 5010 -counter (Packard). Low affinity receptor competition binding assays were performed in a similar manner except 7.5 × 105 mouse L-cells expressing mGM-Rα were incubated with unlabeled competitors in the presence of 2.0 × 10MI-mGM-CSF for 2 h. The equilibrium binding data were analyzed using the Ligand program (33Munson P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Curve fitting for both one- and two-site models were performed on each sample. Curves were either fit using a fixed high and low affinity equilibrium binding constants (K; 5.0×10M, K; 3.0×10M) or by fitting the control wild-type mGM-CSF and the mutant protein competition curve simultaneously. Binding curves are presented as the concentration of competitor versus the specific counts/minute bound as a percentage of total bound. Analysis of the binding data for Lyssubstitutions exposed a limitation of the Ligand software. Substitutions for Lysshowed a range of defects in high affinity binding. For substitutions resulting in small changes a two site model with reliable high and low affinity Kvalues was statistically significant. For substitutions with reduced high affinity binding approaching that of the low affinity, the Ligand program was unable to discriminate a two-site model. This is reflected in the unreliable binding constants with small F and large p (>0.05) values as well as high affinity Kvalues with values higher than would be expected from examination of the binding curves (Table 1). We presume that this is the result of combining both high and low affinity values into a single binding constant. Only by measuring the affinity of Lyssubstitution proteins for the low affinity receptor alone (mGM-Rα) were we able to asign binding defects of Lysmutant proteins to the mGM-Rβ(Table 4).Table 1 Open table in a new tab Table 4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Mouse GM-CSF Molecular ModelingThe coordinates for hGM-CSF were kindly provided by Dr. A. Karplus (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The mouse GM-CSF Cα backbone conformation was modeled using SegMod (34Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) followed by refinement of side chain conformations using the program CARA (35Lee C. Subbiah S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) within the LOOK suite of programs (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA). The structure was displayed using Insight II software (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA).RESULTSBiological Response of mGM-CSF Mutant ProteinsA panel of amino acid substitutions was generated for selected residues in the first α-helix of mGM-CSF. Based on previous studies (16Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25466-25472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the following residues were targeted: Arg (R11), Lys14 (K14), His (H15), Lys (K20), and Glu (E21). Position Glu, although surface exposed and located between Glu14 and Glu, was not included in this analysis, since all available evidence points to at best a minor involvement of this residue(15Shanafelt A.B. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Kastelein R.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25466-25472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant protein was produced in E. coli and quantitated as described previously(24Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Biological activity was assessed by measuring the proliferative response of the mGM-CSF-dependent myeloid cell line NFS60. Of the four surface-exposed residues (Arg, Lys14, Lys, and Glu), only substitution of Glu significantly altered the biological activity of mGM-CSF (Fig. 1, panel 5A, Table 3). Charge reversal substitutions at this position (E21R and E21K) reduced the biological activity to <1% and reduced the magnitude of the plateau. Several other Glu substitution proteins (Ala, Gly, Ser, and Leu) had lower biological activity (10-30%), although the magnitude of the response was not affected. All other substitutions at these four positions had only a marginal effect on the biological activity (>30%) with the exception of proline substitutions of Lys and Glu. The introduction of proline residues at these positions in the first α-helix reduced the activity of the resulting proteins to less than 1% (Fig. 1, panels 4A and 5A, Table 2, Table 3). The magnitude of the plateau for E21P but not K20P was reduced. Proline substitutions of Arg and Lys14, located just outside and just within the first α-helix, respectively, did not significantly alter the biological activity (Fig. 1, panels 1A and 2A, Table 1).Figure 1:Biological activity and competition binding of wild-type and mutant proteins. A, proliferation of NFS60 cells was measured as a function of protein concentration using the MTT assay(32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45437) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in quadruplicate with symbol error bars indicating standard deviation. Curves were generated using a 4-parameter logistical fit and all correlation coefficients exceeded 0.990. B, competition of I-mGM-CSF on NFS60 cells were performed with a constant concentration of 3.0 × 10MI-mGM-CSF in triplicate with symbol error bars indicating standard deviation. Under these conditions both high and low affinity sites were detected using the Ligand program (33Munson P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Each pair of A and B panels represents multiple amino acid substitutions for a specific residue as indicated Arg (1), Lys14 (2), His (3), Lys (4); and Glu (5). Substitutions are represented by each symbol as follows: •, wild-type; , Gly; , Met; Pro; ○, Ala; □, Leu; , Val; ◬, His; , Phe; ▿., Trp; ., Tyr; ▵, Gln; ▿, Ser; ⬢., Arg; , Glu; ⬢, Lys.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Based on homology to hGM-CSF, His of mGM-CSF appears to occupy a buried position in the first α-helix. This buried position is less tolerant to substitution than the surface exposed residues (with the exception of Glu). Substitution at His with charged or polar residues resulted in a reduced biological activity, whereas hydrophobic or aromatic substitutions are well tolerated (Fig. 1, panel 3A). All His mutants reached full plateau.Competitive Receptor Binding of mGM-CSF Mutant ProteinsThe effects of amino acid substitution on the ability of mGM-CSF to bind to the high affinity mGM-CSF receptor (mGM-Rαβ) on NFS60 cells was measured using conditions designed to detect both high and low affinity binding (see “Materials and Methods”). Some proteins had no loss in high affinity binding, and such mutant proteins were not investigated further. Some proteins had decreased high affinity binding, and the mutant protein was then tested for its ability to bind to the low affinity mGM-CSF receptor (mGM-Rα) on stably transfected L-cells (see “Materials and Methods”). This step was necessary so that the observed reduction in affinity could be assigned to either a loss of binding to the mGM-Rβ component in the mGM-Rαβ complex, to a loss of binding to the mGM-Rα component, or to a loss of binding to both.For most substitution mutants at Arg, Lys14, His, and Lys, a two-site fit of the high affinity receptor binding data was statistically significant (data shown for Lys14 and Lys; Table 1, Table 2). Substitution at Arg with either a negatively charged (R11E) or positively charged (R11K) residue, neutral (R11G), hydrophobic (R11L), or aromatic (R11W) residue had no effect on either high or low affinity binding constants (data not shown). This residue was not studied further.Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Mutant proteins with charged and polar substitutions at position His showed a reduced ability to compete for I-mGM-CSF (Fig. 1, panel 3B), in agreement with the observed loss in biological activity (Fig. 1, panel 3A). Since this is a buried position in the protein, losses in activity and binding are probably due to structural perturbations of the protein core. Proteins mutated at this position were also not studied further.Mutations at position Lys14 did not alter noticeably the biological activity of the resulting mutant protein. However, significant binding defects were observed (Fig. 1, panels 2A and 2B, Table 1). For some Lys14 mutants, only one affinity site is detected (Glu, Gly, Ser, Val, Trp, and Tyr). For others, two sites were still detected but both were reduced in affinity (e.g. Phe and Gln). In general, reduction of the high affinity binding constant was less than 10-fold, while values for the low affinity Kd showed wider variation with a concomitant increase in the %CV, indicating that the calculated value for the low affinity binding constant was less reliable under these conditions. Several Lys14 mutants displaying a range of high affinity defects were selected and analyzed for their low affinity binding to mGM-Rα expressed alone on stably transfected L-cells (Fig. 2A). Of the five mutant proteins tested, four had a low affinity Kd similar to mGM-CSF (Kd = 7.2 × 10M; Table 4). From this analysis we conclude that the reduction seen in the high affinity binding constant for Lys14 substitution proteins results from losses in binding to the mGM-Rβ in the mGM-Rαβ complex. Protein K14P is the exception. A proline substitution at this position affected the low as well as the high affinity binding constant (Table 1).Figure 2:Competition binding of mutant and wild-type mGM-CSF proteins.

To distinguish between losses in binding to the mGM-Rβ and/or mGM-Rα, Lys substitution proteins were analyzed on mGM-Rα-expressing L-cells. Whereas most substitutions at Lys did not affect the low affinity binding constant as measured on L-cells, small amino acid substitutions (Ala, Gly, and Ser) at this position led to a 10-fold reduction in mGM-Rα binding (Fig. 2B, Table 4). The introduction of proline at this position profoundly disturbed the binding of the resulting protein to both high and low affinity receptor.In contrast to the other mutant proteins examined, all Glu substitution proteins competed I-mGM-CSF for only a single class of binding sites on NSF60 cells (Fig. 1, panel 5B, Table 3). The affinity of Glu substitution proteins (Kd = 1-4 × 10M) for these sites suggested that binding is to mGM-Rα. Scatchard analysis of one of the Glu substitution proteins, E21A, has shown that both affinity and number of binding sites were consistent with binding of this mutant protein to mGMRα only(16Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25466-25472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, the exception was E21P. This protein had a low affinity binding constant that was at least three orders of magnitude higher than the other Glu proteins (Fig. 5B, Table 3), probably caused by severe structural changes(36Altmann S.W. Johnson G.D. Prystowsky M.B. J. Biol.

In an attempt to further characterize CD45 function, we set out to identify molecule(s) that specifically associate with CD45. A 116-kDa protein was detected in immunoprecipitates from CD45 cells but not CD45 cells. The association between CD45 and this 116-kDa protein can be reconstituted by mixing lysates from CD45 cell lines with purified CD45. p116 appears to associate with CD45 through the external, transmembrane, or membrane-proximal region of CD45 since p116 is associated with a mutant form of CD45 possessing a truncated cytoplasmic domain. The association of p116 with CD45 is not isoform-specific as p116 associates equally well with various CD45 isoforms. We have determined that p116 is a tyrosine-phosphorylated glycoprotein and that it is associated with CD45 in all hematopoietic cells examined. Because of its broad distribution, it is possible that identification of p116 will provide additional insight into the function of CD45 in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid hematopoietic cells.

CD45 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein abundantly expressed on nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin(1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Isoforms of CD45 arise from differential splicing of 4 exons (exons 4-7) encoding sequences found near the amino terminus of the molecule, giving rise to structurally related molecules differing in molecular weight. Different cell lineages express different isoforms, and the isoform usage often changes as cell differentiate. All isoforms of CD45 share a large, highly conserved cytoplasmic domain containing two subdomains. These subdomains have significant homology with human placental protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B(2Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7182-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and it is well established that CD45 has intrinsic protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity(3Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8695-8701Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 4Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). CD45 has been shown to be important for both T- and B-lymphocyte activation. CD45-deficient T-cell lines are unable to be activated to proliferate, secrete interleukin-2, or mediate cytolytic events after stimulation through the T-cell antigen receptor(5Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 6Peyron J.F. Verma S. de Wall Malefyt R. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Spits H. Int.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4415-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CD45 appears to exert its function early in the activation cascade since tyrosine phosphorylation, generation of inositol phosphates, and an increase in intracellular Ca after stimulation through the T-cell or B-cell receptor for antigen are ablated in most CD45-deficient cells (8Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 9Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfection of chimeric molecules containing the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 into CD45 cells restores the signaling capacity, suggesting that the external domain is not required for these early activation events(12Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A.

CD45 appears to regulate the phosphorylation state and the enzymatic activity of src-related tyrosine kinases including p56 and p59(4Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), consistent with it being required early in the activation cascade. It is not clear if CD45 has additional substrates or if the regulation of src-related kinases is its only function during lymphocyte activation. In an attempt to further define the role of CD45 in lymphocyte activation, a number of investigations have been undertaken to identify molecules that are specifically associated with CD45. Such associated molecules might regulate the enzymatic activity or modulate the physical proximity of CD45 with its specific substrate(s). The most commonly employed approaches include chemical cross-linking and cocapping. Using the same chemical cross-linking reagent, one group has demonstrated that CD45 immunoprecipitates contain CD2 (20Schraven B. Samstag Y. Altevogt P. Meuer S.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and another Thy-1 and the T-cell antigen receptor(21Volarevic S. Burns C.M. Sussman J.J. Ashwell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7085-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cocapping studies suggest that the association of CD45 with CD4, CD8, LFA-1, and CD2 is isoform-specific(22Dianzani U. Luqman M. Rojo J. Yagi J. Baron J.L. Woods A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Bottomly K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2249-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Dianzani U. Redoglia V. Malavasi F. Bragardo M. Pileri A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Bottomly K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CD45 is coimmunoprecipitated with CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) from digitonin lysates of human T-cells(24Torimoto Y. Dang N.H. Vivier E. Tanaka T. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2514-2517PubMed Google Scholar). Since the expression of these various molecules is restricted to certain cell lineages, we speculate that there may be alternative molecules associated with CD45 in other cell types or that there may be more ubiquitously expressed molecules associated with CD45 in all hematopoietic cells. Studies have also been performed to determine if there are protein interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 that may regulate its function. CD45 is associated with a 30-kDa protein (25Takeda A. Wu J.J. Maizel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16651-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has no homology with known sequences and appears to be expressed in all leukocytes(26Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This molecule has been postulated to be an adapter molecule for CD45-mediated signaling events. The cytoskeletal protein fodrin has also been shown to associate with CD45 and may stimulate its enzymatic activity(27Lokeshwar V.B. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21551-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of CD45 with the cytoskeleton, through fodrin, may also regulate its association with other cell-surface molecules(27Lokeshwar V.B. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21551-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our goal was to identify molecules that are stably associated with CD45 in the detergent Nonidet P-40. Herein we establish that a 116-kDa protein is associated with CD45 in immunoprecipitates of CD45 but not CD45 T-lymphomas. We also demonstrate that a 116-kDa protein appears to be specifically associated with CD45 in all CD45-expressing cells examined. Initial characterization of this molecule suggests that it is a tyrosine-phosphorylated glycoprotein. Identification of this 116-kDa protein might provide additional insight into the function of CD45 in non-lymphoid cells as well as lymphoid cells. BW5147 and SAKRTLS 12.1 are mouse T-lymphomas. These cells and their CD45 variants as well as the BW5147 revertant have been described previously(4Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The 2 cells infected with pARV-1 retroviral constructs expressing isoforms of CD45 containing different sequences encoded by alternatively spliced exons have also been described(28Johnson P. Greenbaum L. Bottomly K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These cells and all other cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 8% heat-inactivated defined calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 2 mM glutamine. The monoclonal antibodies used in this study were I3/2 (29Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and M1/9.34 HL2, which are both specific for a portion of the ectodomain common to all isoforms of CD45, and M1/42, which is specific for mouse major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Both M1/9.34 HL2 and M1/42 were obtained from ATCC. Cells producing monoclonal antibodies were grown in serum-free media (protein-free hybridoma medium II, Life Technologies, Inc.) and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dialysis. The purity of the antibodies was verified by SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. The antibodies were then directly coupled to cyanogen-activated Sepharose 4B. The polyclonal antiserum to recombinantly expressed cytoplasmic domain of CD45 has been described(4Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline. For metabolic labeling with [S]methionine, cells were incubated for 4 h at 107 cells/ml with 0.2 mCi/ml of TranS-label (ICN, Irvine, CA) in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dialyzed calf serum. Cells were washed 3 times in cold Dulbecco's PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) before lysis. Cells were prepared for surface biotinylation by washing twice in PBS and resuspending at 4 × 107 cells/ml in PBS containing 120 μg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Labeling was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature and was quenched by incubation with an equal volume of culture medium for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were then washed once in cold culture medium and 3 times in cold Dulbecco's PBS. Lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described below. Cells were washed 3 times in Dulbecco's PBS and lysed by resuspension in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, unless otherwise noted, at 4 × 107 cells/ml. After 20 min on ice, postnuclear extracts were added to Sepharose 4B that had been previously coupled to antibody and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. After 45-90 min at 4°C, immunoprecipitates were washed 3-6 times in lysis buffer. Reducing sample buffer was added directly to the beads and, after boiling, proteins were subjected to electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoresed on either 7.5 or 10% gels by the Laemmli method(30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were either silver stained or proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 20% methanol, 20 mM Tris base, 96 mM glycine for 2-3 h at 60 V. After transfer, proteins were stained with India ink as described in the Immobilon-P product bulletin. Biotinylated proteins were detected by incubation with Streptavidin-peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim Canada, Laval, Quebec) at 1:30,000 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN) as described in the product manual. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using affinity-purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 1.5 μg/ml followed by goat anti-rabbit coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). CD45 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography by passing Nonidet P-40-solubilized SAKRTLS 12.1 extracts over an I3/2 column. After extensive washing in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, followed by 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, which disrupts the association with p116, CD45 was eluted with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0. One-ml fractions were immediately neutralized, and positive fractions were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealing CD45 as the only species visible by silver staining. For the reconstitution studies, membranes from CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 cells were isolated as described previously(31Kane K.P. Champoux P. Mescher M.F. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation in PBS followed by high speed centrifugation to separate cytosolic proteins from the membrane fraction. Cell membranes were reconstituted at 1.6 mg/ml in lysis buffer, and an additional ultracentrifugation step was performed to eliminate the detergent-insoluble material. Samples were saved at each step for I3/2 immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of approximately 10 μg of purified CD45. Beads mixed with detergent-solubilized fractions were prepared for SDS-PAGE by washing 5 times in lysis buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 3 times in regular lysis buffer. Beads treated with cytosolic proteins in the absence of detergent were washed 8 times in PBS. Immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at 37°C with 0.3 units of endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 50 μl of 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 6.5, 20 mM EDTA, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, resuspended in reducing sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. To determine if any proteins specifically immunoprecipitate with CD45, lysates were prepared from CD45 and CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 T-lymphomas using buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. CD45 was immunoprecipitated with the CD45-specific monoclonal antibody I3/2 directly coupled to Sepharose 4B, washed extensively with lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. To minimize nonspecific interactions, the Sepharose 4B was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin prior to use for immunoprecipitation. Proteins were either silver stained directly or transferred to Immobilon-P and revealed with India ink staining. A protein of about 116 kDa, detected by both silver stain (Fig. 1A) and India ink stain (Fig. 1B), could be reproducibly co-immunoprecipitated with CD45. When immunoprecipitates were prepared using M1/42, a monoclonal antibody of the same isotype as I3/2 but recognizing major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, no band at 116 kDa was observed (Fig. 1B). The 116-kDa protein could not be detected in immunoprecipitates prepared using anti-LFA-1 or anti-transferrin receptor as additional controls (data not shown). A 116-kDa protein is also detected in immunoprecipitates from CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 cells but not CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 following metabolic labeling with [S]methionine (Fig. 1C). To ascertain if the association of p116 with anti-CD45 immunoprecipitates is unique to the anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody that we employed, we have also used a second antibody to CD45, M1/9.34 HL2, and found that a 116-kDa protein is also present in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that the 116-kDa protein specifically associates with CD45 and does not nonspecifically associate with the immunoprecipitating antibodies or the Sepharose beads. The association is most likely not due to cross-reactivity of the antibody because p116 is not immunoprecipitated from lysates of CD45 cells. Identical results have also been obtained using sets of CD45 and CD45 cell lines derived from NZB.1, BW5147, and Yac-1 T-lymphomas (data not shown). We screened a number of different cell lines derived from different cell lineages to determine if p116 is associated with CD45 in all cells that express CD45. Since we do not have CD45 variants of all these different cell lines, we compared the I3/2 immunoprecipitates with parallel immunoprecipitates employing isotype-matched M1/42 as a negative control. The results of two such experiments using freshly isolated thymocytes from AKR mice and a cytotoxic T-cell clone called 2C are shown in Fig. 2A. It can be seen that a 116-kDa protein is found in the I3/2 immunoprecipitates but not in the M1/42 immunoprecipitates. In all, we have tested about 20 hematopoietic cell lines of different origins and have found, without exception, that all cell lines expressing CD45 have a 116-kDa protein present in CD45 immunoprecipitates. These cell lines include B and T tumor cell lines (A20.CY, LK35.2, 70Z/3, EL4, AKR), antigen-specific T-cell clones and hybridomas (clone 11, CTLL-2, L3, AODH 7.1, A1.1, DO.11.10), the mastocytoma P815, and the macrophage and monocytic cell lines WEHI-3, J774A.1 and P388D1 (data not shown). We have obtained 2 cells that express various isoforms of CD45 that were generated by infection with recombinant retrovirus containing various isoforms of CD45(28Johnson P. Greenbaum L. Bottomly K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As expected, we were unable to detect either CD45 or p116 in I3/2 immunoprecipitates from control 2 cells. Interestingly, we have found that a 116-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitates with two different isoforms of CD45 expressed in 2 cells (Fig. 2B). These results raise the possibility that p116 may be ubiquitously expressed, even in cells that do not normally express CD45. Furthermore, the association between CD45 and p116 appears to be relatively strong, in that it is stable in 0.5 M NaCl in 0.1-1% Nonidet P-40 or digitonin (Fig. 2B and data not shown). A revertant of the BW5147/CD45 cell line that reexpresses CD45 has been isolated. The CD45 that is reexpressed, however, is truncated so that most of the cytoplasmic domain has been deleted as demonstrated by in vivo inorganic phosphate labeling studies(32Hyman R. Trowbridge I. Stallings V. Trotter J. Immunogenetics. 1982; 15: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It also lacks protein-tyrosine phosphatase enzymatic activity (4Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) but appears to express a normal external domain(32Hyman R. Trowbridge I. Stallings V. Trotter J. Immunogenetics. 1982; 15: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The exact location of this truncation has not yet been mapped; however, the CD45 that is expressed is about 120 kDa, which is consistent with it lacking essentially all of the cytoplasmic domain. We have found that p116 associates with CD45 expressed in this revertant cell line (Fig. 3, BW/rev). The amount of the 116-kDa protein found in an I3/2 immunoprecipitate from BW/rev is much lower than in the BW5147 parent, consistent with the revertant expressing about 10-20% of the CD45 expressed on parental BW5147 cells(4Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). It is difficult to visualize the truncated CD45 band on India ink-stained membranes, but it does appear as a faint smear at about 120 kDa on silver-stained gels (data not shown). The observation that the 116-kDa protein is found in immunoprecipitates of this truncated CD45 suggests that it associates with the external domain, the transmembrane domain, and/or the membrane-proximal region of CD45. Since p116 appears to associate with CD45 through the external domain, the transmembrane domain, and/or the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain, there is a formal possibility that the differentially expressed exons might be involved in these associations. To examine this possibility, we again made use of the 2 transfectants expressing various isoforms of CD45(28Johnson P. Greenbaum L. Bottomly K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We examined four different CD45 cell lines expressing differentially spliced exons 4, 5, and 6 (RA), 5 and 6 (RB), 6 alone (RC) or none of the differentially spliced exons (RO). To perform the experiment, we prepared CD45 immunoprecipitates from each of these cell lines, including a control line, and mixed these with lysates prepared from [S]methionine-labeled CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 cells to assay whether the labeled p116 from the CD45-negative cell line could associate with the unlabeled immunoprecipitated CD45. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that p116 associates equally well with all of the different isoforms tested. These results suggest that the association between CD45 and p116 is isoform-independent and are consistent with our observation that the 116-kDa protein is detected in CD45 immunoprecipitates prepared from a variety of different cell types expressing different isoforms of CD45. Furthermore, these results also demonstrate that p116 is expressed in CD45 cells and can associate with CD45 in vitro. To determine if p116 is a membrane-bound or cytosolic protein, we prepared membrane and cytosolic fractions from CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 cells. The p116 expressed in these cells does not have CD45 to associate with and would therefore not be found in the membrane solely by virtue of its association with CD45. To perform this experiment, we immunopurified CD45 over an I3/2 affinity column. After this purification step, the CD45 appeared as a single band on a silver-stained gel (data not shown) and had no detectable p116 associated with it. The purified CD45 was mixed with I3/2 beads along with the Nonidet P-40-solubilized membranes or the cytosolic fraction isolated from CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 cells. We also examined the detergent-solubilized membranes devoid of detergent-insoluble material. The beads were then washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The results of one such experiment are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that a protein of about 116 kDa becomes associated with CD45 after mixing with the Nonidet P-40-solubilized membrane fraction from CD45 cells but not with the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that p116 is a membrane-bound protein. The p116 is predominantly found in the Nonidet P-40-soluble membrane fraction further supporting its association with the membrane and not with the membrane skeleton. We were also able to reconstitute the association with postnuclear Nonidet P-40 extracts mixed with purified CD45 in the presence of I3/2 beads but not in the presence of control M1/42 beads (data not shown). To determine if the 116-kDa protein contains an external domain, we cell-surface biotinylated CD45 and CD45 SAKRTLS 12.1 cells and immunoprecipitated CD45 under conditions that maintain the association with p116. It is clear from Fig. 6A that p116 can be biotinylated, suggesting that it does have an external domain accessible to the biotinylating agent. Control immunoprecipitates containing p56or actin demonstrate that intracellular molecules are not biotinylated (data not shown). Protein staining of parallel immunoprecipitates run on the same gel demonstrate that the biotinylated protein at 116 kDa comigrates with p116 as revealed by India ink staining and that both are found only in immunoprecipitates from CD45cells (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, we also observe a 30-kDa biotinylated protein in immunoprecipitates prepared from CD45cells but not CD45cells. It is possible that this is the previously described 30-kDa adapter protein, which is predicted to have a very small external domain(26Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . Surface iodination experiments have also been done, and p116 does become iodinated albeit to a very low level (data not shown). These results, in conjunction with the data presented inFig. 5, suggest that p116 is a membrane-bound protein with an external domain. Since CD45 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, the determination of the phosphorylation status of p116 is significant. We found, by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, that a CD45-associated 116-kDa protein is tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 6A). The immunoprecipitates used for immunoblotting were run on the same gel with a parallel immunoprecipitate that was stained with India ink to reveal p116. It is clear that the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein comigrates with p116 (Fig. 6A). Identical results were obtained with two different rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antisera, and antibody binding to the 116-kDa protein could be inhibited with phenylphosphate or phosphotyrosine (data not shown). Furthermore, very little tyrosine phosphorylation is detected when sodium vanadate is omitted from the lysis buffer, suggesting that the phosphorylation of p116 is regulated by a tyrosine phosphatase (data not shown). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that p116 is a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. To determine if p116 is a glycoprotein, we incubated immunoprecipitates containing CD45 and p116 with endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F, which removes high mannose and complex N-glycans. As shown in Fig. 6B, there is a dramatic shift in the mobility of CD45, which serves as our internal control, and a slight shift in the mobility of p116, suggesting that p116 is a glycoprotein. When these immunoprecipitates are immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, there is an identical shift in the tyrosine phosphorylated protein, further supporting the conclusion that p116 is a tyrosine-phosphorylated and glycosylated protein (data not shown). It is also interesting to note that the association between CD45 and p116 is not dependent on N-linked glycosylation of either CD45 or p116 since the association is stable after N-glycosidase F treatment. These results taken together with the membrane reconstitution and surface biotinylation experiments suggest that p116 is a transmembrane glycoprotein. We have found that a 116-kDa protein specifically associates with CD45 in all CD45-expressing cells examined. This molecule appears to be a tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane glycoprotein. The interaction between CD45 and this 116-kDa protein is relatively stable and is easily reconstituted. Chemical cross-linkers are not required to detect the association, which is stable in buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 M NaCl. The association is stable overnight at 37°C and does not require the presence of N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 6B). A number of studies have been done to identify molecules that are associated with CD45 on the T-cell surface. It has been shown to be associated with Thy-1, the T-cell antigen receptor, CD2, CD4, and CD8 (20Schraven B. Samstag Y. Altevogt P. Meuer S.C.

The expression of these cell-surface molecules is restricted to the T-cell lineage and therefore does not permit generalizations about the role of CD45 in the large number of different cell types in which it is expressed. We have found that p116 is associated with CD45 in every hematopoietic cell type examined, including non-lymphoid cells. Intriguingly, p116 was also detected in cells that do not normally express CD45, suggesting that p116 is ubiquitously expressed. It has been demonstrated that CD45 is found in CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) immunoprecipitates prepared from digitonin, but not Nonidet P-40, extracts of human T-lymphocytes(24Torimoto Y. Dang N.H. Vivier E. Tanaka T. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2514-2517PubMed Google Scholar). This molecule is about 110 kDa and has a wide tissue distribution raising the possibility that it might be the equivalent of the 116-kDa protein described herein. However we find this unlikely for three reasons. 1) CD26 is efficiently iodinated, whereas p116 is minimally iodinated. 2) CD26 has a different mobility than p116 by SDS-PAGE. 3) Mouse CD26 has no tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain for phosphorylation, and 4) antibodies to CD26 do not react with p116 either by immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting (data not shown). A number of observations have allowed us to eliminate the possibility that p116 is a degradation product of CD45. First, neither antiserum to the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 nor monoclonal antibodies to the external domain react with p116 by Western blotting (data not shown). Second, CD45 cells express p116 as demonstrated by the labeled reconstitution experiments where labeled p116 from CD45 cells is able to bind to unlabeled CD45 (Fig. 4). Third, two-dimensional peptide mapping of CD45 versus p116 from [S]methioninelabeled cells gives very distinct patterns (data not shown). These observations, taken together, suggest that p116 is not a degradation product of CD45. The identification of p116 will likely yield important functional information about CD45. We have worked out a purification scheme for p116 and are now trying to obtain sequence information. We have also immunized rabbits with the purified protein to obtain antiserum that will be useful for further characterization of the interaction. At present, one can only speculate about the potential functions for such a molecule. One possibility is that p116 regulates CD45 enzymatic activity either directly or by allowing or preventing interactions with its substrate(s). Since p116 is tyrosine phosphorylated, it could be a substrate of CD45 and therefore a downstream mediator of CD45-triggered signaling events. It is also possible that p116 may be a linker molecule that connects CD45 to additional signaling pathways similar to the -chain of the T-cell receptor complex(33Weissman A.M. Baniyash M. Hour D. Samelson L.E. Burgess W.H. Klausner R.D. Science. 1988; 239: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 34Irving B.A. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, p116 has limited glycosylation and is not readily iodinated, suggesting that it may have a small external domain as does the -chain(33Weissman A.M. Baniyash M. Hour D. Samelson L.E. Burgess W.H. Klausner R.D. Science. 1988; 239: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggest that the phosphorylation of p116 does not change upon T-cell activation; however, this can be addressed more directly once we have antibodies to the protein. Further characterization of p116 will provide insight into the role of CD45 in signal transduction in lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cells. We thank Drs.

The poor enhancer activity of the R1 site in Ad12-transformed cells is correlated with increases in the extent of binding of nuclear factors to the R2 element, suggesting the presence of a repressor whose effects are mediated via the R2 site. Kralli et al.(31Kralli A. Ge R. Graeven V. Ricciardi R.P. Weimann R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6979-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that the putative R2-binding repressor protein, designated R2BF, is similar to members of the family of thyroid hormone/retinoic acid receptors. We showed previously that a distal 5′-element (−1,521 to −1,837 relative to the start site of transcription) that contributes to E1A-mediated negative regulation is included in the promoter region of the H-2K gene(9Katoh S. Ozawa K. Kondoh S. Soeda E. Israël A. Shiroki K. Fujinaga K. Itakura K. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The CAA repeated sequences in regions −1,736 to −1,689 and −1,616 to −1,535 are both necessary for full negative regulation of the H-2K gene by E1A. We report here that an additional element, a TATA-like sequence, in the far upstream region of the 5′-flanking sequence (−1,773 to −1,767) is also a key element in the negative regulation of expression of the MHC class I H-2K gene by E1A in conjunction with either upstream or downstream CAA repeats. A gel shift competition assay demonstrated that the factor that binds to the far upstream TATA-like sequence can also bind to the TATA-box sequence in the basal promoter. Using an immunoselection and cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) method, we also obtained direct evidence that Ad12-E1A can associate with the proteins that bind to the TATA-like sequence and to the CAA repeats in Ad12-E1A-transformed cells. Plasmids-The deletion and substitution CAT mutants, namely, del-4ml, del-4m2, del-5ml, and del-5m2 were constructed as follows. The BspHI/RsaI DNA fragment of a distal 5′-flanking sequence of the H-2K gene, including the element CTGTAAGCCAGACCC or the TATA-like sequence TATTAAA, was mutated to either ATGTAAGAAAGAAAC or TAGCGAA, respectively, and ligated to the RsaI/DdeI DNA fragment (−1,735/-1,188) or the BstNI/Sau3A fragment of a distal 5′-flanking sequence of the H-2K gene (−1,615/-1,534) with 4-6-bp BamHI or HindIII linkers of both ends of the DNA. The resultant fragments were inserted into the BamHI site or the HindIII site of pH-2Kb(367)CAT (32Ozawa K. Saka F. Kitabayashi I. Imai T. Soeda E. Israël A. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K.

The TATA-like sequence in the BspHI/RsaI DNA fragment was converted to various TATA-like sequences found in the promoters of the H-2K, adenovirus major late promoter (AdML), hsp70, c-fos, histone, β-globin, adenoviruses E3 and E4, and SV40 early genes (see (33Simon M.C.

In each case, overhang was generated by EcoRI, and the DNA fragment was either inserted into the EcoRI site of pH-2Kb(367)CAT(CAAu) or coinserted with the DNA fragment RsaI/DdeI (−1,735/-1,688) into either the EcoRI site of pSV2CAT (34Gorman C.L.

The DNA-protein complex and free probe were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 5% gel in 0.5 × Tris-borate buffer (1 × TBE buffer: 0.089 M Tris, 0.089 M boric acid, 2 mM EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to two sheets of x-ray film. The film closest to the gel recorded signals from both S and P and the second film recorded only signals from P. Immunoselection and CASTing were performed by a combination of the methods of Kinzler et al.(43Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

A DNA fragment containing the promoter region of H-2Kb (HindIII-NruI) was sheared to an average size of 200-400 bp (mass average) by sonication on ice. The ends of the DNA fragments were blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli and then ligated to “catch linkers” (5′-GAGTAGAATTCTAATATCTC-3′) using T4 ligase. To separate catch linkers that had become ligated to themselves, the ligated linkers were digested with XhoI. The reaction mixture for the first cycle of immunoselection and CASTing included 84 μg of DNA fragments and 40 μl of a nuclear extract of 3Y1 cells (400 μg of protein) in a total volume of 1.0 ml of buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol). After a 25-min incubation at 20°C, 10 μl of a solution of rat IgG were added, and then the mixture was slowly agitated at 20°C for 1 h after the addition of 100 μl of a suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was further incubated with 40 μl of a nuclear extract of CYpAdC3 cells or Ad5-E1A-transformed 3Y1 cells (400 μg of protein) for another 25 min at 20°C. Then 10 μl of a solution of monoclonal antibodies specific for Ad12-E1A or Ad5-E1A and 100 μl of the suspension of protein A-Sepharose were added to the reaction mixture, and the final mixture was treated according to the same protocol as described above. The beads were washed five times with 1.0 ml of isotonic saline that contained 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml and then twice with 1.0 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM ZnSO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS). DNA was freed from complexes by incubation of beads for 50 min at 50°C in dissociation buffer (500 mM Tris (pH 9.0), 20 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% SDS). Protein A-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation, the supernatant containing DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. Various amounts of recovered DNA (1/2, 1/20, and 1/200 dilutions) were amplified using the catch linkers as primers (25 cycles; 94°C for 60 s, 55°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 120 s) as described elsewhere(43Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 44Perkins A.S. Fishel R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2% agarose, 1 × TBE), and 10 μl of a solution of the amplified material (typically containing 30-50 ng of DNA) were used to initiate the second and subsequent rounds of CASTing. After six cycles of CASTing, the amplified DNA was radiolabeled by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I with [α-P]dTT(45Sambrook D. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Preparative gel shift assays were performed as described elsewhere(45Sambrook D. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each shifted band, representing a protein-DNA complex, was excised from the gel and eluted from the gel by overnight agitation at 37°C in 0.6 ml of a solution of 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5). DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated in ethanol. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA. PCR was then performed under the conditions described above. After the fourth cycle of gel shifting and PCR, the resultant DNAs were digested with EcoRI and ligated into pBluescript KS() (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The products were used to transform competent XL-1 Blue E. coli cells. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method as described elsewhere(36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51947) Google Scholar). Ad12-E1A-transformed CYpAdC3 cells and baby mouse kidney primary cultured cells, infected with either Ad12 or Ad5 virus, were used for the promoter-screening assay. A distal 5′-end element between −1,521 and −1,837 that contributes to negative regulation mediated by the E1A gene products was previously defined within the H-2Kb gene(9Katoh S. Ozawa K. Kondoh S. Soeda E. Israël A. Shiroki K. Fujinaga K. Itakura K. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the precise controlling sequence in the 316-bp DNA fragment, we constructed a set of fusions of partially deleted and substituted regulatory regions with the pH-2Kb(367)CAT construct, which contained the promoter and enhancer regions of the mouse H-2Kb gene, as described previously(32Ozawa K. Saka F. Kitabayashi I. Imai T. Soeda E. Israël A. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4185-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the TATA-like sequence (−1,773 to 1,767) in the 316-bp far upstream region was found to contribute to the E1A-mediated repression in Ad12-E1A-transformed cells. The plasmid del-3CAT (lane 2 (Fig. 1, lane 2)), which contained only the TATA-like sequence, did not show this negative activity. However, when the DNA fragment from −1,809 to −1,735 was ligated with either an upstream CAA repeated element (−1,735 to −1,688) or a downstream CAA repeated element (−1,615 to −1,534), repression was detected at significant levels in Ad12-E1A-transformed cells, but not in Ad5-infected cells (lanes 3-6). The results obtained with substitution mutations of the TATA-like sequence in this region showed that this negative regulation was caused by the TATA-like sequence (lanes 7 and 8). Similar results were obtained in adenovirus-infected baby hamster kidney and baby rat kidney primary cells (data not shown). Collectively, the results indicate that the far upstream TATA-like sequence is one of the negative elements involved in the E1A-mediated control of expression of the H-2Kb MHC class I gene. The same results were obtained in co-transfection experiments using 3Y1 cells and NIH3T3 cells, with CAT reporter genes and an E1A expression vector (data not shown). We studied the effects of the upstream TATA-like element together with the CAA repeated motif in the presence or absence of either pE1A12S or pE1A13S cDNA constructs from adenovirus type 12 and type 5 (Fig. 2). Only the 13S mRNA from Ad12 had the ability to regulate negatively the expression of the MHC class I promoter (panel B). Thus, the negative effect exerted by the TATA-like sequence together with either an upstream or a downstream CAA repeated element appears to be specific to the mRNA for Ad12-13S E1A. The effects of the position and the orientation of the upstream TATA-like sequence were studied in transfection experiments (Fig. 3A). The TATA-like sequence was placed in front of the upstream CAA repeated motif, upstream of pH-2Kb(367)CAT (promoter/enhancer) in both the original and the reverse orientation. The CAT plasmid, which had the original orientation but in which the TATA-like sequence was separated from the H-2Kb promoter/enhancer by a CAA upstream sequence (lanes 4 and 5), displayed about the same level of suppression as the wild-type CAT construct (see Fig. 1, lane 1). By contrast, the CAT plasmid with the opposite orientation of the upstream TATA-like element was not associated with a negative effect (lanes 6 and 7). When the upstream TATA-like sequence was placed at the downstream BamHI site of the vector in the original orientation, a significant decrease in CAT activity was observed (lanes 8 and 10). However, when the upstream TATA-like sequence was placed at the same BamHI site of the plasmid in the opposite orientation, no suppression was detected (lanes 9 and 11). When the position of the upstream TATA-like element was exchanged with that of the CAA repeated motif in the original or the reverse orientation, no significant repression of H-2Kb promoter activity was detected (lanes 12 and 13). Thus, the TATA-like element was active at an increased distance from its original position, but the repression of H-2Kb promoter activity was sensitive to the orientation of the TATA-like element. These results were obtained in Ad12-E1A-transformants and were not obtained at similar significant levels in Ad5-E1A-transformed cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that monomers and dimers of the CAA repeats do not function as negative elements in Ad12-E1A-mediated repression of the H-2Kb gene(10Ozawa K. Hagiwara H. Tang X. Saka F. Kitabayashi I. Shiroki K. Fujinaga K. Israël A. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27258-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether the upstream TATA-like sequence might affect the H-2Kb promoter activity of CAT plasmids with oligomerized CAA repeated motifs. To our surprise, the effect of the TATA-like sequence on the H-2Kb promoter activity was apparent in conjunction with monomeric or dimeric CAA motifs (data not shown). This effect was also sensitive to the relative orientations of the TATA-like sequence and the CAA motifs but not to the relative positional effects of the two elements (data not shown). We analyzed the influence of the promoter on the negative effect of the upstream TATA-like element (Fig. 3B). The repression of three different constructs driven by SV40, thymidine kinase (TK), and conalbumin (Cona) promoters was clearly observed (5.0-7.0-fold repression), similar to the repression associated with the homologous promoter (10-fold repression), although the extent of repression was variable (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Thus, this negative effect was not dependent upon the specific promoter tested in the case of Ad12-E1A-transformed cells. By contrast, the upstream TATA-like element had only a moderate negative effect (1.5-2.0-fold repression) in Ad5-E1A transformants. To determine the relative abilities of various TATA-like sequences to repress the E1A-dependent activity of the H-2Kb promoter, we constructed a series of CAT plasmids with various TATA-like sequences, such as those of the adenoviruses E3 and E4, Ad-ML, hsp70, SV40 early genes, histone H1, c-fos, and β-globin, by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4). When the upstream TATA-like sequence (TATTAAA) was changed to the basic TATA sequence of promoters (TATAAA), we observed significant repression (lanes A and B). When the upstream TATA-like sequence was converted to the Ad-ML (TATAAAA), hsp70 (TATAAAA), or c-fos (TATAAAA) sequences, significant repression was detected (lane C). The conversion to E4 (TATATATA) and SV40 early (TATTTAT) sequences, did not result in negative repression (lanes G and H). Conversion to the histone H1 (TATATAA), the β-globin (CATATAA), or the E3 (TATAACT) sequences resulted in moderate negative repression (lanes D, E, and F). These results imply that full negative activity of this upstream element requires the sequence TAT (A/T) AA. The sequence specificity of the TATA-like element was seen only in the case of Ad12-E1A-transformed cells. No significant similar result was obtained in Ad5-E1A-transformed cells. We next examined the combined effects of the upstream TATA-like sequence and the TATA-box of the basal promoter on the E1A-dependent negative repression of the MHC class I H-2Kb promoter. Various upstream TATA-like sequences were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, as indicated above, and were introduced into either Ad12-E1A- or Ad5-E1A-transformed cells. We constructed CAT plasmids driven by the SV40 early (TATTTAT) promoter or the thymidine kinase promoter (TATTAA), which are known to be negatively and positively affected by Ad5-E1A-mediated transactivation, respectively ((33Simon M.C.

INTRODUCTIONAmidotransferases catalyze glutamine hydrolysis to supply ammonia for de novo biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, glucosamine, folate, nicotinamide, and several amino acids(1Zalkin H. Bisswanger H. Schmincke-Ott E. Multifunctional Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, New York1980: 123-149Google Scholar, 2Weng M. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3023-3028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two classes of amidotransferase, trpG and purF types(2Weng M. Zalkin H. J.

In both types of enzymes, the amidotransferase activity is usually associated with a separate subunit or domain of the biosynthetic complex. The trpG amidotransferase domains represent a homologous family of proteins with a molecular mass of 20 kDa and a sequence that includes three nearly invariant regions (regions I-III) shown to be important for the function of the molecule(2Weng M.

Glutamine hydrolysis does not proceed at a significant rate in the absence of bicarbonate and ATP. This functional linkage, which minimizes the hydrolysis of glutamine when the other substrates needed for carbamyl phosphate synthesis are limiting, is also present in CAD. ATP and bicarbonate increase the k of the glutaminase reaction 14-fold by increasing the rate of hydrolysis of the thioester intermediate (25Chaparian M.G. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3387-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) formed during the catalytic cycle.We have recently cloned the glutaminase domain of CAD and expressed the protein in E. coli(26Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein had barely detectable catalytic activity but formed a fully functional hybrid with the E. coli CPSase synthetase domain indicating that the functional linkage between the glutaminase and synthetase domains had been restored. This observation suggests that the subunit interfaces must be nearly identical in the eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins and that the interdomain linkage has been highly conserved throughout the course of evolution.The glutaminase domain of all carbamyl phosphate synthetases is unusual in that it consists of a 21-kDa carboxyl half which is homologous to all of the trpG-type amidotransferases and a 19-kDa amino half which occurs only in this family of molecules(17Simmer J.P.

The carboxyl half or catalytic subdomain contains the active site cysteine that participates in glutamine hydrolysis. The function of the amino half of the CPSase glutaminase domain is unknown, although, in a recent study (34Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a series of point mutations and deletions were introduced into the E. coli CPSase small subunit. Removal of the amino-terminal third (residues 1-113) of the glutaminase subunit prevented the association with the CPSase synthetase subunit, suggesting that this region is required to stabilize the complex. Thus, the amino half of the glutaminase domain has been designated the interaction subdomain.As reported here, we have cloned and expressed the two halves of the hamster CAD glutaminase domain to determine whether they are separately folded subdomains with distinct functions. This study showed that all of the residues required for glutamine binding and hydrolysis are present in the catalytic domain and that the interaction domain, in addition to its role in maintaining the physical association of the glutaminase and synthetase domain, also participates in the interdomain signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and StrainsThe 7.1-kb plasmid, pHG-GLN52(26Guy H.I.

The program Minsq (Micromath) was used to obtain a nonlinear least squares fit of the saturation curves to the Michaelis-Menten equation.Purification of the CAD GLN Catalytic SubdomainA 500-ml culture of pHG-GLN15-transformed L673 cells yielded 5.3 g of cells. The cells were suspended in 30 ml of 0.05 M Tris-Cl, pH 7, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol (sonication buffer) and sonicated on ice twice for 2 min as described previously(26Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sonicate was centrifuged at 29,000 ×g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant (30 ml) was applied to a 50-ml DEAE-Sephacryl column equilibrated in sonication buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the GLN catalytic subdomain, identified by SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, were pooled, precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate, and fractionated on a Sephadex G-200 column and eluted with 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Fractions containing the homogeneous protein were pooled and stored at −0°C.Purification of the CAD GLN Interaction SubdomainA 500-ml culture of pJHN-GLN17-transformed L673 cells yielded 3.1 g of cells. The cells were suspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer and sonicated as described above. The sonicate was centrifuged, and the supernatant (20 ml) was applied to a 50-ml DEAE-Sephacryl column and eluted with a 0-0.3 M NaCl gradient in sonication buffer. The nearly homogeneous interaction subdomain eluted at approximately 0.10 M NaCl. The pooled fractions were stored at −70°C.RESULTSConstruction of the Recombinant CAD GLN SubdomainsThe glutaminase domain, located at the amino end of the CAD polypeptide (Fig. 1), consists of two halves defined (17Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by homology with other amidotransferases. The amino half, designated the interaction domain, extends from residues 1 to 174, while the carboxyl half or catalytic domain begins at residue 175 and extends to residue 365, the last amino acid before the start of the linker which connects the GLNase and CPSase domains.The recombinant, pJHN-GLN17, encoding the amino half of the hamster CAD glutaminase domain (Fig. 2), was obtained by deletion of pHG-GLN52(26Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a plasmid which codes for the entire 40-kDa glutaminase domain. The parent plasmid was restricted with StyI and EcoRI, and the 5′ extensions were made flush using the Klenow fragment. The 3.9-kb fragment was gel-purified and religated to yield pJHN-GLN17, which contained a 539-bp cDNA insert encoding residues 1 to 180 of the CAD polypeptide. The coding sequence, thus, extends 6 residues into the putative catalytic subdomain. In addition, 3 residues derived from the vector are added to the carboxyl end of the protein. Expression of the recombinant, like the parental plasmid, is under control of the pyrBI promoter.Figure 2:Cloning of the CAD GLNase interaction and catalytic subdomains. To clone the interaction subdomain (on the left), pHG-GLN52(26Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a plasmid encoding the CAD GLNase domain (dark-shaded area) under the control of the pyrBI promoter (reg), was restricted with StyI and EcoRI, and the 5′ extensions were made flush using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The resulting 3.9-kb plasmid pJHN-GLN17 contained a 539-bp cDNA fragment encoding the entire interaction subdomain and six amino acid residues of the amino end of the catalytic subdomain. In addition, three amino acids (-Leu-Asn-Ser-COOH) derived from the vector are encoded prior to the stop codon. The recombinant, pJHN-GLN17, is under control of the pyrBI promoter. To clone the catalytic subdomain (on the right), a 565-bp XhoII-SmaI fragment (dark-shaded area) was excised from the recombinant plasmid pCAD142 (35Shigesada K. Stark G.R. Maley J.A. Niswander L.A. Davidson J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) which contains most of the CAD coding sequence. The fragment was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the vector pJLA503 after restriction and removal of the 5′ extensions of EcoRI cleavage site with mung bean nuclease. The resulting recombinant pHG-GLN15 is under the control of the tandem phage promoters (PR, PL) and has a temperature-sensitive repressor gene (CI) which allows expression by heat shock. The plasmid encodes residues 175 to 365 of CAD and has five amino acids (NH2-Met-His-Arg-Asn-Arg-) and six amino acids (-Arg-Arg-Pro-Arg-Cys-Pro-COOH) derived from the vector appended to the amino and carboxyl ends of the protein, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sequence encoding the carboxyl half of the GLNase domain was excised from the partial cDNA clone pCAD142(35Shigesada K. Stark G.R. Maley J.A. Niswander L.A. Davidson J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), by restriction with XhoII and SmaI (Fig. 2). The insert was cloned into the plasmid, pJLA503, a heat shock vector under control of dual promoters. The vector was cut with EcoRI and then with BamHI after removal of the 5′-EcoRI extensions with mung bean nuclease. The resulting recombinant, pHG-GLN15, has a 565-bp insert corresponding to residues 175 to 365 of the CAD polypeptide. When expressed, the recombinant protein has 5 and 6 amino acid residues derived from the vector added to the amino and carboxyl ends, respectively.Expression and Purification of the CAD GLN SubdomainsThe uracil-dependent E. coli carAB-deficient strain, L673, which lacks both the glutaminase and synthetase subunits of E. coli CPSase, served as the host for expression of the mammalian GLNase subdomains.For expression of the interaction subdomain, pJHGLN-17 transformants were grown in minimal media containing limiting uracil (12 μg/ml). The pyrBI promoter is derepressed when the uracil is exhausted (16-18 h), and a new 19-kDa protein began to accumulate in the extracts. This species was not found in extracts of cells transformed with the vector, pEK81. Immunoblots (Fig. 3) probed with hamster CAD antibodies confirmed that this polypeptide was of mammalian origin. The interaction subdomain was purified by DEAE-Sephacryl chromatography. We typically obtained 1-2 mg of the nearly homogeneous protein from a 500-ml culture of transformed cells.Figure 3:Expression and purification of the CAD GLNase interaction subdomain. The plasmid pJHN-GLN17, which encodes the GLNase interaction subdomain, was transformed into the strain EK1104 (lane 1) and the Lon protease-deficient strain L673 (lane 2). The induction followed the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell extracts were prepared by suspending 6 ml of packed cells (50 mg of cell protein) in 0.1 ml of 5 × SDS-sample buffer and 0.4 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT. The suspension was immediately heated to 85°C for 15 min, then sonicated briefly, and 50-μl aliquots were loaded onto a 7.5-15% gradient SDS-gel. This figure shows the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (panel A) and the corresponding immunoblot (panel B) of the pJHN-GLN17/EK1104 (lane 1), pJHN-GLN17/L673 (lane 2) transformants, and EK1104 and L673 cells transformed with the vector only (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). An SDS-polyacrylamide gel of 1 μg of partially purified interaction domain (panel C) is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the expression of the catalytic subdomain, pHG-GLN15-transformed cells were induced by heat shock (see “Experimental Procedures”). SDS-gel electrophoresis showed that extracts of pHG-GLN15 transformants contained a new species with a molecular mass of 21 kDa, that was not present in extracts of cells transformed with the vector. The recombinant protein reacted specifically with CAD antibodies indicating that it was part of the CAD polypeptide. Moreover, extracts of cells transformed with pHG-GLN15, but not the untransformed cells, had high glutaminase activity (Table 1). The protein was purified 667-fold (Table 1) by chromatography (Fig. 4) on a DEAE-Sephacryl column followed by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. A 500-ml culture usually yielded 30 μg of nearly homogeneous catalytic subdomain.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Figure 4:Expression and purification of the CAD GLNase catalytic subdomain. The recombinant, pHG-GLN15, which encodes the GLNase catalytic subdomain, was transformed into the Lon protease-deficient E. coli strain, L673(37Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and induced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell extracts were prepared as described in the legend to Fig. 3, from 6 ml of packed cells (60 mg of cell protein). The expression of the 21-kDa catalytic subdomain at 35, 90, and 150 min after heat shock (lanes 1-3) was shown by SDS-gel electrophoresis (panel B) and immunoblotting (panel D) of the pHG-GLN15 transformants. This species was not seen in extracts of cells transformed with the vector (lanes 4-6). For comparison, the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (panel A) and immunoblot (panel C) of EK1104 cells transformed with pHG-GLN52, which encodes the 40-kDa full-length GLNase domain, are also shown as is an SDS gel of 0.2 μg of the purified GLNase catalytic subdomain (panel E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Glutaminase Activity of the Purified GLNase Catalytic SubdomainThe isolated full-length GLNase domain was found to have barely detectable glutaminase activity(26Guy H.I.

Using the more sensitive HPLC assay method, a glutamine saturation curve was obtained which gave the kinetic parameters summarized in Table 2. The Km for glutamine was 46-fold higher, and the k was 8.5-fold lower than the corresponding values of CAD measured in the absence of ATP and bicarbonate.Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab In contrast, the purified catalytic subdomain was hyperactive (Fig. 5).
