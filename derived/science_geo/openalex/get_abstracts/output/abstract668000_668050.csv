https://openalex.org/W3126817342,"Background Healthcare workers are at increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies are warranted that examine socio-ecological factors associated with these outcomes to inform interventions that support healthcare workers during future disease outbreaks. Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional study of healthcare workers during May 2020 to assess the socio-ecological predictors of mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed factors at four socio-ecological levels: individual (e.g., gender), interpersonal (e.g., social support), institutional (e.g., personal protective equipment availability), and community (e.g., healthcare worker stigma). The Personal Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise scales assessed probable major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess unadjusted and adjusted associations between socio-ecological factors and mental health outcomes. Results Of the 1,092 participants, 72.0% were female, 51.9% were frontline workers, and the mean age was 40.4 years (standard deviation = 11.5). Based on cut-off scores, 13.9%, 15.6%, 22.8%, and 42.8% had probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD, respectively. In the multivariable adjusted models, needing more social support was associated with significantly higher odds of probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD. The significance of other factors varied across the outcomes. For example, at the individual level, female gender was associated with probable PTSD. At the institutional level, lower team cohesion was associated with probable PTSD, and difficulty following hospital policies with probable MD. At the community level, higher healthcare worker stigma was associated with probable PTSD and AUD, decreased satisfaction with the national government response with probable GAD, and higher media exposure with probable GAD and PTSD. Conclusions These findings can inform targeted interventions that promote healthcare workers’ psychological resilience during disease outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3127942813,"In this paper, we explore the utility of resting-state EEG measures as potential biomarkers for the detection and assessment of cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neurophysiological biomarkers of AD derived from EEG and FDG-PET, once characterized and validated, would expand the set of existing diagnostic molecular biomarkers of AD pathology with associated biomarkers of disease progression and neural dysfunction. Since symptoms of AD often begin to appear later in life, successful identification of EEG-based biomarkers must account for age-related neurophysiological changes that occur even in healthy individuals. To this end, we collected EEG data from individuals with AD (n = 26), MCI (n = 53), and cognitively normal healthy controls stratified by age into three groups: 18–40 (n = 129), 40–60 (n = 62) and 60–90 (= 55) years old. For each participant, we computed power spectral density at each channel and spectral coherence between pairs of channels. Compared to age matched controls, in the AD group, we found increases in both spectral power and coherence at the slower frequencies (Delta, Theta). A smaller but significant increase in power of slow frequencies was observed for the MCI group, localized to temporal areas. These effects on slow frequency spectral power opposed that of normal aging observed by a decrease in the power of slow frequencies in our control groups. The AD group showed a significant decrease in the spectral power and coherence in the Alpha band consistent with the same effect in normal aging. However, the MCI group did not show any significant change in the Alpha band. Overall, Theta to Alpha ratio (TAR) provided the largest and most significant differences between the AD group and controls. However, differences in the MCI group remained small and localized. We proposed a novel method to quantify these small differences between Theta and Alpha bands’ power using empirically derived distributions of spectral power across the time domain as opposed to averaging power across time. We defined Power Distribution Distance Measure (PDDM) as a distance measure between probability distribution functions (pdf) of Theta and Alpha power. Compared to average TAR, using PDDF enhanced the statistical significance, the effect size, and the spatial distribution of significant effects in the MCI group. We designed classifiers for differentiating individual MCI and AD participants from age-matched controls. The classification performance measured by the area under ROC curve after cross-validation were AUC = 0.85 and AUC = 0.6, for AD and MCI classifiers, respectively. Posterior probability of AD, TAR, and the proposed PDDM measure were all significantly correlated with MMSE score and neuropsychological tests in the AD group."
https://openalex.org/W3128149569,"Background In this study, we performed molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Hiroshima and its mutation pattern between the first and second waves of the outbreak. Method A total of 55 nasal swab samples from the first wave in Hiroshima and 13 from the second wave were examined quantitatively by RT-qPCR and qualitatively by nested PCR using specific primers. Four samples from each wave underwent next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis including controls and all sequences retrieved in Japan from GISAID and GenBank. Subsequently, mutations were examined. Results Viral load ranged 7.85 × 10 1 −1.42 × 10 8 copies/ml. Of 68 samples, one was Asian type-O, 65 were European type-GR, and 2 were undetectable. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that Japan was infected with various Asian strains (L, S, V, O) from January through April. By second week of March, European strains (G, GH, GR) had appeared, and GR strains became predominant after mid-March. The first case in Hiroshima was classified as Asian strain O, and the rest were GR strains. Then, second wave of GR strains appeared independently with 11–15 base mutations. Comparing the first- and second-wave GR strains, mutation rate was 1.17–1.36 × 10 −3 base substitutions per site per year; in addition, amino acid changes occurred at S1361P and P3371S in ORF1a, A314V in ORF1b, and P151L in N. All seven GR strains were D614G variants with R202K and G203R mutations in N. A single-nucleotide insertion in ORF8 that causes a defect in ORF8 protein was found in one isolate (S66) from the second wave. Conclusion Our findings reveal the evolutionary hierarchy of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. The predominant D614G variants and a new form of ORF8 deletion in Hiroshima provide the clue for role of viral factor in local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2."

This technology is supposed to reduce a lot of financing costs for SMEs on average. Therefore, this research extends complexity theory to discover the factors that affect the use of Blockchain loan systems by SMEs. Complexity, perceived risk, perceived fairness and reward sensitivity prove to have significant effects on usage intention. Complexity proves to have moderating effects on other relationships. This research may contribute to the system performance improvement and provide opportunities for SMEs to share information with financial institutions or individuals around the world, thereby providing investors with equal opportunities for competition."
https://openalex.org/W3128648529,"The scientific assessment of regional ecosystem service value (ESV) is helpful in developing scientific ecological protection plans and compensation policies. However, an ESV evaluation method that can adapt to the complex and diverse characteristics of the ecological environment has not been established. This study takes Gansu Province in China as an example, fully considering the regional differences in ecosystem service function. Five correction indices for the value equivalent factor per unit area were constructed on a provincial scale, and a regional difference adjustment index for 11 categories of ecosystem services was constructed on a regional scale. In this way, a value evaluation model based on regional differences was established. The results show that in 2015, the total ESV reached 2,239.56 billion yuan in Gansu Province, with ESV gradually increasing from the northeast to the southwest, and the high-value areas of service function being located in Qilian and Longnan Mountains. The forest and grassland ecosystems contributed the most to the ESV. From the perspective of value composition, local climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance functions are the main service functions of Gansu Province. From 2000 to 2015, ESV increased by 3.43 billion yuan in the province. The value of forest and urban ecosystems continued to increase, whereas the value of cultivated land ecosystem continued to decrease. In terms of spatial characteristics of the service value change, the area that experienced value reduction gradually moved from the central part of Gansu Province to the surrounding areas. The evaluation method proposed in this paper provides a relatively comprehensive evaluation scheme for the spatiotemporal dynamic evaluation of ESV in complex ecological environments."
https://openalex.org/W3126174451,"In recent years, gastronomy has become a fundamental motivation to travel. Learning how to prepare gastronomic dishes and about the raw materials that compose them has attracted increasing numbers of tourists. In Andalusia (region of southern Spain), there are many quality products endorsed by Protected Designations of Origin, around which gastronomic routes have been created, some visited often (e.g., wine) and others remaining unknown (e.g., ham and oil). This study analyses the profile of gastronomic tourists in Andalusia to understand their motivations and estimates the demand for gastronomic tourism using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models. The results obtained indicate that the gastronomic tourist in Andalusia is very satisfied with the places he/she visits and the gastronomy he/she savours. However, the demand for this tourist sector is very low and heterogeneous; while wine tourism is well established, tourism focusing on certain products, such as olive oil or ham, is practically non-existent. To obtain a homogeneous demand, synergies or pairings should be created between food products, e.g., wine-ham, oil-ham, etc., to attract a greater number of tourists and distinguish Andalusia as a gastronomic holiday destination."
https://openalex.org/W3127905780,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a hypervascular and aggressive primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Recent investigations showed that traditional therapies along with antiangiogenic therapies failed due to the development of post-therapy resistance and recurrence. Previous investigations showed that there were changes in the cellular and metabolic compositions in the tumor microenvironment (TME). It can be said that tumor cell-directed therapies are ineffective and rethinking is needed how to treat GBM. It is hypothesized that the composition of TME-associated cells will be different based on the therapy and therapeutic agents, and TME-targeting therapy will be better to decrease recurrence and improve survival. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the changes in the TME in respect of T-cell population, M1 and M2 macrophage polarization status, and MDSC population following different treatments in a syngeneic model of GBM. In addition to these parameters, tumor growth and survival were also studied following different treatments. The results showed that changes in the TME-associated cells were dependent on the therapeutic agents, and the TME-targeting therapy improved the survival of the GBM bearing animals. The current GBM therapies should be revisited to add agents to prevent the accumulation of bone marrow-derived cells in the TME or to prevent the effect of immune-suppressive myeloid cells in causing alternative neovascularization, the revival of glioma stem cells, and recurrence. Instead of concurrent therapy, a sequential strategy would be better to target TME-associated cells."
https://openalex.org/W3128233336,"Background Neonatal bacterial infections are a common cause of death, which can be managed well with inpatient treatment. Unfortunately, many families in low resource settings do not accept referral to a hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a guideline for management of young infants up to 2 months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible. Government of Ethiopia with WHO evaluated the feasibility of implementing this guideline to increase coverage of treatment. Objective The objective of this study was to implement a simplified antibiotic regimen (2 days gentamicin injection and 7 days oral amoxicillin) for management of sick young infants with PSBI in a programme setting when referral was not feasible to identify at least 80% of PSBI cases, achieve an overall adequate treatment coverage of at least 80% and document the challenges and opportunities for implementation at the community level in two districts in Tigray, Ethiopia. Methods Using implementation research, we applied the PSBI guideline in a programme setting from January 2016 to August 2017 in Raya Alamata and Raya Azebo Woredas (districts) in Southern Tigray, Ethiopia with a population of 260884. Policy dialogue was held with decision-makers, programme implementers and stakeholders at federal, regional and district levels, and a Technical Support Unit (TSU) was established. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) working at the health posts and supervisors working at the health centres were trained in WHO guideline to manage sick young infants when referral was not feasible. Communities were sensitized towards appropriate home care. Results We identified 854 young infants with any sign of PSBI in the study population of 7857 live births. The expected live births during the study period were 9821. Assuming 10% of neonates will have any sign of PSBI within the first 2 months of life (n = 982), the coverage of appropriate treatment of PSBI cases in our study area was 87% (854/982). Of the 854 sick young infants, 333 (39%) were taken directly to a hospital and 521 (61%) were identified by HEW at health posts. Of the 521 young infants, 27 (5.2%) had signs of critical illness, 181 (34.7%) had signs of clinical severe infection, whereas 313 (60.1%) young infants 7–59 days of age had only fast breathing pneumonia. All young infants with critical illness accepted referral to a hospital, while 117/181 (64.6%) infants with clinical severe infection accepted referral. Families of 64 (35.3%) infants with clinical severe infection refused referral and were treated at the health post with injectable gentamicin for 2 days plus oral amoxicillin for 7 days. All 64 completed recommended gentamicin doses and 63/64 (98%) completed recommended amoxicillin doses. Of 313 young infants, 7–59 days with pneumonia who were treated by the HEWs without referral with oral amoxicillin for 7 days, 310 (99%) received all 14 doses. No deaths were reported among those treated on an outpatient basis at health posts. But 35/477 (7%) deaths occurred among young infants treated at hospital. Conclusions When referral is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be managed appropriately at health posts by HEWs in the existing health system in Ethiopia with high coverage, low treatment failure and a low case fatality rate. Moreover, fast breathing pneumonia in infants 7–59 days of age can be successfully treated at the health post without referral. Relatively higher mortality in sick young infants at the referral level health facilities warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3112146071,"Background Hand-foot-and-mouth disease_(HFMD) is one of the most typical diseases in children that is associated with high morbidity. Reliable forecasting is crucial for prevention and control. Recently, hybrid models have become popular, and wavelet analysis has been widely performed. Better prediction accuracy may be achieved using wavelet-based hybrid models. Thus, our aim is to forecast number of HFMD cases with wavelet-based hybrid models. Materials and methods We fitted a wavelet-based seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)–neural network nonlinear autoregressive (NNAR) hybrid model with HFMD weekly cases from 2009 to 2016 in Zhengzhou, China. Additionally, a single SARIMA model, simplex NNAR model, and pure SARIMA–NNAR hybrid model were established for comparison and estimation. Results The wavelet-based SARIMA–NNAR hybrid model demonstrates excellent performance whether in fitting or forecasting compared with other models. Its fitted and forecasting time series are similar to the actual observed time series. Conclusions The wavelet-based SARIMA–NNAR hybrid model fitted in this study is suitable for forecasting the number of HFMD cases. Hence, it will facilitate the prevention and control of HFMD."
https://openalex.org/W3126852161,"Background Timely initiating antenatal care (ANC) is crucial in the countries that have high maternal morbidity and mortality. However, in developing countries including Ethiopia, pregnant mother’s time to initiate antenatal care was not well-studied. Therefore, this study aimed to assess time to first ANC and its predictors among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 7,543 pregnant women in Ethiopia using the Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey (EDHS), 2016 data. A two-stage stratified cluster sampling was employed. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate time to first antenatal care visit. Cox-gamma shared frailty model was applied to determine predictors. Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) with 95% confidence interval was reported as the effect size. Model adequacy was assessed by using the Cox-Snell residual plot. Statistical significance was considered at p value &lt;0.05. For data management and analysis Stata 14 was used. Results The median time to first ANC was 5 months with IQR (3,-). The independent predictors of time to first ANC visit were primary education [AHR: 1.24 (95%CI, 1.13–1.35)], secondary education [AHR: 1.28(95% CI, 1.11–1.47)], higher education [AHR: 1.43 (1.19–1.72)] as compared to women with no formal education. Having media exposure [AHR: 1.13 (95% CI, 1.03–1.24)], early initiation of ANC increases by 25% [AHR: 1.25 (95% CI, 1.12–1.40)] in poorer, 32% [AHR: 1.32 (95% CI, 1.17–1.49)] in middle, 37% [AHR: 1.37 (95% CI, 1.20–1.56)] in richer and 41% [AHR: 1.41 (95%CI, 1.1.19–1.67)] in richest households as compared to poorest household wealth index. Living in city administration, media exposure and community women literacy were also enabler factors, while, long distance from health facility and nomadic region residency were hindering factors of early ANC visit. Conclusions The current study revealed that women’s time to first antenatal care visit was by far late in Ethiopia as compared to the world health organization recommendation (WHO). The predictors of time to first ANC visit were education status of women, having media exposure, level of household wealth index, community women literacy ad distance to health facility. It is vital that maternal and child health policies and strategies better to be directed at women development and also designing and applying interventions that intended to increase timely initiation ANC among pregnant-women. Researchers also recommended conducting studies using a stronger design like a cohort to establish temporality and reduce biases."
https://openalex.org/W3128875988,"To investigate if the anxiety associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a promoting factor to tinnitus. A retrospective research design collected from 188 tinnitus patients, was used to compare the clinical characteristics of tinnitus between the patients in 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the matching period in 2019. While anxiety was quantified using the Zung’s Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the test of tinnitus loudness (TL). The assessments were repeated after the sound therapy plus educational counselling (STEC) for 38 patients in 2020 and 58 patients in 2019 and compared with EC alone therapy for 42 patients in 2020 and 17 patients in 2019. A large increase in anxiety was evident in 2020 in both case rate and SAS. The treatment of both methods was less effective in 2020. SAS, THI and TL were all deteriorated after the EC alone treatment in 2020, while an improvement was seen in 2019. This suggests that EC alone could not counteract the stress by COVID-19 at all, and the stress, if not managed well, can significantly increase the severity of tinnitus and associated anxiety. By using the EC subgroup in virtual control, we conclude that anxiety can serve as a promoting factor to tinnitus. We believe that this is the first study report that confirm the causative/promotive role of anxiety on tinnitus during COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3126509598,"The cost of human movement, whether expressed in time, effort, or distance, is a function of natural and human related variables. At the same time, human movement itself, whether on land, air or sea, causes environmental cost. We are looking into the long-term environmental relationship of this interplay. Gullies—linear landforms, which dissect the landscape—are considered to be a cost for human movement, as they can form unpassable barriers destroying present path networks. On the other hand, human movement creates pathways, which flatten the surface and decrease the water permeability potential. This process results in runoff generation and possibly gully erosion. Accordingly, the spatial relationship between pathways and gullies is investigated. In the Tigray region of the Northern Ethiopian Highlands, gullies and pathways were mapped using remote sensing data. Frequency Ratio was used for assessing pathways as a variable affecting the location of gullies while Least Cost Paths were tested to evaluate the possible constraining impact gullies have on mobility. Based on these results, it is concluded that a positive feedback exists between the cost of human movement and gully erosion. We further discuss possible effects gullies may have had on trade, territory, and political affairs in Tigray. Consequently, we suggest that movement cost and gullying may not only hold strictly environmental or movement-related implications, but also socio-cultural ones."
https://openalex.org/W3127562762,"The first decades of the 21st century have witnessed a renewed interest in the relationship between language structure and the various social and ecological niches in which the languages of the world are used and against the background of which they evolved. In this context, Everett (2013) argued for direct geographical influences on the sound structure of languages. It was observed that ejective consonants, produced with a sudden burst of non-pulmonic air to a salient acoustic effect, tend to occur in high-altitude environments in which these sounds may be adaptive due to a reduced articulatory effort and/or to prevent desiccation. Here, we evaluate this claim and at the same time place it into a broader context. We observe that the distribution of another class of typologically unusual sounds, uvulars, is highly similar to that of ejectives, but that the proposed explanations are not available to account for the similar geographical patterning of uvulars. Hence, we test an alternative explanatory account that would posit indirect rather than direct environmental influences on language structure that are mediated by anthropological factors, in particular the relative sociolinguistic isolation of speech communities at the highest altitudes. Applying Bayesian Logistic Mixed Effects Regression to a large database of phonological inventories of the world’s languages, however, we do not find strong support for either a correlation of ejectives or uvulars with high-altitude environments, though the association is somewhat stronger for ejectives than uvulars. A phylogenetic exploration of the development of both classes of sounds in two large language families spoken in widely different environments, Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan, together with a qualitative assessment of the dedicated literature, in contrast, suggests a strong role of language contact rather than environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W3128817409,"Vascular leak is a hallmark of severe dengue, and high leukotriene levels have been observed in dengue mouse models, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis. We sought to explore their role in acute dengue, by assessing levels of urinary LTE4 and urinary histamine in patients with varying severity of acute dengue.Urinary LTE4, histamine and creatinine were measured by a quantitative ELISA, in healthy individuals (n = 19), patients with dengue fever (DF = 72) and dengue haemorrhagic fever DHF (n = 48). The kinetics of LTE4 and histamine and diurnal variations were assessed in a subset of patients.Urinary LTE4 levels were significantly higher (p = 0.004) in patients who proceed to develop DHF when compared to patients with DF during early illness (≤ 4 days) and during the critical phase (p = 0.02), which continued to rise in patients who developed DHF during the course of illness. However, LTE4 is unlikely to be a good biomarker as ROCs gave an AUC value of 0.67 (95% CI 0.57 and 0.76), which was nevertheless significant (p = 0.002). Urinary LTE4 levels did not associate with the degree of viraemia, infecting virus serotype and was not different in those with primary vs secondary dengue. Urinary histamine levels were significantly high in patients with acute dengue although no difference was observed between patients with DF and DHF and again did not associate with the viraemia. Interestingly, LTE4, histamine and the viral loads showed a marked diurnal variation in both patients with DF and DHF.Our data suggest that LTE4 could play a role in disease pathogenesis and since there are safe and effective cysteinyl leukotriene receptor blockers, it would be important to assess their efficacy in reducing dengue disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3127128031,"Background Only approximately one in five adults are offered HIV testing by providers when seeking care for symptoms of acute illness in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our aims were to estimate testing coverage and identify predictors of provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) and barriers to PITC implementation in this population. Methods We assessed HIV testing coverage among adult outpatients 18–39 years of age at four public and two private health facilities in coastal Kenya, during a 3- to 6-month surveillance period at each facility. A subset of patients who reported symptoms including fever, diarrhoea, fatigue, body aches, sore throat or genital ulcers were enrolled to complete a questionnaire independently of PITC offer. We assessed predictors of PITC in this population using generalised estimating equations and identified barriers to offering PITC through focus group discussion with healthcare workers (HCW) at each facility. Results Overall PITC coverage was 13.7% (1600 of 11,637 adults tested), with 1.9% (30) testing positive. Among 1,374 participants enrolled due to symptoms, 378 (27.5%) were offered PITC and 352 (25.6%) were tested, of whom 3.7% (13) tested positive. Among participants offered HIV testing, 93.1% accepted it; among participants not offered testing, 92.8% would have taken an HIV test if offered. The odds of completed PITC were increased among older participants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–2.1 for 30–39 years, relative to 18–24 years), men (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.7); casual labourers (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.7); those paying by cash (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0–1.4) or insurance (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5–5.8); participants with fever (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2–1.8) or genital ulcers (aOR 4.0, 95% CI 2.7–6.0); and who had tested for HIV &gt;1 year ago (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–2.0) or had never tested (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.1). Provider barriers to PITC implementation included lack of HCW knowledge and confidence implementing guidelines, limited capacity and health systems constraints. Conclusion PITC coverage was low, though most patients would accept testing if offered. Missed opportunities to promote testing during care-seeking were common and innovative solutions are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3127472569,"Background Here, we have demonstrated that gestational low-protein (LP) intake offspring present lower birth weight, reduced nephron numbers, renal salt excretion, arterial hypertension, and renal failure development compared to regular protein (NP) intake rats in adulthood. We evaluated the expression of various miRNAs and predicted target genes in the kidney in gestational 17-days LP (DG-17) fetal metanephros to identify molecular pathways involved in the proliferation and differentiation of renal embryonic or fetal cells. Methods Pregnant Wistar rats were classified into two groups based on protein supply during pregnancy: NP (regular protein diet, 17%) or LP diet (6%). Renal miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq) performed on the MiSeq platform, RT-qPCR of predicted target genes , immunohistochemistry, and morphological analysis of 17-DG NP and LP offspring were performed using previously described methods. Results A total of 44 miRNAs, of which 19 were up and 25 downregulated, were identified in 17-DG LP fetuses compared to age-matched NP offspring. We selected 7 miRNAs involved in proliferation, differentiation, and cellular apoptosis. Our findings revealed reduced cell number and Six-2 and c-Myc immunoreactivity in metanephros cap (CM) and ureter bud (UB) in 17-DG LP fetuses. Ki-67 immunoreactivity in CM was 48% lesser in LP compared to age-matched NP fetuses. Conversely, in LP CM and UB, β-catenin was 154%, and 85% increased, respectively. Furthermore, mTOR immunoreactivity was higher in LP CM (139%) and UB (104%) compared to that in NP offspring. TGFβ-1 positive cells in the UB increased by approximately 30% in the LP offspring. Moreover, ZEB1 metanephros-stained cells increased by 30% in the LP offspring. ZEB2 immunofluorescence, although present in the entire metanephros, was similar in both experimental groups. Conclusions Maternal protein restriction changes the expression of miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during renal development. Renal ontogenic dysfunction, caused by maternal protein restriction, promotes reduced reciprocal interaction between CM and UB; consequently, a programmed and expressive decrease in nephron number occurs in the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W3126893598,"Evidence-based models emphasizing on lifestyle behaviours for the treatment of drug use is still in its infancy. The development of multicomponent effective drug use intervention programs as part of health promotion is crucial to decrease risk of relapse. This study aims at exploring the lifestyle practices including dietary intake, physical activity and sleep of people who use drugs undergoing residential rehabilitation treatment in Lebanon with its perceived benefits and pitfalls. A purposive sample of 18 males and 9 females at different stages of recovery from drug use in rehabilitation centers participated in the qualitative discussions. The six phases thematic analysis revealed three themes: chaotic lifestyle, structuredlifestyle, benefits and pitfalls, and suggestions for making rehabilitation a better experience. Participants discussed their chaotic lifestyle during addiction with poor food intake, disrupted sleep and low physical activity moving to a more disciplined routine enforcing normality in lifestyle practices with social and professionlprofessional support. The early phases of treatment were marked with increased food intake and weight gain perceived as a health indicator and the sole divergent from drugs, moving towards more structured meals and efforts to lose weight in later stages. Lack of variety of Physical activity programs taking into consideration the motivational differences among the participants was also highlighted. Measures for improving rehabilitation services in terms of promoting healthy eating behaviours and environmental control were thoroughly addressed. These findings shed the light on the challenges faced in maintaining a healthy lifestyle in rehabilitation centers and the necessities of addressing them to improve the overall rehabilitation experience, prevent relapse and inform the development of future targeted intervention programs tackling all aspects of behavioural changes."
https://openalex.org/W3126147329,"Introduction Olfactory dysfunction (OD) affects a majority of COVID-19 patients, is atypical in duration and recovery, and is associated with focal opacification and inflammation of the olfactory epithelium. Given recent increased emphasis on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the purpose of the present study was to experimentally characterize aerosol dispersion within olfactory epithelium (OE) and respiratory epithelium (RE) in human subjects, to determine if small (sub 5μm) airborne aerosols selectively deposit in the OE. Methods Healthy adult volunteers inhaled fluorescein-labeled nebulized 0.5–5μm airborne aerosol or atomized larger aerosolized droplets (30–100μm). Particulate deposition in the OE and RE was assessed by blue-light filter modified rigid endoscopic evaluation with subsequent image randomization, processing and quantification by a blinded reviewer. Results 0.5–5μm airborne aerosol deposition, as assessed by fluorescence gray value, was significantly higher in the OE than the RE bilaterally, with minimal to no deposition observed in the RE (maximum fluorescence: OE 19.5(IQR 22.5), RE 1(IQR 3.2), p&lt;0.001; average fluorescence: OE 2.3(IQR 4.5), RE 0.1(IQR 0.2), p&lt;0.01). Conversely, larger 30–100μm aerosolized droplet deposition was significantly greater in the RE than the OE (maximum fluorescence: OE 13(IQR 14.3), RE 38(IQR 45.5), p&lt;0.01; average fluorescence: OE 1.9(IQR 2.1), RE 5.9(IQR 5.9), p&lt;0.01). Conclusions Our data experimentally confirm that despite bypassing the majority of the upper airway, small-sized (0.5–5μm) airborne aerosols differentially deposit in significant concentrations within the olfactory epithelium. This provides a compelling aerodynamic mechanism to explain atypical OD in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3126475406,"Background This study set out to determine the prevalence of low bone mass following long-term exposure to antiretroviral therapy in Ugandan people living with HIV. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 199 people living with HIV that had been on anti-retroviral therapy for at least 10 years. All participants had dual X-ray absorptiometry to determine their bone mineral density. The data collected included antiretroviral drug history and behavioral risk data Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Inferential statistics were analyzed using multilevel binomial longitudinal Markov chain Monte Carlo mixed multivariate regression modelling using the rstanarm package. Results One hundred ninety nine adults were enrolled with equal representation of males and females. The mean age was 39.5 (SD 8.5) years. Mean durations on anti-retroviral treatment was 12.1 (SD 1.44) years, CD4 cell count was 563.9 cells/mm 3 . 178 (89.5%) had viral suppression with &lt;50 viral copies/ml. There were 4 (2.0%) and 36 (18%) participants with low bone mass of the hip and lumbar spine respectively. Each unit increase in body mass index was associated with a significant reduction in the odds for low bone mineral density of the hip and lumbar spine. The duration on and exposure to the various antiretroviral medications had no significant effect on the participant’s odds for developing low bone mass. All the coefficients of the variables in a multivariable model for either hip or lumbar spine bone mass were not significant. Conclusion These results provide additional evidence that patients on long term ART achieve bone mass stabilization. Maintaining adequate body weight is important in maintaining good bone health in people on antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3127300778,"The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) magnetized on applying an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to stimulate the thermal characteristics and to induce tumor apoptosis is a currently active area of research in cancer treatment. In previous work, we developed biocompatible and superparamagnetic polystyrene-sulfonic-acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles (PSS-MNPs) as applications for magnetically labeled cell trapping, but without assessment of treatment effects on tumor diseases. In the present work, we examined PSS-MNP-induced magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) on SK-Hep1 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells for lethal thermal effects with a self-made AMF system; an adjustable AMF frequency generated a variable intensity of magnetic field and induced MNP relaxation. The extracellular and intracellular MFH treatments on a SK-Hep1 cell line were implemented in vitro ; the result indicates that the lethal effects were efficient and caused a significantly decreased cell viability of SK-Hep1 cells. As the PSS-MNP concentration decreased, especially in intracellular MFH treatments, the MFH effects on cells, however, largely decreased through heat spreading to the culture medium. On controlling and decreasing the volume of culture medium, the problem of heat spreading was solved. It can be consequently expected that PSS-MNPs would be a prospective agent for intracellular cancer magnetotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3127764966,"Healthy aging is associated with a decline in cognitive function, and is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases. Although, there are several evidence that brain mitochondrial function is altered with aging its significance at the cellular level is elusive. In this study, we have investigated mitochondrial TCA cycle and neurotransmitter cycle fluxes associated with glutamatergic, GABAergic neurons and astroglia in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of young (6 months) and aged (24 months) C57BL6 mice by using 1H-[13C]-NMR spectroscopy together with timed infusion of 13C-labeled glucose and acetate. The ratio VCyc/VTCA was determined from a steady-state [2-13C]acetate experiment. Metabolic fluxes were obtained by fitting a three-compartment metabolic model to 13C turnover of amino acids from glucose. Levels of glutamate, aspartate and taurine were reduced in the cerebral cortex, while glutamine and choline were elevated in the hippocampus of aged mice. Interestingly, the rate of acetate oxidation increased in the cerebral cortex, while the flux of mitochondrial TCA cycle of glutamatergic neurons decreased in the cerebral cortex (P < .0001) and hippocampus (P = .025) of aged mice. The glutamate-glutamine neurotransmitter cycle flux was reduced in the cerebral cortex (P < .0001). The GABAergic TCA cycle flux was reduced in the cerebral cortex (P = .0008), while GABA-glutamine neurotransmitter cycling flux was also reduced in the cerebral cortex (P = .011) and hippocampus (P = .042) of aged brain. In conclusion, the reduction in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter activity of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus correlates qualitatively with declined cognitive function in aged mice."
https://openalex.org/W3128721729,"Physical activity has positive health implications for individuals living with neurodegenerative diseases. The success of physical activity programs, particularly in culturally and linguistically diverse populations, is typically dependent on their alignment with the culture, lifestyle and environmental context of those involved. Aboriginal families living in remote communities in the Top End of Australia invited researchers to collaborate with them to co-design a physical activity and lifestyle program to keep individuals with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) walking and moving around. The knowledge of Aboriginal families living with MJD, combined with findings from worldwide MJD research, formed the foundation for the co-design. An experience-based co-design (EBCD) approach, drawing from Indigenous and Participatory methodologies, was used. An expert panel of individuals with lived experience of MJD participated in a series of co-design phases. Prearranged and spontaneous co-design meetings were led by local community researchers within each phase. Data was collected using a culturally responsive ethnographic approach and analysed thematically. Sixteen panel members worked to develop the ‘Staying Strong Toolbox’ to cater for individuals with MJD who are ‘walking strong’; or ‘wobbly’; or ‘in a wheelchair’. Based on the ‘Staying Strong Framework’, the Toolbox was developed as a spiral bound A3 book designed to guide the user to select from a range of activities to keep them walking and moving around and to identify those activities most important to them to work on. The ‘Staying Strong Toolbox’ is a community driven, evidence based resource for a physical activity and lifestyle program for Aboriginal families with MJD. The Toolbox provides a guide for health professionals and support workers to deliver person-centred support to Aboriginal families with MJD, and that can be modified for use by other families with MJD or people with other forms of ataxia around the world."
https://openalex.org/W3126498241,"Emerging evidence that an elevated serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer, but still controversial. The aim of this study to assess the relationship between GGT level and risk of gastrointestinal cancer, and the contribution of the interaction of hyperglycemia with elevated GGT level to the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer by the stratified analysis. A total of 8,120,665 Koreans who received medical checkups in 2009 were included. Subjects were classified according to the quartile of GGT level for women and men. The incidence rates of gastrointestinal cancer for each group were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 129,853 cases of gastrointestinal cancer newly occurred (esophagus, 3,792; stomach, 57,932; and colorectal, 68,789 cases). The highest GGT quartile group showed an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer (esophagus, hazard ratio = 2.408 [95% confidence interval, 2.184–2.654]; stomach, 1.121 [1.093–1.149]; and colorectal, 1.185 [1.158–1.211]). The risk increased significantly with the rise in GGT quartile level, regardless of the site of cancer. The stratified analysis according to glycemic status showed that the effect of elevated GGT was predominant in the risk of esophageal cancer. The effect of elevated GGT further increased the risk of stomach and colorectal cancers in diabetic patients. An elevated level of GGT was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer, regardless of the site of cancer. The effect of the increase in GGT level on the risk of gastrointestinal cancer depended on the type of cancer and glycemic status."
https://openalex.org/W3126966790,"Purpose Studies using magnetic resonance imaging to assess lumbar multifidus cross-sectional area frequently utilize T1 or T2-weighted sequences, but seldom provide the rationale for their sequence choice. However, technical considerations between their acquisition protocols could impact on the ability to assess lumbar multifidus anatomy or its fat/muscle distinction. Our objectives were to examine the concurrent validity of lumbar multifidus morphology measures of T2 compared to T1-weighted sequences, and to assess the reliability of repeated lumbar multifidus measures. Methods The lumbar multifidus total cross-sectional area of 45 patients was measured bilaterally at L4 and L5, with histogram analysis determining the muscle/fat threshold values per muscle. Images were later re-randomized and re-assessed for intra-rater reliability. Matched images were visually rated for consistency of outlining between both image sequences. Bland-Altman bias, limits of agreement, and plots were calculated for differences in total cross-sectional area and percentage fat between and within sequences, and intra-rater reliability analysed. Results T1-weighted total cross-sectional area measures were systematically larger than T2 (0.2 cm 2 ), with limits of agreement &lt;±10% at both spinal levels. For percentage fat, no systematic bias occurred, but limits of agreement approached ±15%. Visually, muscle outlining was consistent between sequences, with substantial mismatches occurring in &lt;5% of cases. Intra-rater reliability was excellent (ICC: 0.981–0.998); with bias and limits of agreement less than 1% and ±5%, respectively. Conclusion Total cross-sectional area measures and outlining of muscle boundaries were consistent between sequences, and intra-rater reliability for total cross-sectional area and percentage fat was high indicating that either MRI sequence could be used interchangeably for this purpose. However, further studies comparing the accuracy of various methods for distinguishing fat from muscle are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3128385559,"Objectives We set out to evaluate the effect of postnatal exposure to tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy on bone mineral density among breastfeeding women living with HIV. Design IMPAACT P1084s is a sub-study of the PROMISE randomized trial conducted in four African countries ( ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01066858). Methods IMPAACT P1084s enrolled eligible mother-infant pairs previously randomised in the PROMISE trial at one week after delivery to receive either maternal antiretroviral therapy (Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate / Emtricitabine + Lopinavir/ritonavir–maternal TDF-ART) or administer infant nevirapine, with no maternal antiretroviral therapy, to prevent breastmilk HIV transmission. Maternal lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at postpartum weeks 1 and 74. We studied the effect of the postpartum randomization on percent change in maternal bone mineral density in an intention-to-treat analysis with a t-test; mean and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are presented. Results Among 398/400 women included in this analysis, baseline age, body-mass index, CD4 count, mean bone mineral density and alcohol use were comparable between study arms. On average, maternal lumbar spine bone mineral density declined significantly through week 74 in the maternal TDF-ART compared to the infant nevirapine arm; mean difference (95%CI) -2.86 (-4.03, -1.70) percentage points (p-value &lt;0.001). Similarly, maternal hip bone mineral density declined significantly more through week 74 in the maternal TDF-ART compared to the infant nevirapine arm; mean difference -2.29% (-3.20, -1.39) (p-value &lt;0.001). Adjusting for covariates did not change the treatment effect. Conclusions Bone mineral density decline through week 74 postpartum was greater among breastfeeding HIV-infected women randomized to receive maternal TDF-ART during breastfeeding compared to those mothers whose infants received nevirapine prophylaxis."
https://openalex.org/W3128442157,"Objectives To evaluate the different policies to recognize child maltreatment in emergency departments (EDs) in Europe in order to define areas of improvement. Methods A survey was conducted on the recognition of child maltreatment in EDs in European countries with a focus on screening methods, parental risk factors, training and hospital policies. The survey was distributed through different key members from the EUSEM, REPEM and the EuSEN. A summary score based on the NICE guideline (4 questions on child characteristics, 4 questions on parental characteristics and 5 questions on hospital policy) was calculated. Results We analysed 185 completed surveys, representing 148 hospitals from 29 European countries. Of the respondents, 28.6% used a screening tool, and 31.8% had guidelines on parental risk factors. A total of 42.2% did not follow training based on child characteristics, and 57.6% did not follow training on parental characteristics. A total of 71.9% indicated that there was a need for training. 50.8% of the respondents reported a standardized policy for the detection of child maltreatment. Translating the survey results to NICE summary scores of the EDs in Europe, we found that 25.6% (34/133) met most, 22.6% (30/133) met some and 51.9% (69/133) met few of the NICE guideline recommendations. More specifically, with respect to hospital policies, 33.8% (45/133) met most, 15.0% (20/133) met some and 51.1% (68/133) met few of the NICE guideline recommendations. Conclusion There is high variability regarding policies for child maltreatment detection and only a quarter of the EDs met most of the NICE guideline recommendations for child maltreatment. There is a need for the use of screening tools, training of ED staff and implementation of local hospital policies."
https://openalex.org/W3128801182,"Bacterial Infections remains a leading cause of death in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). In this era of rising antimicrobial resistance, new tools are needed to guide antimicrobial use. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), resistin, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) waveform and C-reactive protein (CRP) for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection (SBI) in children on admission to PICU and their use as prognostic indicators.A regional PICU in the United Kingdom.Consecutive PICU admissions between October 2010 and June 2012.Blood samples were collected daily for biomarker measurement. The primary outcome measure was performance of study biomarkers for diagnosis of SBI on admission to PICU based on clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria. Secondary outcomes included durations of PICU stay and invasive ventilation and 28-day mortality. Patients were followed up to day 28 post-admission.A total of 657 patients were included in the study. 92 patients (14%) fulfilled criteria for SBI. 28-day mortality was 2.6% (17/657), but 8.7% (8/92) for patients with SBI. The combination of PCT, resistin, plasma NGAL and CRP resulted in the greatest net reclassification improvement compared to CRP alone (0.69, p<0.005) with 10.5% reduction in correct classification of patients with SBI (p 0.52) but a 78% improvement in correct classification of patients without events (p <0.005). A statistical model of prolonged duration of PICU stay found log-transformed maximum values of biomarkers performed better than first recorded biomarkers. The final model included maximum values of CRP, plasma NGAL, lymphocyte and platelet count (AUC 79%, 95% CI 73.7% to 84.2%). Longitudinal profiles of biomarkers showed PCT levels to decrease most rapidly following admission SBI.Combinations of biomarkers, including PCT, may improve accurate and timely identification of SBI on admission to PICU."
https://openalex.org/W3128984532,"Background To investigate the prognostic value of gene variants and copy number variations (CNVs) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), an integrative genomic analysis was performed. Methods Sixty-seven patients with NDMM exhibiting more than 60% plasma cells in the bone marrow aspirate were enrolled in the study. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on bone marrow nucleated cells. Mutation and CNV analyses were performed using the CNVkit and Nexus Copy Number software. In addition, karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization were utilized for the integrated analysis. Results Eighty-three driver gene mutations were detected in 63 patients with NDMM. The median number of mutations per patient was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0–3.0, range = 0–8). MAML2 and BHLHE41 mutations were associated with decreased survival. CNVs were detected in 56 patients (72.7%; 56/67). The median number of CNVs per patient was 6.0 (95% CI = 5.7–7.0; range = 0–16). Among the CNVs, 1q gain, 6p gain, 6q loss, 8p loss, and 13q loss were associated with decreased survival. Additionally, 1q gain and 6p gain were independent adverse prognostic factors. Increased numbers of CNVs and driver gene mutations were associated with poor clinical outcomes. Cluster analysis revealed that patients with the highest number of driver mutations along with 1q gain, 6p gain, and 13q loss exhibited the poorest prognosis. Conclusions In addition to the known prognostic factors, the integrated analysis of genetic variations and CNVs could contribute to prognostic stratification of patients with NDMM."
https://openalex.org/W3129161572,"One method for the evaluation of sensorimotor therapeutic interventions, the horizontal ladder walking task, analyzes locomotor changes that may occur after disease, injury, or by external manipulation. Although this task is well suited for detection of large effects, it may overlook smaller changes. The inability to detect small effect sizes may be due to a neural compensatory mechanism known as ""cross limb transfer"", or the contribution of the contralateral limb to estimate an injured or perturbed limb's position. The robust transfer of compensation from the contralateral limb may obscure subtle locomotor outcomes that are evoked by clinically relevant therapies, in the early onset of disease, or between higher levels of recovery. Here, we propose angled rungs as a novel modification to the horizontal ladder walking task. Easily-adjustable angled rungs force rats to locomote across a different locomotion path for each hindlimb and may therefore make information from the contralateral limb less useful. Using hM3Dq (excitatory) Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) expressed in large diameter peripheral afferents of the hindlimb in the intact animal, we characterized the sensitivity of our design to detect stepping differences by comparing locomotor changes observed on angled rungs to those observed on a standard horizontal ladder. On our novel asymmetrical ladder, activation of DREADDs resulted in significant differences in rung misses (p = 0.000011) and weight-supporting events (p = 0.049). By comparison, on a standard ladder, we did not observe differences in these parameters (p = 0.86 and p = 0.98, respectively). Additionally, no locomotor differences were detected in baseline and inactivated DREADDs trials when we compared ladder types, suggesting that the angled rungs do not change animal gait behavior unless intervention or injury is introduced. Significant changes observed with angled rungs may demonstrate more sensitive probing of locomotor changes due to the decoupling of cross limb transfer."
https://openalex.org/W3126577076,"Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite, which has three unique secretory organelles: micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. Almost all the secreted proteins are transported through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi system to function in their respective destination by accurate targeting and packaging. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a supergene family enzyme that has multiple functions, which include regulation of cell proliferation and death signaling pathways, and participation in transportation and metabolism in mammal cells. However, the role of GST in Toxoplasma gondii has not been explained. In this study, we identified three GST proteins in T gondii, of which GST2 acts as a membrane protein that localizes to the Golgi-endosomal system and colocalizes with proteins involved in vesicle transport as well, including synaptobrevin, putative sortilin (VPS10), Rab5 and Rab6, which function as vesicle transport factors. Moreover, the loss of TgGST2 leads to Rab5 and Rab6 distribution of discrete puncta, and incorrect localization and decreased expression of several secretory proteins, and to significantly reduced invasion capacity and virulence to mice. Consistent with its relation to vesicle transport proteins, the distribution of TgGST2 relies on post-Golgi trafficking. Overall, our findings demonstrated that TgGST2 contributes to vesicle trafficking and plays a critical role in parasite lytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W3127689713,"The dynamics of recovery of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and its impact on controlling clinically significant CMV infections following hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are rarely reported in pediatric HSCT recipients. In this study, dynamics of recovery of CMV-specific CMI and its clinical significance in controlling CMV viremia and clinically significant CMV infections were assessed in pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients. All subjects underwent CMV pp65- and IE1-specific enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays just before transplantation and then monthly until the detection of CMV-specific CMI with ≥ 5 spot-forming cells (SFC) / 2.0 × 10 5 cells. Clinically significant CMV infections were defined as CMV diseases, prolonged CMV infections, recurrent CMV infections or late onset CMV infections. Among 52 recipients, 88.5% of recipients recovered CMV-specific CMI with ≥ 5 SFC/ 2.0 × 10 5 cells at a median of 34 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 29–95 days) following HSCT, 55.8% at 30 days following HSCT, and 73.1% at 90 days following HSCT. The presence of CMV-specific CMI before HSCT was the significant factors for the reconstitution of CMV specific CMI after HSCT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–142.86). After HSCT, 30 recipients experienced CMV viremia, of which 20 were clinically significant CMV infections. The full recovery of CMV-specific CMI with ≥ 50 SFC / 2.0 × 10 5 cells after HSCT was the protective factor for the development of clinically significant CMV infections (aOR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.22–0.71). In the haploidentical HSCT recipients, 82.1% recovered CMV-specific CMI at a median of 65 days after HSCT (IQR: 34–118 days) with a tendency to recover their CMV-specific CMI later than did those from non-haploidentical donors (65 days vs. 30 days; P = 0.001). Clinically significant CMV infections tended to occur more frequently in the haploidentical HSCT recipients compared to those with matched donor HSCT (46.4% vs. 29.2%; P = 0.205). The full recovery of CMV-specific CMI with ≥ 50 SFC/2.0 × 10 5 cells after HSCT also lowered the risk of development of clinically significant CMV infections (aOR = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01–0.90). However, transplantation from haploidentical donors was a significant risk factor hampering recovery of CMV-specific CMI (aOR = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01–0.86) and full recovery of CMV-specific CMI (aOR = 0.05; 95% CI = 0.01–0.50). Pre-transplant CMV-specific CMI influenced the recovery of CMV-specific CMI, and the full recovery of CMV-specific CMI could be a surrogate marker for preventing clinically significant CMV infections in pediatric HSCT recipients. Immunologic monitoring using ELISPOT assay before and after HSCT helps in identifying patients with a high risk of CMV infection and in controlling CMV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3128103160,"Background It is essential to provide safe healthcare in complex, difficult, and quickly changing conditions. The quality of healthcare services directly influences the safety of both the patients and staff. Understanding healthcare staff attitudes toward safety in the healthcare delivery context is foundational for building a culture of safety. Aim of the work To adapt, via a structured translation methodology, the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire–Short Form (SAQ-SF), which assesses how employees of the health care sector perceive the safety climate in their workplace, to the Polish context. Methods Using a content validation approach to structure the translation process, we tested and psychometrically analysed the translated SAQ-SF. The sample comprised 322 employees of a district hospital (second referral level, which ensures 24/7 emergency care services) in Poland. Results The reliability of the sub-scales of the Polish version of the SAQ-SF ranged from 0.66 to 0.95. The discriminatory power of particular SAQ items ranged between 0.02 and 0.90. For 6 out of the 8 scale dimensions, the questions with the highest factor loadings were those measuring the same dimensions of the safety climate, according to the original scale. Conclusions The Polish version of the SAQ-SF (SAQ-SF-PL) meets the criteria of psychometric and functional validation as well as demonstrates good reliability as a measure of patient safety culture in the Polish context. The SAQ-SF-PL is an instrument that enable a valid and reliable assessment of patient safety climate in the Polish healthcare facilities and identify opportunities for improvement. International comparisons will also become easier."
https://openalex.org/W3128155386,"Background Additional progress towards HIV epidemic control requires understanding who remains at risk of HIV infection in the context of high uptake of universal testing and treatment (UTT). We sought to characterize seroconverters and risk factors in the SEARCH UTT trial (NCT01864603), which achieved high uptake of universal HIV testing and ART coverage in 32 communities of adults (≥15 years) in rural Uganda and Kenya. Methods In a pooled cohort of 117,114 individuals with baseline HIV negative test results, we described those who seroconverted within 3 years, calculated gender-specific HIV incidence rates, evaluated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) for seroconversion using multivariable targeted maximum likelihood estimation, and assessed potential infection sources based on self-report. Results Of 704 seroconverters, 63% were women. Young (15–24 years) men comprised a larger proportion of seroconverters in Western Uganda (18%) than Eastern Uganda (6%) or Kenya (10%). After adjustment for other risk factors, men who were mobile [≥1 month of prior year living outside community] (aRR:1.68; 95%CI:1.09,2.60) or who HIV tested at home vs. health fair (aRR:2.44; 95%CI:1.89,3.23) were more likely to seroconvert. Women who were aged ≤24 years (aRR:1.91; 95%CI:1.27,2.90), mobile (aRR:1.49; 95%CI:1.04,2.11), or reported a prior HIV test (aRR:1.34; 95%CI:1.06,1.70), or alcohol use (aRR:2.07; 95%CI:1.34,3.22) were more likely to seroconvert. Among survey responders (N = 607, 86%), suspected infection source was more likely for women than men to be ≥10 years older (28% versus 8%) or a spouse (51% vs. 31%) and less likely to be transactional sex (10% versus 16%). Conclusion In the context of universal testing and treatment, additional strategies tailored to regional variability are needed to address HIV infection risks of young women, alcohol users, mobile populations, and those engaged in transactional sex to further reduce HIV incidence rates."
https://openalex.org/W3128663619,"This study explores pregnant women's and healthcare providers' perspectives on the role of patient-provider communication in experiences of antenatal anxiety within a low-resource setting. In 2017-18, we consecutively sampled pregnant women (n = 19) with at least mild anxiety and purposively sampled antenatal care providers (n = 10) from a public hospital in Punjab Province, Pakistan. We then conducted in-depth interviews and thematically coded them with a combination of inductive and deductive coding methodologies. We found that patients expressed a desire for warm, empathetic communication from providers who demonstrate respect, attentiveness, and a shared lived experience. Providers revealed an awareness that their heavy caseloads, high stress levels, and discourteous tones adversely influenced communication with pregnant women and may exacerbate their anxieties, but also reported that compassionately addressing women's concerns, providing financial problem-solving and/or assistance, and moderating conflicting healthcare desires between patients and their families could alleviate anxiety in pregnant women. Patients reported feelings of anxiety stemming from a belief that they received lower quality communication from antenatal providers at public hospitals than patients received from antenatal providers at private hospitals, an experience that they partially attributed to their low socioeconomic status. Meanwhile, some providers disclosed potentially stigmatizing views of women from particular sociocultural backgrounds or low socioeconomic status, including perceptions that appeared to shape communication with these patients in antenatal care encounters. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that communication between pregnant women and antenatal providers that is warm, normalizes patient fears, and integrates patients' interpersonal and financial considerations can mitigate pregnant women's experiences of anxiety and reduce barriers to accessing antenatal care in Pakistan's public healthcare facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3128855188,"In organ transplantation, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatch grafts not only induce the activation of cellular mediated immune response but also the development of chronic antibody-mediated rejection due to the donor-specific anti-HLA antibody (DSA) produced by B cells and plasma cells interacting with the graft endothelium. Significant improvement in long-term survival after transplantation can be expected if antibody-mediated rejection due to the DSA can be overcome. However, the mechanism of producing or controlling the DSA remains to be elucidated. In recent decades, “humanized” mouse models have been widely used for the basic research of human immune systems, but a humanized mouse model to analyze the mechanism of DSA production has not been established yet. Thus, we aimed to create a humanized mouse using a severe immunodeficiency mouse (NSG mouse) administered with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Initially, we detected a very low level of human total-IgG and no anti-HLA antibodies (Abs) in these mice. In our next attempt, we mixed PBMCs of various HLA antigenic combinations with or without regulatory T cells and preconditioned them by culturing on feeder cells stably transfected with human CD40 ligand (h-CD40L) alone or with h-CD40L and human B cell activating factor (h-BAFF). They were subsequently co-cultured with the corresponding irradiated stimulator PBMCs, and all cells were administered into naïve NSG mice. Although all three humanized models had sufficient human total-IgG and anti-HLA antibody production, allospecific anti-HLA Ab production was prominently suppressed whereas non-specific anti-HLA Abs were sufficiently detected. Therefore, this novel humanized mouse model might be useful for analyzing the mechanism of anti-allogeneic human B cell tolerance induction."
https://openalex.org/W3126387505,"Acetaldehyde is the major toxic metabolite of alcohol (ethanol) and enhances fibrosis of the liver through hepatic stellate cells. Additionally, alcohol administration causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce hepatocyte injury-mediated lipid peroxidation. Iso-α-acids, called isohumulones, are bitter acids in beer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of iso-α-acids against alcoholic liver injury in hepatocytes in mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed diets containing isomerized hop extract, which mainly consists of iso-α-acids. After 7 days of feeding, acetaldehyde was administered by a single intraperitoneal injection. The acetaldehyde-induced increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were suppressed by iso-α-acids intake. Hepatic gene expression analyses showed the upregulation of detoxifying enzyme genes, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). In vitro, iso-α-acids upregulated the enzymatic activities of GST and ALDH and induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nfe2l2; Nrf2), a master regulator of antioxidant and detoxifying systems. These results suggest that iso-α-acid intake prevents acetaldehyde-induced liver injury by reducing oxidative stress via Nrf2-mediated gene expression."

Mice were assigned to one of four LPS groups at 8-weeks of age: placebo (0.0 μg/d), low (0.9 μg/d), mid (3.6 μg/d) and high (14.4 μg/d) dose. Trabecular and cortical bone outcomes were measured at 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks of age using in vivo micro-computed tomography. The anticipated serum LPS dose-dependent response was not observed. Therefore, the low, mid, and high LPS groups were combined for analysis. Compared to the placebo group, endpoint serum LPS was elevated in both males ( p &lt; 0.05) and females ( p &lt; 0.05) when all LPS treatment groups were combined. However, there was no significant change in trabecular or cortical bone outcomes in the combined LPS groups compared to the placebo following the 12-week LPS intervention for either sex. This suggests that although serum LPS was elevated following the 12-week LPS intervention, the dosages administered using the osmotic pumps was not sufficient to negatively impact trabecular or cortical bone outcomes in either male or female CD-1 mice."
https://openalex.org/W3127395300,"The intracellular protozoal parasite Toxoplasma gondii has been associated with worsened cognitive function in animal models and in humans. Despite these associations, the mechanisms by which Toxoplasma gondii might affect cognitive function remain unknown, although Toxoplasma gondii does produce physiologically active intraneuronal cysts and appears to affect dopamine synthesis. Using data from the UK Biobank, we sought to determine whether Toxoplasma gondii is associated with decreased prefrontal, hippocampal, and thalamic gray-matter volumes and with decreased total gray-matter and total white-matter volumes in an adult community-based sample. The results from adjusted multivariable regression modelling showed no associations between Toxoplasma gondii and prefrontal, hippocampal, and thalamic brain gray-matter volumes. In contrast, natural-log transformed antibody levels against the Toxoplasma gondii p22 (b = -3960, 95-percent confidence interval, -6536 to -1383, p &lt; .01) and sag1 (b = -4863, 95-percent confidence interval, –8301 to -1425, p &lt; .01) antigens were associated with smaller total gray-matter volume, as was the mean of natural-log transformed p22 and sag1 titers (b = -6141, 95-percent confidence interval, -9886 to -2397, p &lt; .01). There were no associations between any of the measures of Toxoplasma gondii and total white-matter volume. These findings suggest that Toxoplasma gondii might be associated with decreased total gray-matter in middle-aged and older middle-aged adults in a community-based sample from the United Kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W3127960792,"Glucose metabolism is tightly regulated and disrupting glucose homeostasis is a hallmark of many diseases. Caloric restriction (CR), periodic fasting, and circadian rhythms are interlinked with glucose metabolism. Here, we directly investigated if CR depends on periodic fasting and circadian rhythms to improve glucose metabolism. CR was implemented as two-meals per day (2M-CR), provided at 12-hour intervals, and compared with one meal per day CR, mealtime (MT), and ad libitum (AL) feeding. The 2M-CR impacted the circadian rhythms in blood glucose, metabolic signaling, circadian clock, and glucose metabolism gene expression. 2M-CR significantly reduced around the clock blood glucose and improved glucose tolerance. Twenty-four-hour rhythms in mTOR signaling and gene expression observed under AL, MT, and CR, became 12-hour rhythms in 2M-CR. The 12-hour rhythms in behavior, gene expression, and signaling persisted in fasted mice, implicating some internal regulation. The study highlights that the reduction in caloric intake rather than meal frequency and duration of fasting is essential for metabolic reprograming and improvement in glucose metabolism and provides evidence on food-entrained molecular pacemaker, which can be uncoupled from the light-entrained circadian clock and rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W3128939957,"A mild isolate of Papaya ringspot virus type-P, abbreviated as PRSV-mild, from Ecuador was sequenced and characterized. The most distinguishing symptom induced by PRSV-mild was gray powder-like leaf patches radiating from secondary veins. In greenhouse experiments, PRSV-mild did not confer durable protection against a severe isolate of the virus (PRSV-sev), obtained from the same field. Furthermore, isolate specific detection in mixed-infected plants showed that PRSV-sev becomes dominant in infections, rendering PRSV-mild undetectable at 90–120 days post superinfection. Virus testing using isolate-specific primers detected PRSV-mild in two out of five surveyed provinces, with 10% and 48% of incidence in Santo Domingo and Los Ríos, respectively. Comparative genomics showed that PRSV-mild lacks two amino acids from the coat protein region, whereas amino acid determinants for asymptomatic phenotypes were not identified. Recombination events were not predicted in the genomes of the Ecuadorean isolates. Phylogenetic analyses placed both PRSV-mild and PRSV-sev in a clade that includes an additional PRSV isolate from Ecuador and others from South America."
https://openalex.org/W3126314854,"Tolerance intervals have been recommended for simultaneously validating both the accuracy and precision of an analytical procedure. However, statistical inferences for the corresponding hypothesis testing are scarce. The aim of this study is to establish a whole statistical inference for tolerance interval testing, including sample size determination, power analysis, and calculation of p-value. More specifically, the proposed method considers the bounds of a tolerance interval as random variables so that a bivariate distribution can be derived. Simulations confirm the theoretical properties of the method. Furthermore, an example is used to illustrate the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3126515005,"Reproductive organs and developing tissues have high energy demands that require metabolic functions primarily supported by mitochondria function. The highly conserved CISD/NEET iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein family regulates iron and reactive oxygen homeostasis, both of which are important for mitochondrial function. Disruption of iron and reactive oxygen homeostasis typically leads to detrimental effects. In humans, CISD dysfunction is associated with human health issues including Wolfram syndrome 2. Using C . elegans , we previously determined that the cisd-1 , cisd-3 . 1 and cisd-3 . 2 have an overlapping role in the regulation of physiological germline apoptosis through the canonical programmed cell death pathway. Here, we isolated the cisd-3 . 2(pnIs68) mutant that resulted in physiological and fitness defects including germline abnormalities that are associated with abnormal stem cell niche and disrupted formation of bivalent chromosomes. The cisd-3 . 2(pnIs68) mutation led to complete disruption of the cisd-3 . 2 gene expression and a decrease in expression of genetically intact cisd-1 and cisd-3 . 1 genes suggesting an indirect impact of the cisd-3 . 2(pnIs68) allele. The CISD-3.2 and CISD-3.1 proteins localize to the mitochondria in many tissues throughout development. The cisd-3 . 2(pnIs68) mutant displays phenotypes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including disruption of the mitochondrial network within the germline. These results further support the idea that the CISD protein family is required for mitochondrial function that supports important functions in animals including overall fitness and germline viability."
https://openalex.org/W3127009860,"Maneuvering a motorcycle in racing conditions or for prolonged time is sufficiently demanding that on many occasions forearm muscles reach a state of functional failure when riders cannot properly brake or operate the throttle. This study intends to discriminate which ones of the several dynamometric parameters used in the literature to characterize the Force-time (F-t) curve during voluntary contractions are more sensitive to neuromuscular fatigue in simulated motorcycle-riding conditions. Thirty-three adults performed an intermittent fatiguing protocol (IFP) that simulated the brake-pulling and throttle-twisting actions, by using a hydraulic system equipped with a pressure sensor. Sixty pressure-time (P-t) curve parameters, including the rate of pressure development (RPD) and area under the curve were measured to characterize the time course of the braking maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Two types of variables were used to analyze the P-t curve: 1) Times interval (from 0 to 30-50-100-500-1000 and 2000 ms); 2) Percentages of MVC (10-30-60-90%MVC). Overall significant ( p ≤ 0.05) fatigue-related declines were observed only at time intervals longer than 100 ms and contraction intensities higher than 30%MVC. Strong and significant linear declines ( p &lt; 0.001) were observed at 500 ms and 1 s for normalized pressures, as well as for the ratio RPD 60%MVC /MVC ( p &lt; 0.003) throughout the IFP. Our results suggest considering RPD at time windows of 0–500 ms and 0–1 s, and contraction intensities comprised between 30% and 60% of MVC, as more suitable criteria to study fatigue-related decrements in performance rather than the classical MVC force."
https://openalex.org/W3127872563,"Although embankment seismic damages are very complex, there has been little seismic fragility research yet. Researches on seismic fragility of bridges, dams and reinforced concrete (RC) structures have achieved fruitful results, which can provide references for embankment seismic fragility assessment. Meanwhile, the influencing degrees of retaining structures, such as retaining walls on the embankment seismic performances are still unclear. The K1025+470 embankment of the Xi’an-Baoji expressway was selected as the research object, and the finite difference models of the embankment fill-soil foundation system and embankment fill-soil foundation-retaining wall system were established. The ground-motion records for Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) were selected and the dynamic response analysis were conducted. Probabilistic Seismic Demand Analysis (PSDA) was used to deal with the IDA results and the seismic fragility curves were generated. Based on the assessment results, the influences of the retaining wall on the embankment seismic fragility were further verified. The research results show that regardless of which seismic damage parameter is considered or the presence or absence of the retaining wall, larger PGAs always correspond to higher probabilities of each seismic damage grade. Seismic damages to the embankment fill-soil foundation-retaining wall system are always lower than those of the embankment fill-soil foundation system under the same PGA actions, thus, the retaining wall can decrease the embankment seismic fragility significantly."
https://openalex.org/W3128389526,"Wild elephant populations are declining rapidly due to rampant killing for ivory and body parts, range fragmentation, and human-elephant conflict. Wild and captive elephants are further impacted by viruses, including highly pathogenic elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses. Moreover, while the rich genetic diversity of the ancient elephant lineage is disappearing, elephants, with their low incidence of cancer, have emerged as a surprising resource in human cancer research for understanding the intrinsic cellular response to DNA damage. However, studies on cellular resistance to transformation and herpesvirus reproduction have been severely limited, in part due to the lack of established elephant cell lines to enable in vitro experiments. This report describes creation of a recombinant plasmid, pAelPyV-1-Tag, derived from a wild isolate of African Elephant Polyomavirus (AelPyV-1), that can be used to create immortalized lines of elephant cells. This isolate was extracted from a trunk nodule biopsy isolated from a wild African elephant, Loxodonta africana , in Botswana. The AelPyV-1 genome contains open-reading frames encoding the canonical large (LTag) and small (STag) tumor antigens. We cloned the entire early region spanning the LTag and overlapping STag genes from this isolate into a high-copy vector to construct a recombinant plasmid, pAelPyV-1-Tag, which effectively transformed primary elephant endothelial cells. We expect that the potential of this reagent to transform elephant primary cells will, at a minimum, facilitate study of elephant-specific herpesviruses."
https://openalex.org/W3127738758,"Background Several studies have highlighted both the extreme anticancer effects of Cryptotanshinone (CT), a Stat3 crippling component from Salvia miltiorrhiza , as well as other STAT3 inhibitors to fight cancer. Methods Data presented in this experiment incorporates 2 years of in vitro studies applying a comprehensive live-cell drug-screening analysis of human and canine cancer cells exposed to CT at 20 μM concentration, as well as to other drug combinations. As previously observed in other studies, dogs are natural cancer models, given to their similarity in cancer genetics, epidemiology and disease progression compared to humans. Results Results obtained from several types of human and canine cancer cells exposed to CT and varied drug combinations, verified CT efficacy at combating cancer by achieving an extremely high percentage of apoptosis within 24 hours of drug exposure. Conclusions CT anticancer efficacy in various human and canine cancer cell lines denotes its ability to interact across different biological processes and cancer regulatory cell networks, driving inhibition of cancer cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W3128346607,"Wild pigs ( Sus scrofa ) are one of the most detrimental invasive mammals in the US. Lack of adequate population control has allowed pigs to become established across the landscape, causing significant ecological and economic damage. Given the need for additional tools for reducing wild pig populations, two toxicants, warfarin and sodium nitrite, are at the forefront of the discussion regarding future wild pig management. However, no research has examined stakeholders’ perspectives towards the use of toxicants in wild pig management. Given the lack of knowledge, our goal was to determine stakeholders’ perspectives towards the legal use of toxicants for managing wild pigs. We surveyed 1822 individuals from three stakeholder groups (hunters, farmers, and forestland owners) across Alabama during February 2018 using an online survey following the Tailored Design Method. All three stakeholder groups were generally supportive of toxicant use, though their views differed slightly by group. Furthermore, all stakeholder groups were supportive of toxicant purchasing and use regulations, while accidental water contamination, human health impact, and incorrect usage of a toxicant were stakeholders’ greatest concerns. These results indicate that these groups would likely be in support of using toxicants for wild pig management in Alabama and could be a model for other states or locations. Consequently, these results have direct implications for shaping policy and possible use of toxicants as a future wild pig management tool."
https://openalex.org/W3127271359,"With the exception of a few master transcription factors, regulators of neutrophil maturation are poorly annotated in the intermediate phenotypes between the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) and the mature neutrophil phenotype. Additional challenges in identifying gene expression regulators in differentiation pathways relate to challenges wherein starting cell populations are heterogeneous in lineage potential and development, are spread across various states of quiescence, as well as sample quality and input limitations. These factors contribute to data variability make it difficult to draw simple regulatory inferences. In response we have applied a multi-omics approach using primary blood progenitor cells primed for homogeneous proliferation and granulocyte differentiation states which combines whole transcriptome resequencing (Ampliseq RNA) supported by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) validation and mass spectrometry-based proteomics in a hypothesis-generation study of neutrophil differentiation pathways. Primary CD34+ cells isolated from human cord blood were first precultured in non-lineage driving medium to achieve an active, proliferating phenotype from which a neutrophil primed progenitor was isolated and cultured in neutrophil lineage supportive medium. Samples were then taken at 24-hour intervals over 9 days and analysed by Ampliseq RNA and mass spectrometry. The Ampliseq dataset depth, breadth and quality allowed for several unexplored transcriptional regulators and ncRNAs to be identified using a combinatorial approach of hierarchical clustering, enriched transcription factor binding motifs, and network mapping. Network mapping in particular increased comprehension of neutrophil differentiation regulatory relationships by implicating ARNT, NHLH1, PLAG1, and 6 non-coding RNAs associated with PU.1 regulation as cell-engineering targets with the potential to increase total neutrophil culture output. Overall, this study develops and demonstrates an effective new hypothesis generation methodology for transcriptome profiling during differentiation, thereby enabling identification of novel gene targets for editing interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3127390608,"Objectives We examine here the association of multidimensional functional fitness with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as compared to anthropometric indices of obesity such as body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) in a sample of Indian population. Research design and method We analysed retrospective data of 663 volunteer participants (285 males and 378 females between age 28 and 84), from an exercise clinic in which every participant was required to undergo a health related physical fitness (HRPF) assessment consisting of 15 different tasks examining 8 different aspects of functional fitness. Results The odds of being diabetic in the highest quartile of BMI were not significantly higher than that in the lowest quartile in either of the sexes. The odds of being a diabetic in the highest WHR quartile were significantly greater than the lowest quartile in females (OR = 4.54 (1.95, 10.61) as well as in males (OR = 3.81 (1.75, 8.3). In both sexes the odds of being a diabetic were significantly greater in the lowest quartile of HRPF score than the highest (males OR = 10.52 (4.21, 26.13); females OR = 10.50 (3.53, 31.35)). After removing confounding, the predictive power of HRPF was significantly greater than that of WHR. HRPF was negatively correlated with WHR, however for individuals that had contradicting HRPF and WHR based predictions, HRPF was the stronger predictor of T2DM. Conclusion The association of multidimensional functional fitness score with type 2 diabetes was significantly stronger than obesity parameters in a cross sectional self-selected sample from an Indian city."
