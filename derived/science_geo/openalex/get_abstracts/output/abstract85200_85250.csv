https://openalex.org/W2027314789,"Specific receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in cultured rat pituitary cells were increased by subnanomolar concentrations of GnRH agonists and decreased by high concentrations of these peptides. The antagonist [D-Phe2, Pro3, D-Phe6]GnRH did not alter GnRH binding capacity and blocked the increase in sites induced by GnRH. These findings provide direct evidence for the homologous regulation of GnRH receptors by physiological concentrations of the hypothalamic peptide, an action that could mediate the cyclical and postcastration increases in GnRH receptors and responsiveness of the pituitary gonadotrophs."
https://openalex.org/W1505709711,"A rabbit liver cAMP-independent glycogen synthase kinase has been purified 4500-fold to a specific activity of 2.23 mumol of 32P incorporated per min per mg of protein using ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and phosphocellulose, gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose 6B, and affinity chromatography on calmodulin-Sepharose. This synthase kinase, which was completely dependent on the presence of calmodulin (apparent K0.5 = 0.1 microM) and calcium for activity, also catalyzed the phosphorylation of purified smooth muscle myosin light chain but not of smooth muscle myosin. Using 0.5 mM ATP, a maximal rate of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase was achieved in the presence of 10 mM magnesium acetate with a pH optimum of 7.8. Gel filtration experiments indicated a Stokes radius of about 70 A and sucrose density gradient centrifugation data gave a sedimentation coefficient of 10.6 S. A molecular weight of approximately 300,000 was calculated. A definitive subunit structure was not determined, but major bands observed after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate corresponded to a doublet at 50,000 to 53,000. The calmodulin-dependent glycogen synthase kinase incorporated about 1 mol of 32P per mol of synthase subunit into sites 2 and 1b associated with a decrease in the synthase activity ratio from 0.8 to about 0.4. The calmodulin-dependent glycogen synthase kinase may mediate the effects of alpha-adrenergic agonists, vasopressin, and/or angiotensin II on glycogen synthase in liver."

https://openalex.org/W2032561058,The human cellular homolog of the transforming DNA sequence isolated from the bladder carcinoma cell line EJ was localized on the short arm of human chromosome 11 by Southern blot analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell DNA. This locus contains human sequences homologous to the Harvey murine sarcoma virus v-Ha-ras oncogene.

https://openalex.org/W2075375851,"When two new steroids, methyl prednisolonate and methyl 20-dihydroprednisolonate, were applied locally their anti-inflammatory activities were nearly equivalent to those of the parent compound prednisolone in the cotton pellet granuloma bioassay. However, when these two derivatives were administered systemically, their anti-inflammatory activities were weaker than those of the parent compound. Furthermore, unlike the parent compound, these new anti-inflammatory steroids did not suppress pituitary-adrenal function or cause liver glycogen depletion in rats."

https://openalex.org/W1552426354,"This study was aimed to elucidate whether GDP can mediate hormonal signal to adenylate cyclase in hepatic glucagon sensitive adenylate cyclase with ATP as substrate. Conversion of added GDP to GTP catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase was suppressed to less than 0.3% of added GDP by including UDP. Inhibition of this enzyme activity by UDP was accompanied by a preferential loss of the stimulatory effect of glucagon plus GDP on cyclase activity without changes in effects of glucagon plus GTP, glucagon plus guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate, and NaF. Under this condition, i.e. in the presence of UDP, GDP competitively inhibited the actions of GTP (Ki for GDP, 1 microM) and guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate in the presence of glucagon, the inhibition being complete at high GDP concentrations. GDP also inhibited cyclase activity stimulated by NaF with UDP but did only slightly without UDP. It was demonstrated that nucleoside diphosphate kinase is located in membranes in addition to cytosol fraction. However, the activity of membrane-associated enzyme was not affected by the addition of glucagon. Based on these observations, it is concluded that GDP is unable to mediate hormonal signal to adenylate cyclase and that it acts as an inhibitor of cyclase activity stimulated by GTP or its analog along with hormone. The results suggest a possible role of membrane-associated nucleoside diphosphate kinase in determining GTP and GDP levels at or near their binding site so as to replenish GTP and, thereby, decrease the inhibitory action of GDP when hormone is present."
https://openalex.org/W1482560148,"Liver lysosomes from Triton-injected or normal rats were found to rapidly incorporate 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into a lipid component of the membrane, in vitro. The lipid was identified as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate based on its chromatographic behavior on Silica Gel H thin layer plates as compared with standard phosphoinositides. The deacylation product, glyceryl-phosphorylinositol phosphate, was compared with standards in chromatographic and electrophoretic systems to further substantiate the identification of the radioactive material. A trace of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was also found. The properties of the lysosomal membrane phosphatidylinositol kinase were examined using both endogenous lipid and exogenous phosphatidylinositol as substrate. The enzyme was active at neutral pH in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2. The addition of 0.4% Triton X-100 stimulated the enzyme activity toward endogenous substrate, and the highest activity was observed in the presence of detergent and 1 mM phosphatidylinositol. Degradation of the product was seen only in the presence of Triton X-100. The specific activity of the lysosomal phosphatidylinositol kinase is comparable to the detergent-stimulated activity of liver microsomes and plasma membrane, the previously recognized sources of this enzyme in the liver cell."

https://openalex.org/W1560812415,"Membrane-derived oligosaccharides, found in the Escherichia coli periplasmic space (Schulman, H., and Kennedy, E. P. (1979) J. Bacteriol. 137, 686-688), are composed of 8-10 units of glucose, the sole sugar, in beta 1 leads to 2 and beta 1 leads to 6 linkages (Schneider, J. E., Reinhold, V., Rumley, M. K., and Kennedy, E. P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10135-10138). Oligosaccharides in this family are variously substituted with succinyl ester residues, as well as with sn-1-phosphoglycerol and phosphoethanolamine, both derived from membrane phospholipids. These negatively charged oligosaccharides may function in cellular osmoregulation since their synthesis is under osmotic control (Kennedy, E. P. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 1092-1095). We now report initial characterization of an enzyme catalyzing transfer of phosphoglycerol residues from phosphatidylglycerol to membrane-derived oligosaccharides or to synthetic beta-glucoside acceptors. The products are sn-1,2-diglyceride and beta-glucoside-6-phosphoglycerol. Localized in the inner membrane, the transferase has a requirement for divalent cations, of which manganese is most effective, and a pH optimum of 8.9 in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2091052006,"A human B cell line producing a monoclonal antibody to an antigenic determinant of acetylcholine receptors was established by cloning B cells that had been transformed in vitro by Epstein-Barr virus. The B cells were obtained from the thymus of a patient with myasthenia gravis. The antibody produced by the cell line precipitated acetylcholine receptors from denervated and innervated rat muscle and from human muscle, but did not show detectable response to the acetylcholine receptors from the electric organs of Narke japonica. The monoclonal antibody showed identical binding patterns in innervated and denervated rat muscles. Passive transfer of the monoclonal antibody into rats induced moderate muscle weakness and electromyographic changes characteristic of myasthenia gravis."

https://openalex.org/W1561120785,"Co(II)-glyoxalase I has been prepared by reactivation of apoenzyme from human erythrocytes with Co2+. The visible absorption spectrum showed maxima at 493 and 515 nm and shoulders at 465 and 615 nm. The absorption coefficients at 493 and 515 nm were 35 and 33 M-1 cm-1/cobalt ion, respectively; i.e. 70 and 66 M-1 cm-1 for the dimeric metalloprotein. The product of the enzymatic reaction, S-D-lactoylglutathione, although binding to Co(II)-glyoxalase I, had no demonstrable effect on the visible absorption spectrum, indicating binding outside the first coordination sphere of the metal. The EPR spectrum at 3.9 K was characterized by g1 approximately 6.6, g2 approximately 3.0, and g3 approximately 2.5, and eight hyperfine lines with A1 = 0.025 cm-1. Binding of the strong competitive inhibitor S-p-bromobenzylglutathione to Co(II)-glyoxalase I gave three g values: 6.3, 3.4, and 2.5, indicating a conformational change affecting the environment of the metal ion. Both optical and EPR spectra strongly suggest a high spin Co2+ with octahedral coordination in the active site of the enzyme. The similarities in kinetic properties between native Zn(II)-glyoxalase I and enzyme substituted with Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ is consistent with the view that these enzyme forms have the same metal coordination in the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1576995966,"Human erythrocyte ghosts were covalently labeled with 4-maleimide-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxyl. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry revealed two major binding environments representing strongly (S) and weakly (W) immobilized species. The disorder parameter, W/S, determined from the respective peak amplitudes, was shown to be irreversibly elevated following treatment of the labeled ghosts with superoxide, indicating an increase in membrane fluidity. Labeled ghosts reduced with ascorbate showed no nitroxide EPR signals. However, following exposure of these membranes to superoxide, the nitroxide spectrum returned with a W/S ratio of 25. In contrast, the disorder parameter for spin-labeled ghosts decreased following exposure to hydroxyl radicals suggesting decreased fluidity, as a result of lipid peroxidation. This effect could be prevented by the inclusion of mannitol. These changes in membrane fluidity and/or protein mobility observed by EPR are compared with previous results obtained by other methods and provide additional evidence for physiologic alterations initiated by superoxide."

https://openalex.org/W1518189392,"When purified rat liver plasma membranes were incubated with norepinephrine, rat liver cytosol, and Ca2+, the amount of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol was reduced by up to 50%. The levels of other major membrane phospholipids underwent negligible change. The decrease in phosphatidylinositol levels was not observed if norepinephrine was omitted or cytosol was absent. The disappearance of phospholipid persisted when soluble Ca2+ was depleted by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The decrease was prevented by phentolamine, benextramine, and prazosin, but not by sotalol. The results show that norepinephrine elicits a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated breakdown of phosphatidylinositol in isolated plasma membranes which is dependent on the presence of cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1964870639,"The 5' nucleotide sequences of the transforming gene of simian sarcoma virus (v-sis) and its human cellular homolog (c-sis) were compared. A short homology was found between helper virus and cellular DNA sequences at the junction of v-sis and c-sis, which may have had a role in the original recombination event leading to the generation of simian sarcoma virus."
https://openalex.org/W1519418075,"An enzyme which N-acetylates beta-endorphin has been identified and characterized in the rat brain and pituitary gland. The beta-endorphin acetyltransferase activity was localized almost exclusively in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. beta-endorphin acetyltransferase activity was also present in the hypothalamus, a brain region which synthesizes beta-endorphin, but not the cerebellum, a region which does not synthesize beta-endorphin. The substrate specificity of beta-endorphin acetyltransferase appeared to be located in the NH2 terminus and midportions of the beta-endorphin sequence. The regional distribution and pharmacological specificity of beta-endorphin acetyltransferase indicate that it is a highly specialized regulatory enzyme. Because N-acetyl-beta-endorphin is nonanalgesic and does not bind to the opiate receptor (Smyth, D.G., Massey, D.E., Zakarian, S., and Finnie, M.D. (1979) Nature (Lond.) 279, 252-254), it appears that the physiological significance of beta-endorphin acetyltransferase is that it can modulate the activity of endorphin secreted from opiomelanotropinergic cells and neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1597616721,"Bovine cardiac glycogen-free glycogen synthase I reacts with oxidized glutathione at low temperature to partially inactivate the enzyme. Evidence is presented that a mixed disulfide between glutathione and the enzyme is formed in this reaction. A short incubation of the GSSG-treated enzyme with dithiothreitol restores full enzyme activity. The reaction with GSSG is pH dependent and the product is quite stable at neutral pH. Oxidation of one sulfhydryl group in glycogen synthase is associated with a loss of 60-70% of the enzyme activity. Further modification of protein sulfhydryls has less effect on the enzyme activity. Other low molecular weight disulfides also inactivate glycogen synthase and treatment with [35S]cystine to produce a 40% loss of enzyme activity gave rise to a single major radioactive peptide after cyanogen bromide digestion. Thus the GSSG-mediated inactivation of glycogen synthase apparently occurs through a single reactive sulfhydryl group that forms a mixed disulfide with low molecular weight disulfide molecules. Uridine 5'-diphosphate glucose and glycogen prevent the inactivation of glycogen-free glycogen synthase with GSSG, and glucose 6-phosphate retards the rate of inactivation. Reduction and reactivation of the GSSG-oxidized glycogen synthase is not affected by glycogen and it occurs readily at neutral pH with dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol, or cysteamine. Oxidation of the reactive sulfhydryl group with GSSG has no effect on the rate of glycogen synthase phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1554494596,"The mechanism of the rifampicin induction of RNA polymerase beta and beta' subunit synthesis was investigated, employing an in vitro coupled system of transcription and translation as well as an in vitro transcription system with purified RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Two independent effects leading to the induction of beta and beta' polypeptide synthesis have been identified for the drug: 1) rifampicin binds to RNA polymerase holoenzyme and inhibits its autorepressor activity, thus relieving the autorepression exerted possibly on the translation of rpoBC mRNA; and 2) rifampicin-RNA polymerase complex functions as a positive effector stimulating the transcription of rpoBC genes, but not of rplL gene. Using a terminally labeled DNA fragment covering the intercistronic region between rplL and rpoB as a probe, the structure of both in vivo and in vitro RNA were analyzed by S1 nuclease-mapping assays. The experimental results indicated that the observed stimulation of the transcription by rifampicin was attributed, at least in part, to relaxation of the transcription attenuation immediately preceding the rpoB gene, resulting in the increase of the read-through transcript to rpoBC genes. Besides the read-through transcript and the processed mature rpoBC mRNA, another RNA species was found in in vivo RNA, which might be transcribed from a weak promoter located in the intercistronic region. However, no clear indication has been obtained of possible enhancement of the transcription initiation by rifampicin from the putative promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1541531150,"An ion-gated channel was conferred on a planar lipid bilayer membrane upon incorporation of (Na+,K+)-ATPase. The channel exhibited two conductance states. The high conductance state was only observed when an ion gradient was present across the planar membrane. This state corresponded to an enzyme conformation which was ouabain and vanadate sensitive (i.e. conductance was inhibited by these compounds), while the low conductance state showed no sensitivity to either inhibitor. Single channel conductance behavior was observed when minimal amounts of enzyme were incorporated into the planar bilayer. The observed single channel conductance was 270 +/- 14 picosiemens. Similar transport behavior was observed for enzyme purified from ovine kidney using sodium dodecyl sulfate (anionic), eel electroplax using Lubrol-WX (nonionic), and kidney microsomes. In addition, the data strongly suggest that enzyme from the kidney microsomes was asymmetrically incorporated into the planar bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1537430592,"The reoxidation of reduced cytochrome c1 by potassium ferricyanide follows pseudo-first order kinetics with k = 4 x 10(4) M-1 s-1. However, the reoxidation of this cytochrome in two-electron reduced Complex III does not follow any simple rate law although the overall rate of reaction is essentially unchanged. The observed kinetics can be well fitted with a model in which ferricyanide reacts exclusively with cytochrome c1 together with very rapid electron transfer from the reduced iron-sulfur center to cytochrome c1. Neither removal of coenzyme Q from the complex nor prior incubation with antimycin A had any effect on the observed kinetics of reoxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1575516545,"This communication provides biochemical, immunological, and genetic evidence that pp60src, the Rous sarcoma virus transforming gene product, is associated with glycerol kinase activity. Our investigations demonstrated that the compound phosphorylated by pp60src or by glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30) from Candida mycoderma share the same electrophoretic and chromatographic mobilities. The glycerol kinase and protein kinase activities of pp60src were inhibited similarly by preincubation with immune IgG. Both activities were reduced 6-9-fold in pp60src preparations derived by immunoaffinity chromatography from cells which were infected with NY68, a temperature-sensitive transformation mutant of Rous sarcoma virus. The thermolability at 41 degrees C of the glycerol kinase activity of pp60src from the mutant virus-infected cells was greater (t/2 = 1.3 min) than the same activity in pp60src preparations from wild type virus-infected cells (t/2 = 4.8 min)."
https://openalex.org/W1496382024,"Obligately alkalophilic Bacillus firmus RAB had a higher molar growth yield on L-malate (Ymal = 38 mg, dry weight/mmol of L-malate) than its non-alkalophilic mutant derivative, strain RABN (Ymal = 12 mg, dry weight/mmol of L-malate). Measurements of respiration dependent proton translocation by the two strains in the presence of K+ and valinomycin showed that the alkalophile also has much higher H+/O stoichiometries (at pH 9.0) than does the mutant (at pH 7.0). H+/O ratios for B. firmus RAB at pH 9.0 were as high as 13, with a frequently observed value of 9. These high values were observed in the first phase of a set of biphasic curves for both oxygen consumption and proton ejection. At pH 7.0, both the wild type and the mutant exhibited H+/O ratios near 4 in a single phase of oxygen consumption and proton ejection. The results are consistent with suggestions that the alkalophilic respiratory chain is especially well adapted for effective energy transduction at alkaline but not neutral pH."

https://openalex.org/W1508004060,"Hydrophobic interaction chromatography is employed to determine if calmodulin might associate with its target enzymes such as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and calcineurin through its Ca2+-induced hydrophobic binding region. The majority of protein in a bovine brain extract that binds to a calmodulin-Sepharose affinity column also is observed to bind in a metal ion-independent manner to phenyl-Sepharose through hydrophobic interactions. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity that is bound to phenyl-Sepharose can be resolved into two activity peaks; one peak of activity is eluted with low ionic strength buffer, while the second peak eluted with an ethylene glycol gradient. Calcineurin bound tightly to the phenyl-Sepharose column and could only be eluted with 8 M urea. Increasing ethylene glycol concentrations in the reaction mixture selectively inhibited the ability of calmodulin to stimulate phosphodiesterase activity, suggesting that hydrophobic interaction is required for activation. Comparison of the proteins which are bound to and eluted from phenyl- and calmodulin-Sepharose affinity columns indicates that chromatography involving calmodulin-Sepharose resembles hydrophobic interaction chromatography with charged ligands. In this type of interaction, hydrophobic binding either is reinforced by electrostatic attractions or opposed by electrostatic repulsions to create a degree of specificity in the binding of calmodulin to certain proteins with accessible hydrophobic regions."
https://openalex.org/W1536971346,"Abstract Opiate receptor binding decayed exponentially in mouse neuroblastoma-rat glioma (NG108-15) hybrid cell preparations following exposure to increasing doses of ionizing radiation (0.2 to 7.0 Mrads; 2.0 Mrads/min). Target size analysis revealed that [3H][D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin (agonist) and [3H]naloxone (antagonist) bound specifically to a component with an apparent molecular size of 200,000 +/- 20,000. Lyophilization of cells for the irradiation procedure did not significantly alter receptor affinity or binding capacity for these ligands. Furthermore, the loss of opiate receptor binding in irradiated cell samples could not be attributed to reduced receptor affinity since increasing concentrations of radiolabeled ligand failed to reverse the inhibition; nonspecific binding decreased only slightly under identical experimental conditions. The value of determining molecular size by radiation inactivation analysis was confirmed by showing that apparent target sizes for two representative lysosomal enzymes (beta-galactosidase and alpha-mannosidase) were consistent with results obtained previously using conventional methods. Thus, the data suggest that the ligand binding component of delta-opiate (enkephalin) receptors in NG108-15 cells has a minimum functional size of approximately 200,000."
https://openalex.org/W1568285924,"Human transferrin receptor protein from various human cell lines in tissue culture (phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphocytes, normal embryonic fibroblasts (WI-38), a choriocarcinoma (Be Wo), an epidermoid carcinoma (KB), and a metastatic breast carcinoma (MCF-7)) was metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and purified by two methods. The first method involves affinity chromatography of the transferrin receptor with a transferrin-linked Sepharose 4B resin. The second method involves direct immunoprecipitation of the receptor protein with a goat polyclonal antibody raised against placental transferrin receptor. Additionally, transferrin receptor from normal gestational placenta was similarly radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and subsequently purified with transferrin-bound resin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the reduced receptor isolated by both purification techniques revealed an Mr = 94,000 protein to be present in all cells assayed for this study. Partial proteolytic digestion with Staphylococcus aureus protease followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed identical mapping patterns of the Mr = 94,000 protein isolated from each cell line, irrespective of the isolation technique employed to purify the receptor. These findings indicate an identical peptide structure of the human transferrin receptor in cells with a differentiated function for iron metabolism, in normal cells undergoing mitosis, and in neoplastic cells in long term culture, within the limits of detectability of the proteolytic digestion maps."

https://openalex.org/W1597248618,"The pH dependence of the oxidation-state marker line of hemoproteins is investigated in cytochrome c peroxidase with Raman difference spectroscopy. The frequency is sensitive to ionization of a group on the protein that regulates catalytic activity of the resting ferriheme enzyme. The oxidation-state marker line shows a transition with pK of 5.5 in good agreement with other spectroscopic measurements and kinetic measurements of binding of peroxide, and other ligands to the native enzyme. The shift of 0.8 cm-1 to higher frequency at pH 4.5 relative to the pH 6.4 value is interpreted in terms of a substantial decrease in pi-electron density in the porphyrin ring. Charge density in the pi-system is highest at maximal activity, as would be expected if donor-acceptor interactions with residues of the protein stabilize the oxidized Fe(IV) reaction intermediate. Evidence of additional heme-linked ionizations with pK values near 7.5 is found; this alkaline transition involves deprotonation of several groups of the protein, conversion of iron from high to low spin, and, possibly, denaturation of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1613296146,"Conclusive evidence is presented for an S = 1/2 spincoupled pair of high spin ferric and ferrous ions in the major reaction product of sulfide with the met form of the non-heme iron oxygen-carrying protein hemerythrin. Evidence for an analogous selenide derivative is also reported. Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy establish (a) the charge and spin states of the individual iron atoms in sulfidehemerythrin as Fe(III), S = 5/2, and Fe(II), S = 2, and (b) the existence of an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction that couples the two spins to a resultant spin S = 1/2. The combined Mossbauer and EPR data confirm the correctness of the formulation first proposed for semi-methemerythrin by Harrington, P.C., de Waal, D.J.A., and Wilkins, R.G. ((1978) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 191, 444-451) and furthermore show that a majority of the iron centers in the protein can be stabilized at this oxidation level. The results also demonstrate a new route to semi-methemerythrin. A titration of methemerythrin with selenide indicates that this derivative forms by a two step process consisting of first, reduction to the semi-met oxidation level by selenide and second, binding of selenide to either one or both irons."
https://openalex.org/W1523311793,"Glucose 6-phosphotransferases were investigated in two transplantable rat insulinoma tumor lines. Homogenates of tumors contained glucose phosphorylating activities of both high (e.g. supernatant Km = 0.060 mM and pellet Km = 0.077 mM) and low (Km = 7.6 mM) affinities for glucose. Chromatography of supernatants (105,000 X g) of insulinomas on DEAE-Cibacron Blue F3GA agarose evidenced glucose 6-phosphotransferase activity which eluted similarly to glucokinase from rat liver. Kinetic studies of insulinoma glucokinase also indicated similarity with liver glucokinase, i.e. cooperative rate dependence on glucose concentration and comparable Km values for glucose, and it did not phosphorylate N-acetylglucosamine. These characteristics of glucose 6-phosphotransferase in insulinomas are similar to those of the enzyme found in islets of Langerhans. Since glucokinase is thought to serve as glucose sensor of insulin secretory pancreatic beta-cells, these transplantable insulinomas offer great promise for biochemical and biophysical studies of the nature of glucose-induced insulin release."
