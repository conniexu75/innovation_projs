https://openalex.org/W2092097845,"ZIP1 is a novel meiosis-specific gene required for chromosome synapsis and cell cycle progression in S. cerevisiae. zip1 strains undergo homologous chromosome pairing, but are defective in synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. The zip1 mutation confers a uniform arrest in meiosis prior to the first division. zip1 strains display nearly wild-type levels of commitment to meiotic recombination; however, mature reciprocal recombinants are not formed until cells are released from meiotic arrest by return to growth medium. DNA sequence analysis of ZIP1 reveals structural homology to a number of proteins containing coiled coils. Immunofluorescence experiments using anti-ZIP1 antibodies demonstrate that the ZIP1 protein localizes to synapsed meiotic chromosomes but not to unsynapsed axial elements. Taken together, these data suggest that ZIP1 is a component of the central region of the SC. We propose a model in which ZIP1 acts as a molecular zipper to bring homologous chromosomes in close apposition."
https://openalex.org/W2052969380,"Repetitive activation of hippocampal mossy fibers evokes a long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic responses in pyramidal cells in the CA3 region that is independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. Previous results suggest that the site for both the induction and expression of this form of LTP is presynaptic. Experimental elevation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) both mimics and interferes with tetanus-induced mossy fiber LTP, and blockers of the cAMP cascade block mossy fiber LTP. It is proposed that calcium entry into the presynaptic terminal may activate Ca(2+)-calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase I which, through protein kinase A, causes a persistent enhancement of evoked glutamate release."

https://openalex.org/W2000131964,"Hypotheses about chimpanzee social behavior, phylogeography, and evolution were evaluated by noninvasive genotyping of free-ranging individuals from 20 African sites. Degrees of relatedness among individuals in one community were inferred from allele-sharing at eight nuclear simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Males are related on the order of half-siblings, and homozygosity is significantly increased at several SSR loci compared to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. These data support the kin-selection hypothesis for the evolution of cooperation among males. Sequence variation patterns at two mitochondrial loci indicate historically high long-distance gene flow and clarify the relationships among three allopatric subspecies. The unexpectedly large genetic distance between the western subspecies, Pan troglodytes verus, and the other two subspecies suggests a divergence time of about 1.58 million years. This result, if confirmed at nuclear loci and supported by eco-behavioral data, implies that P. t. verus should be elevated to full species rank."
https://openalex.org/W2040026254,"Experimentally, a productive infection with HIV-1 requires that virus be administered to T cells that are activated by mitogens. We describe a productive milieu for HIV-1 within the confines of normal skin that does not require standard stimuli. The milieu consists of dendritic cells and T cells that emigrate from skin and produce distinctive stable, nonproliferating conjugates. These conjugates, upon exposure to each of seven different HIV-1 isolates, begin to release high levels of virus progeny within 4 days. Numerous infected syncytia, comprised of both dendritic and T cells, rapidly develop. We propose that conjugates of dendritic cells and T cells, as found in the external linings of organs involved in sexual transmission of HIV-1, represent an important site for the productive phase of HIV-1 infection. Because the affected T cells carry the memory phenotype, this site additionally provides a mechanism for the chronic depletion of CD4+ memory cells in HIV-1 disease."
https://openalex.org/W2056205588,"Commitment to the cell cycle in fission yeast requires the function of the cdc10+ transcriptional activator at START. The product of the cdc18+ gene is a major downstream target of cdc10+, and transcription of cdc18+ is activated by cdc10+ during passage through START. The cdc18+ function is required for entry into S phase. In addition, the product of the cdc18+ gene is part of the checkpoint control that prevents mitosis from occurring until S phase is completed. Thus, cdc18+ plays a key role in coupling S phase to START and mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2051579898,Indirect evidence implicates γδ T cells in the cross-regulation of CD4 αβ T cell responses. Adoptive transfer of small numbers of γδ T cells from ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice selectively suppressed TH2 -dependent immunoglobulin E(IgE) antibody production without affecting parallel IgG responses. Challenge of these γδ T cells in vitro with specific antigen resulted in production of high levels of interferon γ. The effects of the γδ T cells may be mediated by direct inhibition of OVA-specific CD4+ TH2 cell proliferation or selection for specific CD4 TH2 cells.
https://openalex.org/W2039007871,"The Uitrabithorax (Ubx) and Antennapedia (Antp) genes of Drosophila encode homeodomain proteins that have very similar DNA binding specificities in vitro but specify the development of different segmental patterns in vivo. We describe cooperative interactions between Ubx protein and a divergent homeodomain protein, extradenticle (exd), that selectively increases the affinity of Ubx, but not Antp, for a particular DNA target. We also provide evidence that Ubx and exd bind to neighboring sites on this DNA and interact directly to stabilize the DNA-bound form of Ubx. Thus, the ability of different homeotic genes to specify distinct segmental patterns may depend on cooperative interactions with proteins such as exd that selectively modulate their otherwise similar DNA binding specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1996645786,"The chaperonin GroEL is a ribosome-sized double-ring structure that assists in folding a diverse set of polypeptides. We have examined the fate of a polypeptide during a chaperonin-mediated folding reaction. Strikingly, we find that, upon addition of ATP and the cochaperonin GroES, polypeptide is released rapidly from GroEL in a predominantly nonnative conformation that can be trapped by mutant forms of GroEL that are capable of binding but not releasing substrate. Released polypeptide undergoes kinetic partitioning: a fraction completes folding while the remainder is rebound rapidly by other GroEL molecules. Folding appears to occur in an all-or-none manner, as proteolysis and tryptophan fluorescence indicate that after rebinding, polypeptide has the same structure as in the original complex. These observations suggest that GroEL functions by carrying out multiple rounds of binding aggregation-prone or kinetically trapped Intermediates, maintaining them in an unfolded state, and releasing them to attempt to fold in solution."

https://openalex.org/W2065200502,"Distinct cell types differentiate along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube. We have cloned and characterized a novel member of the TGF beta gene family, dorsalin-1 (dsl-1), that appears to regulate cell differentiation within the neural tube. dsl-1 is expressed selectively in the dorsal neural tube, and its pattern of expression appears to be restricted by early signals from the notochord. Exposure of neural plate cells to dsl-1 promotes the differentiation of cells with neural crest-like properties and inhibits the induction of motor neurons by signals from the notochord and floor plate. These findings suggest that dsl-1 regulates the differentiation of cell types along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube, acting in conjunction with distinct ventralizing signals from the notochord and floor plate."
https://openalex.org/W2085993193,"Estrogen and progesterone modulate gene expression in rodents by activation of intracellular receptors in the hypothalamus, which regulate neuronal networks that control female sexual behavior. However, the neurotransmitter dopamine has been shown to activate certain steroid receptors in a ligand-independent manner. A dopamine receptor stimulant and a D1 receptor agonist, but not a D2 receptor agonist, mimicked the effects of progesterone in facilitating sexual behavior in female rats. The facilitory effect of the neurotransmitter was blocked by progesterone receptor antagonists, a D1 receptor antagonist, or antisense oligonucleotides to the progesterone receptor. The results suggest that in rodents neurotransmitters may regulate in vivo gene expression and behavior by means of cross-talk with steroid receptors in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2140718203,"The anatomical and numerical simplicity of the fish olfactory system has led us to examine the family of olfactory receptors expressed in the catfish. We have identified a family of genes encoding seven transmembrane domain receptors that share considerable homology with the odorant receptors of the rat. The size of the catfish receptor repertoire appears to be far smaller than in mammals. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences suggests that these receptor genes have undergone positive Darwinian selection to generate enhanced diversity within the putative odorant-binding domains. Individual receptor clones anneal with 0.5%-2% of the olfactory neurons, suggesting that a single cell expresses only a small subset of distinct odorant receptors. Each cell, therefore, possesses a unique identity defined by the receptors it expresses. These data suggest that the brain may discriminate among odors by determining which neurons have been activated."
https://openalex.org/W1566946085,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is rapidly regulated by reversible phosphorylation; phosphorylation inactivates ACC, whereas dephosphorylation activates the enzyme. Among protein kinases only cAMP-dependent protein kinase and 5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase can inactivate ACC; cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates Ser-77 and -1200; 5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates Ser-79, -1200, and -1215. In this report, the construction and expression of ACC cDNA containing the entire coding region (7.2 kilobase pairs) is described. In order to identify the critical phosphorylation site(s) for each protein kinase, we introduced site-specific mutations at Ser-77, -79, -1200, and -1215 of ACC cDNA and a series of mutated ACCs containing various combinations of these four mutated sites was expressed. By examination of the various mutant ACCs, we provided evidence that the effect of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is entirely mediated by the phosphorylation of Ser-1200 and that Ser-79 is important for 5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase action in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2062096098,"Adenosine is present in the mammalian brain in large amounts and has potent effects on neuronal activity, but its role in neural signaling is poorly understood. The glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) caused a presynaptic depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of guinea pig hippocampal slices. This depression was blocked by an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, which suggests that activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor raises the concentration of extracellular adenosine, which acts on presynaptic inhibitory A1 receptors. Strong tetanic stimulation caused a heterosynaptic inhibition that was blocked by both NMDA and A1 receptor antagonists. Enkephalin, which selectively inhibits interneurons, antagonized the heterosynaptic inhibition. These findings suggest that synaptically released glutamate activates NMDA receptors, which in turn releases adenosine, at least in part from interneurons, that acts at a distance to inhibit presynaptically the release of glutamate from excitatory synapses. Thus, interneurons may mediate a widespread purinergic presynaptic inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2046859370,"After activation in mesoderm and neuroectoderm, expression of the Hoxb-1 gene is progressively restricted to rhombomere (r) 4 in the hindbrain. Analysis of the chick and mouse Hoxb-1 genes identified positive and negative regulatory regions that cooperate to mediate segment-restricted expression during rhombomere formation. An enhancer generates expression extending into r3 and r5, and a repressor limits this domain to r4. The repressor contains a conserved retinoic acid response element, point mutations in which allow expression to spread into adjacent rhombomeres. Retinoids and their nuclear receptors may therefore participate in sharpening segment-restricted expression of Hoxb-1 during rhombomere boundary formation."
https://openalex.org/W2066424373,"Recently, a Drosophila gene has been identified, extradenticle, whose product modulates the morphological consequences of homeotic selector genes. We show here that extradenticle protein raises the DNA binding specificity of Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A but not that of Abdominal-B. We further show that extradenticle modulates the DNA binding activity of engrailed to a different target site. While a region N-terminal of the extradenticle homeodomain is required for Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A cooperativity, engrailed requires a domain C-terminal of the extradenticle homeobox. These studies show directly how the DNA binding specificity of selector gene products can be raised by extradenticle and provides a mechanism, cooperative DNA binding, that allows selector gene products to achieve some of their biological specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2037281919,"Transgenic embryos were generated carrying a Hoxb-8 transgene under control of the mouse RARβ2 promoter, which extends the normal expression domain to more anterior regions of the embryo. These embryos showed mirror-image duplications in the forelimb, analogous to the duplications observed in chick in response to transplantation of a ZPA to the anterior margin of the limb bud. Examination of Sonic hedgehog, Fgf-4, and Hoxd-11 gene expression confirmed that a second ZPA had been generated at the anterior side of the limb bud. Besides other alterations, posterior homeotic transformations of axial structures were observed, involving the first spinal (Frorlep's) ganglion and several cervical vertebrae."
https://openalex.org/W1522289497,"Abstract We have previously reported the purification of a palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (PPT) from bovine brain that removes palmitate from Ha-Ras (Camp, L. A., and Hofmann, S. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22566-22574). In the current paper, we have isolated bovine and rat cDNA clones encoding PPT. The deduced amino acid sequence of PPT predicts a protein of 306 amino acids that contains amino acid motifs characteristic of thioesterases: Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly positioned near the NH2 terminus and Gly-Asp-His positioned near the COOH terminus of the protein. The identity of the PPT cDNA was further confirmed by expression in simian COS cells and insect Sf9 cells. Comparison of the DNA and protein sequence data suggests that a hydrophobic NH2-terminal sequence of 27 amino acid residues is removed from the primary translation product. Furthermore, the recombinant protein and the native protein purified from bovine brain contain complex asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and a large proportion of the expressed PPT is secreted from COS and Sf9 cells. Thus, while the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase will deacylate intracellular palmitoylated proteins such as Ha-Ras and the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, the physiologic substrates are likely to be externally oriented or secreted proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2006577331,"The Drosophila anachronism (ana) locus controls the proliferation of neuroblasts, neuronal stem cells that give rise to the central nervous system. In ana mutants, quiescent postembryonic central brain and optic lobe neuroblasts enter S phase precociously. ana encodes a novel secreted protein of 474 amino acids that is expressed not in the affected neuroblasts, but rather in a subclass of neighboring glial cells. These studies argue for an important role for glia in negatively regulating proliferation of neuronal precursor cells, thereby controlling the timing of postembryonic neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1548069410,"Site-directed mutations of the cDNA for Gi1 alpha, Gi21 alpha, and Gi3 alpha were constructed which changed the cysteine residue at the C terminus to a glycine residue (Gi alpha PT). This mutation of the Gi alpha would not permit the subsequent covalent modification by pertussis toxin, which requires the cysteine moiety. The cDNA for each of the mutant Gi alpha subunits was transfected into GH4C1 cells with either of the alternative splice forms of the D2 dopamine receptor and clonal lines were generated. After treatment with pertussis toxin to remove the contribution from endogenous Gi proteins, the receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was examined. The D2 dopamine receptor, short form (D2s) signaled through the Gi2 alpha PT mutant in these cells with an affinity for agonist which was comparable to that observed in cells transfected with the cDNA for D2s alone or the signaling observed in the absence of pertussis toxin. The long form of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2l) signaled through the Gi3 alpha PT mutant to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, with an affinity for agonist comparable to that observed in cells transfected with the cDNA for D2l alone. The receptor for somatostatin (somatotropin release inhibiting factor) was used as an endogenous control receptor in these cell lines. The somatotropin release inhibiting factor was able to signal through both Gi1 alpha PT and Gi3 alpha PT to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase. These results indicated that receptors use distinct Gi proteins to signal to a common effector."
https://openalex.org/W2030145065,"It is widely accepted that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is triggered postsynaptically, but there is considerable debate as to the site at which the increase in synaptic strength is expressed. The irreversible open-channel blocking action of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 has been used to test whether the probability of transmitter release (Pr) is increased during LTP. Although the rate of decline of the amplitude of the NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in the presence of MK-801 strongly depends on Pr, the rate of decline of the EPSC evoked at synapses expressing LTP is identical to that observed at synapses not expressing LTP. These findings are difficult to reconcile with models in which the expression of LTP is due to an increase in Pr."
https://openalex.org/W1539632996,"In Escherichia coli, the molecular chaperones (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) are essential for the rapid degradation of certain proteins. To see if chaperones are involved more generally in proteolysis, we studied the degradation of a short-lived fusion protein, CRAG, which associates with DnaK and GroEL in vivo. Its rapid degradation requires ATP and ClpP, the proteolytic subunit of protease Ti (Clp). However, this process is not reduced in strains lacking the complementary ATPase subunit, ClpA, or its homologs, ClpB and ClpX. At 37 degrees C, but not at 42 degrees C, protease La also contributes partially to CRAG degradation. Nevertheless, CRAG is not degraded in cell-free extracts or upon incubation with ClpP or protease La. We tested whether the chaperones associated with CRAG might be involved in its degradation. CRAG breakdown was accelerated 2-3-fold in strains with high levels of heat-shock proteins (hsps), i.e. in those that overproduce the hsp transcription factor (sigma 32) or carry a dnaK deletion. A similar stimulation of proteolysis was observed in cells overproducing GroEL or both GroEL and GroES; in these cells, more CRAG was associated with GroEL than in the wild type. In a temperature-sensitive groEL44 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, CRAG breakdown was accelerated, and more CRAG was found complexed with GroEL. However, in a temperature-sensitive groES mutant, CRAG was completely stable at the nonpermissive temperature and accumulated bound to GroEL. These findings indicate that the association of CRAG with GroEL is a rate-limiting step in CRAG degradation, which also requires a subsequent action of GroES. We propose that if the hsp60/hsp10 chaperonins fail to catalyze the proper folding of a protein, they can facilitate its rapid degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1596852471,"Tubulin is a GTPase that hydrolyzes its bound nucleotide triphosphate after it becomes incorporated into a microtubule. The only known consequence of nucleotide hydrolysis is that it increases the dissociation rate of tubulin from the end of the microtubule by 2 orders of magnitude. In this study, we investigated whether microtubules composed of tubulin-GMPCPP (guanylyl alpha,beta-methylenediphosphate) (a very slowly hydrolyzed GTP analog) or tubulin-GDP exhibit additional structural or functional differences. We show that tubulin-GMPCPP microtubules are significantly stiffer than tubulin-GDP microtubules and have a 21% shallower protofilament twist angle. We also find that kinesin, a microtubule-based motor protein, transports tubulin-GMPCPP microtubules at approximately 30% faster rates than tubulin-GDP microtubules. These findings suggest that growing microtubule ends, which are thought to be composed of tubulin-GTP, may have different structural and mechanical properties from the remainder of the microtubule polymer."
https://openalex.org/W1589333353,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that promotes adhesion in immunological and inflammatory reactions. ICAM-1 is expressed on cells of many lineages and is induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Functional analysis of ICAM-1 promoter-luciferase constructs in HepG2 cells enabled us to identify a region between -110 and -37 mediating IL-6 and IFN-gamma responsiveness and containing a palindromic IL-6/IFN-gamma response element (pIRE). Site-directed mutagenesis of key nucleotides in the ICAM-1 pIRE abolished the effect of both IL-6 and IFN-gamma stimulation, while this pIRE element was sufficient to confer IL-6 and IFN-gamma responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. We further show by gel retardation analysis that distinct nuclear factors induced by both IL-6 or IFN-gamma specifically bind to this pIRE. Furthermore, treatment with IL-6 results in the formation of multiple complexes while IFN-gamma induces a single binding complex, both in HepG2 and monocytic U937 cells. Differentiation of U937 cells by exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate abolishes response to IL-6 but not IFN-gamma. Supershift data utilizing the ICAM-1 pIRE revealed that IFN-gamma and IL-6 both induce a factor antigenically related to IFN-gamma activation factor. We further provide data suggesting that IL-6 additionally activates an ICAM-1 pIRE binding factor related to the previously described acute-phase response factor in disparate cell types. We therefore conclude that the activation of these related nuclear factors by IL-6 and IFN-gamma is important in the regulation of ICAM-1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1496241100,"We have previously demonstrated that several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, including BiP, ERp72, grp94, and protein disulfide isomerase, bind to a denatured thyroglobulin (Tg) affinity column and can be specifically eluted by ATP (Nigam, S.K., Goldberg, A.L., Ho, S., Rohde, M.F., Bush, K.T., and Sherman, M.Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1744-1749). Using chemical cross-linking, we now demonstrate that BiP, ERp72, and grp94 associate with Tg in two types of cultured thyroid cells, FRTL-5 and PCC13. Whereas BiP could be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Tg antibodies in the absence of cross-linking, only trace amounts of ERp72 and grp94 were coimmunoprecipitated. Likewise, in both cell types, anti-BiP antibodies were able to coimmunoprecipitate Tg in the absence of cross-linking, though ERp72 and grp94 were only minimally present. Coprecipitation of BiP and Tg was abolished when ATP and Mg2+ were added to cell lysates. In contrast, after cross-linking, there was a large increase in the amount of ERp72 and grp94 that coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Tg antibodies, although there was only a slight increase in BiP. Similarly, in cross-linked lysates, grp94 and ERp72 were also coimmunoprecipitated with anti-BiP antibodies. An apparently novel 200-kDa protein was also consistently immunoprecipitated by anti-BiP antibodies in both cell types. In addition, anti-ERp72 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated Tg, BiP, and grp94 only after cross-linking. Analysis of uncross-linked and cross-linked samples by sucrose density gradient centrifugation confirmed that Tg, BiP, grp94, and ERp72 are present together in high molecular weight complexes only after treatment of cells with cross-linking reagent. These results suggest that ERp72, as well as BiP and grp94, function as molecular chaperones in the maturation of Tg, potentially as part of a macromolecular complex."

https://openalex.org/W1532399050,"Abstract The cDNA encoding the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2) from mouse P-glycoprotein involved in multidrug resistance was obtained from adrenal cell mRNA and amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. NBD2 was highly overexpressed in Escherichia coli in fusion with glutathione S-transferase and could be purified after efficient thrombin cleavage. Both fused and purified NBD2 bound TNP (2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl))- derivatives of nucleotides with high affinity. TNP-ATP or TNP-ADP binding at micromolar concentrations produced a characteristic blue-shifted enhancement of extrinsic fluorescence and was specifically prevented or chased by ATP or ADP at millimolar concentrations. A similar affinity binding was monitored by quenching of intrinsic fluorescence. The spectrum of fusion protein, containing 5 tryptophan residues, was maximally quenched at 328 nm upon interaction with TNP-nucleotides. TNP-GTP exhibited a lower affinity than TNP-ATP but produced a higher maximal quenching (44% instead of 28%). The intrinsic fluorescence of purified NBD2, containing a single tryptophan residue, exhibited a narrow spectrum with a maximum at 328 nm characteristic of a hydrophobic tryptophan environment. A high quenching was observed upon nucleotide interaction with similar affinity. The results put forward a functional role for the tryptophan-containing sequence of P-glycoprotein NBD2 that was not detected up to now."
https://openalex.org/W1542422271,"Measurement of the affinity of microtubules for the anti-cancer drug taxol is problematic, because microtubules are not stable at the very low concentrations required to detect taxol dissociation. We have circumvented this problem by using the GTP analogue GMP-CPP (guanylyl alpha, beta-methylenediphosphonate), which renders microtubules sufficiently stable to allow binding studies with nonsaturating concentrations of taxol. AKd value equal to about 10 nM was estimated from the effect of taxol concentration on the dilution-induced disassembly rate and on the binding of [3H]taxol. With GTP-microtubules the Kd value for taxol binding by tubulin-GDP subunits in the core of the microtubule appears to be comparable with that of GMPCPP-microtubules. However, the stabilizing effect of the drug bound to tubulin subunits that arrive at ends of disassembling microtubules is attenuated by a two-step reaction sequence in which taxol dissociates (k = 30 s-1), followed by rapid (k = 1000 s-1) loss of the taxol-free tubulin subunit. This sequential reaction can be disrupted by high (micromolar) concentrations of taxol, which react rapidly with tubulin subunits at the ends of microtubules (k = 2 x 10(9) M-1 s-1). The inhibitory effect of taxol on microtubule disassembly at concentrations a thousand-fold greater than the Kd value suggests the desirability of using high taxol concentrations in chemotherapy with this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1508212622,"The activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) by 1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD) or ibotenate induced a rapid cell volume increase in primary cultures of type 1 astroglial cells from the cerebral cortex of a newborn rat. These relative volume changes and parallel Ca2+ transients in single cells were examined by microspectrofluorimetry after loading the cells with fura-2/AM and varying the excitation wavelengths between the isosbestic point of the probe and its ion-sensitive wavelength. L(+)-2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) evoked an astroglial swelling but few or no cytosolic Ca2+ transients. No rapid swelling was observed after stimulation of ionotropic Glu receptors. The Glu-induced volume increase was unaffected by gluconate or amiloride, partially blocked by Glu-carrier blockers, and totally blocked by ketamine. The Glu- or L-AP4-induced volume increases were blocked by BaCl2 or furosemide. Tetraethylammoniumchloride-1-hydrate blocked the Glu- and 1S,3R-ACPD-induced astroglial swelling but the voltage-dependent L-, N-, or T-type Ca2+ channels were not primarily involved in the Glu-, 1S,3R-ACPD-, or L-AP4-induced swelling. mGluRs induce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis, intracellular Ca2+ increase, and the opening of a delayed outward K+ rectifier, and along another route they activate a Gi protein and open an inward K+ rectifier. One Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)-cotransporter and a Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase is activated and so also is an electrogenic Na(+)-dependent Glu carrier. Thus, Glu-induced astroglial swelling is not only the result of the above mechanisms, but requires another, until now unidentified mechanism, probably some ketamine-sensitive K+ outflux or Na+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W1581416262,"Inactivation of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by acivicin (L-(alpha S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid) is rapid, thought to be irreversible, and associated with binding of close to 1 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme. Previous studies with [3-14C]acivicin indicated binding (prevented by substrate) to a specific hydroxyl group (threonine 523) of the rat kidney enzyme. In the present work, we found that such inactivation can be reversed by treating the inhibited enzyme with hydroxylamine. Reactivation (more than 85% complete) is associated with release from the inactivated enzyme of compounds that exhibit the properties of threo-beta-hydroxy-L-gamma-glutamyl hydroxamate and 3-hydroxypyrrolidone-2-carboxylate. We found that the enzyme acts very slowly on acivicin, at a rate that is about 10(-9) that of its normal catalytic rate with glutathione, to form threo-beta-hydroxy-L-glutamate and hydroxylamine. The findings indicate that inhibition by acivicin involves its transformation on the enzyme to an inhibitory species which is attached, apparently by ester linkage, to a specific hydroxyl group of the enzyme. The very slow rate of release of this intermediate appears to account for the observed inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1608932825,"Replication-blocking lesions generate a signal in Escherichia coli that leads to the induction of the multigene SOS response. Among the SOS-induced genes are umuD and umuC, whose products are necessary for the increased mutation rate in induced bacteria. The mutations are likely to result from replication across the DNA lesion, and such a bypass event has been reconstituted in vitro (Rajagopalan, M., L, C., Woodgate, R., O'Donnel, M., Goodman, M. F., Echols, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 10777-10781). In this work, we show that the chaperone proteins promote the proper folding of UmuC protein in vitro. We treated purified and inactive UmuC with Hsp70 and Hsp60. After Hsp70 treatment, the DNA binding activity of UmuC was recovered, but the ability to promote replication across DNA lesions was not. However, lesion bypass activity was recovered upon further treatment with Hsp60. The biological significance of such a folding pathway for UmuC protein is strengthened by in vivo evidence for a role of DnaK in UV-induced mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1524969330,"To investigate the relationship between prohormone processing and sorting of mature polypeptides into nascent secretory vesicles, we recently developed a permeabilized cell system that supports both these reactions (Xu, H., and Shields, D. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 122, 1169-1184). Rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells expressing high levels of prosomatostatin (proSRIF) were incubated at 20 degrees C; this temperature prevented exit from the trans-Golgi network and inhibited proSRIF processing. Following the 20 degrees C block, the cells were mechanically permeabilized and incubated at 37 degrees C, and proSRIF processing was determined. Cleavage of proSRIF to the mature hormone required ATP hydrolysis and was inhibited by chloroquine, a weak base, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a protonophore. This suggested that a proton gradient and/or an acidic pH facilitated by a vacuolar H(+)-ATPase was required for prohormone processing. We have now utilized the permeabilized cell system in conjunction with the antibiotic bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H(+)-ATPases, to elucidate the role of acidic pH in prohormone processing. Here we report that (i) proSRIF processing was inhibited in vivo and in vitro by low concentrations of bafilomycin A1, confirming the involvement of a vacuolar type ATPase in prohormone processing; (ii) the ATP requirement for processing could be circumvented in vitro by incubating permeabilized cells at acidic pH in the presence of protonophores, indicating that an acidic pH rather than a H+ gradient is necessary for processing; and (iii) a pH of between 6 and 6.2 in the trans-Golgi network was optimal for proSRIF cleavage. We also demonstrate that prohormone convertase 2 exhibited temperature-dependent activity in which proSRIF processing was inhibited at 20 degrees C in vitro. This result explains our previous observation that prohormone processing is inhibited when intact cells are incubated at 20 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1572177748,"HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII."
https://openalex.org/W1937868599,"The substrate specificity of lysyl oxidase has been explored with synthetic oligopeptides. kcat/Km increased with increasing peptide length in Ac-(Gly)n-Lys-(Gly)n-CONH2 (n = 1-5). Using 11-mers as the standard peptide length, Glu immediately N-terminal to Lys increased kcat/Km 8.8-fold over that for the -Lys-Glu- sequence and 4.9-fold over the glutamate-free control. Kinetic constants were significantly less perturbed when Glu was 2 or more residues distant from Lys. Replacement of Glu in -Glu-Lys- with Gln significantly increased Km and lowered kcat/Km. Asp rather than Glu N-terminal to Lys decreased Km similar to that of the -Glu-Lys- 11-mer, although the kcat decreased considerably, indicating that lysyl oxidase responds to the side chain length of vicinal Asp or Glu at this position. -Asp-Glu-Lys- within an 11-mer was not oxidized, although this sequence is oxidized within the N-terminal telopeptide of the alpha 1(I) chain in type I collagen fibrils. Thus, lysyl oxidase exhibits distinct preferences for sequences vicinal to lysine. These results are discussed with respect to a model requiring collagen fibril formation prior to oxidation of lysine in collagen by lysyl oxidase."

In contrast, ATP-utilizing enzymes such as hexokinase or rhodopsin kinase were not effected."
https://openalex.org/W1585830736,"The glycosylation and phosphorylation of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A was analyzed by a combination of metabolic labeling, tryptic fragmentation, mass spectrometry, and radiosequencing. The results demonstrate that all three potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn residues 158, 184, and 350 are utilized in arylsufatase A and carry high mannose or hybride type oligosaccharides. Phosphorylation of mannose residues is restricted to oligosaccharides at the first and third N-glycosylation site (Asn-158 and Asn-350). Both are phosphorylated with comparable efficiency. An earlier study had shown that a mutant arylsulfatase A containing only the second N-glycosylation site at Asn-184 folds correctly and is phosphorylated (Gieselmann, V., Schmidt, B., and von Figura, K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13262-13266). The lack of phosphorylation at Asn-184 in wild type arylsulfatase A therefore indicates that in vivo the presence of oligosaccharides can interfere with phosphorylation of other sites or that phosphorylation occurs in an ordered manner whereby phosphorylation of one site can affect the phosphorylation of another site."
https://openalex.org/W1497285805,"Elevating the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions in human erythrocytes leads to the formation of membrane-associated polymers, composed of skeletal and cytoplasmic proteins. The anion transporter band 3 serves as a membrane anchor for this N epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-linked polymer. The reaction is catalyzed by an intrinsic transglutaminase, and it can be observed in broken cells merely by the addition of Ca2+. Certain primary amines, such as dansylcadaverine, inhibit the process by virtue of competition against the epsilon-lysyl or donor functionalities of the protein substrates. Dansylcadaverine itself becomes incorporated into the enzyme-specific gamma-glutaminyl or acceptor residues, blocking these from participating in the formation of protein-to-protein cross-links. This labeling procedure, coupled with an anti-dansyl antibody affinity procedure to isolate dansyl-labeled compounds, was employed to identify Gln-30 as the preferred transglutaminase-reactive acceptor site in the band 3 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1552421601,"The multifunctional protein CAD catalyzes the first three steps in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Glutamine-dependent carbamyl-phosphate synthetase (CPSase), aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase activities are carried by a 243-kDa polypeptide chain that is organized into discrete functional domains connected by interdomain linkers. One of the connecting chain segments, the DA linker bridging the dihydroorotase and aspartate transcarbamylase domains, is unusually long (109 residues) and conserved in length in all eukaryotic species. A plasmid (pCK-CAD10) that encodes the entire 243-kDa polypeptide was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified protein had kinetic parameters that were close to those obtained for native CAD. Moreover, the CPSase activity was allosterically regulated. Gel filtration showed that the recombinant protein had the same molecular mass as native CAD. Thus, this complex mammalian protein is expressed and folds correctly in bacterial cells and, despite its extreme protease sensitivity, can be isolated intact. A deletion mutant that lacked the DA linker was then constructed. The kinetic parameters of the mutant protein were, for the most part, unaltered, showing that the DA linker is not essential for the proper folding or optimal functioning of the individual domains. However, a significant decrease in the thermal stability of the CPSase domain suggested that the linker helps to stabilize the complex. Moreover, the channeling of carbamyl phosphate, determined by measuring the extent to which the exogenously added intermediate could dilute the endogenous carbamyl phosphate pool, was appreciably reduced when the DA linker was removed. Thus, although the domains function autonomously, some of the linkers are important for interdomain interactions in CAD."
https://openalex.org/W1589257585,"The production of large amounts of paclitaxel for use as an anticancer treatment has been a challenging problem because of the low concentration of the compound in yew trees and its occurrence as part of a mixture of other taxanes. Two novel enzymes were isolated to facilitate the production of 10-deacetylbaccatin III, a precursor used for semisynthesis of paclitaxel and analogs. A strain of Nocardioides albus (SC13911) was isolated from soil and found to produce an extracellular enzyme that specifically removed the C-13 side chain from paclitaxel, cephalomannine, 7-beta-xylosyltaxol, 7-beta-xylosyl-10-deacetyltaxol, and 10-deacetyltaxol. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity to give a polypeptide with 47,000 M(r) on a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. A strain of Nocardioides luteus (SC13912) isolated from soil was found to produce an intracellular 10-deacetylase that removed the 10-acetate from baccatin III and paclitaxel. The 10-deacetylase was purified to give a polypeptide with 40,000 M(r) on a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. Treatment of extracts prepared from a variety of yew cultivars with the C-13-deacylase and C-10-deacetylase converted a complex mixture of taxanes primarily to 10-deacetylbaccatin III and increased the amount of this key precursor by 4-24 times."
https://openalex.org/W1519434948,"Arylsulfatase A is a lysosomal enzyme that is involved in the degradation of sulfated glycolipids. High levels of arylsulfatase A mRNA are found in germ cells of mouse testis. In late pachytene and secondary spermatocytes the level of arylsulfatase A mRNA is increased 20-fold when compared with other tissues. These high levels of arylsulfatase A mRNA are maintained in round spermatids and decrease in late elongating spermatids. The increase of arylsulfatase A mRNA levels is not accompanied by a similar increase in enzyme activity or polypeptides. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the majority of arylsulfatase A mRNA is not associated with polysomes but is found in fractions of lower buoyancy. The failure to become translated is ascribed to the association of arylsulfatase A mRNA with nonpolysomal ribonucleoproteins. This translational repression may be due to proteins that bind to arylsulfatase A mRNA and prevent its translation. Within the 639-nucleotide 5'-untranslated region and the 700-nucleotide 3'-untranslated region of the arylsulfatase A mRNA, we identified two regions that specifically bind proteins present in extracts prepared from testicular cells. These RNA binding proteins were absent from extracts prepared from liver or brain."

https://openalex.org/W1563800106,"We have purified a soluble rabbit reticulocyte protein, previously termed the supernatant factor, that reverses the inhibition of protein synthesis in hemin-deficient lysate by promoting the inactivation of the hemin-controlled eIF-2 alpha kinase (HCR) mediating the effect of hemin deficiency. We have identified the supernatant factor as a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, denoted hsp 70(R), based upon its size (72 kDa), specific reaction to a monoclonal antibody against eukaryotic hsp 70, strong binding affinity for ATP, and endogenous ATPase activity. We have investigated the role of hsp 70(R) and hemin in the regulation of the activation of HCR from its latent precursor (ProHCR) and the translational control of protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We find that autophosphorylation of Pro-HCR is reduced by about 75% by adding saturating hsp 70(R) and almost completely reduced by adding either saturating hemin or limiting hemin plus limiting hsp 70(R). In contrast, autophosphorylation of HCR, which is similar in magnitude to that of ProHCR, is unaffected by adding either saturating hsp 70(R), saturating hemin, or limiting amounts of both. The activation of HCR (measured by inhibition of protein synthesis) from isolated ProHCR is completely prevented by hsp 70(R) in the presence, but not absence, of dithiothreitol. This suppression appears to be due to the association of hsp 70(R) with ProHCR, since hsp 70(R) action is prevented by ATP/Mg2+ and because activation of HCR from less purified ProHCR, that has associated hsp 70(R), is suppressed by dithiothreitol alone. This association is confirmed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, which shows co-sedimentation of some hsp 70(R) with ProHCR following preincubation together that is prevented by ATP/Mg2+ and does not occur after conversion of ProHCR to HCR. Limiting hsp 70(R) reduces the concentration of hemin required to prevent activation of HCR from isolated ProHCR from 0.75 to 0.15 microM and the optimal hemin concentration needed to maintain protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysate from 25 to 10 microM. Limiting hsp 70(R) also allows the delayed addition of hemin to suppress activation of HCR from ProHCR and to reverse inhibition of protein synthesis in hemin deficient lysate. The association of hsp 70(R) with ProHCR also underlies the observation that much more protein is synthesized in reticulocyte lysate in the absence of hemin at 25 degrees C than at temperatures of 30 degrees C or greater. These observed effects may be specific to hsp 70(R), since they are not observed with rabbit reticulocyte eIF-2 or eIF-2B, and since the comparable hsp 70 from bovine brain is incapable of maintaining or restoring protein synthesis in hemin-deficient lysate."
