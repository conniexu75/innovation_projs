https://openalex.org/W1984252277,"THE biological formation of hydrogen peroxide has often been postulated in the past, particularly in connexion with the presumed function of catalase and peroxidase; but so far its actual detection has been successful only in cultures of some bacteria1,2,3 and some moulds4,5 and in certain enzymic oxidations catalysed in vitro and requiring molecular oxygen for the oxidation of their respective substrates. The chemical identification of H2O2 as a product of metabolic processes of animal tissues has up to now been unsuccessful. Indirect evidence for H2O2 formation during respiration of bovine spermatozoa in egg-yolk medium has been submitted in a previous communication6, and some evidence of its possible formation in human sperm has been given7. Using suspensions of washed spermatozoa in presence of a substance separated from egg-yolk, we have now been able to demonstrate chemically the formation of hydrogen peroxide."

https://openalex.org/W2045321233,"Since the majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis show a slower fall in the blood sugar level after the intravenous injection of glucose than do the normal controls, the alteration cannot be explained on the basis of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Differences in the renal threshold of glucose do not explain the altered glucose tolerance, since approximately the same amount of glucose is lost in the urine in both groups. Blood samples taken at 3 and 5 minutes following the injection of the glucose showed the height of the blood sugar level to be approximately the same in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in normals. The slower fall in the blood sugar level of the former is therefore not a simple function of a greater rise following the intravenous administration of the glucose. Although the patients with severe poliomyelitis had as much or more atrophy than the rheumatoid arthritic patients, there was no delay in rate of fall of the blood sugar level after the intravenous administration of glucose. In view of the fact that the hepatic homeostatic control regulates the blood sugar level, faulty utilization of glucose by extrahepatic tissues cannot be considered the primary factor responsible for the alteration of the glucose tolerance. The altered glucose tolerance in rheumatoid arthritis is explainable on the basis of an altered threshold of the hepatic homeostatic control of the blood sugar. Additional studies must be done to determine whether this derangement emanates directly from extrahepatic influences."

https://openalex.org/W2092929356,"THE availability of separated human plasma proteins resulting from recent advances in fractionation methods1 has provided the possibility of further investigations into the clotting mechanism in hæmophilia. It is of particular interest to find with which normal plasma fraction is associated the coagulation-promoting substance effective in hæmophilia2, and to make a closer examination of this material. Important results have already been published on this subject3."
https://openalex.org/W2057610967,"As the result of work on the optical absorption and electrical conductivity of mixtures of nitric and sulphuric acids, and on the depression of the freezing point of sulphuric acid by added nitric acid, Hantzsch concluded that in such solutions nitric acid is largely converted into two cations, H2NO3+ and H3NO3++, the latter being the principal form present in excess of sulphuric acid1. The optical and electrical work showed essentially that the nitric acid is converted into an altered form, and that this consists of or contains ions. The cryoscopic work furnished a specific argument in favour of the bivalent ion. For the univalent ion corresponds to a two-fold, and the bivalent ion to a three-fold, depression by nitric acid of the freezing point of the sulphuric acid solvent: the van't Hoff i-factors would be as shown. Experimentally, Hantzsch found a three-fold depression (i = 3): The remaining evidence of a specific nature consists in Hantzsch's claim to have isolated crystalline perchlorates corresponding to each of his ions, namely, the salts (H2NO3+) (ClO4â) and (H3NO3++) (ClO4â)2 (cf. the following note)."
https://openalex.org/W1996298081,"EXISTING theories of the viscosity of liquids fail to give a satisfactory account of the temperature variation of the viscosity of certain associated liquids. The X-ray diffraction patterns of liquids show that the inter-atomic distances vary about a mean; the variability increasing with increasing temperature. In addition, for the silicate glasses and for water, it is concluded that the structure is a random three-dimensional network of atomic bonds. This network is continuous throughout the liquid and in this sense glasses and water are associated liquids. In glasses the network is built up of Si—O bonds and in water of O—H bonds, the silicon atoms being surrounded by four oxygen atoms, and in water, the oxygen atoms by four hydrogen atoms."

This activity they ascribed to Li8 formed according to the reaction"

https://openalex.org/W2039901192,"Woolley (3, 4) had found the agent to be present in the whole blood of his strains, in concentrations suggestively similar to its concentration in milk. In our experiments whole blood was obtained by heart puncture from 100 mature etherized female Paris mice, whose tumor incidence in our laboratory has been 92.9 ± 1.84 per cent in bred female controls. All blood samples were pooled, and serum and serum fractions were prepared in the appropriate manner from this pool. Single doses of 0.2 cc. of whole blood or serum, or serum fraction equivalent to 0.2 cc. serum, were injected subcutaneously into young female C57 test mice, a strain in which there have been no spontaneous mammary carcinomata during the past five years in our laboratory. This strain has proved highly susceptible to the milk factor, developing 76.1 ± 4.34 per cent carcinoma of the breast in females by foster nursing (2). The injected mice were subsequently bred and allowed to bring up their young normally under our standard control conditions. The final results appear in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W1990513184,"IT has been shown by Weigert and Mottram1 that, independent of its mode of introduction into an animal, benzpyrene passes through a series of chemical changes prior to its final excretion. The following evidence suggests that the first derivatives—provisionally termed X1 and X2—are produced locally in those organs (liver, kidney, lung) where the benzpyrene is concentrated after intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, and also in the blood. The same happens in the subcutaneous tissues and in the skin of mice after the injection or painting of benzpyrene."
https://openalex.org/W2015276368,"DEBYE has reported1 that the velocity of thermal diffusion, relative to that of ordinary diffusion, is much greater in polymer solutions than in simple solutions. This result is likely to arouse a great deal of interest, and the following recent observations of our own concerning thermal diffusion in solutions of polymethyl methacrylate in various solvents may therefore be opportune."
https://openalex.org/W2023710589,"ACCOUNTS have been already published of the effects of vitamin D, alteration of the Ca : P ratio of the diet, and dietary restriction, upon the dentin of the incisors of rachitic rats1. It was noted during this work that the formation of organic enamel was sometimes upset by these procedures in animals on the Steenbock and Black rachitogenic diet of high Ca : P ratio; but that the organic enamel of animals made rachitic by low Ca : P ratio diets was scarcely ever affected. The fact that organic enamel formation in rats on a high Ca : P ratio diet is easily upset by various metabolic changes has been confirmed by recent experiments, which were undertaken in a different way and originally for another purpose2 : after twenty-eight days on the usual Steenbock and Black diet, the animals were subjected to dietary restriction for 5–6 days. By this time it was found by examining a control rat that the epiphyses showed a well-marked 'line test' response. The remainder of the litter was then placed back on to full Steenbock and Black diet, and rats were killed and examined at intervals up to fifteen days thereafter, depending on the litter size and length of survival. Five litters of rats were treated in this way."
https://openalex.org/W2035259681,"IN a recent paper, Renard1 has applied a method by which the qualitative analysis of the hydrolysates of proteins seems easily realized. The first step of the process consists in transforming the Î±-mono-amino mono-carboxylic acids resulting from hydrolysis into Î±-chloro-acids; the latter having been separated into different groups by fractional distillation, Raman analysis is used to identify the compounds. The fundamental assumption made by Renard is that the spectrum of the mixture results from the superposition of the spectra of the constituent acids."

https://openalex.org/W2081065782,"A strain of Str. dysgalactiae was found to be an effective test organism for penicillin blood-level determinations. This organism, although inhibited by penicillin in concentrations of 0.006-0.008 unit/ml., is resistant to the natural inhibiting substances of blood sera. The latter characteristic is very significant, since the test organisms (Str. pyogenes C-203 and B. subtilis) that are now employed for penicillin assay of body fluids are inhibited by a large percentage of human sera. The method described can detect penicillin blood levels in concentration of 0.016 unit/ml. of blood sera. Since blood levels above 0.03 unit/ml. are considered to be therapeutically effective, this method of assay is adequately sensitive for routine clinical application."

https://openalex.org/W4241980220,"BOTH the man of science and the technologist are greatly indepted to the Society of Dyers and Colourists for its enterprise in organising a symposium on fibrous proteins so soon after the end of the War. The meetings were held at the University of Leeds during May 23–25, and among the three hundred in attendanee were visitors from Australia, Belgium, France, Holland, Norway, Sweden and the United States. Full details of the proceedings will appear in a volume which is to be issued shortly by the Society. Some thirty papers were read and discussed: they covered subjects ranging from the structure of protein molecules to the production of synthetic protein fibres; from the thermodynamics of water adsorption by proteins to the production of an unshrinkable finish on wool. No distinction could be drawn between science and technology, for new methods of examining the structure of wool and silk were shown to give results with a profound bearing on recent hypotheses concerning the structure of protein molecules in general, and technological advances were found to be the direct outcome of a clearer understanding of the nature of the proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1968120745,"IT is widely believed that the titre of the incomplete or blocking (δ) antibody, as determined by the quantitative saline test1, is dependent on the dilution of the anti-Rh0 serum added to the mixture of red cells and unknown serum2. Coombs, Mourant and Race3 stated in a recent article, It is remarkable that the “blocking” effect at this time still remained proof against our strongest I serum. However, if the incomplete antibody is “univalent”, as suggested by Wiener4, and if the “blocking” effect is a quantitative reaction, the presence or absence of agglutination in the “saline test” would be expected to be dependent on the absolute amount of incomplete antibody (I) present and not on the amount of the anti-Rh0 serum added."

This suggests that these two groups of biologists should work together more closely."

https://openalex.org/W4230557788,"IN giving the University Grants Committee new terms of referance as announced by the Chancellor in the House of Commons on July 30, the Government has taken a first step to implement the findings of the Barlow Committee. That Committee, while considering that the expansion programme envisaged did not call for the replacement of the University Grants Committee by any new organ of government, expressed the view that circumstances demanded that the University Grants Committee should policy and that it might be desirable for this purpose to revise its terms of reference and to strengthen its machinery. Under the new terms of reference, the University Grants Committee is now empowered, in addition to inquiring into the financial needs of university education and advising the Government as to the application of grants made by Parliament towards meeting them, “to collect, examine, and make available information on matters relating to University education at home and abroad; and to assist, in consultation with the Universities and other bodies concerned, the preparation and execution of such plans for the development of the Universities as may from time to time be required in order to ensure that they are fully adequate to national needs”."
https://openalex.org/W4244373822,"DR. DOROTHY S. RUSSELL, recently elected professor of morbid anateiny in the University of London and director of the Bernhard Baron Institute of Pathology at the London Hospital, was born at Sydney, Australia. Coming to England as a child, she were from the Perse High School for Girls to Girton College, Cambridge, and passed Part I of the Natural Sciences Tripos (Class 1). A Gilchrist Studentship gave her another year at Cambridge. She entered the London Hospital in 1919, took the Conjoint Diploma in January 1922, and later became M.D. Lond. (University Medal), M.A. Oxford (by decree), Sc.D. Camb. (for published work) and M.R.C.P. London (by by-law 123). She was the first woman awarded the John Hunter Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons (1934). After a year as pathology assistant in the Institute (1922–23) she became a Junior Beit Fellow. Her research, “A Classification of Bright's Disease”, was made a Special Report by the Medical Research Council. Then as Rockefeller Medical Research Fellow she divided a year in the United States between Prof. F. B. Mallory and Dr. Wilder Penfield. She then worked in the Bernhard Baron Institute with Sir Hugh Cairns with grants from the Medical Research Council, to the scientific staff of which she was appointed in 1933. She worked at Oxford during the War, returning to the Institute in October 1944."
