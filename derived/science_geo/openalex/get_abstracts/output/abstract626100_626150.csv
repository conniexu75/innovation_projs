https://openalex.org/W2909508198,"Background Data regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and genotype distribution are limited in Shandong Province, China. Therefore, we investigated the recent HPV prevalence and genotype distribution among females in Shandong and aimed to provide comprehensive data to guide HPV-based cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination for this population of Chinese women. Methods HPV testing results of 94,489 females were retrospectively reviewed and extracted from the database of Jinan KingMed Diagnostics, the largest independent pathology laboratory in Shandong Province, China. HPV was detected by a HPV genotyping panel from January 2011 to June 2017. The overall prevalence, age-specific prevalence, and genotype distribution were analyzed. Results A total of 26,839 cases (28.4%) were HPV-positive, with 4.3% positive for low- or undetermined-risk HPV (lr-/urHPV)-only, 18.1% positive for high-risk HPV (hrHPV)-only, and 6.1% positive for mixed lr-/urHPV and hrHPV infections. Single HPV infections accounted for 62.8%, while the rest were multiple HPV infections of two or more genotypes. HPV16 (5.8%), HPV52 (5.1%), HPV58 (3.5%), HPV51 (2.6%), and HPV56 (2.3%) were the five most common hrHPV genotypes; while HPV81 (2.8%), HPV53 (2.8%), and HPV6 (2.3%) were the three most common lr-/urHPV genotypes. HPV18 (1.7%) was only the ninth most common hrHPV genotype. HPV16 but not HPV52 was more common in single infections than in multiple infections. The distribution of both mixed lr-/urHPV and hrHPV as well as overall HPV infections demonstrated a bimodal pattern across age groups, of which the first peak appeared in the younger group and the second peak was found in older women. A similar age-specific distribution was observed in multiple infections of three or more subtypes as well. Moreover, the proportion of mixed lr-/urHPV and hrHPV infection significantly increased, while those of lr-/urHPV-only and hrHPV-only infections declined as the number of co-infections increased during the study period. Conclusion This large daily clinical practice report shows that HPV prevalence and genotype distribution are different in this population, who had limited cervical cancer screening service, compared to those in developed countries. Therefore, different strategies should be developed for HPV-based cervical cancer screening and vaccine-based HPV prevention in Shandong Province."
https://openalex.org/W2909308045,"Aspergillus niger and other filamentous fungi are widely used in industry, but efficient genetic engineering of these hosts remains nascent. For example, while molecular genetic tools have been developed, including CRISPR/Cas9, facile genome engineering of A. niger remains challenging. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple Cas9-based gene targeting method that provides selectable, iterative, and ultimately marker-free generation of genomic deletions and insertions. This method leverages locus-specific “pop-out” recombination to suppress off-target integrations. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by targeting the phenotypic marker albA and validated it by targeting the glaA and mstC loci. After two selection steps, we observed 100% gene editing efficiency across all three loci. This method greatly reduces the effort required to engineer the A. niger genome and overcomes low Cas9 transformations efficiency by eliminating the need for extensive screening. This method represents a significant addition to the A. niger genome engineering toolbox and could be adapted for use in other organisms. It is expected that this method will impact several areas of industrial biotechnology, such as the development of new strains for the secretion of heterologous enzymes and the discovery and optimization of metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2909739091,"Inland waters are unique ecosystems offering services and habitat resources upon which many species depend. Despite the importance of, and threats to, inland water, global assessments of protected area (PA) coverage and trends have focused on land habitats or have assessed land and inland waters together. We here provide the first assessment of the level of protection of inland open surface waters and their trends (1984-2015) within PAs for all countries, using a globally consistent, high-resolution (30 m) and validated dataset on permanent and seasonal surface waters based on Landsat images. Globally, 15% of inland surface waters are covered by PAs with mapped boundaries. Estimated inland water protection increases to 16.4% if PAs with reported area but delineated only as points are included as circular buffers. These coverage estimates slightly exceed the comparable figure for land but fall below the 17% goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 for 2020. Protection levels are very uneven across countries, half of which do not yet meet the 17% target. The lowest coverage of surface water by PAs (<5%) was found in Africa and in parts of Asia. There was a global trend of permanent water losses and seasonal water gains within PAs, concomitant with an increase of both water types outside PAs. In 38% of countries, PAs lost over 5% of permanent water. Global protection targets for inland waters may well be met by 2020, but much stronger efforts are required to ensure their effective conservation, which will depend not only on sound PA governance and management but also on the sustainable use of water resources outside PAs. Given the pressures on water in a rapidly changing world, integrated management planning of water resources involving multiple sectors and entire basins is therefore necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2909393055,"The G8 questionnaire is a quick and easy-to-use screening tool. Several studies reported that the G8 questionnaire had a high sensitivity for predicting abnormalities in the full comprehensive geriatric assessment and predicted functional decline and survival in elderly cancer patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of the G8 questionnaire for predicting clinical outcomes and overall survival (OS) in elderly patients with lung cancer, who received chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The data of 101 lung cancer patients aged ≥70 years, who were hospitalized between September 2011 and August 2014, were analyzed. Of these patients (median age, 77 years), 83 (82%) had impaired G8 scores. The proportion of patients with an impaired G8 score was significantly higher in patients aged ≥80 years than those aged <80 years (p = 0.04). All 18 patients with a normal G8 score possessed an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and none of the patients with a normal G8 score had an ECOG PS of ≥2 (p < 0.0001). An impaired G8 score tended to correlate with a relative dose intensity of <0.65 in patients who received chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.05, odds ratio = 5.40). In the univariate analysis, an ECOG PS of ≥2 and an impaired G8 score were significantly associated with a poor OS (p = 0.009 and p = 0.003, respectively). Moreover, in the multivariate analysis, an ECOG PS of ≥2 (HR 2.55; 95% CI, 1.23-5.30; p = 0.01) and an impaired G8 score (HR 3.86; 95% CI, 1.44-13.36; p = 0.006) were remained independent prognostic factor for OS. G8 screening tool is useful for the prognostication of elderly lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. These finding suggest that the G8 questionnaire could be a useful tool in treatment decision-making to predict prognosis and prevent patients from receiving inappropriate anti-cancer treatment near the end of life."
https://openalex.org/W2909660922,"The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been attributed to a high frequency of tumor metastasis and recurrence even after successful surgical resection. With less than 30% of patients benefiting from curative treatment, alternative treatment regimens for patients with advanced HCC are needed. Propyl gallate (PG), a synthetic antioxidant used in preserving food and medicinal preparations, has been shown to induce cancer cell death, but the anticancer effects of PG in HCC are unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that PG inhibited HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in zebrafish models in vivo in a dose- and time-dependent manner. PG also induced cell apoptosis and increased the number of necrotic cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner as determined using a high-content analysis system. We found that PG also increased the intracellular levels of superoxide and reactive oxidative stress as well as the formation of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Regarding the molecular mechanism, PG did not alter the levels of autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), ATG5/12 or Beclin-1 but increased the rate of the LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, suggesting autophagy induction. PG exposure increased the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, Bax, and Bad and a decreased level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PG inhibits HCC cell proliferation through enhanced ROS production and autophagy activation. Finally, PG-treated cells induced cell apoptosis and may be a new candidate for HCC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2909163216,"Streptococcus suis is an economically important pathogen of pigs as well as a zoonotic cause of human disease. Serotyping is used for further characterization of isolates; some serotypes seem to be more virulent and more widely spread than others. This study characterizes a collection of German field isolates of Streptococcus suis from pigs dating from 1996 to 2016 with respect to capsular genes (cps) specific for individual serotypes and pathotype by multiplex PCR and relates results to the clinical background of these isolates. The most prominent finding was the reduction in prevalence of serotype-2/serotype-1/2 among invasive isolates during this sampling period, which might be attributed to widely implemented autogenous vaccination programs in swine against serotype 2 in Germany. In diseased pigs (systemically ill; respiratory disease) isolates of serotype-1/serotype-14, serotype-2/serotype-1/2, serotype 3 to 5 and 7 to 9 were most frequent while in carrier isolates a greater variety of cps types was found. Serotype-1/serotype-14 seemed to be preferentially located in joints, serotype 4 and serotype 3 in the central nervous system, respectively. The virulence associated extracellular protein factor was almost exclusively associated with invasive serotype-1/serotype-14 and serotype-2/serotype-1/2 isolates. In contrast, lung isolates of serotype-2/serotype-1/2 mainly harbored the gene for muramidase-released protein. Serotype 4 and serotype 9 isolates from clinically diseased pigs most frequently carried the muramidase-released protein gene and the suilysin gene. When examined by transmission electron microscopy all but one of the isolates which were non-typable by molecular and serological methods showed various amounts of capsular material indicating potentially new serotypes among these isolates. Given the variety of cps types/serotypes detected in pigs, not only veterinarians but also medical doctors should consider other serotypes than just serotype 2 when investigating potential human cases of Streptococcus suis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2909304876,"Histone modifications play a key role in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription in cancer cells. Histone acetylations are regulated by two classes of enzymes, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are increased in ovarian carcinomas and they are involved in carcinogenesis and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. In our study we investigated anticancer effect of HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaBu) on cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cell lines A2780 and A2780cis. A2780 and A2780cis were treated with NaBu alone or in combination with cisplatin (CP). NaBu inhibited the growth of both cell lines and enhanced cytotoxic effect of CP. Exposure to NaBu for 24 h induced cell cycle arrest. The expressions of EMT-related genes and proteins were further investigated by qPCR and western blot analysis. Loss of E-cadherin has been shown to be crucial in ovarian cancer development. We found that NaBu dramatically induce expression of E-cadherin gene (CDH1) and protein levels in A2780 and A2780cis. We investigated correlation between transcription and methylation of CDH1gene. Methylation level analysis in 32 CpG sites in CDH1 gene (promoter/exon1 regions) was performed using bisulfite NGS (Next Generation Sequencing). We found that cisplatin-resistant cell line A2780cis cells differ from their cisplatin-sensitive counterparts in the CDH1 methylation. Methylation in A2780cis cells is elevated compared to A2780. However, NaBu-induced expression of CDH1 was not accompanied by CDH1 demethylation. NaBu treatment induced changes in expression of EMT-related genes and proteins. Interestingly E-cadherin zinc finger transcriptional repressor SNAIL1 was upregulated in both cell lines. Mesenchymal marker vimentin was downregulated. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are necessary for pericellular proteolysis and facilitate migration and invasion of tumour cells. NaBu induced mRNA expression of MMPs, mild changes in activities of gelatinases MMP2 and MMP9 were detected. Our data demonstrate that NaBu sensitizes cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, re-established E-cadherin expression, but it was not able to reverse the EMT phenotype completely."
https://openalex.org/W2910832552,"The motivations that lead to wishes to die (WTD) in palliative care patients with cancer are relatively well studied. But little is known about WTD in other pathologies and the relation between subjective understandings of dying trajectories and a WTD. We investigated the WTD of palliative patients in four different dying trajectories: neurological diseases, organ failure, frailty due to age, and cancer.62 palliative cancer (n = 30) and non-cancer (n = 32) patients (10 neurological disease; 11 organ failure; 11 frailty), their families and health professionals in different palliative care settings (248 interviews).Qualitative semi-structured interviews. Data analysis through Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis and Grounded Theory.In addition to personal motivations, we found that people dealing with similar trajectories were often confronted with similar questions and concerns due to similar challenges. For four trajectories we show typical patterns, similarities and differences that should be considered when talking with patients about their WTD. These illness-related considerations do not explain the WTD completely, but give important information on the challenges for particular patient groups that might experience a WTD. In all patient groups, there were clear moments that triggered a WTD: for neurological patients it was experiencing breathlessness, high-dependency care, or when considering tube feeding or respiratory support; for persons with organ failure it was an acute burdensome crisis; for patients with cancer after the initial diagnosis, it was the first relapse or the move into advanced palliative care; for elderly frail persons it was the move into care facilities, or the loss of important relationships or capabilities. The feeling of being a burden to others was reported in all patient groups.WTD can be triggered within disease trajectories by specific conditions and transitional points that affect agency and self-understanding. A better understanding of the concerns and challenges of a particular dying trajectory as well as its characteristic trigger points can facilitate early and comprehensive communication about patients' WTD, and the underlying motivations and protective factors."
https://openalex.org/W2909827993,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play essential regulatory roles in various developmental processes and stress responses. However, the functions of lncRNAs during the flowering period of tomato are largely unknown. To explore the lncRNA profiles and functions during flowering in tomato, we performed strand-specific paired-end RNA sequencing of tomato leaves, flowers and roots, with three biological replicates. We identified 10919 lncRNAs including 248 novel lncRNAs, of which 65 novel lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (DE) in the flowers, leaves, and roots. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were carried out to identify the cis target gene of DE lncRNAs. The results showed that the lncRNAs might play an important role in the growth, development, and apoptosis of flowering tomato plant by regulating the formation of intima in flower tissues, binding to various molecules, influencing metabolic pathways, and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, we identified the interaction between 32, 78, and 397 kinds of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs. The results suggest that the lncRNAs can regulate the expression of mRNA during flowering period in tomato by forming competitive endogenous RNA, and further regulate various biological metabolism pathways in tomato."
https://openalex.org/W2910951951,"Numerous preclinical studies have supported the theory that enhanced activation of mGluR5 signaling, due to the absence or reduction of the FMR1 protein, contributes to cognitive and behavioral deficits in patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS). However multiple phase 2 controlled trials in patients with FXS have failed to demonstrate efficacy of compounds that negatively modulate mGluR5, including two phase 2b randomized controlled trials (RCT) of mavoglurant (AFQ056, Novartis Pharma AG), when the primary measures of interest were behavioral ratings. This has cast some doubt onto the translation of the mGluR5 theory from animal models to humans with the disorder.We evaluated social gaze behavior-a key phenotypic feature of the disorder-and sympathetic nervous system influence on pupil size using a previously-validated eye tracking paradigm as a biobehavioral probe, in 57 adolescent or adult patients with FXS at baseline and following three months of blinded treatment with one of three doses of mavoglurant or placebo, within the context of the AFQ056 RCTs.Patients with FXS treated with mavoglurant demonstrated increased total absolute looking time and number of fixations to the eye region while viewing human faces relative to baseline, and compared to those treated with placebo. In addition, patients had greater pupil reactivity to faces relative to baseline following mavoglurant treatment compared to placebo.The study shows that negative modulation of mGluR5 activity improves eye gaze behavior and alters sympathetically-driven reactivity to faces in patients with FXS, providing preliminary evidence of this drug's impact on behavior in humans with the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2911039251,"Task- and stimulus-based neuroimaging studies have begun to unveil the central autonomic network which modulates autonomic nervous system activity. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the central autonomic network without the bias constituted by the use of a task. Additionally, we assessed whether this circuitry presents signs of dysregulation in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease (PD), a condition which may be associated with dysautonomia. We combined heart-rate-variability based methods for time-varying assessments of the autonomic nervous system outflow with resting-state fMRI in 14 healthy controls and 14 de novo PD patients, evaluating the correlations between fMRI time-series and the instantaneous high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum, a marker of parasympathetic outflow. In control subjects, the high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum was significantly anti-correlated with fMRI time-series in several cortical, subcortical and brainstem regions. This complex central network was not detectable in PD patients. In between-group analysis, we found that in healthy controls the brain activation related to the high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum was significantly less than in PD patients in the mid and anterior cingulum, sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area, insula and temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and in a region encompassing posterior cingulum, precuneus and parieto-occipital cortex. Our results indicate that the complex central network which modulates parasympathetic outflow in the resting state is impaired in the early clinical stages of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2911120045,"Objective Guidance to address health literacy often focuses on health education rather than tools to facilitate action, despite action being important for self-management. This study evaluated an online intervention informed by health literate design principles and behavior change theory to reduce unhealthy snacking. Methods 440 participants were recruited online and randomized to an intervention: 1) Health-literate action plan (guided implementation intention); 2) Standard action plan (self-guided implementation intention); 3) Education (healthy snacking fact-sheet). The primary outcome was self-reported unhealthy snacking. Follow-up was at 1 month. Results 373 participants (84.8%) completed follow-up. Half the sample had adequate health literacy (52%), and the other half had low (24%) or possibly low (25%) health literacy, as measured by Newest Vital Sign (NVS). At follow-up, lower health literacy was associated with more unhealthy snacks and there was no overall difference between intervention groups. However, participants with lower health literacy who used the health-literate action plan reported less unhealthy snacking compared to the standard action plan; the reverse was true for those with higher health literacy scores (b = 1.7, p = 0.03). People scoring 2 points below the mean NVS (M = 3.4, SD = 2.0) using the health-literate action plan reported eating 8 fewer serves of unhealthy snacks, whereas people scoring 2 points above the mean NVS reported eating 6 more serves of unhealthy snacks using the same tool. Conclusions These findings suggest that the universal precautions approach currently recommended for health information may be less effective for facilitating action than tailoring to health literacy level.

https://openalex.org/W2909679640,"Interprofessional education (IPE) for medical students is becoming increasingly important, as reflected in the increasing number of medical schools adopting IPE. However, the current status of and barriers to pre-registration IPE implementation in Japanese medical schools remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to clarify the status and barriers of IPE implementation in medical schools in Japan. We conducted a curriculum survey from September to December 2016 of all 81 medical schools in Japan. We mailed the questionnaire and asked the schools’ undergraduate education staff to respond. The survey items were the IPE implementation status and barriers to program implementation. Sixty-four of the 81 schools responded (response rate 79.0%), of which 46 (71.9%) had implemented IPE, 42 (89.1%) as compulsory programs. Half of IPE programs were implemented in the first 2 years, while less than 10% were implemented in the latter years of medical programs. As part of the IPE programs, medical students collaborated with a wide range of professional student groups. The most common learning strategy was lectures. However, one-third of IPE programs used didactic lectures without interaction between multi-professional students. The most common perceived major barrier to implementing IPE was adjustment of the academic calendar and schedule (82.8%), followed by insufficient staff numbers (73.4%). Our findings indicate that IPE is being promoted in undergraduate education at medical schools in Japan. IPE programs differed according to the circumstances of each school. Barriers to IPE may be resolved by improving learning methods, introducing group discussions between multi-professional students in lectures or introducing IPE programs using team-based learning. In summary, we demonstrated the current status and barriers of IPE implementation in Japanese medical schools. Our findings will likely lead to the promotion of IPE programs in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2909629686,"Malnutrition, the suboptimal consumption of essential nutrients like zinc, severely affects human health. This burden of malnutrition falls disproportionally heavy on developing countries, directly increasing child mortality and childhood stunting, or reducing people’s ability mending diseases. One option to combat malnutrition is to blend missing nutrients in crop fertilizers, thereby increasing crop yields and possibly the nutrient density in harvested crop products, thus enriching crop products destined for human consumption. But, the effectiveness of so-called agronomic fortification remains ill-understood, primarily due to a paucity of field trials. We hypothesize that, if at all this is an effective strategy, there should exist a causal link between malnutrition and natural variation in the quality of soils to begin with. Until now, data limitations prevented the establishment of such a link, but new soil micronutrient maps for Sub-Saharan Africa allow for a detailed assessment. In doing so, we find statistically significant relations between soil nutrients and child mortality, stunting, wasting and underweight. For instance, a simultaneous increase in soil densities of copper, manganese and zinc by one standard deviation reduces child mortality by 4–6 per mille points, but only when malaria pressure is modest. The effects of soil nutrients on health dissipate when malaria pressure increases. Yet, the effects are fairly small in magnitude suggesting that except for a few regions, agronomic fortification is a relatively cost ineffective means to combat malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2908995601,"Adequate provision of safe water, basic sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities and behavior change can reduce pupil absence and infectious disease. Increased drinking water quantity may also improve educational outcomes through the effect of hydration on attention, concentration, and short-term memory. A pilot study was conducted to adapt field measures of short-term cognitive performance and hydration, to evaluate levels of hydration, and to investigate the impact of providing supplementary drinking water on the cognitive performance of pupils attending water-scarce schools in rural Mali. Using a cross-over trial design, data were collected under normal school conditions (control condition) on one visit day; on the other, participants were given a bottle of water that was refilled throughout the day (water condition). Morning and afternoon hydration was assessed using specific gravity and urine color. Cognitive performance was evaluated using six paper-based tests. Three percent of pupils were dehydrated on the morning of each visit. The prevalence of dehydration increased in the afternoon, but was lower under the water condition. Although there was a trend indicating drinking water may improve cognitive test performance, as has been shown in studies in other settings, results were not statistically significant and were masked by a ""practice effect."""
https://openalex.org/W2909055659,"Previous studies revealed that healthy individuals consistently misjudge the size and shape of their hidden hand during a localisation task. Specifically, they overestimate the width of their hand and underestimate the length of their fingers. This would also imply that the same individuals misjudge the actual location of at least some parts of their hand during the task. Therefore, the primary aim of the current study was to determine whether healthy individuals could accurately locate the actual position of their hand when hidden from view, and whether accuracy depends on the type of localisation task used, the orientation of the hidden hand, and whether the left or right hand is tested. Sixteen healthy right-handed participants performed a hand localisation task that involved both pointing to and verbally indicating the perceived position of landmarks on their hidden hand. Hand position was consistently misjudged as closer to the wrist (proximal bias) and, to a lesser extent, away from the thumb (ulnar bias). The magnitude of these biases depended on the localisation task (pointing vs. verbal), the orientation of the hand (straight vs. rotated), and the hand tested (left vs. right). Furthermore, the proximal location bias increased in size as the duration of the experiment increased, while the magnitude of ulnar bias remained stable through the experiment. Finally, the resultant maps of perceived hand location appear to replicate the previously reported overestimation of hand width and underestimation of finger length. Once again, the magnitude of these distortions is dependent on the task, orientation, and hand tested. These findings underscore the need to control and standardise each component of the hand localisation task in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2910020547,"Patients with primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS) have diminished health quality and fatigue, arthralgia along with dryness of the mouth and eyes have major impact on their psychological and social aspects of life. The purpose of this study was to determine psychological features of patients with pSS. We analyzed personality, depression and anxiety of patients with primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS) in comparison with patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls (HC) and assessed their association with sociodemographic factors and comorbidity.In 105 pSS patients (mean age 51.34 years, mean disease duration 5.98 years), 52 RA patients (mean age 51.37 years, mean disease duration 8.10 years) and 54 HC (mean age 51.35 years) clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were determined and results analyzed. At enrollment patients and controls completed the Revisited NEO Personality Inventory Five-Factor model (NEO-PI-R), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS [Version 16.0]. The relative size of the effect was assessed based on standardized estimates of effect size (d).Patients with pSS, similarly to RA patients had higher scores of Neuroticism (d = 0.46, p = 0.007) and lower scores of Extraversion (d = 0.51, p = 0.001) and Openness for experience (d = 0.65, p = 0.013) compared to HC. There was no significant differences between pSS group and HC in the depression (d = 0.171, p>0.05). However, patients with pSS had higher anxiety in comparison to HC (p<0.0001). In multivariate models, education and satisfaction with family relationships were significant predictors for psychological characteristics of patients, independently of clinical diagnosis.Our study is the first to show that patients with pSS scored high on neuroticism and anxiety and low on sociability. Education and satisfaction with family relationships predisposed to their psychological profile. Psychological assessment of patients with pSS may improve understanding and treatment of this clinical condition."
https://openalex.org/W2951245036,"Significance Foraged leafy greens are consumed around the globe, including in urban areas, and may play a larger role when food is scarce or expensive. It is thus important to assess the safety and nutritional value of wild greens foraged in urban environments. Methods Field observations, soil tests, and nutritional and toxicology tests on plant tissue were conducted for three sites, each roughly 9 square blocks, in disadvantaged neighborhoods in the East San Francisco Bay Area in 2014–2015. The sites included mixed-use areas and areas with high vehicle traffic. Results Edible wild greens were abundant, even during record droughts. Soil at some survey sites had elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium, but tissue tests suggest that rinsed greens of the tested species are safe to eat. Daily consumption of standard servings comprise less than the EPA reference doses of lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals. Pesticides, glyphosate, and PCBs were below detection limits. The nutrient density of 6 abundant species compared favorably to that of the most nutritious domesticated leafy greens. Conclusions Wild edible greens harvested in industrial, mixed-use, and high-traffic urban areas in the San Francisco East Bay area are abundant and highly nutritious. Even grown in soils with elevated levels of heavy metals, tested species were safe to eat after rinsing in tap water. This does not mean that all edible greens growing in contaminated soil are safe to eat—tests on more species, in more locations, and over a broader range of soil chemistry are needed to determine what is generally safe and what is not. But it does suggest that wild greens could contribute to nutrition, food security, and sustainability in urban ecosystems. Current laws, regulations, and public-health guidance that forbid or discourage foraging on public lands, including urban areas, should be revisited."
https://openalex.org/W2908760954,"Human ageing is accompanied by a progressive decline in leg-extensor power (LEP). LEP is typically measured with specialized and expensive equipment, which limits the large-scale applicability. Previously, sensor-based trunk kinematics have been used to estimate the vertical power required to elevate the body’s center of mass during functional tests, but the link with LEP and age remains to be investigated. Therefore, we investigated whether a body-fixed sensor-based analysis of power during stair ascent (SA) and sit-to-stand (STS) is positively related to LEP and whether its ability to detect age-related declines is similar. In addition, the effect of load during SA and STS was investigated. 98 adults (20–70 years) performed a leg press to assess LEP, SA and 5-repetition STS tests. In SA and STS, two conditions were tested: unloaded and loaded (+10% body mass). An inertial measurement unit was used to analyze (sub)-durations and vertical power. SA and STS power were more related to LEP than duration parameters (i.e. 0.80–0.81 for power and -0.41 –-0.66 for duration parameters, p < 0.05). The average annual age-related percent change was higher in SA power (-1.38%) than in LEP (-0.86%) and STS power (-0.38%) (p < 0.05). Age explained 29% in SA power (p < 0.001), as opposed to 14% in LEP (p < 0.001) and a non-significant 2% in STS power (p = 0.102). The addition of 10% load did not influence the age-related decline of SA and STS power nor the relationship with LEP. These results demonstrate the potential of SA tests to detect age-related deterioration in neuromuscular function. SA seems more sensitive to detect age-related changes than LEP, probably because of the additional balance component and plantar- and dorsiflexor activity. On the contrary, STS is less sensitive to age-related changes because of a ceiling effect in well-functioning adults."
https://openalex.org/W2908780372,"The emergence of bacterial pathogens that are resistant to clinical antibiotics poses an increasing risk to human health. An important reservoir from which bacterial pathogens can acquire resistance is the human gut microbiota. However, thus far, a substantial fraction of the gut microbiota remains uncultivated and has been little-studied with respect to its resistance reservoir-function. Here, we aimed to isolate yet uncultivated resistant gut bacteria by a targeted approach. Therefore, faecal samples from 20 intensive care patients who had received the prophylactic antibiotic treatment selective digestive decontamination (SDD), i.e. tobramycin, polymyxin E, amphotericin B and cefotaxime, were inoculated anaerobically on porous aluminium oxide chips placed on top of poor and rich agar media, including media supplemented with the SDD antibiotics. Biomass growing on the chips was analysed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, showing large inter-individual differences in bacterial cultivability, and enrichment of a range of taxonomically diverse operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Furthermore, growth of Ruminococcaceae (2 OTUs), Enterobacteriaceae (6 OTUs) and Lachnospiraceae (4 OTUs) was significantly inhibited by the SDD antibiotics. Strains belonging to 16 OTUs were candidates for cultivation to pure culture as they shared ≤95% sequence identity with the closest type strain and had a relative abundance of ≥2%. Six of these OTUs were detected on media containing SDD antibiotics, and as such were prime candidates to be studied regarding antibiotic resistance. One of these six OTUs was obtained in pure culture using targeted isolation. This novel strain was resistant to the antibiotics metrodinazole and imipenem. It was initially classified as member of the Ruminococcaceae, though later it was found to share 99% nucleotide identity with the recently published Sellimonas intestinalis BR72T. In conclusion, we show that high-throughput cultivation-based screening of microbial communities can guide targeted isolation of bacteria that serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2909949289,"Background Data from the UK Infant Feeding Surveys indicate that breastfeeding initiation increased between 1985 and 2010. During this period, societal changes in GB also influenced the sociodemographic characteristics of women in the childbearing population. As breastfeeding behaviour is highly socially patterned in GB, the increasing trend in breastfeeding initiation may have hidden inequalities in breastfeeding practices. This study examines the sociodemographic inequalities in breastfeeding initiation in GB between 1985 and 2010, exploring whether and how this may have been influenced by social and policy changes. Methods Data drawn from the nationally representative 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 Infant Feeding Surveys were used to estimate changes in the proportion of mothers in selected sociodemographic groups over time. Logistic regression models estimated the independent associations between breastfeeding initiation in each survey year and maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Associations were adjusted for maternal sociodemographic, pregnancy-related and support factors. Evidence of a change in the association between breastfeeding initiation and each sociodemographic characteristic over time was assessed using a test for statistical heterogeneity. Results The sociodemographic characteristics of mothers in GB changed substantially between 1985 and 2010. Mothers were increasingly more likely to be 30 or over; have higher education and socioeconomic status; and be single or cohabiting. An increasing proportion of mothers in GB identified as being of black or minority ethnic origin. Reported smoking in pregnancy declined. These same characteristics independently predicted higher odds of breastfeeding initiation; the associations between these characteristics and breastfeeding initiation did not vary significantly over time. Conclusions Marked inequalities in breastfeeding initiation persisted over the study period, hidden among the increasing initiation rate at the population level. The increasing overall rate of initiation was most likely driven by the rising prevalence of those groups of mothers who were, and remain, characteristically most likely to breastfeed."
https://openalex.org/W2908729136,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among people living with HIV is elevated due to persistent inflammation, hypertension and diabetes comorbidity, lifestyle factors and exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data from Africa on how CVD risk affects morbidity and mortality among ART patients are lacking. We explored the effect of CVD risk factors and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) on medium-term ART outcomes. Methods A prospective cohort study of standardized ART outcomes (Dead, Alive on ART, stopped ART, Defaulted and Transferred out) was conducted from July 2014—December 2016 among patients on ART at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in Zomba district, Malawi. The primary outcome was Dead. Active defaulter tracing was not done and patients who transferred out and defaulted were excluded from the analysis. At enrolment, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia were diagnosed, lifestyle data collected and the FRS was determined. Cox-regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for the outcome Dead. Results Of 933 patients enrolled, median age was 42 years (IQR: 35–50), 72% were female, 24% had hypertension, 4% had diabetes and 15.8% had elevated total cholesterol. The median follow up time was 2.4 years. Twenty (2.1%) patients died, 50 (5.4%) defaulted, 63 (6.8%) transferred out and 800 (85.7%) were alive on ART care (81.7% urban vs. 89.9% rural). In multivariable survival analysis, male gender (aHR = 3.28; 95%CI: 1.33–8.07, p = 0.01) and total/HDL cholesterol ratio (aHR = 5.77, 95%CI: 1.21–27.32; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with mortality. There was no significant association between mortality and hypertension, body mass index, central obesity, diabetes, FRS, physical inactivity, smoking at enrolment, ART regimen and WHO disease stage. Conclusions Medium-term all-cause mortality among ART patients was associated with male gender and elevated total/HDL cholesterol ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2911022902,"C-reactive proteins (CRPs) are among the faster acute-phase inflammation-responses proteins encoded by one gene (hcrp) in humans and seven genes (crp1-7) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) with importance in bacterial and viral infections. In this study, we described novel preferential bindings of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HOCh) to CRP1-7 compared with other lipids and explored the antiviral effects of both 25HOCh and CRP1-7 against spring viremia carp virus (SVCV) infection in zebrafish. Both in silico and in vitro results confirmed the antiviral effect of 25HOCh and CRP1-7 interactions, thereby showing that the crosstalk between them differed among the zebrafish isoforms. The presence of oxidized cholesterols in human atherosclerotic plaques amplifies the importance that similar interactions may occur for vascular and/or neurodegenerative diseases during viral infections. In this context, the zebrafish model offers a genetic tool to further investigate these interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2911085564,"There is mounting evidence that associates brain injury and offending behaviour, and there is a need to understand the epidemiology of head injury in prisoners in order to plan interventions to reduce associated disability and risk of reoffending. This is the first study to determine the lifetime prevalence of hospitalised head injury (HHI) in a national population of current prison inmates. In addition characteristics of prisoners with HHI and were compared to prisoners without HHI to discover whether those with HI differed demographically.Whole life hospital records of everyone aged 35 years or younger and resident in a prison in Scotland on a census date in 2015 were electronically linked via their unique NHS identifier and checked for ICD-9 and 10 codes for head injury. Using a case-control design, these data were compared with a sample from the general population matched 3:1 for age, gender and area-based social deprivation. Comparison of demographic variables was made between prisoners with and without HHI.HHI was found in 24.7% (1,080/4,374) of prisoners and was significantly more prevalent than found in the matched general population sample (18.2%; 2394/13122; OR 2.10; 95%CI 1.87, 2.16). The prevalence of HHI in prisoners and controls was similar with the exception of a higher risk of HHI in prisoners in lower deprivation quintiles. Having three or more HHI was more common in prisoners (OR 3.04; 95%CI 2.33, 3.97) as were HHI with ICD codes for intracranial injuries (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.54, 2.11), suggesting that more severe HHI is more prevalent in prisoners than the general population. The distributions within demographic variables and the characteristics of HHI admissions in prisoners with and without a history of HHI were similar.Prisoners in Scotland aged 35 years or younger have a higher lifetime prevalence of HHI than the general population and are more likely to have had repeated HI or intracranial injuries. Further work is required to elucidate the correspondence between self-report of HI and hospitalised records and to ascertain persisting effects of HI in prisoners and the need for services to reduce associated disability and risk of reoffending."
https://openalex.org/W2911199825,"Metal hypersensitivity has been recognized as an adverse biologic reaction that can compromise total joint arthroplasty (TJA) performance. However, the etiology of metal hypersensitivity responses in TJAs remains unclear. Metal implant debris is known to act as a danger signal that drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation. It remains unknown if implant debris induced inflammasome activation regulates T cell lineage in TJA metal hypersensitivity responses. In this study, we show both in vivo and in vitro that the pathogenesis of metal hypersensitivity responses to implant debris are largely dependent on activation of the inflammasome/caspase-1 pathway and subsequent production of IL-17A/F by CD4+ T cells. Inhibiting either the inflammasome pathway or IL-17A bioactivity in vivo and in vitro (in vivo using NLRP3 and Caspase-1 deficient mice or in vitro using blocking agents such as Capase-1 inhibitor, IL-1Ra and anti-IL-17A), significantly (p<0.05) mitigated metal-DTH paw inflammation as well as lymphocyte cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-17) and proliferation responses in metal-sensitized mice and primary human PBMCs. This study provides mechanistic insight into how in vivo exposure to orthopedic implant debris, and metals in general, elicits NLRP3 inflammasome activation that mediates the generation of IL-17A/F producing CD4+ T cells, leading to metal-delayed type hypersensitivity reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2908983330,"Collective action of resource users is essential for sustainability. Yet, often user groups are socioculturally heterogeneous, which requires cooperation to be established across salient group boundaries. We explore the effect of this type of heterogeneity on resource extraction in lab-in-the-field Common Pool Resource (CPR) experiments in Zanzibar, Tanzania. We create heterogeneous groups by mixing fishers from two neighbouring fishing villages which have distinct social identities, a history of conflict and diverging resource use practices and institutions. Additionally, we analyse between-village differences in extraction behaviour in the heterogeneous setting to assess if out-group cooperation in a CPR dilemma is associated with a community’s institutional scope in the economic realm (e.g., degree of market integration). We find no aggregate effect of heterogeneity on extraction. However, this is because fishers from the two villages behave differently in the heterogeneity treatment. We find support for the hypothesis that cooperation under sociocultural heterogeneity is higher for fishers from the village with larger institutional scope. In line with this explanation, cooperation under heterogeneity also correlates with a survey measure of individual fishers’ radius of trust. We discuss implications for resource governance and collective action research."
https://openalex.org/W2909158552,"Using a head-mounted perimeter imo that can measure monocular sensitivity with both eyes open, we investigated the difference between monocular sensitivities measured with and without occlusion of the fellow eye and if the difference was influenced by eccentricity.Using the perimeter imo, monocular sensitivities with/without occlusion and binocular sensitivity were measured and compared. Three test conditions for monocular sensitivity without occlusion were: with/without a fusional fixation target, and a binocular random single eye test in which the target was randomly presented to either eye and the examinee was not aware of the tested eye. Within the central 25° visual field (VF), 29 points located at the fovea and on the 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315° meridians with 3° intervals were tested. Differences among the four monocular sensitivities with/without occlusion were further evaluated at the fovea, within and beyond the central 5° VF.Sixteen visually normal volunteers (mean age, 28.6 ± 4.6 years) were included in this study. Except at the fovea, monocular sensitivities measured without occlusion were significantly higher than those with occlusion (P < 0.01). No significant difference was seen among the three monocular sensitivities without occlusion (P = 0.82).Except at the fovea, monocular sensitivities measured with and without occlusion significantly differed. This indicates that without occlusion, binocular interaction is activated and affects not only binocular sensitivity but also monocular sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2909373668,"Across the Mediterranean, conservation programmes often operate concomitantly with hunting interests within game-lands. Carnivore guilds lie at the interface between contrasting management goals, being simultaneously fundamental components of ecosystems and targets of predator control to reduce predation on game species. Here, we evaluate the composition and spatial structure of a mesocarnivore community in a protected area of Southeast Portugal, with high economic investment in conservation and significant hunting activity. Between June and August 2015, we deployed 77 camera-traps across a ~80 km2 area. We report on interspecific disparities in mesocarnivore occupancy and associated environmental determinants. Contrasting occupancy states suggest an unbalanced community, biased towards the widespread occurrence of the red fox Vulpes vulpes () compared to other species (stone marten Martes foina, European badger Meles meles, Egyptian mongoose Herpestes ichneumon, common genet Genetta genetta, and Eurasian otter Lutra lutra) exhibiting spatially-restricted occupancy patterns (). The feral cat Felis silvestris catus was the exception () and, together with the stone marten, exhibited a positive association with human settlements. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions on how mesocarnivore communities are shaped by the effects of non-selective predator control, paradoxically favouring species with higher population growth rates and dispersal abilities, such as the red fox. Our results reinforce the need to understand the role of predator control as a community structuring agent with potential unintended effects, while exposing issues hindering such attempts, namely non-selective illegal killing or biased/concealed information on legal control measures."
https://openalex.org/W2909692999,"Objectives To assess the occurrence of transient interruption of contrast (TIC) phenomenon in pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTPA) exams performed in inspiratory breath-hold after patients were told to inspire gently. Methods In this retrospective single-centre study, CTPA exams of 225 consecutive patients scanned on a 16-slice CT scanner system were analysed. A-priori to measurements, exams were screened for inadequate pulmonary artery contrast due to incorrect bolus tracking or failure of i.v. contrast administration. Those exams were excluded. Attenuation values in the thoracic aorta and in the pulmonary trunk were assessed in duplicate measurements (M1 and M2) and the aorto-pulmonary density ratio was calculated. An aorto-pulmonary ratio > 1 with still contrast inflow being visible within the superior vena cava was defined as TIC. Results 3 patients were excluded due to incorrect bolus tracking. Final analysis was performed in 222 patients (mean age 65 ± 19 years, range 18 to 99 years). Mean density in the pulmonary trunk was 275±17 HU, in the aorta 208 ± 15 HU. Mean aorto-pulmonary ratio was 0.81± 0.29. 48 patients (21.6%) had an aorto-pulmonary ratio >1. Correlation of mean aorto-pulmonary ratio and age was: -0.213 (p = 0.001). Age was not significantly different for an aorto-pulmonary ratio >1 vs. ≤1 (p = 0.122). Both in M1 and M2, 33/222 patients presented with absolute HU values of < 200 HU within the pulmonary artery. In M1 measurements, 24 of these 33 patients (72%) fulfilled TIC criteria (M2: 25/33 patients (75%)). Conclusions TIC is a common phenomenon in CTPA studies with inspiratory breath-hold commands after patients were told to inspire gently with an incidence of 22% in our retrospective cohort. Occurrence of TIC shows a significant negative correlation with increasing age and disproportionately often occurs in patients with lower absolute contrast density values within their pulmonary arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2910153147,"Many campaigns targeting pro-environmental behavior combine multiple approaches without properly understanding how these different approaches interact. Here we study the effect of such combinations. We apply construal level theory to classify different intervention approaches, which can either be at a high construal level (abstract and distant) or at a low construal level (concrete and proximal). In a field experiment we recruited 197 students living in one-person apartments in an all-inclusive student housing facility. We objectively measured their individual electricity and warm water use, and measured psychological variables through surveys. We expected that the (commonly considered superior) combination between a high and a low construal level approach would be least effective. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2(Construal Level: low vs. high) × 2(Social Distance: low vs. high) plus control condition mixed-model design targeting a reduction in warm water use. Our findings suggest that a congruent combination at a high construal level (i.e., the high construal level condition combined with the high social distance condition) has the largest effect on warm water use and that spillover to electricity use is most likely to occur when a high construal level is used (i.e., high social distance). Moreover, especially participants who valued nature and the environment less were most strongly influenced by the combination of two high construal level approaches. In sum, our study suggests that when designing interventions one should consider the construal level and when targeting pro-environmental behavior high construal levels appear most appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2963382481,"A terrestrial laser scanner is a fast, high-precision data acquisition device, which has been applied more and more to the research area of forest inventory. In this study, a type of automated low-cost terrestrial laser scanner was designed and implemented based on a SICK LMS-511 two-dimensional laser scanning sensor and a stepper motor. The new scanner was named BEE(developed by the department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Forestry University), which can scan the forest trees in three dimensions. The BEE scanner and its supporting software are specifically designed for forest inventory. The specific software was developed to smoothly control the BEE scanner and to acquire the data, including the angular data, range data, and intensity data, and the data acquired by the BEE scanner could be processed into point cloud data, a range map, and an intensity map. Based on the point cloud data, the trees were detected by a single slice of the single scan in a plot, and the local ground plane was fitted for each detected tree. Then the diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, and tree position could be estimated automatically by using the specific software. The experiments have been performed by using the BEE scanner in an artificial ginkgo forest which was located in the Haidian District of Beijing. Four 10 m × 10 m square plots were selected for the experiments. The BEE scanner scanned in the four plots and acquired the single-scan data, respectively. The DBH, tree height, and tree position of the trees in the four plots were estimated and analyzed. For comparison, manually-measured data was also collected in the four plots. The trunk detection rate for all four plots was 92.75%; the root mean square error of the DBH estimation was 1.27 cm; the root mean square error of the tree height estimation was 0.24 m; and the tree position estimation was in line with the actual position. The scanner also was tested in more natural forest in the JiuFeng Forest Park. Two plots with a radius of 5 meters were scanned. Eleven trees in the plot with a flat ground were detected and DBH were estimated. But tree detection was failed in the other plot because of the undulating ground. Experimental results show that the BEE scanner can efficiently estimate the structure parameters of plantation trees and has good potential in practical applications of forest inventory."

Adhesion molecules, including soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), are associated with incident CVD. We hypothesized that specific genetic variants will be associated with plasma levels of adhesion molecules in suspected OSA patients. We also hypothesized that there may be an interaction between these variants and OSA. Methods We measured levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 in 491 patients with suspected OSA and genotyped them for 20 polymorphisms. Results The most significant association was between the ABO rs579459 polymorphism and sE-selectin levels (P = 7×10−21), with the major allele T associated with higher levels. The direction of effect and proportion of the variance in sE-selectin levels accounted for by rs579459 (16%) was consistent with estimates from non-OSA cohorts. In a multivariate regression analysis, addition of rs579459 improved the model performance in predicting sE-selectin levels. Three polymorphisms were nominally associated with sICAM-1 levels but none with sVCAM-1 levels. The combination of severe OSA and two rs579459 T alleles identified a group of patients with high sE-selectin levels; however, the increase in sE-selectin levels associated with severe OSA was greater in patients without two T alleles (P = 0.05 test for interaction). Conclusions These genetic polymorphisms may help to identify patients at greatest risk of incident CVD and may help in developing a more precision-based approach to OSA care."
https://openalex.org/W2911203605,"Spaceflight affects the immune system, but the effects on the antibody repertoire, responsible for humoral immunity, has not been well explored. In particular, the complex gene assembly and expression process; including mutations, might make this process vulnerable. Complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), composed of parts of the V-(D-)J-gene segments, is very important for antigen binding and can be used as an important measure of variability. Skeletal unloading, and the physiological effects of it, parallel many impacts of space flight. Therefore, we explored the impact of skeletal unloading using the antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) model. Animals were experimentally challenged with tetanus toxoid (TT) and/or the adjuvant CpG. Blood was analyzed for anti-TT antibody and corticosterone concentrations. Whole spleen tissue was prepared for repertoire characterization. AOS animals showed higher levels of corticosterone levels, but AOS alone did not affect anti-TT serum antibody levels. Administration of CpG significantly increased the circulating anti-TT antibody concentrations. AOS did alter constant gene usage resulting in higher levels of IgM and lower levels of IgG. CpG also altered constant gene region usage increasing usage of IgA. Significant changes could be detected in multiple V-, D-, and J-gene segments in both the heavy and light chains in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatments. Analysis of class-switched only transcripts revealed a different pattern of V-gene segment usage than detected in the whole repertoire and also showed significant alterations in gene segment usage after challenge. Alterations in V/J pairing were also detected in response to challenge. CDR3 amino acid sequence overlaps were similar among treatment groups, though the addition of CpG lowered overlap in the heavy chain. We isolated 3,045 whole repertoire and 98 potentially TT-specific CDR3 sequences for the heavy chain and 569 for the light chain. Our results demonstrate that AOS alters the repertoire response to challenge with TT and/or CpG."
https://openalex.org/W2908928672,"Annual movements have been widely described for birds migrating across the Americas and between Eurasia and Africa, yet relatively little information exists for intra-African migrants. Identifying the areas used throughout a species annual cycle by understanding migratory patterns and settlement areas during breeding and non-breeding seasons is essential for conservation initiatives. Here, we describe for the first time, the migratory patterns and settlement areas of an endangered raptor endemic to Southern Africa, the Black Harrier (Circus maurus). From 2008 to 2015, thirteen breeding adult Black Harriers were trapped in south-western South Africa and fitted either with a GPS-GSM or with a PTT tracker device. Adults were monitored for 365 ± 198 days (range: 56–819 days) revealing great individual variability in annual movements. Most Black Harriers performed an unusual West-East migration from their breeding areas, but routes of all migrating individuals covered the entire southern land area of South Africa and Lesotho. The distance travelled averaged 814 ± 324 km, but unlike many other species, migrants travelled faster during post-breeding (i.e. austral summer) (207.8 ± 113.2 km.day-1) than during pre-breeding (i.e. austral winter/spring) migrations (143.8 ± 32.2 km.day-1). Although most marked individuals displayed movements similar to those that bred following pre-breeding migrations, only two of thirteen were confirmed as breeders the year after being tagged. This suggests that individuals may sometimes take a sabbatical year in reproduction, although this requires confirmation. Most tagged birds died on migration or during the non-breeding season. Adults frequently returned to the same non-breeding settlement areas, and often used up to 3 different locations an average of about 200 km apart. On the other hand, there was wide variation in distance between subsequent reproductive events. We discuss the implications of our study for the conservation of Black Harriers and more broadly for intra-African bird migrants."
https://openalex.org/W2910259437,"Objective To characterise perceived household support for female education and the associations between educational support and HIV prevalence, HSV-2 prevalence and sexual risk behaviours. Methods This cross-sectional study used baseline survey data from the Swa Koteka HPTN 068 trial undertaken in Mpumalanga, South Africa. The study included 2533 young women aged 13–20, in grades 8–11 at baseline. HIV and HSV-2 status were determined at baseline. Information about patterns of sexual behaviour and household support for education was collected during the baseline survey. Linear regression and binary logistic regression were used to determine associations between household support for education and both biological and behavioural outcomes. Results High levels of educational support were reported across all measures. HIV prevalence was 3.2% and HSV-2 prevalence was 4.7%, both increasing significantly with age. Over a quarter (26.6%) of young women reported vaginal sex, with 60% reporting condom use at last sex. The median age of sexual debut was 16 years. Household educational support was not significantly associated with HIV or HSV-2; however, the odds of having had vaginal sex were significantly lower in those who reported greater homework supervision (OR 0.82, 95%CI: 0.72–0.94), those who engaged in regular discussion of school marks with a caregiver (OR 0.82, 95%CI: 0.71–0.95) and when caregivers had greater educational goals for the young woman (OR 0.82, 95%CI: 0.71–0.96). In contrast, greater caregiver disappointment at dropout was significantly associated with reported vaginal sex (OR 1.29, 95%CI: 1.14–1.46). Conclusion Young women in rural South Africa report experiencing high levels of household educational support. This study suggests that greater household educational support is associated with lower odds of having vaginal sex and engaging in risky sexual behaviour, though not with HIV or HSV-2 prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W2910630080,"Reconsolidation theory posits that upon retrieval, consolidated memories are destabilized and need to be restabilized in order to persist. It has been suggested that experience with a competitive task immediately after memory retrieval may interrupt these restabilization processes leading to memory loss. Indeed, using a motor sequence learning paradigm, we have recently shown that, in humans, interference training immediately after active task-based retrieval of the consolidated motor sequence knowledge may negatively affect its performance levels. Assessing changes in tapping pattern before and after interference training, we also demonstrated that this performance deficit more likely indicates a genuine memory loss rather than an initial failure of memory retrieval. Here, applying a similar approach, we tested the necessity of the hypothetical retrieval-induced destabilization of motor memory to allow its impairment. The impact of memory retrieval on performance of a new motor sequence knowledge acquired during the interference training was also evaluated. Similar to the immediate post-retrieval interference, interference training alone without the preceding active task-based memory retrieval was also associated with impairment of the pre-established motor sequence memory. Performance levels of the sequence trained during the interference training, on the other hand, were impaired only if this training was given immediately after memory retrieval. Noteworthy, an 8-hour interval between memory retrieval and interference allowed to express intact performance levels for both sequences. The current results suggest that susceptibility of the consolidated motor memory to behavioral interference is independent of its active task-based retrieval. Differential effects of memory retrieval on performance levels of the new motor sequence encoded during the interference training further suggests that memory retrieval may influence the way new information is stored by facilitating its integration within the retrieved memory trace. Thus, impairment of the pre-established motor memory may reflect interference from a competing memory trace rather than involve interruption of reconsolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2908554976,"Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can impact tumor growth and progression. The inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R) suppresses the activation of myeloid cells and lack of this pathway results in a reduction of tumor growth, conversely a tumorigenic effect of CD200R triggering was also described. Here we investigated the role of CD200R activation in syngeneic mouse tumor models. We showed that agonistic CD200R antibody reached tumors, but had no significant impact on tumor growth and minor effect on infiltration of immune myeloid cells. These effects were reproduced using two different anti-CD200R clones. In contrast, we showed that CD200-deficiency did decrease melanoma tumor burden. The presence of either endogenous or tumor-expressed CD200 restored the growth of metastatic melanoma foci. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that blockade of the endogenous ligand CD200 prevented the tumorigenic effect of CD200R-expressing myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, whereas agonistic anti-CD200R has no effect on tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2910217950,"FnCel5A from Fervidobacterium nodosum is one of the most thermostable endoglucanases that have phenomenal characteristics, such as high activity, pH stability, and multi-specificity towards various substrates. However, large-scale thermophilic enzyme production is still a challenge. Herein, we focus on an optimization approach based on response surface methodology to improve the production of this enzyme. First, a Box-Behnken design was used to examine physiochemical parameters such as induction temperatures, isopropylβ-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside concentrations and induction times on the heterogeneous expression of FnCel5A gene in E. coli. The best culture was collected after adding 0.56 mM IPTG and incubating it for 29.5 h at 24°C. The highest enzymatic activity observed was 3.31 IU/mL. Second, an economical ""thermolysis"" cell lysis method for the liberation of the enzymes was also optimized using Box-Behnken design. The optimal levels of the variables were temperature 77°C, pH 7.71, and incubation time of 20 min, which gave about 74.3% higher activity than the well-established bead-milling cell disruption method. The maximum productivity of FnCel5A achieved (5772 IU/L) illustrated that its production increased significantly after combining both optimal models. This strategy can be scaled-up readily for overproduction of FnCel5A from recombinant E.coli to facilitate its usage in biomass energy production."

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a widely available, vitamin fortified beverage (5h Energy Decaffeinated) on insulin sensitivity, metabolic hormones and serum metabolomic responses in adolescents. Twenty adolescents (13-19y, 10M/10F) completed two randomized trials, consuming either coloured water as placebo (PL) or a vitamin fortified, sugar free beverage (FB, 1.5ml/kg) 40min prior to a modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, 1.75g/kg glucose). Samples were collected at baseline and at 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120min during the OGTT. No differences in blood glucose response were observed between the treatments. However, compared to PL, postprandial plasma C-peptide and insulin excursion was significantly greater with FB, resulting in a 28% decline in the insulin sensitivity index. This was accompanied by elevated GLP-1, glucagon and PYY responses with FB compared to PL. Serum metabolomics (1H-NMR) analysis also revealed perturbations to vitamin B-linked one carbon metabolism flux with FB consumption that became more pronounced over time. These included a transient reduction in homocysteine flux accompanied by increases in betaine, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, folate and taurine. Although these impacts are likely short-lived, results show that beverages fortified with excessive amounts of vitamins are not metabolically inert, but likely result in greater insulin secretion, differential gut hormone secretion and elevated one-carbon flux to process the excessive vitamin loads."
https://openalex.org/W2908554748,"During erythropoiesis, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate in successive steps of commitment and specification to mature erythrocytes. This differentiation process is controlled by transcription factors that establish stage- and cell type-specific gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that FUSE binding protein 1 (FUBP1), a transcriptional regulator important for HSC self-renewal and survival, is regulated by T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia 1 (TAL1) in erythroid progenitor cells. TAL1 directly activates the FUBP1 promoter, leading to increased FUBP1 expression during erythroid differentiation. The binding of TAL1 to the FUBP1 promoter is highly dependent on an intact GATA sequence in a combined E-box/GATA motif. We found that FUBP1 expression is required for efficient erythropoiesis, as FUBP1-deficient progenitor cells were limited in their potential of erythroid differentiation. Thus, the finding of an interconnection between GATA1/TAL1 and FUBP1 reveals a molecular mechanism that is part of the switch from progenitor- to erythrocyte-specific gene expression. In summary, we identified a TAL1/FUBP1 transcriptional relationship, whose physiological function in haematopoiesis is connected to proper erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2908712667,"Even very young children are adept at linking property to owners (Gelman, Manczak, & Noles, 2012). However, some studies report that children systematically conserve property with the first possessors (Blake & Harris, 2009; Friedman & Neary, 2008). The present study seeks to integrate these two findings by testing for the presence of a first possessor bias in older children (ages 7–10) using a broader array of property transfers, and by investigating how manipulations of context–from third-person to first-person–yield ownership attributions that are more or less biased. Seven- and 8-year-olds, but not older children, exhibited a first possessor bias when property transfers were presented in a third-person context. This finding suggests that the first possessor bias persists longer in childhood than previously suspected. However, the bias was greatly attenuated or absent when property transfers were presented in a first-person context, rather than a third-person context."
https://openalex.org/W2909445333,"The massive genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including proteomics data from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), provides a unique opportunity to study cancer systematically. While most observations are made from a single type of genomics data, we apply big data analytics and systems biology approaches by simultaneously analyzing DNA amplification, mRNA and protein abundance. Using multiple genomic profiles, we have discovered widespread dosage compensation for the extensive aneuploidy observed in TCGA breast cancer samples. We do identify 11 genes that show strong correlation across all features (DNA/mRNA/protein) analogous to that of the well-known oncogene HER2 (ERBB2). These genes are generally less well-characterized regarding their role in cancer and we advocate their further study. We also discover that shRNA knockdown of these genes has an impact on cancer cell growth, suggesting a vulnerability that could be used for cancer therapy. Our study shows the advantages of systematic big data methodologies and also provides future research directions."
https://openalex.org/W2910591315,"A long shelf life of onions (Allium cepa L.) is of high importance in the onion industry. Onions are dried and stored in large wooden boxes that are difficult to access. Monitoring temperature and relative humidity during these processes is challenging. Moreover, quality may change in storage without being noticed. Therefore, there is a need to find alternative methods for monitoring and controlling the drying and storage processes of onions and to identify early changes in quality during storage. The potential use of online measurements of temperature and relative humidity (RH) in the vicinity of onions was evaluated during drying and long-term storage of six onion batches (four cultivars and three selections of one of the cultivars) in commercial storage. The batches varied in bulb weight, dry matter content, firmness and disease incidence. The dry matter content and firmness decreased during storage, while the respiration rate and incidences of individual and total disease increased. Two of the batches had low storability with high disease incidences and high average temperatures and variations in the RH. The results showed that tracking the temperature and RH in the vicinity of the onions is a promising tool for improving the drying and storage processes in commercial storage and for identifying onion batches with reduced storability early in storage."
https://openalex.org/W2909626813,"Sildenafil is a pulmonary vasodilator that has potential to mitigate the decrement in endurance performance caused by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of sildenafil on pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, pulse oxygen saturation, and exercise performance at moderate simulated altitude. We hypothesized that sildenafil would reduce the decline in exercise performance in hypoxia by blunting the rise in pulmonary artery pressure and causing a relative increase in cardiac output and oxygen saturation. Twelve endurance trained men performed three experimental cycling trials at sea level and simulated moderate altitude of 3,000m (FIO2 = 0.147) after ingesting either a placebo or sildenafil 50 mg capsule in a double blinded fashion. Each test consisted of a warmup period, a 15-minute steady state period at 60% of peak power output, and a 16.1 km time-trial. All subjects experienced a decline in maximal exercise capacity in hypoxia that ranged from 6% to 24%. This decline was correlated with the reduction in pulse oxygen saturation in hypoxic maximal exercise. Sildenafil had no effect on pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, or pulse oxygen saturation measured during steady state exercise. There was no effect of sildenafil on mean power output during the time-trial. During high intensity cycle exercise in acute, moderate hypoxia pulmonary artery pressure is unaffected by sildenafil and does not appear to influence cardiovascular function or exercise performance."
https://openalex.org/W2909839337,"Soy protein and fish oil are food components that decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Previous studies demonstrated that these food components reduced serum cholesterol levels and suppressed hepatic lipogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of these food components remain unclear. Ten classes of serum lipoprotein profiles showed that dietary tofu, a soybean curd, suppressed cholesterol absorption, while fish oil reduced most of the lipoprotein classes in rats. Tofu and fish oil both halved the level of the lipoprotein class LAC1 (LDL-anti-protease complex), a 15-nm LDL-anti-protease complex, which is speculated to be a cause of atherosclerosis. Moreover, a global transcriptome analysis revealed that tofu inhibited the mRNA expression of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis, while fish oil stimulated that of genes related to fatty acid degradation. Therefore, tofu and fish oil independently regulate lipid metabolism. The decrease observed in LAC1 may have been due to reduced cholesterol absorption in the tofu diet group and the interference of lipogenesis via the activation of polyunsaturated fatty acid detoxification in the fish oil group."
https://openalex.org/W2910083313,"Development of biocompatible and functional scaffolds for tissue engineering is a major challenge, especially for development of polarised epithelia that are critical structures in tissue homeostasis. Different in vitro models of the lung epithelial barrier have been characterized using non-degradable polyethylene terephthalate membranes which limits their uses for tissue engineering. Although poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) membranes are biodegradable, those prepared via conventional Diffusion Induced Phase Separation (DIPS) lack open-porous geometry and show limited permeability compromising their use for epithelial barrier studies. Here we used PLLA membranes prepared via a modification of the standard DIPS protocol to control the membrane surface morphology and permeability. These were bonded to cell culture inserts for use in barrier function studies. Pulmonary epithelial cells (H441) readily attached to the PLLA membranes and formed a confluent cell layer within two days. This was accompanied by a significant increase in trans-epithelial electrical resistance and correlated with the formation of tight junctions and vectorial cytokine secretion in response to TNFα. Our data suggest that a structurally polarized and functional epithelial barrier can be established on PLLA membranes produced via a non-standard DIPS protocol. Therefore, PLLA membranes have potential utility in lung tissue engineering applications requiring bio-absorbable membranes."

When patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergo orthopedic surgery, AMI incidence can be expected to be relatively high. However, data on a population-wide scale is lacking.To investigate AMI incidence in patients with CKD (with and without dialysis) undergoing orthopedic surgery.A population-based study covering the period from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2011.Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database.Participants were 219,195 patients with CKD who underwent surgery between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2011.AMI occurred in 2,708 participants (1.24%). The AMI incidence rate in the dialyzed group was 1.52%, which was higher than that in the nondialyzed group after propensity score matching. Dialysis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62-1.98), male (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.28-1.57), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.44-1.80), hyperlipidemia (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.68-2.11), old myocardial infarction (OR: 18.87; 95% CI: 16.26-1.21.90), and cerebral vascular disease (CVA) (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.30-1.47) were all associated with AMI in the patients with CKD.The AMI risk was higher in the patients with CKD undergoing orthopedic surgery than in the general population, and the dialyzed group had a higher risk of AMI than did the nondialyzed group."
https://openalex.org/W2909272806,"The identification of elite individuals is a critical component of most breeding programs. However, the achievement of this goal is limited by the high cost of phenotyping and experimental research. A significant benefit of genomic selection (GS) to plant breeding is the identification of elite individuals without the need for phenotyping. This study aimed to propose different calibration strategies using combinations between generations from different genetic backgrounds to improve the reliability of GS and to investigate the effects of LD in different types of mating systems: outcrossing (An) self-pollination (Sn) and hybridization (Hn). For this purpose, we simulated a genome with 10 linkage groups. In each group, two QTL were simulated. Subsequently, an F2 population was created, followed by four generations of inbreeding (S1 to S4, H1 to H 4, A1, to A4,). Quantitative traits were simulated in three scenarios considering three degrees of dominance (d/a = 0, 0.5 and 1) and two broad sense heritabilities (h2 = 0.30 and 0.70), totaling six genetic architectures. To evaluate prediction reliability, a model (RR-BLUP) was trained in one generation and used to predict the following generations of mating systems. For example, the marker effects estimated in the F2 population were used to estimate the expected genomic breeding value (GEBV) in populations S1 through A4. The squared correlation between the GEBV and the true genetic value were used to measure the reliability of the predictions. Independently of the population used to estimate the marker effect, reliability showed the lowest values in the scenario where d = 1. For any scenario, the use of the multigenerational prediction methodology improved the reliability of GS."
https://openalex.org/W2910917882,"In high-income countries, individual- and community-level factors are associated with increased contact with the criminal justice system. However, little is known about how these factors contribute to the risk of arrest in South Africa, which has one of the highest rates of arrests globally. We examine both individual- and community-level factors associated with arrests among young men living in the townships of Cape Town.Data were collected from a stratified community sample of 906 young men aged 18-29 years old living in 18 township neighborhoods. Communities with high and low rates of arrest were identified. Logistic regression models were used to assess which individual-level (such as substance use and mental health status) and community-level (such as infrastructure and presence of bars and gangs) factors predict arrests.Significant predictors of arrests were substance use, gang activity, being older, more stressed, and less educated. Living in communities with better infrastructure and in more recently established communities populated by recent immigrants was associated with having a history of arrests.When considering both individual- and community-level factors, substance use and gang violence are the strongest predictors of arrests among young men in South Africa. Unexpectedly, communities with better infrastructure have higher arrest rates. Community programs are needed to combat substance use and gang activity as a pathway out of risk among South African young men.ClinicalTrials.gov registration #NCT02358226, registered Nov 24, 2014."
