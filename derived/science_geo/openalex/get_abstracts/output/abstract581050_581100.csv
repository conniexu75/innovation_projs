https://openalex.org/W2589923912,"The multidrug resistance protein MRP1 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that confers resistance to many anticancer drugs and plays a role in the disposition and efficacy of several opiates, antidepressants, statins, and antibiotics. In addition, MRP1 regulates redox homeostasis, inflammation, and hormone secretion. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we determined the molecular structures of bovine MRP1 in two conformations: an apo form at 3.5 Å without any added substrate and a complex form at 3.3 Å with one of its physiological substrates, leukotriene C4. These structures show that by forming a single bipartite binding site, MRP1 can recognize a spectrum of substrates with different chemical structures. We also observed large conformational changes induced by leukotriene C4, explaining how substrate binding primes the transporter for ATP hydrolysis. Structural comparison of MRP1 and P-glycoprotein advances our understanding of the common and unique properties of these two important molecules in multidrug resistance to chemotherapy."

However, in vitro culture of neurons deprives them of their natural environment. Here we transplanted human PSC-derived cortical neuronal precursors into the brain of a murine AD model. Human neurons differentiate and integrate into the brain, express 3R/4R Tau splice forms, show abnormal phosphorylation and conformational Tau changes, and undergo neurodegeneration. Remarkably, cell death was dissociated from tangle formation in this natural 3D model of AD. Using genome-wide expression analysis, we observed upregulation of genes involved in myelination and downregulation of genes related to memory and cognition, synaptic transmission, and neuron projection.

Alois Alzheimer described in 1906 the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD): amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary pathology and tangles, astrogliosis, and neuronal loss (Alzheimer, 1906Alzheimer A. Über einen eigenartigen schweren Erkrankungsprozeβ der Hirnrinde.Neurol. Central. 1906; 25: 1134Google Scholar). Cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, microgliosis, inflammation, and major synaptic alteration are other pathological features of AD (Katzman, 1986Katzman R. Alzheimer’s disease.N. Engl. J.

The amyloid hypothesis links abnormally folded Aβ peptides in a linear and causal cascade to the other disease hallmarks, including neuronal tangle formation and neuronal cell death (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002Hardy J.

This hypothesis has provided the theoretical basis for the generation of numerous animal models, diagnostics, and therapeutics for AD. However, evolving insights have made increasingly clear that a more complex theory and more elaborate in vivo models are needed to understand the long prodromal phase of the disease (De Strooper and Karran, 2016De Strooper B.

However, crucial aspects of the disease process, like neuronal tangle formation and severe neuronal loss, have never been convincingly demonstrated in rodents (Kokjohn and Roher, 2009Kokjohn T.A.

Recently, a three-dimensional, human neural stem-cell-derived culture (Choi et al., 2014Choi S.H. Kim Y.H. Hebisch M. Sliwinski C. Lee S. D’Avanzo C. Chen H. Hooli B. Asselin C.

The cells overexpress exogenous APP and PSEN FAD genes. No cell loss was detected, and neuroinflammatory and vascular components of the disease are lacking in this in vitro model. It remains, indeed, crucial to complement in vitro approaches with in vivo experiments to study human neurons in the context of the diseased brain. Neural precursors derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) (reviewed in Suzuki and Vanderhaeghen, 2015Suzuki I.K. Vanderhaeghen P. Is this a brain which I see before me?

We use here this approach to investigate whether Aβ species generated in an AD mouse model (Radde et al., 2006Radde R. Bolmont T. Kaeser S.A. Coomaraswamy J. Lindau D. Stoltze L. Calhoun M.E. Jäggi F. Wolburg H.

This chimeric model presents numerous Aβ plaques and Aβ-associated neuroinflammation in the human transplant and, importantly, the transplanted neurons show remarkable signs of neurodegeneration that are not detected in the mouse host brain or in transplanted PSC-derived mouse neurons. Thus, human neurons respond to Aβ pathology differently than their murine counterparts in vivo. We differentiated GFP-expressing human PSCs into cortical precursor cells in vitro to implant them as xenografts into the brains of newborn mice (Figure 1A; Figures S1E and S1F) (Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013Espuny-Camacho I. Michelsen K.A. Gall D. Linaro D. Hasche A. Bonnefont J. Bali C. Orduz D. Bilheu A.

We used transgenic Tg (Thy1-APPSw,Thy1-PSEN1∗L166P) 21Jckr, further called APP/PS1-21, mice (Radde et al., 2006Radde R. Bolmont T. Kaeser S.A. Coomaraswamy J. Lindau D. Stoltze L. Calhoun M.E.

Schweitzer P.A. Christianson S.W. Gott B. Schweitzer I.B. Tennent B. McKenna S. Mobraaten L. Rajan T.V. Greiner D.L. et al.Multiple defects in innate and adaptive immunologic function in NOD/LtSz-scid mice.J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 180-191PubMed Google Scholar), to generate AD mice or wild-type (WT) littermates suitable for grafting experiments (Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013Espuny-Camacho I. Michelsen K.A. Gall D. Linaro D. Hasche A. Bonnefont J. Bali C. Orduz D. Bilheu A. Herpoel A. et al.Pyramidal neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells integrate efficiently into mouse brain circuits in vivo.Neuron. 2013; 77: 440-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We additionally used GFP-expressing mouse neurons derived from murine PSCs as controls (Figures S2H and S2I) (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N. Bouschet T. Hourez R. Dimidschstein J. Naeije G. van den Ameele J. Espuny-Camacho I. Herpoel A. Passante L. Schiffmann S.N. et al.An intrinsic mechanism of corticogenesis from embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The cells present a normal karyotype (Figure S1D) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array (data not shown) and undergo neuronal and telencephalic/cortical specification in vitro as attested by beta III tubulin, Tau, Tbr1, and Ctip2 staining (Figures S1A–S1C). The transplanted human neurons express GFP and human-specific markers, like HuNuclei (Figures S1G and S1H), and present cortical (Tbr1+, CTIP2+, Satb2+, and Brn2+), telencephalic (Foxg1+), and mature neuronal (NeuN+ and MAP2+) identities (Figures 1B–1G; Figures S1I and S1J). Electron microscopy (EM), combined with GFP-immunogold labeling, shows numerous synapses between the human graft and the mouse host (Figures 1H and 1I). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis confirms broad expression of telencephalic, cortical, and glutamatergic, and some expression of GABAergic, astrocytic, and oligodendroglia genes (Figure S1K). Cholinergic, dopaminergic, or neural crest-derived cell identities are less abundant or absent (Figure S1K). Aβ plaques are present in the AD mouse host brain (GFP negative), as assessed by Thioflavin, 6E10, and Congo red staining (arrows; Figures 1L–1N; Figures S2A–S2E). Congo red+ plaques show birefringence when using plane-polarized light (Figure S2E). Importantly, Aβ plaques are detected within GFP+ human neuronal clusters (arrowheads; Figures 1L–1M′; Figures S2A–S2B′, S2D, and S2E) and near single human neuronal cells integrated into the mouse host tissue (arrows; Figure 1N; Figure S2C). Aβ plaques within human clusters are more diffuse than mouse host dense-cored plaques and are significantly smaller (Figure 1O; 120 ± 6 μm2 in mouse host; 88 ± 8 μm2 in human grafts). No significant differences in number of Aβ plaques per unit surface are detected (Figure 1P; 40 ± 3 plaques/mm2 in mouse host; 71 ± 16 plaques/mm2 in human grafts). Aβ reactivity is, as expected, not observed in WT mice (Figures 1J and 1K). Aβ plaque ultrastructure is very similar in the human transplants and in the mouse host: one or more cores of extracellular Aβ filaments (asterisks) surrounded by dystrophic neurites (DNs) (arrowheads) (Figures 1Q–1T). Immunogold labeling against human cell-specific markers, i.e., the GFP transgene or endogenous STEM121 marker, confirms that Aβ deposits (asterisk) and dystrophic neurites are within grafted human clusters (arrowheads point to immunogold particles; Figures S2F and S2G). PSC-derived mouse neurons transplanted under similar conditions also present Aβ plaques and DNs inside murine clusters (Figures S2H–S2K). Thus, the transplanted neuronal clusters integrate into the mouse host tissue and are exposed to Aβ deposits produced by the AD mice. We detect GFAP+ astrocytes (Figures 2A, 2B, 2E, and 2F ) and Iba1+ microglia cells (Figures 2C, 2D, 2G, and 2H) clustered around Thioflavin+ Aβ deposits in mouse host tissue (GFP−; arrows) and human grafts in AD mice (GFP+; arrowheads). Significant increases in the number of GFAP+ astrocytes and Iba1+ microglial cells are seen in AD versus WT mice (Figures 2M and 2N), but neuroinflammation in mouse host and human transplants does not differ significantly. Microglia cells performing phagocytosis are detected (red arrowhead; Figure 2K). Astrocytes and microglial cells within human clusters are mostly of host origin as attested by the lack of GFP immunoreactivity (arrowheads; Figures 2I–2L). Ultrastructural analysis of astrocytes and microglia cells in human clusters in AD mice show an activated hypertrophic morphology with 76% and 74% of cells showing enlarged and/or phagocytic phenotypes, respectively (Figures 2P and 2R–2V). These phenotypes are rarely found in human grafts in WT mice (Figures 2O, 2Q, 2T, and 2V), indicating that the elicited immune response is induced by the Aβ-associated pathology and not a consequence of unexpected host-graft reactivity. Thus, both grafted human neuronal clusters and mouse host tissue are similarly exposed to Aβ-associated neuroinflammatory responses characterized by astrocytic and microglial cell reactivity and recruitment to the Aβ plaque sites. We examined the grafted human neuronal clusters exposed to Aβ for signs of cellular or neuritic abnormalities. DN structures are found associated with Aβ plaques in both mouse host and human grafts in AD mice 4 months post-transplantation (MPT) (Figures 3A, 3B, 3D, and 3E ), but not in WT mice (Figures 3C and 3F). DNs present a globular structure (Figures 3B and 3E) and a heterogeneous content of vesicles (red boxes), dense bodies (red arrowheads), mitochondria (blue boxes), and neurofilaments (green boxes) (Figures 3G–3N). Myelin alterations are also detected (arrowheads; Figures S4K and S4L). Ubiquitin staining confirms the presence of DNs around Thioflavin+ Aβ plaques in mouse host tissue and human clusters 4 MPT (Figures 3O–3R) with 85% of Aβ plaques surrounded by DNs in human grafts versus 58% in mouse host (Figure 3S). DNs are also detected in human clusters in AD mice by GFP or human-specific STEM121 staining (arrowheads; Figures 3O, 4C, and 4 J; Figures S2L and S2M) but are absent in human grafts in WT mice (Figures 4A and 4H). We observe abnormal accumulations of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin (SYP) and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) around Aβ plaques in human clusters in AD mice (Figures 4C, 4D, 4J, and 4K), similar to the accumulations found in human AD brains (Brion et al., 1991Brion J.P. Couck A.M. Bruce M. Anderton B. Flament-Durand J. Synaptophysin and chromogranin A immunoreactivities in senile plaques of Alzheimer’s disease.Brain Res. 1991; 539: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Figures S3A–S3D). These accumulations are absent in human clusters in WT mice (Figures 4A, 4B, 4H, and 4I) and are less important in mouse host or in mouse neurons grafted in AD mice (Figures 4E, 4F, 4L, and 4M; Figures S3E–S3H), with 74% and 70% of Aβ plaques in human grafts surrounded by SYP and VGlut1+ structures, respectively, versus 23% and 39% in mouse host (Figures 4G and 4N). The dendritic marker MAP2 reveals an area devoid of staining around Aβ plaques in human clusters in AD mice (Figures 4O and 4P) that is minor in mouse host (Figures 4Q and 4R). The absence of MAP2 is mirrored by the accumulation of SYP+ or Tau+ structures around Aβ plaques (Figures S3I–S3P). The postsynaptic marker Homer1 confirms the reduction of dendritic staining around Aβ plaques in human neuronal clusters (Figures S3Q–S3T). Thus, DNs surrounding Aβ plaques display abnormal accumulations of presynaptic and axonal proteins, while human dendritic and postsynaptic proteins become reduced. These neuritic changes are much more subtle in mouse host tissue or mouse neuronal clusters grafted in the AD mice. Robust neuronal loss is a crucial AD hallmark lacking from existing animal models (Kokjohn and Roher, 2009Kokjohn T.A. Roher A.E.

Genet. 2010; 19: R12-R20Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the density of human neurons at 6 MPT, evaluated using GFP together with the pan nuclear marker TOPRO3 (Figures 5A–5F) or HuNuclei (Figures S4A–S4F), is much lower in transplants in AD mice (Figures 5D–5F) than in WT mice (Figures 5A–5C), although similar amounts of cells were injected. In contrast, nuclei density is similar in mouse host tissue in AD (Figures 5J–5L) versus WT mice (Figures 5G–5I). Quantification shows that the density of mouse host tissue neurons is not significantly changed (98% in AD versus 100% in WT) while the density of human neurons in AD mice is reduced to 54% compared to WT animals (Figure 5M). The density of human neurons at 2 MPT—before Aβ plaques are detected—is not different between AD and WT animals (Figure 5M). Thus, the human cells integrate normally and similarly in WT and AD mouse brain following transplantation and cell loss occurs specifically in AD animals at later stages when Aβ pathology is present in vivo. Semithin sections of human transplants stained with toluidine blue also show dense Aβ plaques, disorganized neuropil texture, and reduced neuronal density in AD mice (Figures 5N and 5O), while no such morphological alterations are seen in mouse host tissue and PSC-derived mouse grafts in AD mice. On the contrary, many healthy-appearing neurons are detected near Aβ plaques (Figures 5P and 5Q; Figures S4I and S4J). Ultrastructural analysis and quantification of neuron density confirm a significant decrease in the number of neurons in human grafts in AD at 6 MPT (Figure 5W; 1,463 ± 64 neurons/mm2 in grafts in WT versus 344 ± 31 neurons/mm2 in grafts in AD) and the absence of significant differences in mouse host tissue at this age (Figure 5W; 925 ± 47 neurons/mm2 in host in WT versus 817 ± 37 neurons/mm2 in host in AD). Importantly, up to 33% of human neurons in AD mice show a necrotic phenotype (Figure 5X) characterized by electron lucent nuclei with highly dispersed chromatin, swelling of cytoplasm, and swelling and disintegration of cytoplasmic organelles (Figures 5S–5T′) (Nagańska and Matyja, 2001Nagańska E.

Biol. 2013; 1004: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Enlarged mitochondria with disrupted cristae (red arrowheads), large vacuoles (blue arrowheads), and even rupture of the nuclear membrane (green arrowheads) are also seen (Figures 5S′–5T′). However, such phenotypes are completely absent in human neurons in WT mice (Figures 5R, 5R′, and 5X). The effects appear human specific as no signs of degeneration are observed in mouse host tissue or in PSC-derived mouse neurons in AD mice (Figures 5V and 5X; Figure S4N). Apoptotic cell death does not contribute strongly to the cell loss at this stage as no increased caspase-3-activated staining (data not shown) or TUNEL labeling is observed (Figures S4O–S4Z). Overall, the human grafts exposed to Aβ undergo major neuronal loss and neurodegeneration in vivo via a necrosis-mediated mechanism. Moreover, this effect is species specific as mouse host neurons or grafted mouse neurons exposed to the same Aβ load do not undergo degeneration. Adult murine brain mainly expresses the 4R Tau isoform containing four microtubule-binding repeats. During human brain embryonic development, only the 3R splice form of Tau is detected, while the adult human brain expresses 3R and 4R Tau splice forms in a 1:1 ratio (Goedert and Jakes, 1990Goedert M.

We thus studied the expression pattern of Tau using specific antibodies raised against 3R or 4R Tau splice forms (Figures S5M and S5N). After 2 and 4 MPT, 3R Tau is expressed, but 4R Tau is detected only in 0.7% of the human neurons (GFP+ or STEM121+), while 4R Tau is widely expressed in mouse host tissue (Figures 6A–6B′, 6E–6F′, and 6M; Figures S5A–S5C). However, at 6 MPT, 89% of the human neurons express high levels of 4R together with 3R Tau (arrows; Figures 6I–6J′ and 6M; Figures S5G–S5I). In addition, RNA-seq analysis of human grafts in old animals (8 MPT) shows a 3R/4R Tau expression close to 1, similar to the ratio in adult human brain (Figure 6N). We wondered whether the appearance of 4R Tau could be accelerated in our model using two human iPSC lines derived from a patient carrying the pathogenic Tau mutation Ex10+16 (further indicated as Tau∗) (Sposito et al., 2015Sposito T.

Following in vivo transplantation, human Tau∗ neurons (HuNCAM+) showed no 4R Tau expression at 2 MPT (Figures 6C–6D′). However, at 4 MPT 37% of the human Tau∗ neurons expressed 4R together with 3R Tau isoforms (arrows; Figures 6G–6H′ and 6M; Figures S5D–S5F) in agreement with previous findings in vitro (Sposito et al., 2015Sposito T.

Human Tau∗ neurons transplanted into the AD mouse brain show similar phenotypes as described above. We detect numerous Aβ plaques within the grafts (Figures S6A–S6H) and DNs (Figures S6I and S6J). SYP+ and VGlut+ accumulations are surrounding Aβ plaques (Figures S6K–S6L′). Importantly, the density of grafted human Tau∗ neurons near Aβ plaques is reduced to 28% compared to WT animals (Figure 5M; Figures S6M–S6R).

https://openalex.org/W2592950943,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a heterogeneous tumor of the brain with a poor prognosis due to recurrence and drug resistance following therapy. Genome-wide profiling has revealed the existence of distinct GBM molecular subtypes that respond differently to aggressive therapies. Despite this, molecular subtype does not predict recurrence or drug resistance and overall survival is similar across subtypes. One of the key features contributing to tumor recurrence and resistance to therapy is proposed to be an underlying subpopulation of resistant glioma stem cells (GSC). CD133 expression has been used as a marker of GSCs, however recent evidence suggests the relationship between CD133 expression, GSCs and molecular subtype is more complex than initially proposed. The expression of CD133, Olig2 and CD44 was investigated using patient derived glioma stem-like cells (PDGCs) in vitro and in vivo. Different PDGCs exhibited a characteristic equilibrium of distinct CD133+ and CD44+ subpopulations and the influence of environmental factors on the intra-tumor equilibrium of CD133+ and CD44+ cells in PDGCs was also investigated, with hypoxia inducing a CD44+ to CD133+ shift and chemo-radiotherapy inducing a CD133+ to CD44+ shift. These data suggest that surveillance and modulation of intra-tumor heterogeneity using molecular markers at initial surgery and surgery for recurrent GBM may be important for more effective management of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2590568386,"Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) mutations cause severe epilepsies marked by intermittent, pathological hypersynchronous brain states. Here we present two mechanisms that help to explain how mutations in one VGSC gene, Scn8a, contribute to two distinct seizure phenotypes: (1) hypoexcitation of cortical circuits leading to convulsive seizure resistance, and (2) hyperexcitation of thalamocortical circuits leading to non-convulsive absence epilepsy. We found that loss of Scn8a leads to altered RT cell intrinsic excitability and a failure in recurrent RT synaptic inhibition. We propose that these deficits cooperate to enhance thalamocortical network synchrony and generate pathological oscillations. To our knowledge, this finding is the first clear demonstration of a pathological state tied to disruption of the RT-RT synapse. Our observation that loss of a single gene in the thalamus of an adult wild-type animal is sufficient to cause spike-wave discharges is striking and represents an example of absence epilepsy of thalamic origin."

While a major component of social stress often encompasses physical interactions, purely psychological stressors (i.e. witnessing a traumatic event) also fall under the scope of social stress. The current study determined whether the acute stress response and susceptibility to stress-related consequences differed based on whether the stressor consisted of physical versus purely psychological social stress. Using a modified resident-intruder paradigm, male rats were either directly exposed to repeated social defeat stress (intruder) or witnessed a male rat being defeated. Cardiovascular parameters, behavioral anhedonia, and inflammatory cytokines in plasma and the stress-sensitive locus coeruleus were compared between intruder, witness, and control rats. Surprisingly intruders and witnesses exhibited nearly identical increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate during acute and repeated stress exposures, yet only intruders exhibited stress-induced arrhythmias. Furthermore, re-exposure to the stress environment in the absence of the resident produced robust pressor and tachycardic responses in both stress conditions indicating the robust and enduring nature of social stress. In contrast, the long-term consequences of these stressors were distinct. Intruders were characterized by enhanced inflammatory sensitivity in plasma, while witnesses were characterized by the emergence of depressive-like anhedonia, transient increases in systolic blood pressure and plasma levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. The current study highlights that while the acute cardiovascular responses to stress were identical between intruders and witnesses, these stressors produced distinct differences in the enduring consequences to stress, suggesting that witness stress may be more likely to produce long-term cardiovascular dysfunction and comorbid behavioral anhedonia while exposure to physical stressors may bias the system towards sensitivity to inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2591053562,"Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is a member of a large family of proteases that are secreted as inactive zymogens. It is a key regulator of the extracellular matrix, involved in the degradation of various extracellular matrix proteins. MMP9 plays a pathological role in a variety of inflammatory and oncology disorders and has long been considered an attractive therapeutic target. GS-5745, a potent, highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody inhibitor of MMP9, has shown promise in treating ulcerative colitis and gastric cancer. Here we describe the crystal structure of GS-5745·MMP9 complex and biochemical studies to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of MMP9 by GS-5745. GS-5745 binds MMP9 distal to the active site, near the junction between the prodomain and catalytic domain, and inhibits MMP9 by two mechanisms. Binding to pro-MMP9 prevents MMP9 activation, whereas binding to active MMP9 allosterically inhibits activity."
https://openalex.org/W2594613418,"Different olfactory cortical regions are thought to harbor distinct sensory representations, enabling each area to play a unique role in odor perception and behavior. In the piriform cortex (PCx), spatially dispersed sensory inputs evoke activity in distributed ensembles of neurons that act as substrates for odor learning. In contrast, the posterolateral cortical amygdala (plCoA) receives hardwired inputs that may link specific odor cues to innate olfactory behaviors. Here we show that despite stark differences in the patterning of plCoA and PCx inputs, odor-evoked neural ensembles in both areas are equally capable of discriminating odors, and exhibit similar odor tuning, reliability, and correlation structure. These results demonstrate that brain regions mediating odor-driven innate behaviors can, like brain areas involved in odor learning, represent odor objects using distributive population codes; these findings suggest both alternative mechanisms for the generation of innate odor-driven behaviors and additional roles for the plCoA in odor perception."
https://openalex.org/W2591124474,"Upon recognition of bacterial pathogens by pattern recognition receptors, cells are activated to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN by multiple signaling pathways. Every step of the process must be precisely regulated to prevent dysregulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be important regulators with profound effects on inflammatory response. Nevertheless, the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism remains unclear in fish species. Here, we addressed the role of miiuy croaker miR-214 in the bacteria triggered inflammatory response. miR-214 could significantly be up-regulated by Vibro harveyi and LPS stimulation. Up-regulating miR-214 subsequently inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines by targeting myd88 to avoid excessive inflammation. Moreover, the negative regulatory mechanism of miR-214 has been demonstrated to be via the myd88-mediated NF-κB pathway. This is the first to focus on miR-214 acting as the negative regulator involved in the bacteria-triggered inflammatory response and thus may provide knowledge on the host-cell regulator responses to microbial infection."

https://openalex.org/W2594086977,"Quantum annealing is an experimental and potentially breakthrough computational technology for handling hard optimization problems, including problems of computer vision. We present a case study in training a production-scale classifier of tree cover in remote sensing imagery, using early-generation quantum annealing hardware built by D-wave Systems, Inc. Beginning within a known boosting framework, we train decision stumps on texture features and vegetation indices extracted from four-band, one-meter-resolution aerial imagery from the state of California. We then impose a regulated quadratic training objective to select an optimal voting subset from among these stumps. The votes of the subset define the classifier. For optimization, the logical variables in the objective function map to quantum bits in the hardware device, while quadratic couplings encode as the strength of physical interactions between the quantum bits. Hardware design limits the number of couplings between these basic physical entities to five or six. To account for this limitation in mapping large problems to the hardware architecture, we propose a truncation and rescaling of the training objective through a trainable metaparameter. The boosting process on our basic 108- and 508-variable problems, thus constituted, returns classifiers that incorporate a diverse range of color- and texture-based metrics and discriminate tree cover with accuracies as high as 92% in validation and 90% on a test scene encompassing the open space preserves and dense suburban build of Mill Valley, CA."

Synaptic plasticity denotes the ability of neurons to dynamically modulate pre-existing synaptic connections and is a process suggested to play a fundamental role in learning and memory. The AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory transmission and critically contribute to synaptic plasticity as well as to several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders (Palmer et al., 2005Palmer C.L.

In addition to promoting AMPAR surface expression and localization, data accumulating from several studies, including from our lab, showed that the prototypical TARP, γ2, also known as stargazin, functions as a positive allosteric modulator of AMPARs: γ2 slows receptor deactivation, reduces desensitization and accelerates recovery from desensitization, enhances agonist affinity and efficacy, increases channel conductance and open probability, and reduces channel block by intracellular polyamines (Priel et al., 2005Priel A.

Each subunit contains four principal domains: two extracellular domains—the amino-terminus (NT), primarily directing receptor assembly, and the S1-S2 ligand-binding domain (LBD); a membrane-embedded channel domain, composed of three transmembrane domains (M1, M3, and M4) and a re-entered loop (M2); and an intracellular C-tail (CT), implicated mainly in trafficking (Traynelis et al., 2010Traynelis S.F.

In TARPs, roles for the large extracellular loop EX1 and the CTD have been identified, with EX1 main involvement in the regulation of AMPAR biophysical properties, and the CTD in the modulation of trafficking (Tomita et al., 2005Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S.

Nonetheless, a comprehensive understanding of the sequence and role of these interactions in AMPAR modulation by TARPs is still lacking. Here, we employed systematic domain swaps between AMPAR and the TARP-insensitive kainate receptor GluK2 (Chen et al., 2003Chen L. El-Husseini A. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Stargazin differentially controls the trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate and kainate receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and performed functional and biochemical analysis to identify the protein-protein interfaces and mode of action enabling receptor modulation by γ2. We found that the AMPAR membrane domains and the CT are necessary and sufficient to enable receptor modulation by γ2, and that γ2 is situated in between adjacent receptor subunits. Moreover, we disclosed a key role in this process for the TARP domains TM3-EX2-TM4. These results are consistent with the recently published cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of the AMPAR GluA2 in complex with γ2 (Twomey et al., 2016Twomey E.C. Yelshanskaya M.V.

Beyond that, we provide data suggesting a two-step mechanism in which the mere binding of TARP to the AMPAR membrane domains and the CT imposes conformational changes in these domains that destabilize the channel closed state, thereby promoting a more efficient channel opening upon agonist binding. Subsequently, conformational changes induced by agonist binding may allow interactions between extracellular parts of the receptor and TARPs, which in turn, stabilize the open state (Shaikh et al., 2016Shaikh S.A.

In order to identify the domains by which γ2 modulates AMPAR properties, we first analyzed a series of GluA3 chimeras having discrete domain swaps with the kainate receptor GluK2 (Ayalon and Stern-Bach, 2001Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y.

Agonist selectivity of glutamate receptors is specified by two domains structurally related to bacterial amino acid-binding proteins.Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We expressed these chimeras with and without γ2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and used whole-cell two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings to test the γ2 effects on receptor function, focusing on desensitization, agonist efficacy, and intracellular polyamine block, and employed membrane protein biotinylation to measure the impact of γ2 on receptor surface delivery. First, for estimation of the γ2 effect on receptor desensitization, we measured current responses to glutamate in the absence and presence of the AMPAR desensitization blocker cyclothiazide (Figure 1A; G and G+C, respectively). Because of fast AMPAR desensitization, occurring in a few milliseconds, only a small steady-state current can be typically recorded in TEVC following application of glutamate alone (G), while the full response is uncovered in the presence of the desensitization blocker (G+C). Broadly, changes in the ratio between the current amplitudes in the absence and presence of cyclothiazide (G/G+C) can be thus used to estimate the effect of γ2 on receptor desensitization (the higher the ratio the weaker the desensitization), and changes in current amplitude per se in the presence of cyclothiazide can indicate the impact of γ2 on channel conductance and the number of receptors on the surface. As seen in Figure 1A, in oocytes expressing intact GluA3 without γ2, the current recorded in response to glutamate alone was only ∼7% of that obtained with cyclothiazide (black traces, G and G+C, respectively; Table S1), while in oocytes co-expressing γ2 the ratio increased to ∼36% (blue traces, G and G+C, respectively; Table S1), presenting on average an ∼400% change (G/G+C; Figure 1D, black bar), a result consistent with the γ2 reduction of receptor desensitization. There was also an ∼2-fold increase by γ2 in the total response to glutamate in the presence of cyclothiazide (Figure 1A, G+C, black and blue traces, respectively; Table S1), consistent with an increase in channel conductance and/or surface expression; however, since the magnitude of the change highly depended on the level of receptor expression (Priel et al., 2005Priel A. Kolleker A. Ayalon G. Gillor M. Osten P. Stern-Bach Y. Stargazin reduces desensitization and slows deactivation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptors.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2682-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we did not use this parameter in the phenotypic screen of the GluA3 chimeras. Second, for estimation of the γ2 effect on agonist efficacy, we measured responses to saturating concentrations of the partial agonist kainate. These measurements were done in the presence of cyclothiazide (Figure 1A, K+C) to eliminate γ2 effects on receptor desensitization. As seen in Figure 1A, in oocytes expressing intact GluA3 without γ2, the response to kainate was only ∼20% of the response to glutamate (black traces, K+C and G+C, respectively; Table S1), while in oocytes co-injected with γ2, the response to kainate reached almost the same amplitude of that induced by glutamate (∼95%, blue traces K+C and G+C, respectively; Table S1), presenting on average an ∼300% increase in the efficacy of kainate (Figure 1D, K+C/G+C, light gray bar). Third, to measure the γ2 effect on intracellular polyamine block, we obtained current/voltage curves in response to glutamate in the presence of cyclothiazide (Figure 1B) and calculated the change in current rectification index (experimental procedures), which presented on average an increase of ∼250% for intact GluA3 (Figure 1D, dark gray bar; Table S1). Finally, we used a membrane protein biotinylation assay to determine the γ2 effect on receptor surface delivery (Figure 1C). To correct for differences in total protein expression, we calculated the effect of γ2 on the ratio of surface (S) biotinylated to total (T) receptor protein expression, demonstrating an ∼150% increase in surface expression for intact GluA3 (Figure 1D, trafficking index, striped bar; Table S1). Overall, the effects of γ2 on intact GluA3 were similar to those reported for AMPAR GluA2 or GluA1 (Kott et al., 2009Kott S. Sager C. Tapken D. Werner M. Hollmann M.

The above tests were performed on various GluA3 chimeras having discrete domain substitutions with GluK2. Current responses to glutamate of all chimeras were similarly enhanced by cyclothiazide (Table S1), except for chimera A3(K2/NT-S1), having the GluK2 extracellular domains NT and S1, which does not desensitize in response to glutamate (Stern-Bach et al., 1998Stern-Bach Y.

A point mutation in the glutamate binding site blocks desensitization of AMPA receptors.Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, all chimeras contained the flip isoform, which enables a complete desensitization block by cyclothiazide; thus, in addition to using saturated concentrations of cyclothiazide and agonists, the reported modulatory effects of γ2 on the efficiency of cyclothiazide (Tomita et al., 2006Tomita S. Sekiguchi M. Wada K. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin controls the pharmacology of AMPA receptor potentiators.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10064-10067Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were minimized or eliminated. As shown in Figure 1D, chimera A3(K2/NT-S1) basically retained the modulation by γ2 on kainate efficacy, current rectification, and surface delivery (effect on receptor desensitization could not be evaluated due to the non-desensitizing phenotype of the chimera). The apparent increase in the rectification index observed with this chimera was not statistically different from the γ2 effect on intact GluA3. In contrast, γ2 effects were significantly impaired in chimeras containing exchanges of the membrane domains and/or the CT. First, exchange of either the membrane domains M1-M2-M3 (M1-3) or the CT abolished the γ2 effect on receptor desensitization (Figure 1D, black bars, chimeras A3[K2/M1-3] and A3[K2/CT], respectively). Second, γ2 effect on kainate efficacy was also significantly impaired in those chimeras compared to intact GluA3 (p < 0.01), although not completely abolished, and a similar phenotype was exhibited by chimera A3(K2/M1-3,CT), containing the co-exchange of these domains (Figure 1D, light gray bars). Modulation of kainate efficacy by γ2 was also still apparent in chimera A3(K2/M4-CT), containing the exchange of the CT with the membrane domain M4 but totally lost in chimera A3(K2/M1-3,M4-CT), having exchange of the entire membrane core and the CT. γ2 effect on current rectification was significantly impaired by the M1-3 exchange, but not by the CT or by its co-replacement with M4, and abolished only when the entire membrane core and the CT were co-replaced (Figure 1D, dark gray bars). Precise kinetic measurements by fast perfusion patch-clamp technology could not be performed on the chimeras having partial exchanges of the membrane domains or the CT because of very low expression (Table S1) (Ayalon and Stern-Bach, 2001Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Functional assembly of AMPA and kainate receptors is mediated by several discrete protein-protein interactions.Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast, chimera A3(K2/M1-3,M4-CT), having all membrane domains of GluK2, produced sufficient current expression for such an analysis, and, consistent with the TEVC recordings, γ2 had no effect on receptor kinetics in outside-out patches of HEK293 cells expressing this chimera: the desensitization time constants in response to 10 mM glutamate applied for 500 ms were 5.3 ± 0.2 ms and 5.4 ± 0.2 ms without and with γ2, respectively (n = 10), and the deactivation time constants in response to 1 ms application of glutamate were 2.5 ± 0.1 ms and 2.4 ± 0.2 ms without and with γ2, respectively (n = 7). Finally, γ2 enhancement of receptor surface delivery was attenuated in chimeras containing the M1-3 exchange, but not in those having only the CT replacement or the CT with M4 (Figure 1D, striped bars; Table S1). Overall, these results highlight the necessity of the membrane domains and the CT for receptor modulation by γ2. To further establish the contribution of the AMPAR membrane domains and the CT in receptor modulation by γ2, we tested reciprocal GluK2 chimeras having GluA3 exchanges of these domains (Ayalon and Stern-Bach, 2001Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Functional assembly of AMPA and kainate receptors is mediated by several discrete protein-protein interactions.Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), looking for a gain of γ2 effect. As above, we first expressed these chimeras in oocytes and used TEVC to measure responses to glutamate before and after treatment with the kainate receptor desensitization blocker Concanavalin A (Figure 2A; G and G+Co, respectively). Co-expression with γ2 had no effect on current responses of GluK2 chimeras having GluA3 replacement of either M1-3 or the CT (data not shown), presenting a phenotype no different than intact GluK2 (Figure 2A, upper traces and left bars). In contrast, current responses of chimera K2(A3/M1-3,CT), having both exchanges, were significantly increased by γ2 (Figure 2A, lower traces and right bars). Current responses to glutamate alone were increased by ∼9-fold, indicating a significant reduction in receptor desensitization, coupled to an additional positive effect on channel conductance and/or surface expression as disclosed by the ∼1.7-fold increase in current response after the treatment with Concanavalin A. Similar observations were obtained for GluK2 chimeras having M1-3 and CT exchanges with the other AMPAR subunits GluA2 and GluA1 (data not shown). To note, GluK2 chimeras having only the M1 or M2 substitutions were not functional (Ayalon and Stern-Bach, 2001Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Functional assembly of AMPA and kainate receptors is mediated by several discrete protein-protein interactions.Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), thus preventing us from examining the relative contribution of each of these domains to modulation by γ2. Next, encouraged by the positive results, we performed fast perfusion outside-out patch clamp recordings in HEK293 cells, focusing on the chimeras containing the GluA2 exchanges because they expressed better than those having the GluA3 or GluA1 substitutions. Similar to intact GluK2, application of glutamate or kainate for 500 ms to patches expressing chimera K2(A2/M1-3,CT) without γ2 induced fast and almost complete desensitizing responses to both agonists, though slightly slower (Figure 2B, upper black traces; Table S2). However, while co-expression with γ2 had no effect on current responses of intact GluK2, it significantly slowed the current decay of K2(A2/M1-3,CT) in response to both agonists, reaching a significant elevated steady state, which was more pronounced for the response to kainate (Figure 2B, upper blue traces; Table S2). Co-expression with γ2 also slowed the deactivation kinetics of K2(A2/M1-3,CT) in response to a brief 1 ms pulse of glutamate or kainate, but not of intact GluK2 (Figure 2B, lower traces; Table S2). Moreover, although kainate induced fast desensitizing responses in GluK2 and the chimera, peak current, in both cases, reached only ∼50% of that produced by glutamate when recorded on the same patch (Table S2; K/G current ratio), consistent with kainate being a partial agonist on GluK2 and the chimera. Compatible with its effect on AMPAR, γ2 increased the efficacy of kainate on K2(A2/M1-3,CT), reaching ∼70% of the glutamate-evoked amplitude, but had no effect on intact GluK2 (Table S2). Similar observations were made on the compatible K2(A3/M1-3,CT) and K2(A1/M1-3,CT) chimeras (Table S2). The γ2 modulatory effects on receptor desensitization, deactivation, and kainate efficacy were tightly dependent on the co-exchange of M1-3 and the CT, as γ2 had no significant effect on any of these parameters when expressed with the chimeras having only the M1-3 or the CT exchange (Table S2; K2[A2/M1-3] and K2[A2/CT], respectively). To further examine the γ2 effects on function of chimera K2(A2/M1-3,CT), we then tested its effects on receptor apparent affinity to glutamate and on intracellular polyamine block (Figures 2C and 2D). Co-expression of γ2 with K2(A2/M1-3,CT) in oocytes induced a significant leftward shift in the glutamate dose-response curve, presenting ∼2-fold reduction in the EC50 value (Figure 2C), and caused a significant change in current rectification, most prominent at positive membrane potentials (Figure 2D). These features, as well, were not affected by γ2 when co-expressed with chimeras K2(A2/M1-3) or K2(A2/CT) (data not shown). Finally, surface protein biotinylation assays conducted in HEK293 cells on these chimeras demonstrated a significant enhanced trafficking of K2(A2/M1-3,CT) when co-expressed with γ2, but not of K2(A2/CT) (Figure 2E) or K2(A2/M1-3) (data not shown). Taken together, the above results establish the AMPAR M1-3 and the CT as the domains necessary and sufficient for enabling γ2 modulation of both trafficking and gating. The results obtained from the screen with the GluA3 chimeras (Figure 1) as well as from other reports (Terhag et al., 2010Terhag J. Gottschling K. Hollmann M.

Internet-based CBT programs for depression have been classified as “well established” following the American Psychological Association criteria for empirically supported treatments. The aim of this study is to analyze the cost effectiveness at 12-month follow-up of the Internet-based CBT program “Smiling is fun” with (LITG) and without psychotherapist support (TSG) compared to usual care. The perspective used in our analysis is societal. A sample of 296 depressed patients (mean age of 43.04 years; 76% female; BDI-II mean score = 22.37) from primary care services in four Spanish regions were randomized in the RCT. The complete case and intention-to-treat (ITT) perspectives were used for the analyses. The results demonstrated that both Internet-based CBT interventions exhibited cost utility and cost effectiveness compared with a control group. The complete case analyses revealed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €-169.50 and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of €-11389.66 for the TSG group and an ICER of €-104.63 and an ICUR of €-6380.86 for the LITG group. The ITT analyses found an ICER of €-98.37 and an ICUR of €-5160.40 for the TSG group and an ICER of €-9.91 and an ICUR of €496.72 for the LITG group. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the two Internet-based CBT interventions are appropriate from both economic and clinical perspectives for depressed patients in the Spanish primary care system. These interventions not only help patients to improve clinically but also generate societal savings. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01611818"
https://openalex.org/W2594662887,"Canonical Wnt signaling is associated with glaucoma pathogenesis and intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation. Our goal was to gain insight into the influence of non-pigmented ciliary epithelium (NPCE)-derived exosomes on Wnt signaling by trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. The potential impact of exosomes on Wnt signaling in the ocular drainage system remains poorly understood.Exosomes isolated from media collected from cultured NPCE cells by differential ultracentrifugation were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), sucrose density gradient migration and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cellular target specificity of the NPCE-derived exosomes was investigated by confocal microscopy-based monitoring of the uptake of DiD-labeled exosomes over time, as compared to uptake by various cell lines. Changes in Wnt protein levels in TM cells induced by NPCE exosomes were evaluated by Western blot.Exosomes derived from NPCE cells were purified and detected as small rounded 50-140 nm membrane vesicles, as defined by DLS, NTA, TRPS and TEM. Western blot analysis indicated that the nanovesicles were positive for classic exosome markers, including Tsg101 and Alix. Isolated nanoparticles were found in sucrose density fractions typical of exosomes (1.118-1.188 g/mL sucrose). Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrated time-dependent specific accumulation of the NPCE-derived exosomes in NTM cells. Other cell lines investigated hardly revealed any exosome uptake. We further showed that exosomes induced changes in Wnt signaling protein expression in the TM cells. Western blot analysis further revealed decreased phosphorylation of GKS3β and reduced β-catenin levels. Finally, we found that treatment of NTM cells with exosomes resulted in a greater than 2-fold decrease in the level of β-catenin in the cytosolic fraction. In contrast, no remarkable difference in the amount of β-catenin in the nuclear fraction was noted, relative to the control.The data suggest that NPCE cells release exosome-like vesicles and that these nanoparticles affect canonical Wnt signaling in TM cells. These findings may have therapeutic relevance since canonical Wnt pathway is involved in intra-ocular pressure regulation. Further understanding of NPCE-derived exosome-responsive signaling pathways may reveal new targets for pharmacological intervention within the drainage system as a target for glaucoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2589216136,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and its bioactive product, nitric oxide (NO), mediate many endothelial cell functions, including angiogenesis and vascular permeability. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis is inhibited upon reduction of NO bioactivity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, genetic disruption or pharmacological inhibition of eNOS attenuates angiogenesis during tissue repair, resulting in delayed wound closure. These observations emphasize that eNOS-derived NO can promote angiogenesis. Intriguingly, eNOS activity is regulated by nitric-oxide synthase trafficking inducer (NOSTRIN), which sequesters eNOS, thereby attenuating NO production. This has prompted significant interest in NOSTRIN's function in endothelial cells. We show here that NOSTRIN affects the functional transcriptome of endothelial cells by down-regulating several genes important for invasion and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the effects of NOSTRIN on endothelial gene expression were independent of eNOS activity. NOSTRIN also affected the expression of secreted cytokines involved in inflammatory responses, and ectopic NOSTRIN overexpression functionally restricted endothelial cell proliferation, invasion, adhesion, and VEGF-induced capillary tube formation. Furthermore, NOSTRIN interacted directly with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to the suppression of NFκB activity and inhibition of AKT activation via phosphorylation. Interestingly, TNF-α-induced NFκB pathway activation was reversed by NOSTRIN. We found that the SH3 domain of NOSTRIN is involved in the NOSTRIN-TRAF6 interaction and is required for NOSTRIN-induced down-regulation of endothelial cell proteins. These results have broad biological implications, as aberrant NOSTRIN expression leading to deactivation of the NFκB pathway, in turn triggering an anti-angiogenic cascade, might inhibit tumorigenesis and cancer progression."

Biomarkers are needed due to the slow disease progression and the limitations of clinical assessment. This study aims to validate the role of NFL and tau as biomarkers in HD.CSF was obtained from a cohort of HD patients and premanifest HD-mutation carriers. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) testing was performed on all subjects at the time of sampling. NFL and tau concentrations were determined by ELISA. Spearman correlations were calculated with R version 3.2.3.11 premanifest HD and 12 manifest HD subjects were enrolled. NFL and tau levels were correlated. NFL showed strong correlations with all items included in the clinical assessment (for example the total functional capacity (TFC) (r = - 0.70 p < 0.01) and total motor score (TMS) (r = 0.83p < 0.01). Tau showed slightly weaker correlations (eg. TMS (r = 0.67 p < 0.01); TFC (r = - 0.59 p < 0.01)). NFL was significantly correlated with 5-year probability of disease onset, whereas tau was not.This study strengthens the case for NFL as a useful biomarker of disease stage. NFL was strongly correlated to all evaluated items in the UHDRS assessment. Tau also has a potential for use as a biomarker but correlations to clinical tests are weaker in this study. We suggest that NFL and possibly tau be used in clinical drug trials as biomarkers of disease progression that are potentially influenced by future disease-modifying therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2592878890,"For the first time in the literature, our group has managed to demonstrate the existence of plant RNAs in honey samples. In particular, in our work, different RNA extraction procedures were performed in order to identify a purification method for nucleic acids from honey. Purity, stability and integrity of the RNA samples were evaluated by spectrophotometric, PCR and electrophoretic analyses. Among all honey RNAs, we specifically revealed the presence of both plastidial and nuclear plant transcripts: RuBisCO large subunit mRNA, maturase K messenger and 18S ribosomal RNA. Surprisingly, nine plant microRNAs (miR482b, miR156a, miR396c, miR171a, miR858, miR162a, miR159c, miR395a and miR2118a) were also detected and quantified by qPCR. In this context, a comparison between microRNA content in plant samples (i.e. flowers, nectars) and their derivative honeys was carried out. In addition, peculiar microRNA profiles were also identified in six different monofloral honeys. Finally, the same plant microRNAs were investigated in other plant food products: tea, cocoa and coffee. Since plant microRNAs introduced by diet have been recently recognized as being able to modulate the consumer's gene expression, our research suggests that honey's benefits for human health may be strongly correlated to the bioactivity of plant microRNAs contained in this matrix."

The analysis of spatial temporal parameters and the center of pressure displacement, which represents the interaction between the human body and the ground, would be beneficial. The aim of this study was to compare spatial temporal gait parameters and their variability and the variability of the center of pressure displacement between elderly fallers and nonfallers during gait at self-selected, defined and fast speeds. A prospective study design was used. At the baseline, measurements of ground reaction force during gait at self-selected, defined and fast walking speeds by two force plates were performed. In addition, the Tinetti balance assessment tool, the Falls Efficacy Scale-International and the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale were used. Mean and coefficient of variation of spatial temporal gait parameters and standard deviations of center of pressure displacement during loading response, midstance, terminal stance and preswing phases were calculated. Comparison of the fallers and nonfallers exhibited no significant difference in clinical tool, scales or spatial temporal parameters. Compared to nonfallers’ increased variability of walking speed at self-selected and defined speed, step width at fast walking speed and center of pressure displacement during preswing phase in medial-lateral directions at defined walking speed was found in fallers. However, application of the Holm-Bonferroni procedure for multiple comparisons exhibited no significant effect of group in any of the gait parameters. In general, our study did not observe an effect of group (fallers vs. nonfallers) on variability of spatial temporal parameters and center of pressure movement during gait. However, walking speed, step width as well as standard deviation of COP displacement in the medial-lateral direction during preswing exhibited a certain potential for distinguishing between elderly fallers and nonfallers."

We determined the prevalence and factors associated with health services utilization in a rural area of Kenya. Our findings inform the local health management in development of appropriately targeted interventions. We used a cluster sample survey design and interviewed household key informants on history of illness for household members and health services utilization in the preceding month. We estimated prevalence and performed random effects logistic regression to determine the influence of individual and household level factors on decisions to utilize health services. Results and conclusions 1230/6,440 (19.1%, 95% CI: 18.3%-20.2%) household members reported an illness. Of these, 76.7% (95% CI: 74.2%-79.0%) sought healthcare in a health facility. The majority (94%) of the respondents visited dispensary-level facilities and only 60.1% attended facilities within the study sub-counties. Of those that did not seek health services, 43% self-medicated by buying non-prescription drugs, 20% thought health services were too costly, and 10% indicated that the sickness was not serious enough to necessitate visiting a health facility. In the multivariate analyses, relationship to head of household was associated with utilization of health services. Relatives other than the nuclear family of the head of household were five times less likely to seek medical help (Odds Ratio 0.21 (95% CI: 0.05–0.87)). Dispensary level health facilities are the most commonly used by members of this community, and relations at the level of the household influence utilization of health services during an illness. These data enrich the perspective of the local health management to better plan the allocation of healthcare resources according to need and demand. The findings will also contribute in the development of community-level health coverage interventions that target the disadvantaged household groups."

Reduced KCC2 levels in the neuronal membrane contribute to the generation of epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and autism spectrum disorders; thus, it is important to characterize the mechanisms regulating KCC2 expression. In the present study, we determined the role of KCC2-protein interactions in regulating total and surface membrane KCC2 expression. Using quantitative immunofluorescence in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, we discovered that the kainate receptor subunit GluK2 and the auxiliary subunit Neto2 significantly increase the total KCC2 abundance in neurons but that GluK2 exclusively increases the abundance of KCC2 in the surface membrane. Using a live cell imaging assay, we further determined that KCC2 recycling primarily occurs within 1–2 h and that GluK2 produces an ∼40% increase in the amount of KCC2 recycled to the membrane during this time period. This GluK2-mediated increase in surface recycling translated to a significant increase in KCC2 expression in the surface membrane. Moreover, we found that KCC2 recycling is enhanced by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the GluK2 C-terminal residues Ser-846 and Ser-868. Lastly, using gramicidin-perforated patch clamp recordings, we found that the GluK2-mediated increase in KCC2 recycling to the surface membrane translates to a hyperpolarization of the reversal potential for GABA (EGABA).

In conclusion, our results have revealed a mechanism by which kainate receptors regulate KCC2 expression in the hippocampus. The classic fast hyperpolarizing inhibition of the mature brain results primarily from the activation of GABAA receptors. These receptors are Cl−-permeable ion channels, and inhibition results from the influx of Cl− into the neuron (1.Kaila K. Ionic basis of GABAA receptor channel function in the nervous system.Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 489-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This inward gradient for Cl− is set by the neuron-specific K+/Cl− co-transporter KCC2 (2.Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A.

In fact, single-particle tracking revealed that KCC2 is tightly confined to excitatory synapses (5.Chamma I. Heubl M. Chevy Q. Renner M. Moutkine I. Eugène E. Poncer J.C. Lévi S.

Thus, understanding how proteins associated with excitatory synapses regulate KCC2 function may provide critical insight to the function of KCC2.

Although GluK2 and Neto2 can regulate KCC2 independently (9.Mahadevan V. Pressey J.C. Acton B.A. Uvarov P. Huang M.Y. Chevrier J. Puchalski A. Li C.M. Ivakine E.A. Airaksinen M.S. Delpire E.

In the current study, we determined the roles of Neto2 and GluK2 in regulating both total and surface KCC2 abundance using a combination of biochemistry, live cell imaging, and electrophysiology. We determined that although both proteins can regulate total KCC2 abundance, GluK2 exclusively regulates surface abundance. Moreover, we determined that GluK2 increases surface abundance by increasing KCC2 recycling to the membrane and that this recycling can be enhanced by GluK2 phosphorylation. To determine whether Neto2 and/or GluK2 can regulate total and surface KCC2 abundance, we used heterologous cells (COS-7), which do not endogenously express our proteins of interest, allowing us to control protein expression via transfection. We first asked whether the Neto2-KCC2 interaction can increase total KCC2 abundance by transfecting cells with increasing amounts of full-length Neto2 cDNA (containing an HA tag, Neto2-FL-HA) while keeping the amount of transfected KCC2 cDNA constant. We observed that total KCC2 abundance increased in relation to increasing Neto2, despite transfecting with the same amount of KCC2 cDNA (Fig. 1Ai; p = 0.029). Neto2 is a single-pass transmembrane protein containing two extracellular CUB domains, which are critical for maintaining the Neto2-KCC2 interaction (10.Ivakine E.A. Acton B.A. Mahadevan V. Ormond J. Tang M. Pressey J.C. Huang M.Y. Ng D. Delpire E. Salter M.W. Woodin M.A. McInnes R.R. Neto2 is a KCC2 interacting protein required for neuronal Cl− regulation in hippocampal neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on this requirement for the CUB domains, we hypothesized that co-expressing Neto2-HA lacking these domains (Neto2-ΔCUB1&2-HA) would prevent the increase in KCC2 abundance observed in Fig. 1Ai. Surprisingly, we observed that in the absence of the Neto2-KCC2 interaction, increasing Neto2-ΔCUB1&2-HA led to a decrease in total KCC2 abundance (Fig. 1Aii; p = 0.049). Despite the fact that the Neto2:KCC2 interaction is mediated by the extracellular CUB domains, the Neto2 tail alone can rescue the deficiency of KCC2 transport in Neto2−/− neurons (10.Ivakine E.A. Acton B.A. Mahadevan V. Ormond J. Tang M. Pressey J.C. Huang M.Y. Ng D. Delpire E. Salter M.W. Woodin M.A. McInnes R.R. Neto2 is a KCC2 interacting protein required for neuronal Cl− regulation in hippocampal neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests an important Neto2 tail-dependent regulation of KCC2 function that does not require physical interaction. To determine whether the Neto2 tail-dependent regulation of KCC2 includes regulation of total KCC2 abundance, we co-expressed Neto2-HA lacking the cytoplasmic tail (Neto2-Δcyto-HA). We observed that total KCC2 abundance did not increase in response to increasing Neto2-Δcyto-HA cDNA, and again we found a decrease in total KCC2 abundance (Fig. 1Aiii; p = 0.004). Expression of Neto2 truncation mutants resulted in putative degradation products as indicated by the appearance of faster migration bands in Fig. 1 (Aii and Aiii), which is consistent with previous studies (10.Ivakine E.A. Acton B.A. Mahadevan V. Ormond J. Tang M. Pressey J.C. Huang M.Y. Ng D. Delpire E. Salter M.W. Woodin M.A. McInnes R.R.

Neto1 is an auxiliary subunit of native synaptic kainate receptors.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10009-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that when Neto2 associates with KCC2, there is an increase in total KCC2 abundance; however, when this association is disrupted, either physically or through its cytoplasmic tail-dependent regulation, KCC2 is not stably expressed. Using the same assay system, we asked whether increasing GluK2 could also increase total KCC2 abundance. We found that increasing amounts of GluK2 transfection (GluK2-MYC) also increased total KCC2 abundance, despite maintaining the same amount of KCC2 cDNA during transfection (Fig. 1Bi; p = 0.015). To determine whether the effect on KCC2 abundance was due to GluK2 specifically, we repeated these experiments with another kainate receptor subunits GluK1 (GluK1-MYC). We found that increasing GluK1-MYC did not increase KCC2 abundance (Fig. 1Bii; p > 0.05). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that both Neto2 and GluK2 can independently increase total KCC2 abundance in vitro. We next asked whether the regulation of KCC2 abundance is unique to Neto2 and GluK2 or whether other ionotropic glutamate receptors can also regulate KCC2 abundance. To answer this question, we turned to NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which we selected because their activation is known to modulate KCC2 function (12.Lee H.H. Deeb T.Z. Walker J.A. Davies P.A. Moss S.J. NMDA receptor activity downregulates KCC2 resulting in depolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated currents.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because NMDA receptors are heterotetramers, we chose to perform this experiment using the obligatory GluN1 subunit. We found that increasing concentrations of transfected GluN1 did not significantly increase KCC2 abundance (Fig. 1C; p = 0.852), which suggests that the effect of GluK2 on KCC2 may be specific to kainate receptors, at least in the hippocampus. GluK2 normally exists in heteromeric combinations with other GluK subunits (15.Fisher M.T. Fisher J.L. Contributions of different kainate receptor subunits to the properties of recombinant homomeric and heteromeric receptors.Neuroscience. 2014; 278: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and associates with Neto2 (16.Zhang W.

To test whether GluK2 and Neto2 together can further regulate total KCC2 abundance in vitro, we co-expressed KCC2 in combinations with GluK subunits and Neto2. In this assay we used subsaturating amounts of GluK and Neto2 cDNA (125 ng) as determined above (Fig. 1), in combination with KCC2 cDNA (125 ng). As we reported above, co-expression of KCC2 with either Neto2 or GluK2 significantly increased total KCC2 abundance (Fig. 2; p = 0.023), whereas co-expression of KCC2 with GluK1 did not (Fig. 2; p > 0.05). However, when KCC2 was co-expressed with both GluK2 and Neto2, there was a significant increase in total KCC2 abundance as compared with when KCC2 was expressed with either GluK2 or Neto2 alone (Fig. 2; p = 0.002). These results demonstrate that although KCC2 abundance can be increased by either Neto2 or GluK2, both Neto2 and GluK2 produce a further significant increase in total KCC2 abundance in heterologous cells. We have demonstrated that in combination Neto2 and GluK2 can significantly increase KCC2 abundance in a heterologous system. To determine whether this is also true in neurons and to determine the role of Neto2 and GluK2 in regulating KCC2 surface abundance, we quantified KCC2 expression in neurons using immunofluorescence. We chose to perform this experiment in GluK1/2−/− hippocampal neurons because, in addition to lacking kainate receptor subunits, these neurons also have a reduction in Neto2 expression (9.Mahadevan V. Pressey J.C. Acton B.A. Uvarov P. Huang M.Y. Chevrier J. Puchalski A. Li C.M. Ivakine E.A. Airaksinen M.S. Delpire E. McInnes R.R.

A transmembrane accessory subunit that modulates kainate-type glutamate receptors.Neuron. 2009; 61: 385-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To quantify KCC2 abundance, we performed immunocytochemistry in neurons transfected with a KCC2 construct containing an extracellular FLAG-tag (Fig. 3A). In contrast to recombinant systems, we found that co-expression of either Neto2 alone (Fig. 3B) or GluK2 alone (Fig. 3C) did not alter total KCC2 abundance (Fig. 3E). However, overexpressing GluK2 alone (Fig. 3C) significantly increased surface KCC2 immunofluorescence (Fig. 3F; p = 0.004), whereas overexpressing Neto2 alone did not (Fig. 3, B and F). When both Neto2 and GluK2 were present (Fig. 3D), there was a significant increase in both total (Fig. 3E; p = 0.04) and surface abundance of KCC2 (Fig. 3F; p = 0.004). Taken together, this suggests that although both Neto2 and GluK2 are required to increase total KCC2 abundance in neurons, only GluK2 increases KCC2 expressed at the surface. Interestingly, however, only GluK2 regulated KCC2 expressed at the surface even in the absence of any increase in total KCC2 abundance. We therefore hypothesized that the GluK2-mediated increase in KCC2 surface expression resulted from a GluK2-mediated increase in KCC2 recycling to the surface. To test whether GluK2 regulates KCC2 recycling to the neuronal surface, we performed a live cell recycling assay. In this assay we labeled the pool of surface KCC2 that was subsequently endocytosed and then used live imaging to quantify the recycling of that initial membrane pool back to the surface. Similar techniques are routinely used to characterize excitatory neurotransmitter receptor endocytosis and recycling (19.Chamberlain S.E. González-González I.M. Wilkinson K.A. Konopacki F.A. Kantamneni S. Henley J.M. Mellor J.R. SUMOylation and phosphorylation of GluK2 regulate kainate receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Nat.

Ehlers M.D. Recycling endosomes supply AMPA receptors for LTP.Science. 2004; 305: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). As illustrated in the schematic (Fig. 4Ai), we first labeled overexpressed KCC2 containing an extracellular FLAG tag using anti-FLAG antibody (step 1). Following labeling and subsequent endocytosis, we removed any remaining anti-FLAG antibody at the surface using an ice-cold acetic acid buffer wash (step 2). Following a time interval to allow for vesicle recycling (step 3), we visualized KCC2-FLAG recycling back to the membrane by staining for surface FLAG with Alexa Fluor 488 as a secondary antibody (step 4). Lastly, we permeabilized neurons and stained them for intracellular pool of non-recycled KCC2 using Alexa Fluor 555 as secondary antibody (step 5). We first verified that the acetic acid wash removed all surface anti-FLAG antibodies while leaving the cytosolic pool of FLAG-KCC2 intact (Fig. 4Aii). We found that when we overexpressed KCC2-FLAG, we could clearly distinguish recycled from intracellular KCC2 (Fig. 4B). To test our hypothesis that GluK2 regulates KCC2 recycling to the neuronal surface, we compared KCC2 recycling in the somatodendritic compartment (which included the soma and first 50 μm of the proximal dendrites) in GluK1/2−/− neurons overexpressing KCC2-FLAG versus KCC2-FLAG+GluK2. Although we found that KCC2 underwent recycling in the absence of GluK2, KCC2 recycling was significantly increased in the presence of GluK2 (Fig. 4C; 2 h, p = 0.01; 4 h, p = 0.04). KCC2 recycling was determined by normalizing surface KCC2-FLAG to total KCC2-FLAG (surface + internal) to account for potential GluK2-mediated increases in total KCC2 expression. The GluK2-mediated increase in KCC2 surface recycling translated into an increase in surface KCC2-HA puncta as measured using standard immunofluorescence (Fig. 4D; p = 0.02). To confirm that GluK2 increases KCC2 expression in the membrane, we performed total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) 5The abbreviations used are: TIRFtotal internal reflection microscopyPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateANOVAanalysis of variance. in COS-7 cells overexpressing KCC2-HA, which allows the imaging of proteins exclusive to the surface membrane.

It was previously demonstrated that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GluK2 C-terminal residues Ser-846 and Ser-868 regulates the recycling of GluK2 to the plasma membrane (19.Chamberlain S.E.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 19772-19777Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This led us to predict that if we promoted PKC-mediated GluK2 phosphorylation, we would also regulate KCC2 recycling. To test our prediction, we returned to our live cell imaging assay and took advantage of the previously characterized GluK2-S846A/S868A phospho-deficient mutant (23.Nasu-Nishimura Y. Jaffe H. Isaac J.T. Roche K.W. Differential regulation of kainate receptor trafficking by phosphorylation of distinct sites on GluR6.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2847-2856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To express this phospho-deficient mutant in the absence of endogenous GluK2 and KCC2, we performed these experiments in COS-7 cells. This system allowed us to test the sufficiency of GluK2 to regulate KCC2 surface expression. We first analyzed the difference in KCC2-FLAG membrane recycling when cells were transfected with KCC2-FLAG alone or with KCC2-FLAG and GluK2. Similar to our observations in neurons we found that GluK2 facilitated KCC2 recycling (Fig. 5, A and B; p < 0.05). We then asked whether KCC2 recycling was altered when GluK2 was phospho-deficient and found that in the absence of GluK2 phosphorylation at Ser-846/868 residues, there was a significant decrease in KCC2 recycling (Fig. 5, A and B; p < 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in KCC2 recycling between cells transfected with KCC2 alone compared with cells transfected with KCC2 and phospho-deficient GluK2 (Fig. 5B; p > 0.05). Thus, KCC2 recycling in the presence of phospho-deficient GluK2 mutant resembles KCC2 recycling in the absence of GluK2. These findings suggest that GluK2 phosphorylation at Ser-846/868 promotes KCC2 recycling. If PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GluK2 promotes KCC2 recycling and surface expression, then we would predict that phosphorylated GluK2 should result in increased KCC2-mediated Cl− extrusion (because of the increase in surface abundance). To test this prediction, we promoted PKC phosphorylation using PMA. If PKC activation increases KCC2 recycling and surface abundance via phosphorylation of GluK2, then we should see a significantly higher KCC2 transport activity (determined as a hyperpolarization of EGABA) in wild type neurons compared with GluK1/2−/− neurons. Using gramicidin perforated patch clamp recordings to measure EGABA, we determined that promoting PKC phosphorylation with PMA in wild type neurons significantly hyperpolarized EGABA from −69.6 ± 2.6 to −89.1 ± 5.5mV (Fig. 6, A and D; p = 0.007). In GluK1/2−/− neurons, PMA treatment hyperpolarized EGABA from −67 ± 2.3 to −74.4 ± 3.7 mV (Fig. 6B), which also resulted in a significant hyperpolarization of EGABA (Fig. 6D; p = 0.046). Based on the results from our recycling assay, which indicated that the phosphorylation of GluK2-Ser-846/868 promotes KCC2 recycling, we predicted that in the absence of GluK2-Ser-846/868 phosphorylation, PMA would not hyperpolarize EGABA. To test this prediction, we expressed the phospho-deficient GluK2-S846A/S868A in GluK1/2−/− neurons and repeated the above electrophysiology experiments. We found that PMA treatment did not significantly change EGABA (Fig. 6, C and D; no PMA, −55.6 ± 1.6 mV; PMA, −49.28 ± 2.6; p = 0.09). Lastly, we determined that the re-expression of GluK2 in GluK1/2−/− neurons was sufficient to rescue the PMA-induced hyperpolarization of EGABA (Fig. 6D; p < 0.001). The changes in EGABA were not accompanied by any significant changes in synaptic conductance (Fig. 6E; p > 0.05). Thus, the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GluK2, which in turn promotes KCC2 recycling and surface abundance, increases the capacity for Cl− extrusion, which in turn hyperpolarizes EGABA. In this study we determined that although both Neto2 and GluK2 increase total KCC2 abundance in hippocampal neurons, GluK2 itself plays a unique role in promoting KCC2 recycling and surface abundance. Through the use of phosphodeficient GluK2, we revealed that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GluK2 increases KCC2 recycling and surface expression. Increased KCC2 recycling and surface expression culminates in a hyperpolarization of EGABA, which is indicative of increased KCC2-mediated Cl− extrusion and augmented GABAergic inhibition. PKC-mediated phosphorylation is a well established essential post-translational modification of GluK2 (19.Chamberlain S.E. González-González I.M. Wilkinson K.A. Konopacki F.A. Kantamneni S.

https://openalex.org/W2593069661,"Thelodonts are an enigmatic group of Paleozoic jawless vertebrates that have been well studied from taxonomical, biostratigraphic and paleogeographic points of view, although our knowledge of their ecology and mode of life is still scant. Their bodies were covered by micrometric scales whose morphology, histology and the developmental process are extremely similar to those of extant sharks. Based on these similarities and on the well-recognized relationship between squamation and ecology in sharks, here we explore the ecological diversity and lifestyles of thelodonts. For this we use classic morphometrics and discriminant analysis to characterize the squamation patterns of a significant number of extant shark species whose ecology is well known. Multivariate analyses have defined a characteristic squamation pattern for each ecological group, thus establishing a comparative framework for inferring lifestyles in thelodonts. We then use this information to study the squamation of the currently described 147 species of thelodonts, known from both articulated and disarticulated remains. Discriminant analysis has allowed recognizing squamation patterns comparable to those of sharks and links them to specific ecological groups. Our results suggest a remarkable ecological diversity in thelodonts. A large number of them were probably demersal species inhabiting hard substrates, within caves and crevices in rocky environments or reefs, taking advantage of the flexibility provided by their micromeric squamations. Contrary to classical interpretations, only few thelodonts were placed among demersal species inhabiting sandy and muddy substrates. Schooling species with defensive scales against ectoparasites could be also abundant suggesting that social interactions and pressure of ectoparasites were present in vertebrates as early the Silurian. The presence of species showing scales suggestive of low to moderate speed and a lifestyle presumably associated with open water environments indicates adaptation of thelodonts to deep water habitats. Scale morphology suggests that some other thelodonts were strong-swimming pelagic species, most of them radiating during the Early Devonian in association with the Nekton Revolution."

The example analyses include whole body imaging atlas creation, anomaly detection, and cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.The image registration method evaluation on 128 subjects shows low inverse consistency errors and high Dice coefficients. Also, the statistical atlas with fat content intensity values shows low standard deviation values, indicating successful deformations to the common coordinate system. The example analyses show expected associations and correlations which agree with explicit measurements, and thereby illustrate the usefulness of the proposed Imiomics concept.The registration method is well-suited for Imiomics analyses, which enable analyses of relationships to non-imaging data, e.g. clinical data, in new types of holistic targeted and untargeted big-data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2593244388,"Wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn.) is one of the most destructive diseases world-wide. Races belonging to Ug99 (or TTKSK) continue to cause crop losses in East Africa and threaten global wheat production. Developing and deploying wheat varieties with multiple race-specific genes or complex adult plant resistance is necessary to achieve durability. In the present study, we applied genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identifying loci associated with the Ug99 stem rust resistance (SR) in a panel of wheat lines developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Genotyping was carried out using the wheat 9K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Phenotyping was done in the field in Kenya by infection of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKST, the Sr24-virulent variant of Ug99. Marker-trait association identified 12 SNP markers significantly associated with resistance. Among them, 7 were mapped on five chromosomes. Markers located on chromosomes 4A and 4B overlapped with the location of the Ug99 resistance genes SrND643 and Sr37, respectively. Markers identified on 7DL were collocated with Sr25. Additional significant markers were located in the regions where no Sr gene has been reported. The chromosome location for five of the SNP markers was unknown. A BLASTN search of the NCBI database using the flanking sequences of the SNPs associated with Ug99 resistance revealed that several markers were linked to plant disease resistance analogues, while others were linked to regulatory factors or metabolic enzymes. A KASP (Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR) assay was used for validating six marker loci linked to genes with resistance to Ug99. Of those, four co-segregated with the Sr25-pathotypes while the rest identified unknown resistance genes. With further investigation, these markers can be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding for Ug99 stem rust resistance in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2594524883,"Conservation scientists increasingly recognize that incorporating human values into conservation planning increases the chances for success by garnering broader project acceptance. However, methods for defining quantitative targets for the spatial representation of human well-being priorities are less developed. In this study we employ an approach for identifying regionally important human values and establishing specific spatial targets for their representation based on stakeholder outreach. Our primary objective was to develop a spatially-explicit conservation plan that identifies the most efficient locations for conservation actions to meet ecological goals while sustaining or enhancing human well-being values within the coastal and nearshore areas of the western Lake Erie basin (WLEB). We conducted an optimization analysis using 26 features representing ecological and human well-being priorities (13 of each), and included seven cost layers. The influence that including human well-being had on project results was tested by running five scenarios and setting targets for human well-being at different levels in each scenario. The most important areas for conservation to achieve multiple goals are clustered along the coast, reflecting a concentration of existing or potentially restorable coastal wetlands, coastal landbird stopover habitat and terrestrial biodiversity, as well as important recreational activities. Inland important areas tended to cluster around trails and high quality inland landbird stopover habitat. Most concentrated areas of importance also are centered on lands that are already conserved, reflecting the lower costs and higher benefits of enlarging these conserved areas rather than conserving isolated, dispersed areas. Including human well-being features in the analysis only influenced the solution at the highest target levels."

In the present study, a series of 2-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-2-oxoethyl benzoates, 2(a-q), and 2-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-2-oxoethyl pyridinecarboxylate, 2(r-s) were synthesized by reacting 1-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-2-bromoethan-1-one with various carboxylic acids using potassium carbonate in dimethylformamide at ambient temperature. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed a more closely packed crystal structure can be produced by introduction of biphenyl moiety. Five of the compounds among the reported series exhibited significant anti-tyrosinase activities, in which 2p, 2r and 2s displayed good inhibitions which are comparable to standard inhibitor kojic acid at concentrations of 100 and 250 μg/mL. The inhibitory effects of these active compounds were further confirmed by computational molecular docking studies and the results revealed the primary binding site is active-site entrance instead of inner copper binding site which acted as the secondary binding site."

Although access to medicines at affordable prices had been specified as a key objective of the European Health Policy, it seems that these goals have not been achieved. Therefore, we attempted an evaluation of affordability of selected medicines at full prices.The analysis concerned 2012 and was conducted between 2013 and 2015 in all the European Union (EU) countries divided into 3 groups depending on the date of their accession to the EU. Finally, we considered 9 originators used in the treatment of schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Information on drug prices were collected from pharmacies. Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous in order to avoid accusations of advertising. To evaluate affordability, several factors were used (e.g. minimum earnings and Gini coefficient). Due to unavailability in some countries, the exact number of analyzed medicines varies.Drug prices vary significantly between EU Member States. Almost eleven fold difference was observed between Germany (EUR 1451.17) and Croatia (EUR 132.77) in relation to Interferone beta-1a 22 μg. Generally, prices were the highest in Germany. The cheapest drugs were found in various countries but never in the poorest ones like Bulgaria or Romania. Discrepancies in wages were observed too (the smallest minimum wage was EUR 138.00 in Bulgaria and the highest EUR 1801.00 in Luxembourg). Full price of olanzapine 5mg, however, was higher in Bulgaria (EUR 64.53) than, for instance, in Belgium (EUR 37.26).Analyzed medications are still unaffordable for many citizens of the EU. Besides, access to medicines is also impaired e.g. due to parallel trade. Unaffordability of medications may lead to the patients' non-compliance and therefore to increased direct and indirect costs of treatment. Common European solutions are needed to achieve a real affordability and accessibility of medications."
https://openalex.org/W2589710209,"Cancer cells exploit different strategies to escape from the primary tumor, gain access to the circulation, disseminate throughout the body, and form metastases, the leading cause of death by cancer. Invadopodia, pro-teolytically active plasma membrane extensions, are essential in this escape mechanism. Cortactin is involved in every phase of invadopodia formation, and its overexpression is associated with increased invadopodia formation, extracellular matrix degradation, and cancer cell invasion. To analyze endogenous cortactin domain function in these processes, we characterized the effects of nanobodies that are specific for the N-terminal acidic domain of cortactin and expected to target small epitopes within this domain. These nanobodies inhibit cortactin-mediated actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 activation, and, after their intracellular expression in cancer cells, decrease invadopodia formation, extracellular matrix degradation, and cancer cell invasion. In addition, one of the nanobodies affects Arp2/3 interaction and invadopodium stability, and a nanobody targeting the Src homology 3 domain of cortactin enabled comparison of 2 functional regions in invadopodium formation or stability. Given their common and distinct effects, we validate cortactin nanobodies as an instrument to selectively block and study distinct domains within a protein with unprecedented precision, aiding rational future generation of protein domain.xml–.xmlselective therapeutic compounds..xml"

NHERF1 interacts with the PDZ-binding motif in PMCA2 in both normal and malignant breast cells. NHERF1 expression is increased in HER2-positive breast cancers and correlates with HER2-positive status in human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions and invasive breast cancers as well as with increased mortality in patients. NHERF1 is part of a multiprotein complex that includes PMCA2, HSP90, and HER2 within specific actin-rich and lipid raft-rich membrane signaling domains. Knocking down NHERF1 reduces PMCA2 and HER2 expression, inhibits HER2 signaling, dissociates HER2 from HSP90, and causes the internalization, ubiquitination, and degradation of HER2. These results demonstrate that NHERF1 acts with PMCA2 to regulate HER2 signaling and membrane retention in breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2592659517,"Disentangling the mechanisms that shape community assembly across diversity gradients is a central matter in ecology. While many studies have explored community assembly through species average trait values, there is a growing understanding that intraspecific trait variation (ITV) can also play a critical role in species coexistence. Classic biodiversity theory hypothesizes that higher diversity at species-rich sites can arise from narrower niches relative to species-poor sites, which would be reflected in reduced ITV as species richness increases. To explore how ITV in woody plant communities changes with species richness, we compiled leaf trait data (leaf size and specific leaf area) in a total of 521 woody plant species from 21 forest communities that differed dramatically in species richness, ranging from boreal to tropical rainforests. At each forest, we assessed ITV as an estimate of species niche breadth and we quantified the degree of trait overlap among co-occurring species as a measure of species functional similarity. We found ITV was relatively invariant across the species richness gradient. In addition, we found that species functional similarity increased with diversity. Contrary to the expectation from classic biodiversity theory, our results rather suggest that neutral processes or equalizing mechanisms can be acting as potential drivers shaping community assembly in hyperdiverse forests."
https://openalex.org/W2593373303,"Central carbon metabolism is controlled by modulating the protein abundance profiles of enzymes that maintain the essential systems in living organisms. In this study, metabolic adaptation mechanisms in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated by direct determination of enzyme abundance levels in 30 wild type and mutant strains. We performed a targeted proteome analysis using S. cerevisiae strains that lack genes encoding the enzymes responsible for central carbon metabolism. Our analysis revealed that at least 30% of the observed variations in enzyme abundance levels could be explained by global regulatory mechanisms. A enzyme-enzyme co-abundance analysis revealed that the abundances of enzyme proteins involved in the trehalose metabolism and glycolysis changed in a coordinated manner under the control of the transcription factors for global regulation. The remaining variations were derived from local mechanisms such as a mutant-specific increase in the abundances of remote enzymes. The proteome data also suggested that, although the functional compensation of the deficient enzyme was attained by using more resources for protein biosynthesis, available resources for the biosynthesis of the enzymes responsible for central metabolism were not abundant in S. cerevisiae cells. These results showed that global and local regulation of enzyme abundance levels shape central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae by using a limited resource for protein biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2591640347,"This study compared the effects of adding upper-body sprint-intervals or continuous double poling endurance training to the normal training on maximal upper-body strength and endurance capacity in female cross-country skiers. In total, 17 female skiers (age: 18.1±0.8yr, body mass: 60±7 kg, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max): 3.30±0.37 L.min-1) performed an 8-week training intervention. Here, either two weekly sessions of six to eight 30-s maximal upper-body double poling sprint-intervals (SIG, n = 8) or 45–75 min of continuous low-to-moderate intensity double poling on roller skis (CG, n = 9) were added to their training. Before and after the intervention, the participants were tested for physiological and kinematical responses during submaximal and maximal diagonal and double poling treadmill roller skiing. Additionally, we measured maximal upper-body strength (1RM) and average power at 40% 1RM in a poling-specific strength exercise. SIG improved absolute VO2max in diagonal skiing more than CG (8% vs 2%, p<0.05), and showed a tendency towards higher body-mass normalized VO2max (7% vs 2%, p = 0.07). Both groups had an overall improvement in double poling peak oxygen uptake (10% vs 6% for SIG and CG) (both p<0.01), but no group-difference was observed. SIG improved 1RM strength more than CG (18% vs 10%, p<0.05), while there was a tendency for difference in average power at 40% 1RM (20% vs 14%, p = 0.06). Oxygen cost and kinematics (cycle length and rate) in double poling and diagonal remained unchanged in both groups. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that adding upper-body sprint-interval training is more effective than continuous endurance training in improving upper-body maximal strength and VO2max."
https://openalex.org/W2592229353,"Salmonids (e.g. Atlantic salmon, Pacific salmon, and trouts) have a long legacy of genome duplication. In addition to three ancient genome duplications that all teleosts are thought to share, salmonids have had one additional genome duplication. We explored a methodology for untangling these duplications from each other to better understand them in Atlantic salmon. In this methodology, homeologous regions (paralogous/duplicated genomic regions originating from a whole genome duplication) from the most recent genome duplication were assumed to have duplicated genes at greater density and have greater sequence similarity. This assumption was used to differentiate duplicated gene pairs in Atlantic salmon that are either from the most recent genome duplication or from earlier duplications. From a comparison with multiple vertebrate species, it is clear that Atlantic salmon have retained more duplicated genes from ancient genome duplications than other vertebrates--often at higher density in the genome and containing fewer synonymous mutations. It may be that polysomic inheritance is the mechanism responsible for maintaining ancient gene duplicates in salmonids. Polysomic inheritance (when multiple chromosomes pair during meiosis) is thought to be relatively common in salmonids compared to other vertebrate species. These findings illuminate how genome duplications may not only increase the number of duplicated genes, but may also be involved in the maintenance of them from previous genome duplications as well."
https://openalex.org/W2592901505,"Hypercholesterolemia is a marker for several adult chronic diseases. Recently we demonstrated that sub/infertility is also associated to Hypercholesterolemia in rabbits. Seminal alterations included: abnormal sperm morphology, decreased sperm number and declined percentage of motile sperm, among others. In this work, our objective was to evaluate the effects of hypercholesterolemia on testicular efficiency and spermiogenesis, as the latter are directly related to sperm number and morphology respectively. Tubular efficiency was determined by comparing total number of spermatogenic cells with each cell type within the proliferation/differentiation compartments. We found lower testicular efficiency related to both a decrease in spermatogonial cells and an increase in germ cell apoptosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. On the other hand, spermiogenesis–the last step of spermatogenesis involved in sperm shaping–was detaily analyzed, particularly the acrosome-nucleus-manchette complex. The manchette is a microtubular-based temporary structure responsible in sperm cell elongation. We analyzed the contribution of actin filaments and raft microdomains in the arrangement of the manchette. Under fluorescence microscopy, spermatocyte to sperm cell development was followed in cells isolated from V to VIII tubular stages. In cells from hypercholesterolemic rabbits, abnormal development of acrosome, nucleus and inaccurate tail implantation were associated with actin–alpha-tubulin–GM1 sphingolipid altered distribution. Morphological alterations were also observed at electron microscopy. We demonstrated for the first time that GM1-enriched microdomains together with actin filaments and microtubules are involved in allowing the correct anchoring of the manchette complex. In conclusion, cholesterol enriched diets promote male fertility alterations by affecting critical steps in sperm development: spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. It was also demonstrated that hypercholesterolemic rabbit model is a useful tool to study serum cholesterol increment linked to sub/infertility."

We have previously established that despite the apparent surface uniformity and conserved fold of SH3 domains, they display different binding mechanisms and affinities for their interaction with the PRR of Itch. Here, we attempt to determine the molecular bases underlying the wide range of binding properties of the Itch PRR. Using pulldown assays combined with mass spectrometry analysis, we show that the Itch PRR preferentially forms complexes with endophilins, amphyphisins, and pacsins but can also target a variety of other SH3 domain-containing proteins. In addition, we map the binding sites of these proteins using a combination of PRR sub-sequences and mutants. We find that different SH3 domains target distinct proline-rich sequences overlapping significantly. We also structurally analyze these protein complexes using crystallography and molecular modeling.

To ubiquitylate their substrates, CWH ligases must first establish a direct contact with them. This is done via the interaction of their WW domains with short PPXY motifs present in the substrate (3.Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M.

Despite the functional characterization of interactions involving the Itch PRR and several SH3 domain-containing proteins, very little is known about the selectivity and strength of these interactions. The conserved fold of SH3 domains generally exposes key aromatic residues and a proline on the surface, which form hydrophobic pockets required for interactions with the core PXXP sequence (Fig. 1). An additional specificity pocket, defined by negatively charged residues in the RT loop of the SH3 domain, completes the binding motif by forming interactions with a positively charged residue outside the proline core. The relative position of this positively charged residue defines the orientation of the typical class I (+XXPXXP) and class II (PXXPX+) ligands. Itch PRR consists of a compact succession of three class II binding motifs and one class I binding motif that are partially overlapping (8.Desrochers G. Lussier-Price M. Omichinski J.G. Angers A. Multiple src homology 3 binding to the ubiquitin ligase itch conserved proline-rich region.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies showed that the Itch PRR forms classical complexes with a 1:1 protein ratio with several SH3 domain-containing proteins. In the same set of experiments, it was shown that the Itch PRR can also interact simultaneously with two SH3 domains either from two different molecules in the case of β-PIX (8.Desrochers G.

Desrochers, M. Lussier-Price, J. G. Omichinski, and A. Angers, unpublished observations. Thus, the PRR of Itch is employing at least two different mechanisms of binding with distinct stoichiometries to recognize SH3 domains. Although the overall structure and amino acid composition of SH3 domains are highly conserved, subtle variations can lead to drastic changes in their binding properties (11.Kelil A. Levy E.D. Michnick S.W. Evolution of domain-peptide interactions to coadapt specificity and affinity to functional diversity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: E3862-E3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also demonstrated that the affinity of the Itch PRR toward SH3 domains varies greatly and that it has a clear preference for endophilin. Interestingly, the dissociation constant reported for the endophilin·Itch complex places it among the strongest SH3-PRR affinities reported to date. However, the specific residues and the molecular basis of Itch PRR targeting these different SH3 domains remain to be elucidated. Here, we map the binding sites on the SH3 domain-containing proteins most frequently found in complex with the Itch PRR and find that they recognize distinct yet overlapping sites within the Itch PRR. We also solve the structure of the simultaneous interaction between Itch PRR and two β-PIX SH3s. This structure was then used as a template for the molecular modeling of SH3-binding interfaces between Itch PRR and other SH3 domain-containing proteins. Together, these results reveal the binding preferences of the Itch PRR toward several of its SH3 domain-containing partners. The Itch PRR contains a variety of potential binding sites for SH3 domains, and it has been shown to interact with several different proteins (7.Baumann C. Lindholm C.K. Rimoldi D. Lévy F.

To further evaluate the capacity of the Itch PRR to interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins, we performed a pulldown assay with GST-fused PRR peptides on rat brain extracts and analyzed the bound proteins using mass spectrometry. All of the SH3 domain-containing proteins that bound to the Itch PRR are compiled in Table 1.

In addition, several peptide fragments from spectrin α, endophilin A1–3, pacsin 1, and amphiphysin I/II were found in the bound fraction. In agreement with its high affinity for the Itch PRR, a vast majority of spectra identified by MS/MS were matched to endophilin A1. Most of the other proteins detected by mass spectrometry were only represented by a limited number of peptide fragments. Nevertheless, among these proteins, we find several previously reported binding partners for Itch PRR as well as newly identified binding proteins including spectrin α, Src, cortactin, LASP1, DBNL, CD2AP, and STAC. Interestingly, all of these potential new partners of Itch are linked to the organization of the cytoskeleton, pointing to a possible new and unexplored role for Itch.Table 1SH3 domain-containing proteins interacting with Itch PRR identified by mass spectrometryIdentityEnsemblTotal spectraUnique peptide%/%aThe amino acid coverage of the protein in this assignment/the coverage corrected for peptide sequences that are unlikely to be observed using normal proteomics methods.MassGST-Itch PRR (residues 249–269), upper gelbData were analyzed with the human genome using the Global Proteome Machine Organization (28).kDa Endophilin A1ENSP000003699815604664/10039.9 Spectrin αENSP00000361824463618/22284.9 Endophilin A2ENSP00000269886451336/5141.5 Endophilin A3ENSP0000039137218610/1439.3 Amphiphysin IIENSP000003652817519/2647.5 Pacsin 1ENSP00000244458225.9/850.9 Endophilin B2ENSP00000361645113.0/543.9 SNX18ENSP00000317332111.8/368.9 v-SrcENSP00000362680111.3/259.8GST-Itch PRR (residues 249–269), lower gelbData were analyzed with the human genome using the Global Proteome Machine Organization (28).

Open table in a new tab To determine the critical motifs within the Itch PRR required for the binding to the different SH3 domain-containing proteins, we constructed a series of overlapping peptides covering the Itch PRR in fusion with GST (Fig. 2A). These fusion proteins were used in pulldown assays with rat brain extracts (Fig. 2B, top) or with extracts from transfected HEK-293T cells (Fig. 2B, bottom) to determine the interaction with endophilin, pacsin, amphiphysin, and β-PIX. In these experiments, the anti-endophilin immunoblots revealed that this protein interacts with the first half of the Itch PRR, which contains two overlapping class II SH3-binding sites (peptide 249–259). endophilin was found to bind peptides minimally containing a RPPRPSR motif (residues 252–258). Removing the first residues of this class II motif (peptide 255–264) greatly impaired binding to endophilin. Interestingly, the class I and the most C-terminal class II motifs alone (peptide 257–266) did not bind to endophilin. In these experiments, the antibody used to detect endophilin recognizes endophilin A1, A2, and A3. Endophilin A1 and A3 have the same molecular mass (40 kDa) and cannot be distinguished. Because endophilin A1 is much more abundant, it is probably responsible for most of the signal observed on the blots. Only endophilin A2 is expressed in HEK-293T cells, and its higher molecular mass (45 kDa) also enables its detection in rat brain extracts. Both endophilin A1 and A2 have the same binding preferences toward GST-Itch PRR constructs. Using a similar pulldown assay, we next evaluated amphiphysin binding to the Itch PRR. The anti-amphiphysin antibody used in these assays recognized both amphiphysin I and II and revealed that amphiphysin II was pulled down more efficiently than amphiphysin I relative to their respective expression levels in rat brain tissues. Despite this difference, both isoforms showed similar binding preferences. Like endophilin, the amphiphysins bind exclusively to sequences encompassing the first half of the Itch PRR containing the two overlapping class II motifs (peptide 249–259). In contrast to endophilin, amphiphysin binding does not tolerate any truncation of these class II motifs because binding was completely lost when peptides were truncated at both the N and C terminus (peptides 255–264) (Fig. 2B). Thus, both motifs were required for the interaction with amphiphysin, whereas a single intact class II motif could partially pull down endophilin. The determination of the pacsin-binding site on the Itch PRR was more difficult to define due to its lower recovery in the pulldown assay (Fig. 2B). When overexpressed in HEK-293T cells, pacsin binding was readily detected, and it displays a binding pattern very similar to endophilin and amphiphysin, because the three proteins bind to constructs containing the first two class II motifs (peptide 249–259) of the Itch PRR (Fig. 2B). Like amphiphysin, pacsin binding was disrupted by truncation of either of the two class II motifs, but it still bound to a peptide containing the second class II motif, indicating that this motif contributes more to the interaction. In contrast, the binding site for β-PIX is more extended than the other proteins tested, because none of the shorter Itch PRR constructs bind efficiently to β-PIX. The immunoblot performed with resin incubated with overexpressed β-PIX indicates that the only significant recovery occurred with the peptide 252–266, suggesting that this SH3 domain recognizes the class I motif and possibly part of the class II motifs flanking it in the Itch PRR (Fig. 2B). This result is consistent with previous experiments and demonstrates that the β-PIX interaction with Itch involves a different binding mode (9.Janz J.M. Sakmar T.P. Min K.C. A novel interaction between atrophin-interacting protein 4 and β-p21-activated kinase-interactive exchange factor is mediated by an SH3 domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28893-28903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the binding preferences of the SH3 domain-containing proteins, we mutated several arginine residues to glutamic acid in the GST-FLAG-fused PRR of Itch (peptide 249–269) and performed pulldown studies with rat brain extracts (Fig. 2C). In agreement with results obtained with the PRR sub-sequences, the mutation analysis indicates that the first three arginine residues contained in the two overlapping class II motifs of the PRR play a key role in the binding to the four SH3 domains tested here. Interestingly, there were differences in the contribution of each of the first three arginines to the binding of the different SH3s. Whereas the R252E mutant abolishes the interaction with all of the SH3 domains tested under our experimental conditions, the R255E mutant retains partial binding toward endophilin A1 and β-PIX and appears to bind pacsin almost as efficiently as the WT sequence. In contrast, Arg-255 was required for the interaction of the Itch PRR with the SH3 domains of amphiphysin and endophilin A2. In turn, the R258E mutation only partially impairs binding of endophilin A1 but completely abolishes the interaction with endophilin A2, pacsin, β-PIX, and amphiphysin I and II. The R265E or R266E mutants, located exclusively within the last class II SH3-binding site, had no significant impact on its interaction with the SH3 domain-containing proteins. However, the combined R265E/R266E mutation slightly impairs binding to endophilin A1 and A2. Taken together, these results indicate that despite the fact that the preferred binding sites of these SH3 domain-containing proteins are overlapping, they target distinct residues within the PRR of Itch. The pulldown experiments shown in Fig. 2B indicate that the SH3 domain of pacsin does not fully recognize the 249–269 peptide, suggesting that residues flanking the PRR contribute to the binding of some SH3 domains to Itch. We have previously reported that pacsin binding to the Itch PRR displayed a binding affinity comparable with that of β-PIX but much lower than that of endophilin. To determine whether residues outside the PRR contributed to the binding, we repeated the ITC experiments with the shorter sequence (peptide 249–269) and compared the binding affinity with that of a longer sequence (peptide 224–276) used previously (8.Desrochers G. Lussier-Price M. Omichinski J.G. Angers A. Multiple src homology 3 binding to the ubiquitin ligase itch conserved proline-rich region.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thermograms for binding to the SH3 domain of endophilin, pacsin, β-PIX, and amphiphysin (Fig. 3A) indicate similar binding affinities for the 249–269 peptide and the longer 224–276 peptide (Fig. 3B). The binding region for the SH3 domains thus lies entirely within the core PRR sequence for endophilin, pacsin, and β-PIX. As reported previously, it was not possible to fit a saturation curve on thermograms obtained with amphiphysin, although significant heat dispersion was observed. We have shown that different SH3 domain-containing proteins target overlapping sequences within the Itch PRR. To further understand the difference in target recognition at the molecular level, we attempted to crystallize complexes formed by the Itch PRR (peptide 249–269) and the SH3 domains of endophilin, amphiphysin, pacsin, or β-PIX, but we only succeeded in obtaining crystals of the Itch PRR and β-PIX SH3 complex. These crystals belong to the P1 space group, diffract to 1.65 Å resolution (Table 2), and contain four copies of the β-PIX SH3 domain and two copies of the Itch PRR in their unit cell (Fig. 4A). The proteins arrange to form two “super-SH3” domains, which are atypical SH3-PRR associations in which a single PRR simultaneously engages two SH3 domains (12.Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Molecular basis of phosphorylation-induced activation of the NADPH oxidase.Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Each of these super-SH3 complexes thus contains two molecules of β-PIX (hereafter referred to as SH3′ and SH3″; Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10) and one Itch PRR. The two super-SH3 domains are very similar to each other, as evidenced by an RMSD of 0.7 Å for 138 matched Cα, and are related to each other by a 2-fold screw axis non-crystallographic symmetry (Fig. 4B). Within each super-SH3, the PRR peptide is sandwiched between two β-PIX SH3 domains that are related to each other by 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry. This super-SH3 arrangement is closely related to the one observed for cortactin in complex with an AMAP1 peptide (13.Hashimoto S. Hirose M. Hashimoto A. Morishige M. Yamada A. Hosaka H. Akagi K.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7036-7041Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that also exhibits a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry between the cortactin SH3 domains (Fig. 5). The super-SH3 arrangement of β-PIX is stabilized by hydrophobic contacts and a rich network of water-mediated bonds contributed by the RT loops of the symmetry-related SH3 domains (Fig. 6, A and B). This water network is stabilized at one end by Arg-258 from the Itch PRR, which also interacts with SH3″ Glu-202 and SH3′ Tyr-237 (Figs. 6 (C and D) and 7).Table 2Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsData collection BeamlineX25, NSLS Wavelength (Å)1.1 Space groupP1 Unit-cell parametersa, b, c (Å)28.85, 43.45, 61.48,α,β,γ (degrees)90.37, 101.01, 105.25 Resolution (Å)30.12–1.55 (1.605–1.55) No. of unique reflections32,525 (4639) Multiplicity1.8 (1.8) Completeness (%)95.7 (93.2) Rmerge0.021 (0.069) I/σ(I)18.2 (6.9)Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)50–1.65 (1.71–1.65) Reflections (total/test)aReflections with F0 > 0.32,519/1390 Rwork/Rfree (%)13.89/16.13 (14.15/18.16) No. of atoms (excluding hydrogens)Protein2321Water383 B factors19.10Protein17.94Water26.11 RMSDsBond lengths (Å)0.004Bond angles (degrees)0.71 RamachandranbMolProbity analysis.Favored (%)98.9Allowed (%)1.1Outliers (%)0 Clashscore2.20a Reflections with F0 > 0.b MolProbity analysis.

The chloroplast genome sequences of L. wilfordii and S. capitata contain 152,320 bp and 150,224 bp, respectively. The gene contents and orders among 12 Caryophyllaceae species are consistent, but several microstructural changes have occurred. Expansion of the inverted repeat (IR) regions at the large single copy (LSC)/IRb and small single copy (SSC)/IR boundaries led to partial or entire gene duplications. Additionally, rearrangements of the LSC region were caused by gene inversions and/or transpositions. The 18 kb inversions, which occurred three times in different lineages of tribe Sileneae, were thought to be facilitated by the intermolecular duplicated sequences. Sequence analyses of the L. wilfordii and S. capitata genomes revealed 39 and 43 repeats, respectively, including forward, palindromic, and reverse repeats.

The As(III) oxidase AioAB is responsible for As(III) oxidation in the periplasm and it is also involved in Sb(III) oxidation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A. In addition, Sb(III) oxidase AnoA and cellular H2O2 are also responsible for Sb(III) oxidation in strain GW4. However, the deletion of aioA increased the Sb(III) oxidation efficiency in strain GW4. In the present study, we found that the cell mobility to Sb(III), ATP and NADH contents and heat release were also increased by Sb(III) and more significantly in the aioA mutant. Proteomics and transcriptional analyses showed that proteins/genes involved in Sb(III) oxidation and resistance, stress responses, carbon metabolism, cell mobility, phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism, and amino acid and nucleotide metabolism were induced by Sb(III) and were more significantly induced in the aioA mutant. The results suggested that Sb(III) oxidation may produce energy. In addition, without periplasmic AioAB, more Sb(III) would enter bacterial cells, however, the cytoplasmic AnoA and the oxidative stress response proteins were significantly up-regulated, which may contribute to the increased Sb(III) oxidation efficiency. Moreover, the carbon metabolism was also activated to generate more energy against Sb(III) stress. The generated energy may be used in Sb transportation, DNA repair, amino acid synthesis, and cell mobility, and may be released in the form of heat."

We used L-selectin cytoplasmic tail peptide pulldown assays combined with high sensitivity liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify novel L-selectin tail-binding proteins. Incubation of the L-selectin tail with cell extracts from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated Raw 264.7 macrophages resulted in the binding of μ1A of the clathrin-coated vesicle AP-1 complex. Furthermore, full-length GST-μ1A and the GST-μ1A C-terminal domain, but not the GST-μ1A N-terminal domain, bind to L-selectin tail peptide, and the intracellular pool of L-selectin colocalizes with AP-1 at the trans-Golgi network. We identified a novel basic protein motif consisting of a cluster of three dibasic residues (356RR357, 359KK360, and 362KK363) in the membrane-proximal domain of the L-selectin tail as well as a doublet of aspartic acid residues (369DD370) in the membrane-distal end of the L-selectin tail involved in μ1A binding. Stimulation of Raw 264.7 macrophages with PMA augmented the amount of μ1A associated with anti-L-selectin immunoprecipitates. However, full-length GST-μ1A did not bind to the phospho-L-selectin tail or phospho-mimetic S364D L-selectin tail. Accordingly, we propose that phosphorylation of μ1A is required for interaction with the L-selectin tail and that L-selectin tail phosphorylation may regulate this interaction in vivo Molecular docking of the L-selectin tail to μ1A was used to identify the μ1A surface domain binding the L-selectin tail and to explain how phosphorylation of the L-selectin tail abrogates μ1A interaction. Our findings indicate that L-selectin is transported constitutively by the AP-1 complex, leading to the formation of a trans-Golgi network reserve pool and that phosphorylation of the L-selectin tail blocks AP-1-dependent retrograde transport of L-selectin."

BP and heart rate (HR) were measured using continuous finger-pulse photoplethysmography, oxyhaemoglobin saturation with an ear-clip sensor, end-tidal CO2 with a gas analyser, and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), pulsatility and resistive indices with Doppler ultrasound. Changes in SAS were recorded with a recently-developed method called near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding.

In this study, we used mice bearing a knock-in sarcomeric mutation, which is exhibited in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), to investigate the influence of HCM over the development of anxiety and depression. We employed behavioral, MRI, and biochemical techniques in young (3-4 mo) and aged adult (7-8 mo) female mice to examine the effects of HCM on the development of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. We focused on females because in both humans and rodents, they experience a 2-fold increase in mood disorder prevalence vs. males. Our results showed that young and aged HCM mice displayed echocardiographic characteristics of the heart disease condition, yet only aged HCM females displayed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Electrocardiographic parameters of sympathetic nervous system activation were increased in aged HCM females vs. controls and correlated with mood disorder-related symptoms. In addition, when compared with controls, aged HCM females exhibited adrenal gland hypertrophy, reduced volume in mood-related brain regions, and reduced hippocampal signaling proteins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its downstream targets vs. controls. In conclusion, prolonged systemic HCM stress can lead to development of mood disorders, possibly through inducing structural and functional brain changes, and thus, mood disorders in patients with heart disease should not be considered solely a psychologic or situational condition.-Dossat, A.

https://openalex.org/W2592003033,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify brain- wide networks that are activated by electrical stimulation of either the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or hippocampal CA3 region. Stimulation of either one of these regions caused significant BOLD responses in common structures, such as the septum and left and right hippocampus, but also in unique structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex region/anterior cingulum region (mPFC/ACC) and striatum, which were only activated during VTA stimulation. Concurrent stimulations of the two structures resulted in no additive BOLD responses but significantly reduced BOLD responses in the mPFC/ACC when compared with sole VTA stimulation. This reduction is caused by costimulation of the hippocampal CA3 region, which was itself not sufficient to modify BOLD signal intensities in the mPFC/ACC. Under this experimental condition, functional connectivity between VTA and mPFC/ACC in terms of neurophysiological interactions was causative, driven by direct electrical stimulation of VTA projecting neurons, the resulting functional connectivity in terms of correlated BOLD time series becoming masked as soon as hippocampal projections concurrently coactivated mPFC neurons. This result warns against misinterpretation of the absence of functional connectivity in fMRI data sets, because strong existing neurophysiological interactions can be obscured by unrelated network activities."
https://openalex.org/W2594911779,"The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) programme was an ambitious attempt to encourage a globalised solution to important but often-overlooked development problems. The programme led to wide-ranging development but it has also been criticised for unrealistic and arbitrary targets. In this paper, we show how country-specific development targets can be set using stochastic, dynamical system models built from historical data. In particular, we show that the MDG target of two-thirds reduction of child mortality from 1990 levels was infeasible for most countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the MDG targets were not ambitious enough for fast-developing countries such as Brazil and China. We suggest that model-based setting of country-specific targets is essential for the success of global development programmes such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This approach should provide clear, quantifiable targets for policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W2593950989,"Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the metabolism of glutathione. Studies suggested that GGT played an important role in the tumor development, progression, invasion and drug resistance and prognosis. The association between GGT and prognosis of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the association of pretherapeutic serum level of GGT with clinical-pathological parameters and survival in patients with NPC.Two hundred and twenty-two patients with NPC were recruited in this study and were stratified into two GGT risk groups (≤ 34.5 U/L, > 34.5 U/L). The association of pretherapeutic serum GGT levels with clinical-pathological parameters was examined. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed.The pretherapeutic serum level of GGT was not associated with gender, age, pathology, T stage, N stage, TNM stage, chemotherapy or radiotherapy in patients with NPC. Patients in the high-risk GGT group had a poorer survival than the low-risk GGT group (3-year overall survival, 74.2% vs. 50.2%, P = 0.001; 3-year progression-free survival, 76.4% vs. 47.1%, P < 0.001; 3-year loco-regional relapse-free survival, 76.4% vs. 51.3%, P < 0.001; 3-year distant metastasis-free survival, 89.5% vs. 66.4%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that patients in the high-risk GGT group had 2.117 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.225 ∼ 3.659, P = 0.007) times the risk of death, 2.836 (95% CI, 1.765 ∼ 4.557, P < 0.001) times the risk of progression, 2.551 (95% CI, 1.573 ∼ 4.138, P < 0.001) times the risk of relapse, and 3.331 (95% CI, 1.676 ∼ 6.622, P < 0.001) times the risk of metastasis compared with those in the low-risk GGT group.The pretherapeutic serum level of GGT might serve as a novel independent prognostic factor for overall-survival, progression-free survival, loco-regional relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival in patients with NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2594606437,"This study introduced the application of high-throughput sequencing techniques to the investigation of microbial diversity in the field of plant quarantine. It examined the microbial diversity of wheat imported into China, and established a bioinformatics database of wheat pathogens based on high-throughput sequencing results. This study analyzed the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of fungi through Illumina Miseq sequencing to investigate the fungal communities of both seeds and sieve-through. A total of 758,129 fungal ITS sequences were obtained from ten samples collected from five batches of wheat imported from the USA. These sequences were classified into 2 different phyla, 15 classes, 33 orders, 41 families, or 78 genera, suggesting a high fungal diversity across samples. Apairwise analysis revealed that the diversity of the fungal community in the sieve-through is significantly higher than those in the seeds. Taxonomic analysis showed that at the class level, Dothideomycetes dominated in the seeds and Sordariomycetes dominated in the sieve-through. In all, this study revealed the fungal community composition in the seeds and sieve-through of the wheat, and identified key differences in the fungal community between the seeds and sieve-through."

The primary endpoint is the rate of adequate bowel reparation for the whole colon. The adequate bowel preparation rate for separate colon segments, the polyp detection rate (PDR), tolerability, acceptability, sleeping quality and compliance were evaluated as secondary endpoints.700 patients were randomized. In per-protocol analysis, patients in group B attained significantly higher successful preparation rate than group A (88.7% vs. 61.2%, p<0.001) and similar with group C (88.7% vs. 85.0%, p = 0.316). The PDR in group B was significantly higher than group A (43.2% vs. 25.7%, p<0.001). Acceptability was much higher in group B and C.10 mg bisacodyl plus 2 L PEG-ELP can significantly improve both bowel preparation quality and PDR in patients with Bristol stool form 1 and 2. Bristol stool form scale may be an easy and efficient guide for tailored bowel preparation before colonoscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2591713151,"During the prenatal period, the number variation of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y accounts for more than 80% of the clinically significant chromosomal abnormalities diagnosed. Rapid tests for prenatal diagnosis of these abnormalities can improve pregnancy management and alleviate parental anxiety. Here, we present a molecular alternative method for detecting common aneuploidies.This method is based on co-amplification of segmental duplications located on two different chromosomes using a single pair of primers. Segmental duplications have a high degree of sequence identity, but have single-nucleotide differences in some regions. These sequence differences can be quantified using melting curve analysis of dual-labeled probes to estimate the relative dosages of different chromosomes. We designed two quadruplex real-time PCR assays to detect aneuploidies of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y.We examined 75 aneuploid DNA samples and 56 unaffected DNA control samples using these two assays and correctly identified all samples. Four cases of unbalanced translocation were also accurately detected. The observed averaged ratio for each chromosomal disorder was similar to the theoretically expected value.Our real-time assay is a robust, rapid, and easy to conduct technique for prenatal diagnosis of common aneuploidies, representing a competitive alternative for use in diagnostic laboratories."

Pro-inflammatory cytokines were also suppressed by rebamapide. In addition, the population of Th17 was decreased, whereas Treg was increased in the spleen of rebamipide-treated ApoE deficient mice. Rebamipide also ameliorated the severity of obese arthritis and has the capability to reduce the development of atherosclerosis by controlling the balance between Th17 and Treg cells. Thus, rebamipide could be a therapeutic agent to improve the progression of inflammation in metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2594011892,"Background Avoiding axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for invasive breast cancers with isolated tumor cells or micrometastatic sentinel node biopsy (SNB) could decrease morbidity with minimal clinical significance. Purpose The aim of this study is to simulate the medico-economic impact of the routine use of the MSKCC non-sentinel node (NSN) prediction nomogram for ER+ HER2- breast cancer patients. Methods We studied 1036 ER+ HER2- breast cancer patients with a metastatic SNB. All had a complementary ALND. For each patient, we calculated the probability of the NSN positivity using the MSKCC nomogram. After validation of this nomogram in the population, we described how the patients’ characteristics spread as the threshold value changed. Then, we performed an economic simulation study to estimate the total cost of caring for patients treated according to the MSKCC predictive nomogram results. Results A 0.3 threshold discriminate the type of sentinel node (SN) metastases: 98.8% of patients with pN0(i+) and 91.6% of patients with pN1(mic) had a MSKCC score under 0.3 (false negative rate = 6.4%). If we use the 0.3 threshold for economic simulation, 43% of ALND could be avoided, reducing the costs of caring by 1 051 980 EUROS among the 1036 patients. Conclusion We demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of using the MSKCC NSN prediction nomogram by avoiding ALND for the pN0(i+) or pN1(mic) ER+ HER2- breast cancer patients with a MSKCC score of less than or equal to 0.3."
https://openalex.org/W4236429665,"Although frequent fluctuations in domestic hog prices seriously affect the stability and robustness of the hog supply chain, hog futures (an effective hedging instrument) have not been listed in China. To better understand hog futures market hedging, it is important to study the steady state of intersubjective bidding. This paper uses evolutionary game theory to construct a game model between hedgers and speculators in the hog futures market, and replicator dynamic equations are then used to obtain the steady state between the two trading entities. The results show that the steady state is one in which hedgers adopt a “buy” strategy and speculators adopt a “do not speculate” strategy, but this type of extreme steady state is not easily realized. Thus, to explore the rational proportion of hedgers and speculators in the evolutionary stabilization strategy, bidding processes were simulated using weekly average hog prices from 2006 to 2015, such that the conditions under which hedgers and speculators achieve a steady state could be analyzed. This task was performed to achieve the stability critical point, and we show that only when the value of λ is satisfied and the conditions of hog futures price changes and futures price are satisfied can hedgers and speculators achieve a rational proportion and a stable hog futures market. This market can thus provide a valuable reference for the development of the Chinese hog futures market and the formulation and guidance of relevant departmental policies."
