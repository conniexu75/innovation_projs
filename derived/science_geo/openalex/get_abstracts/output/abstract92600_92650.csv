https://openalex.org/W4237607955,"Eating very little in the presence of food or failure to serach for food has been documented in various species during the hibernation season, incubation, molting, and defense of the territory or harem. At these times feeding competes with other, more important activities. One way to avoid conflicts between feeding and these other activities to lower the programmed weight or set-point for body fat. Experiments on mammalian hibernators and incubating birds provide evidence that set-points are indeed lowered. Failure to eat in these two examples depends on anorexia, loss of appetite. A review of other examples suggests that conceptualization in terms of lowered set-points provides a unified and testable way of understanding many naturally occurring instances of fasting in the animal kingdom. Finally, spontaneous animal anorexias are contrasted with attempts by people to lose weight."

https://openalex.org/W1540176268,"The hormonal metabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), exerts its biological effects by initially binding to a cytosolic receptor protein. Such a protein has been demonstrated in the target organs of vitamin D3 including bone. Although the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the skeleton has been extensively studied in normal bone, nothing is known about its effects, if any, in abnormal bone growth. Rat osteogenic sarcoma is a useful model for bone malignancy. Tumor cells retain differentiated functions including the ability to form bone and to respond to parathyroid hormone, prostaglandins, and to a smaller extent to calcitonin with increases in cyclic AMP levels. We have here evaluated osteogenic sarcoma cell lines for the presence of a receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3. We have utilized sucrose gradient sedimentation, saturation analysis, and DNA-cellulose chromatography. Cytosol preparations from these cell lines contain a 3.3 S saturable macromolecule which binds 1,25(OH)2D3 with specificity and high affinity (Kd = 2 x 10(-10) M). The sterol-macromolecule complex binds to DNA-cellulose and its elution profile from this affinity resin is similar to that of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor from normal rat bone. These tumor cells should serve as a useful model for studying the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in bone and the role of this metabolite in the biology of bone malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W1548777710,"The transcription efficiencies of four Drosophila tRNAArg genes located in a tRNA gene cluster at region 42A on chromosome 2, and containing identical coding sequences, were studied in Drosophila Kc cell extracts. Transcription is modulated by the 5' flanking sequences; efficient transcription is dependent on the presence of an optimal 5' flanking sequence. One of the genes, p17D Arg, is not transcribed in the homologous extract but does compete with the other genes for transcription factors. Deletion of a specific sequence from the 5' flank of the gene of p17D Arg leads to an increase in transcription efficiency. All tRNAArg genes are efficiently transcribed in extracts from HeLa cells. However, introduction of small amounts of Drosophila extract reduces the efficiency of transcription in HeLa extracts. This is due to incompatibility between transcriptional components of the two extracts."

https://openalex.org/W1680845046,"Fresh human red blood cells become highly labeled with 45Ca2+ when exposed to 0.5 mM vanadate. The effect of vanadate requires its penetration into the cell, and is attributed to the inhibition of the outwardly directed Ca2+-pumping ATPase which would otherwise mask the uptake of 45Ca2+. Since the inhibition of the CA2+ pump by vanadate is not complete, a transmembrane Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange can be detected. The influx leg of the exchange is inhibited by verapamil, quinidine, and Co2+. This, as well as additional (kinetic) evidence, indicates that the influx of Ca2+ is a carrier-mediated process. Experiments in which the transmembrane K+ gradient has been abolished or decreased with ionophores, or by increasing the K+ concentration in the medium, suggest that the K+ gradient may play a role in the influx of Ca2+. The vanadate-induced accumulation of Ca2+ by red cells promotes a massive efflux of K+, indicating the activation of a Ca2+-sensitive K+-channel. The results indicate the occurrence of a slow cycling of Ca2+ across the red cell membrane. The influx leg of the cycle occurs through a verapamil-sensitive channel, and is possibly driven by the discharge of the transmembrane K+ gradient. The efflux leg of the cycle consists of the Ca2+-pumping ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W2026332984,"Anorexia can occur when a specific diet is associated with a developing illness. The studies reported here show that the decline in food intake which accompanies tumor growth is accompanied by the development of aversions to the specific diet consumed during tumor growth. An immediate elevation in food consumption occurred when a novel diet was introduced. Therefore, the development of learned aversions to the specific diet eaten during tumor growth may be a causal factor in the development of tumor anorexia."
https://openalex.org/W1549732049,"Administration of either all-trans-[3H]- or 13-cis-[3H]retinoic acid to hamsters fed a normal diet results in the formation of a number of polar metabolites. At least one of these metabolites has been shown to be common to both isomers of retinoic acid and can be generated in a hamster liver 10,000 X g supernatant system using 13-cis-retinoic acid as substrate. It has been identified as 13-cis-4-oxoretinoic acid by mass spectral, ultraviolet absorption, and proton NMR characteristics, as well as by its co-migration with synthetic 13-cis-4-oxoretinoic acid in two different high pressure liquid chromatographic systems. In addition, its metabolic precursor, 13-cis-4-hydroxyretinoic acid, has been tentatively identified. These compounds are believed to be early metabolites in the elimination pathway of retinoic acid from the body."

One clone contains the entire preproinsulin coding region, as well as the 3' untranslated region of the messenger RNA and eight nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region. Additional sequence information for the 5' untranslated region was obtained with the use of insulinoma messenger RNA in conjunction with specific primers from the cloned DNA for enzymatic chain termination sequence analysis. The results confirm the amino acid sequence of human proinsulin previously determined, and predict the amino acid sequence of the human preproinsulin signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2152961628,"The kinetics of epiphyseal cartilage membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase activity was studied at physiological pH using p-nitrophenylphosphate and pyrophosphate (PPi) as substrates. The effect of three general types of alkaline phosphatase inhibitors was studied on both purified and membrane-bound forms of the enzyme: 1) uncompetitive inhibitors (L-tetramisole and theophylline), 2) competitive inhibitors (phosphate, arsenate, and vanadate), and 3) metal ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+). These studies were aimed at elucidating the physiological role of epiphyseal cartilage membrane alkaline phosphatase. Hydrolytic activity of enzyme at pH 7.5 toward both PPi and p-nitrophenylphosphate was only one-tenth and one-hundredth, respectively, of that observed at optimal pH. Arsenate (Ki - 1.0-2.7 microM) and vanadate (Ki = 0.7-1.3 microM) were powerful inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase; phosphate (Ki = 20-50 microM) was inhibitory at levels two orders of magnitude below the concentration in cartilage extracellular fluid. Neither Zn2+, Ca2+, or Mg2+ was inhibitory toward p-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis, whereas all three competitively inhibited PPi hydrolysis. The data suggest that formation of poorly hydrolyzable Ca.PPi, Mg2.PPi, and Zn2.PPi complexes was responsible. Inhibition of PPi hydrolysis by Ca2+ occurred at levels within the physiological range. The close similarity in inhibition of both the purified and membrane-bound forms of alkaline phosphatase at pH 7.5 indicates that interaction with the membrane does not significantly alter conformation at the active site. The data obtained suggest that under physiological conditions, cartilage membrane alkaline phosphatase would be essentially inactive as a phosphohydrolase due to its intrinsically weak activity at pH 7.5 and the strong inhibitory effect of physiological levels of phosphate and Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1491564174,"The molecular architecture of the cobra venom factor (CVF)-dependent C3/C5 convertase (EC 3.4.21.47) of human complement was deduced from electron microscopy of the purified bimolecular complex (CVF,Bb) and its isolated subunits, CVF and Bb. Negatively stained CVF imaged as an irregularly shaped cylindrical structure, with approximate dimensions of 137 A x 82 A (length x diameter). The zymogen Factor B appeared globular with a diameter of about 80 A and its image suggested a bipartite structure of two compact, closely associated regions, one about twice as large as the other. Bb, the larger, catalytic site-bearing cleavage fragment of Factor B, revealed two globular domains, each 40 A in diameter, connected by a short linker region about 10 A long and thick. CVF and Bb could be distinguished in micrographs of the CVF,Bb complex: Bb attached to one end of the CVF molecule through only one of its two domains, and in an orientation making the long axes of both molecules approximately orthogonal. It is suggested the naturally occurring C3 convertases (C3b,Bb and C4b,2a) have a similar morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1514363579,"We have determined several kinetic parameters for the reaction of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes with the near-cognate ternary complex of leucyl-tRNA2, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and GTP. From single-turnover experiments at 5 degrees C with the ribosomes present in excess we find that the apparent second order rate constant for GTP hydrolysis is 0.4 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, that the cleavage step is faster than 4 s-1 and that the apparent rate constant for peptide formation is 6 +/- 3 s-1. From multiple-turnover experiments at 5 degrees C, with the ternary complex present in excess we find that kcat for GTP hydrolysis is 0.4 s-1 and Km is 1.6 microM. For both kinds of experiment the ratio of peptide formed to GTP hydrolyzed is 0.05 +/- 0.2. Comparison of these results with those obtained with the cognate complex show that the ribosome distinguishes between the cognate and near-cognate complexes, not on the basis of the forward rate constants, but on the basis of the reverse and rejection rate constants, which differ for the two complexes by at least 4000- and 100-fold, respectively. Both in ternary complex selection and in proofreading, the frequency of errors observed is much higher than might be expected from these large differences in rate constant. The reason is that, even for the near-cognate species, the rates of ternary complex rejection and aminoacyl-tRNA rejection are not overwhelmingly greater than the forward rate constants for GTP hydrolysis and peptidyl-tRNA formation, respectively. The outcome of these reactions is, therefore, at least partially under kinetic rather than thermodynamic control, leading to the trapping of errors which would not be made in a slow process."
https://openalex.org/W1991464937,"Clonal lines of Rauscher erythroleukemia cells exhibited selective responses to two inducers of differentiation, erythropoietin and dimethyl sulfoxide. There were substantial quantitiative differences between clones that reponded to both inducers. Several clones differentiated only in response to erythropoietin. Erythropoietin stimulated cell proliferation and differentiation whereas dimethyl sulfoxide inhibited proliferation, suggesting dissimilar modes of action."
https://openalex.org/W1598288664,"The nucleotide sequence of the gene for spinach chloroplast tRNAIle1 has been determined. The gene is found in two copies located in the inverted repeat regions of spinach chloroplast DNA, but not within the ribosomal RNA spacer. Both copies of the tRNAIle1 gene have been sequenced and found to be identical. A very unusual characteristic of the tRNAIle1 gene is that the anticodon is CAT which is a methionine anticodon. In the tRNA the C residue in the anticodon is subsequently modified, presumably to prevent misreading of the genetic code. The spinach chloroplast tRNAIle1 gene is colinear with its RNA sequence and does not contain an intervening sequence as has been reported for maize chloroplast tRNAIle2 (Koch, W., Edwards, K., and Kossel, H. (1981) Cell 25, 203-213). The tRNAIle1 gene does not code for the 3'-terminal CCA end, nor do any other tRNA genes appear to be contiguous with this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1554428092,"Total glycopeptides from human K-562 cells, labeled metabolically with [3H]glucosamine or [3H]mannose, were prepared by extracting the cells with organic solvents to remove lipids and by digesting the residue with pronase. 3H-labeled glycopeptides were fractionated on Sephadex G-50 revealing a high molecular weight fraction (Mr = 7,000 to 11,000), comprising approximately 10% of the [3H]glucosamine and 25% of the [3H]mannose label. Digestion of this glycopeptide fraction with endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii, specific for a repeating structure of Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3), results in the following four products as resolved by Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration: 1) a disaccharide with the structure beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucosyl leads to beta-galactose; 2) a trisaccharide with the structure beta-galactosyl leads to beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucosyl leads to beta-galactose; 3) a tetrasaccharide with the sequence alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl leads to beta-galactosyl leads to beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucosyl leads to beta-galactose; and 4) a larger, complex fragment which contains mannose and beta-2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucose and which is probably the protein linkage region. In addition, visualization of radiolabeled glycoproteins by fluorography on polyacrylamide gels revealed a 105,000-dalton Band 3-like glycoprotein and other bands that were sensitive to endo-beta-galactosidase. These results indicate that the K-562 cell line bears a glycopeptide, erythroglycan, which has been found on erythrocytes, and that this polymer is expressed mainly in the fetal form as a linear chain."

https://openalex.org/W1576577087,"The reactivity and specificity of a series of substituted benzenesulfonyl fluorides with human leukocyte (HL) elastase, cathepsin G, porcine pancreatic (PP) elastase, and bovine chymotrypsin A alpha are reported. Benzenesulfonyl fluorides with 2-fluoroacyl substituents were found to be potent and specific inhibitors of elastase. HL elastase was inhibited most rapidly by 2--(CF3CF2CONH)--C6H4SO4F (kobs/[I] = 1700 M-1 s-1) which is slightly better than our best peptide chloromethyl ketone inhibitor of this enzyme. PP elastase was most rapidly inhibited by 2--(CF3CONH)--C6H4-SO2F (kobs/[I] = 2300 M-1S-1). The 2--(CF3CF2CF2CONH) and 2--(CF3SNH) derivatives were quite selective for HL elastase and inhibited PP elastase, cathepsin G, and chymotrypsin A alpha quite slowly. A specific and potent chymotrypsin inhibitor (2--(Z--Gly--NH)--C6H4SO2F) was also discovered. A model for the elastase inhibition reaction is proposed which involves interaction of the fluroacyl group of the inhibitor with the primary substrate recognition site S1 of the enzyme. Hydrogen bonding also occurs between the inhibitor NH and a backbone peptide carbonyl group, probably from residue 214. The 2-fluoroacyl group plays the dual role of binding in the hydrophobic S1 pocket and through electronic effects, increasing the strength f the hydrogen bond. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to construct simple organic molecules which are specific inhibitors of HL elastase, PP elastase, or chymotrypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1529241799,"The nucleotide sequences of the major tRNAAsp from rat liver and a minor tRNAAsp present specifically in rat ascites hepatoma were determined by combined use of several postlabeling procedures. The sequence of rat liver tRNAAsp was determined to be pU-C-C-U-C-G-U-U-A-G-U-A-phi-A-G-U-G-G-D-G-A-G-U-A-U-C-C-C-C-G-C-U-C-manQ-U-C-A -m5C-G-C-G-G-G-A-G-A-m5C-m5C-G-G-G-G-T-phi-C-G-A-U-U-C-C-C-C-G-A-C-G-G-G-G-A-G- C-C-AOH. The nucleotide sequence of rat ascites hepatoma TRNAAsp was found to be the same as that of rat liver tRNAAsp, except that mannose-attached queuosine (manQ) present in the wobbling position of rat liver tRNAAsp was replaced by normal guanosine in rat ascites hepatoma tRNAAsp. The other modified nucleosides in the two tRNAAsp species were the same. Thus it was concluded that the new isoacceptor species of tRNAAsp that appears in the tumor tissue is due to hypomodification with respect to Q in the posttranscriptional process. The most notable feature on the sequence of the mammalian tRNAAsp is that cytidine is present in the position next to the 5'-end of the anticodon, because the only known tRNAs having cytidine in this position are cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs from multicellular eukaryotic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W52142451,"We studied the effect of ions on the ability of purified human urinary kallikrein to cleave its natural substrate (kininogen) as well as two synthetic substrates, tosylarginine [3H]methyl ester and Pro-Phe-Arg-[3H]benzylamide. The kininogenase activity of kallikrein is markedly dependent upon the concentration of cations in vitro. Kininogenase activity is very low when measured in a low electrolyte buffer. The addition of cations to the reaction mixture increases activity by up to 27-fold. Maximum activity is achieved with 100 mM sodium, 100 mM potassium, or 20 mM magnesium. The activity is stable at higher concentrations of cation. Renal kallikrein is believed to act within distal tubular fluid in vivo. The concentration of cations in this fluid varies widely in response to alterations in salt and water metabolism. Thus, the relationship of kininogenase activity to the concentration of cations demonstrated in vitro may be relevant to the activity of kallikrein at its presumed site of action in the kidney. In separate experiments, we evaluated the effect of ions on the amidase and esterase activities of kallikrein which are the basis of several assays in routine use for physiological studies. In contrast to their stimulatory effect on kininogenase activity, cations inhibit amidase and to a lesser extent esterase activity. Additional studies indicate that urinary cations probably account entirely for the well known ability of normal urine to inhibit the amidase and esterase activities of kallikrein."

This factor, designated Co-eIF2 beta, is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of approximately 83,000. Wheat germ eIF-2 forms a stable binary complex with GDP but not with GTP.

https://openalex.org/W1515037565,"To characterize further the active site of human placental estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.62), we have synthesized 2-bromoacetamidoestrone methyl ether. The affinity-labeling steroid is a substrate for the homogeneous enzyme. It inactivates the enzyme in a time-dependent, irreversible manner which follows pseudo-first order kinetics. Further, inactivation conducted with varying steroid concentration displays saturation kinetics. When 1.7 x 10(-6) M enzyme is inactivated by 2.6 x 10(-4) M 2-bromoacetamidoestrone methyl ether, the presence of an equimolar concentration of estradiol or 5.2 x 10(-4) M concentrations of NAD+, NADP+, or NADPH markedly slow the rate of inactivation. Bromoacetate (2.6 x 10(-4) M) does not inactivate the enzyme. After inactivation with 2-bromo[2'-14C]acetamidoestrone methyl ether, amino acid analysis reveals carboxymethylated derivatives of cysteine, histidine, and lysine containing 65, 25, and 8%, respectively, of the total incorporated carboxymethyl groups. The presence of estradiol, NADP+, or NADPH clearly inhibits alkylation of cysteinyl and histidyl residues and slows the rate of enzyme inactivation. Protection of these residues by both estradiol and NADPH suggests that they may actually be in the cofactor region of the active site, that this region is close to the steroid A-ring, and that binding of cofactor, by physical interposition, denies the reagent-bearing steroid access to these residues."

Cells of line 745 produced approximately 35 percent beta minor after induction, and 39 clones of line 745 produced from 23 to 61 percent beta minor. Further subcloning of the clone that produced 61 percent beta minor led to three subclones, all of which produced more than 90 percent beta minor.

Inhibition of protein synthesis by either HCR or dsI is associated with a marked increase in the steady state level of 48 S initiation complexes, containing a 40 S ribosomal subunit, globin mRNA, and a reduced level of Met-tRNAf, suggesting that the rate of 60 S subunit addition may be inhibited and that subunit-bound Met-tRNAf may become deacylated by Met-tRNAf deacylase. The addition of highly purified Met-tRNAf deacylase to lysate samples incubated with HCR or dsI reduces the [35S]Met-tRNAf labeling of 48 S complexes to even a lower level but has no effect on the high level of [35S]Met-tRNAf associated with 43 S complexes in the plus hemin control. The effect of added deacylase on the labeling of 48 S complexes with [35S]Met-tRNAf can be overcome by adding eIF-5 or a soluble reticulocyte protein that has been termed the reversing factor, but not by the addition of eIF-2. Added deacylase has no effect on the level of mRNA in 48 S complexes or the labeling of these complexes with [35S]fMet-tRNAf. When lysate samples were labeled with Met-tRNAf, purified from wheat germ or yeast, and doubly labeled with 32P at the 5' end and [35S]methionine aminoacylation, HCR reduced the level of 32P and 35S-labeled tRNAMetf in 48 S complexes to a similar degree, suggesting that once it has become deacylated, tRNAMetf dissociates from the 40 S subunit."

The factor, referred to as D2d, is stable to heating for 5 min at 75 degrees C and loses less than 15% of its activity upon a similar treatment at 90 degrees C. In contrast, all other wheat germ protein synthesis factors are inactivated by heating for 5 min at 65 degrees C. Formation of 80 S ribosome . Met-tRNAiMet complexes from 40 S ribosome . Met-tRNAiMet complexes, as measured by the binding of [3H]Met-tRNAiMet, is almost completely dependent upon the presence of component D2d. The shift in sedimentation of the ribosome subunits to the 80 S ribosome region, however, occurs in the absence of factor D2d. Thus, the role of the factor is not to join the ribosomal subunits, but rather to keep the Met-tRNAiMet bound to the ribosome. The formation of 40 S ribosome . Met-tRNAiMet complexes is increased 2-fold by the presence of factor D2d. Fixing this complex with glutaraldehyde results in the binding of more Met-tRNAIMet than a nonfixed incubation in the presence of D2d. These results suggest that the primary interaction with the ribosomal subunit can occur in the absence of factor D2d, but that the presence of the factor stabilizes the ribosome-bound Met-tRNAiMet."

Molecular probes specific for each of the two FV components were generated and hybridized to RNA extracted from clones differing with respect to virus production or viral envelope antigen expression. Sequences representing the defective component of FV continued to be transcribed in cells regardless of virus production. The presence of helper virus-specific sequences, however, was shown to be directly related to virus expression. Molecular hybridization with cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA extracted from the H-2 congenic clones representing various stages of viral expression demonstrated a direct correlation between the level of transcription of FMuLV-specific sequences and the degree of virus expression. These data suggest that regulation of FV expression is primarily related to the cessation of helper virus transcription in the cell lines studied. In this paper we provide further evidence that the defective viral components is responsible for the rapid malignancy associated with Friend disease."

https://openalex.org/W1537759326,"A putative eukaryotic initiation factor purified from rat liver cytosol promotes the ApUpGp- and Mg2+-dependent, GTP-independent binding of initiator Met-tRNAf to ribosomal 40 S subunits. The isotopically-labeled factor binds specifically to 40 S subunits to form a binary complex which can then bind Met-tRNAf in the presence of ApUpGp. When 60 S subunits are added, an 80 S complex is formed which contains Met-tRNAf but not the factor. The Met-tRNAf bound to 80 S ribosomes reacts quantitatively with puromycin. Purified 40 S subunits exist in the form of monomers and dimers. The factor converts monomers, which appear to contain one molecule of tRNA, to a form that does not contain tRNA and dimerizes readily. Deacylated tRNA inhibits dimerization and, in the presence of the factor, converts dimers to the monomeric form; thus, the factor appears to act in a reversible manner. This protein factor may play a role in the removal of tRNA from 40 S subunits, which could be generated as a consequence of chain termination, a prerequisite to the bindig of Met-tRNAf."
