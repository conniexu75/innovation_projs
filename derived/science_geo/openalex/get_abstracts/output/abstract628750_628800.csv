They are also under extreme pressure, with many stocks overfished and poorly managed. Climate change will add to the burden fish stocks bear, but such impacts remain largely unknown. Free et al. used temperature-specific models and hindcasting across fish stocks to determine the degree to which warming has, and will, affect fish species (see the Perspective by Plagányi). They found that an overall reduction in yield has occurred over the past 80 years. Furthermore, although some species are predicted to respond positively to warming waters, the majority will experience a negative impact on growth. As our world warms, responsible and active management of fisheries harvests will become even more important. Science , this issue p. 979 ; see also p. 930"

The traditional strategy for doing this is through hours of high-temperature cycling to form precipitates in the alloy. Sun et al. developed a processing method that relies on mechanical cycling by pushing and pulling on the alloys at room temperature. This quickly creates many very fine precipitates that have the same strengthening effect as those characteristic of traditional thermal methods. This method should also work for other alloy systems.

Here, we describe a secondary pathway of lipid release from adipocytes that is independent of canonical lipolysis. We found that adipocytes release exosome-sized, lipid-filled vesicles (AdExos) that become a source of lipid for local macrophages. Adipose tissue from lean mice released ~1% of its lipid content per day via exosomes ex vivo, a rate that more than doubles in obese animals. AdExos and associated factors were sufficient to induce in vitro differentiation of bone marrow precursors into adipose tissue macrophage-like cells. Thus, AdExos are both an alternative pathway of local lipid release and a mechanism by which parenchymal cells can modulate tissue macrophage differentiation and function."

Here we report a qualitative breach of this classical behavior in electron systems with high viscosity. The viscous fluid in graphene is found to respond to non-quantizing magnetic fields by producing an electric field opposite to that generated by the classical Hall effect. The viscous contribution is large and identified by studying local voltages that arise in the vicinity of current-injecting contacts. We analyze the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extract the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiment. Good agreement with theory suggests further opportunities for studying electron magnetohydrodynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2915880198,"Episodic memory retrieval relies on the recovery of neural representations of waking experience. This process is thought to involve a communication dynamic between the medial temporal lobe memory system and the neocortex. How this occurs is largely unknown, however, especially as it pertains to awake human memory retrieval. Using intracranial electroencephalographic recordings, we found that ripple oscillations were dynamically coupled between the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) and temporal association cortex. Coupled ripples were more pronounced during successful verbal memory retrieval and recover the cortical neural representations of remembered items. Together, these data provide direct evidence that coupled ripples between the MTL and association cortex may underlie successful memory retrieval in the human brain."

Although some isotope proxies have suggested a roughly equivalent height for the plateau as far back as the Eocene (∼40 million years ago), other lines of evidence suggest a lower elevation in the distant past. Botsyun et al. used a model to show that several previously overlooked factors contribute to the isotopic record from the Eocene (see the Perspective by van Hinsbergen and Boschman). The results harmonize the isotopic record with other proxies and argue for a Tibetan Plateau that was about 1000 meters lower than it is today. Science , this issue p. eaaq1436 ; see also p. 928"
https://openalex.org/W2917450758,"The flyby of Pluto and Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft provided high-resolution images of cratered surfaces embedded in the Kuiper belt, an extensive region of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters less than approximately 13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (less than 1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely greater than 4 billion years old, thus their crater records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System."

It is thought that only fixed, behaviorally relevant patterns can be reactivated, which are stored across hippocampal synaptic connections. To test whether some generalized rules govern reactivation, we examined trajectory reactivation following non-stereotypical exploration of familiar open-field environments. We found that random trajectories of varying lengths and timescales were reactivated, resembling that of Brownian motion of particles. The animals’ behavioral trajectory did not follow Brownian diffusion demonstrating that the exact behavioral experience is not reactivated. Therefore, hippocampal circuits are able to generate random trajectories of any recently active map by following diffusion dynamics. This ability of hippocampal circuits to generate representations of all behavioral outcome combinations, experienced or not, may underlie a wide variety of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as learning, generalization, and planning.

This ability of hippocampal circuits to generate representations of all behavioral outcome combinations, experienced or not, may underlie a wide variety of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions such as learning, generalization, and planning. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in navigation and episodic memory by forming a cognitive map of space, encoded by the spatially selective activity of place cells (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O’Keefe J. Dostrovsky J. The hippocampus as a spatial map. Preliminary evidence from unit activity in the freely-moving rat.Brain Res. 1971; 34: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (3810) Google Scholar, O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978O’Keefe J. Nadel L. Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarindon, 1978Google Scholar). At any given moment, the combined activity of place cells provides a signal that encodes the instantaneous location of the animal, while the sequential firing of these cells can represent entire movement paths through space (O’Keefe and Recce, 1993O’Keefe J. Recce M.L. Phase relationship between hippocampal place units and the EEG theta rhythm.Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar, Skaggs et al., 1996Skaggs W.E.

Theta phase precession in hippocampal neuronal populations and the compression of temporal sequences.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 149-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Such neural representations of behavior likely underpin the spatial component for memories of places and events, that, when reinstated, can be used for navigation in previously explored environments. Consistent with this notion, firing sequences that encode behavioral trajectories during exploration can be subsequently replayed by the network. This takes the form of place cell representations of movement paths that can last several seconds or more, compressed into brief bursts of activity, lasting tens to hundreds of milliseconds (Lee and Wilson, 2002Lee A.K. Wilson M.A. Memory of sequential experience in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). This replay occurs in a variety of behavioral and network states, which may reflect different underlying mechanisms and cognitive functions (Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J. Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, O’Neill et al., 2010O’Neill J.

Play it again: reactivation of waking experience and memory.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 220-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The replay of temporally compressed firing sequences of neurons was first described during transient network synchronization epochs associated with sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in sleep (Lee and Wilson, 2002Lee A.K. Wilson M.A. Memory of sequential experience in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). However, subsequently, it has been shown that similar phenomena can also occur during exploration simultaneously with theta oscillations (Feng et al., 2015Feng T. Silva D. Foster D.J.

Colgin L.L. Spatial sequence coding differs during slow and fast gamma rhythms in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 89: 398-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, not only have 200 Hz ripple-band oscillations been seen during compressed trajectory replay, but simultaneously occurring slower gamma-beta (20–80 Hz) band oscillatory components have been seen as well. The power of the slower oscillatory components of SWRs predicted the fidelity of replay with different oscillatory cycles separating trajectory segments with a discontinuous trajectory jump (Carr et al., 2012Carr M.F.

While replay has been associated with a number of mnemonic processes, including consolidation in sleep, goal-directed navigation, and decision making at maze choice points (Ólafsdóttir et al., 2018Ólafsdóttir H.F. Bush D. Barry C. The role of hippocampal replay in memory and planning.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: R37-R50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying its generation remain controversial. Competing lines of evidence suggest that sequence firing in replay is generated from either experience-dependent mechanisms or, alternatively, reflects hardwired predetermined assemblies (Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011Dragoi G. Tonegawa S. Preplay of future place cell sequences by hippocampal cellular assemblies.Nature. 2011; 469: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, Grosmark and Buzsáki, 2016Grosmark A.D.

Modeling the spontaneous reactivation of experience-specific hippocampal cell assembles during sleep.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Silva et al., 2015Silva D. Feng T. Foster D.J. Trajectory events across hippocampal place cells require previous experience.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the one hand, both the stability of novel spatial maps (Kentros et al., 1998Kentros C. Hargreaves E. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Shapiro M. Muller R.V. Abolition of long-term stability of new hippocampal place cell maps by NMDA receptor blockade.Science. 1998; 280: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and the accurate replay of novel linear tracks during sleep (Silva et al., 2015Silva D. Feng T. Foster D.J. Trajectory events across hippocampal place cells require previous experience.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) require NMDA receptors. This suggests that the associations between spatial cell assemblies during behavior are formed through synaptic plasticity. Consistent with this idea, sequences expressed on novel linear tracks during theta oscillations only emerge after the first lap (Feng et al., 2015Feng T. Silva D. Foster D.J. Dissociation between the experience-dependent development of hippocampal theta sequences and single-trial phase precession.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 4890-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicating that they are generated through activity-dependent mechanisms. However, novel spatial maps and their reactivated trajectories may in part use hardwired circuit connections, which are then refined with the animals’ experience (Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011Dragoi G. Tonegawa S. Preplay of future place cell sequences by hippocampal cellular assemblies.Nature. 2011; 469: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, Shen and McNaughton, 1996Shen B. McNaughton B.L. Modeling the spontaneous reactivation of experience-specific hippocampal cell assembles during sleep.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that firing patterns resembling that of novel paths can also be seen in sleep prior to the animal experiencing that path, termed preplay (Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011Dragoi G. Tonegawa S. Preplay of future place cell sequences by hippocampal cellular assemblies.Nature. 2011; 469: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, Grosmark and Buzsáki, 2016Grosmark A.D.

Barry C. Saleem A.B. Hassabis D. Spiers H.J. Hippocampal place cells construct reward related sequences through unexplored space.eLife. 2015; 4: e06063Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear to what degree preplay patterns are refined as a result of exploration to provide a more accurate replay in sleep after the experience (Silva et al., 2015Silva D. Feng T. Foster D.J. Trajectory events across hippocampal place cells require previous experience.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several reports describe replay that is not simply a product of experience, particularly replay seen during exploration (Gupta et al., 2010Gupta A.S. van der Meer M.A.A. Touretzky D.S. Redish A.D. Hippocampal replay is not a simple function of experience.Neuron. 2010; 65: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Wu and Foster, 2014Wu X. Foster D.J. Hippocampal replay captures the unique topological structure of a novel environment.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 6459-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During exploration, the reactivation seen in transient SWR-associated network bursts tends to occur when animals stop briefly (Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F. Wilson M.A. Hippocampal replay of extended experience.Neuron. 2009; 63: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J. Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). These trajectories tend to originate from the animals’ current position and point toward future goal locations, even in open two-dimensional (2D) environments where a fixed goal is to be reached (Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D.J. Hippocampal place-cell sequences depict future paths to remembered goals.Nature. 2013; 497: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, during replay in more complex maze environments, maze segment combinations that the animal never took before may reactivate together in the form of a novel combined trajectory (Gupta et al., 2010Gupta A.S. van der Meer M.A.A. Touretzky D.S. Redish A.D. Hippocampal replay is not a simple function of experience.Neuron. 2010; 65: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These observations may challenge the theory that reactivated trajectories need to be first experienced, in order to be stored in the hippocampal circuits. However, unlike replay in sleep, it cannot be ruled out that upstream spatial sensory inputs, channeled through the entorhinal cortex, may still be involved in driving reactivation events observed during active waking periods (Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017Yamamoto J. Tonegawa S. Direct medial entorhinal cortex input to hippocampal ca1 is crucial for extended quiet awake replay.Neuron. 2017; 96: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, this replay of inexperienced path combinations through the integration of maze segments may reflect the imagination of novel situations or map refinement (Gupta et al., 2010Gupta A.S. van der Meer M.A.A. Touretzky D.S. Redish A.D. Hippocampal replay is not a simple function of experience.Neuron. 2010; 65: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These observations do not provide a clear answer as to whether, in the absence of sensory inputs, reactivated patterns represent the exact spatial experience of the animal or, alternatively, are generated by a more generalized process that does not require the direct storage of patterns. We set out to examine the mechanisms of replay by testing for its occurrence in conditions that should not support sequence formation through experience-dependent mechanisms. The behavior used in replay studies typically utilizes narrow linear tracks or mazes, in which the animal performs repeated stereotyped trajectories. Instead, we utilized an open-field enclosure in which the animal performed a random pellet-chasing task and then detected replay during a subsequent rest period, recorded in a separate sleep box. We found that reactivated trajectories followed rules of random movement governed by Brownian diffusion that did not directly reflect the past behavioral trajectories of the animal. However, our results were also not consistent with a model of replay solely based on a limited number of preexisting cell assemblies, since the number of replay trajectories was only constrained by the size of the environment and the diffusion dynamics. Instead, the data indicate that hippocampal circuits have the built-in ability to generate sequences that link assemblies together across the entire cognitive map, on all temporal and spatial scales. Such a mechanism likely provides a framework on which past experiences can be reactivated in sleep, or possible future paths can be compared during navigation. We examined reactivation following a random exploration of a large (1.2 m diameter) circular arena during quiet immobility periods in the absence of sensory drive of the explored environment. So far, only one study has been able to see the reactivation of 2D trajectories (Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D.J. Hippocampal place-cell sequences depict future paths to remembered goals.Nature. 2013; 497: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), in that case during awake, exploration-associated SWRs. Therefore, the replay shown in that study may have been driven by an upstream sensory drive (Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017Yamamoto J. Tonegawa S. Direct medial entorhinal cortex input to hippocampal ca1 is crucial for extended quiet awake replay.Neuron. 2017; 96: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), while the animal was performing a goal-seeking task. The encoding of these reactivated trajectories, however, required the simultaneous recordings from many neurons. Therefore, we reasoned that the accurate reconstruction of 2D trajectories in big environments requires the simultaneous recording from large assemblies. Accordingly, in four rats we recorded CA1 multiple-unit activities in 128 channels (32 tetrodes), yielding simultaneous recording of 383, 243, 206, and 100 putative pyramidal and 31, 18, 30, and 24 putative interneuron units during each animal’s recording session (Figures S1 and S2). Trajectory reactivation tends to occur during SWR oscillatory patterns (Buzsáki, 1989Buzsáki G. Two-stage model of memory trace formation: a role for “noisy” brain states.Neuroscience. 1989; 31: 551-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, Lee and Wilson, 2002Lee A.K. Wilson M.A. Memory of sequential experience in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). We detected these SWR periods during the quiet immobility period after exploration in the absence of theta oscillatory periods (see STAR Methods). We subdivided each SWR into prediction time windows and used a Bayesian method to estimate the location encoded by putative pyramidal neurons (Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F. Wilson M.A. Hippocampal replay of extended experience.Neuron. 2009; 63: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 1998Zhang K. Ginzburg I.

Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1017-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar; Figures 1A–1D). Only SWRs that met a quality threshold for the encoded probability (see STAR Methods) and contained at least five encoded trajectory points were included in the subsequent analysis to ensure that only events with reliably encoded places were considered. Altogether n = 558, 693, 544, and 238 SWR events passed the quality threshold for fixed spike number encoding. Each prediction window contained the same number of spikes (n = 15) to ensure uniform coding accuracy. However, similar results were seen using fixed duration windows (8 ms; see STAR Methods) in which case n = 519, 624, 79, and 65 SWRs passed the quality threshold. Reactivation speed was measured by the jump distance between neighboring predicted locations (Figures 1E and S3). Although the reactivation speed remained relatively similar within a SWR, different SWRs yielded wide ranges of mean reactivation speeds, which were lognormally distributed (see Figure 2A inset; all p > 0.3, Pearson chi-square test).Figure 2Comparison of Original and Shuffled TrajectoriesShow full caption(A) Sorted mean (±SD) reactivation speed of SWRs and shuffled counterparts for an example session.

Filled circles display the median of different distributions. Results for the additional animals are shown in Figure S4. See also Figure S5. To verify that the encoded SWR trajectories represented place assemblies of the previous environment and were not from chance coding of temporally organized spike trains, we shuffled the cluster identities of the active cells or performed a random 2D rotation of place fields for the events already passing the selection criteria. Both randomized events yielded distributions with higher mean reactivation speeds (all p < 10e−277, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test) and significantly weaker prediction confidence (all p < 10e−200, KS test; Figures 2A–2C, S4A, and S4B). Next, the role of spike timing in encoding was tested by randomizing them within each SWR. As above, spike time-jittered events exhibited higher mean speeds (all p < 10e−46, KS test) and weaker encoding confidence (all p < 10e−45, KS test). Therefore, the original SWR trajectories were encoded from temporally organized spike trains representing the previous environment. Using larger time-step intervals to compute the reactivation speeds yielded relatively similar mean speed values for the spike-jittered data. However, the mean speed of the original data increased with time-step interval length, making it eventually larger than the shuffled values for the spike-jittered data (Figure S5A). We then examined whether the places expressed during SWRs were organized. First, we shuffled the order of encoded places within a trajectory, which yielded shifted speed distributions (all p < 10e−57, KS test), indicating that each encoded location influenced the next. Second, we replaced each reactivation speed by randomly drawn speeds from other SWRs (Figures 2D and S4C). These speed-randomized events exhibited a higher coefficient of variation in their jump speed than the unshuffled data (all p < 10e−31, KS test), indicating that each replay expressed a consistent speed throughout the SWR. To test how the use of a quality threshold influenced our results, we performed the same analysis using different quality thresholds. Higher threshold values lead to a larger separation between original and shuffled data distributions for reactivation speed (Figures S5B and S5C), but the shuffled distributions were still significantly different from the original distribution even when no threshold was used (i.e., threshold = 0; all p < 0.01, KS test). Significant differences in the distributions were seen as well when we examined events that fell below a quality threshold (all p < 0.04, KS test; Figure S5D). Given that with the reduction of the quality threshold the original and shuffled distributions got more similar, it is possible that some of the low encoding quality events expressed places or trajectories of another environment, perhaps even “preplayed” assemblies of the environment the animal explored next. The animal explored a novel environment following the rest session we tested (see STAR Methods). The proportion of SWR events that passed our quality threshold for encoding the subsequent novel environment was low (<0.005) in the previous rest session and was not significantly different from the proportion of events detected after place fields rotation or spike time jittering generated probability maps (Figure S5E; all p > 0.1, Binomial test). These data question whether preplay of trajectories of the subsequently explored novel environment can be seen in our data. Nevertheless, we compared the speed distributions of the original and shuffled data at different threshold levels to check whether any preplay can be detected in our data. At any of the quality thresholds we tested [0:0.12], the speed distributions were significantly different for the place field rotation generated trajectories (all p < 10e−4, KS). However, at any threshold levels the speed distributions of the original trajectories were not significantly different from those of the spike time jittering trajectories (Figure S5F; all p > 0.15, KS test). The speed distribution differences with the place field rotation generated trajectories suggest that in the rest session before the exploration of a novel environment a small subset of the recorded units maintain consistent correlations with that in the subsequent novel environment exploration. Therefore, a possible explanation for these findings is that places expressed in some events at least partially represented patches of the subsequent novel environment. But, considering that spike time-jittered speed distributions were not different from those of the original data, these preplayed trajectories did not exhibit a consistent order in the expression of places to form organized trajectories in which one location will influence the next one. Similar to SWRs representing the familiar environment, a novel environment encoding SWRs expressed consistent trajectories in the subsequent post-novel rest session (Figure S5C). Hence, the apparent lack of trajectory preplay was not due to an impairment of replaying these trajectories after the novel environment exploration. Given that each replay location depended on the previous locations and that place changes maintained a defined speed range, we then asked whether these trajectories can be approximated by a random walk process akin to random particle movements during diffusion (Rudnick and Gaspari, 2004Rudnick J. Gaspari G. Elements of the Random Walk: An Introduction for Advanced Students and Researchers. Cambridge University Press, 2004Crossref Google Scholar). In physics, diffusion processes are described by a power law between mean distance and time, which represents an exponential relationship characterized by the value of the exponent (Metzler et al., 2012Metzler R. Chechkin A.V. Klafter J. Levy statistics and anomalous transport: levy flights and subdiffusion.Computational Complexity. Springer, 2012: 1724-1745Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, Vlahos et al., 2008Vlahos L. Isliker H. Kominis Y. Hizanidis K. Normal and anomalous diffusion: a tutorial.arXiv. 2008; (arXiv:08050419)https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0419Google Scholar). In Brownian trajectories, the exponent is equal to 0.5. To check the relationship between time and distance, first SWR trajectories were subdivided into homogeneous groups according to their mean reactivation speed. For each reactivation speed group, within each SWR, we took all possible pairs of time windows and measured the distance between predicted places and the time interval between them. On a log-log scale, they showed a linear relationship (Figure 3A). The power law exponents (α), calculated by the slope of the fits, consistently fell near 0.5 (all p > 0.2, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures 3A, 5A, and 5D) with the slope estimates with the smallest confidence intervals yielding slopes closest to 0.5 (r = 0.64 p < 10e−4; Figures 5B and 5E). Shuffling the places within a trajectory resulted in almost flat lines with slopes significantly smaller than the original ones (all p < 0.0003, Wilcoxon one-tailed signed-rank test). Moreover, at any time interval, the distances obtained from the original data were fitted better by a Rayleigh distribution than the shuffled data, as expected for a 2D Brownian diffusion process (Rudnick and Gaspari, 2004Rudnick J. Gaspari G. Elements of the Random Walk: An Introduction for Advanced Students and Researchers. Cambridge University Press, 2004Crossref Google Scholar) (all p < 0.0002, Mann-Whitney test; Figures 3B, 3C, 5C, and 5F). These distance distributions also showed a significant overlap (all p > 0.1, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) with those produced by a simulated Brownian process with the same speed and length statistics (Figures 3B, 3C, 5C, and 5F). Crucially, the same analysis applied to the trajectories of the animal and to trajectories reconstructed using neural activity expressed during active behavior yielded different results, with both exponents α (all p < 10e−4, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and Rayleigh fit (all p < 0.02, Mann-Whitney test) being"
https://openalex.org/W2916658582,"Increased expression of the full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) and AR splice variants (AR-Vs) drives the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The levels of AR-FL and AR-V transcripts are often tightly correlated in individual CRPC samples, yet our understanding of how their expression is co-regulated is limited. Here, we report a role of c-Myc in accounting for coordinated AR-FL and AR-V expression. Analysis of gene-expression data from 159 metastatic CRPC samples and 2142 primary prostate tumors showed that the level of c-Myc is positively correlated with that of individual AR isoforms. A striking positive correlation also exists between the activity of the c-Myc pathway and the level of individual AR isoforms, between the level of c-Myc and the activity of the AR pathway, and between the activities of the two pathways. Moreover, the c-Myc signature is highly enriched in tumors expressing high levels of AR, as is the AR signature in c-Myc-high-expressing tumors. Using shRNA knockdown, we confirmed c-Myc regulation of expression and activity of AR-FL and AR-Vs in cell models and a patient-derived xenograft model. Mechanistically, c-Myc promotes the transcription of the AR gene and enhances the stability of the AR-FL and AR-V proteins without altering AR RNA splicing. Importantly, inhibiting c-Myc sensitizes enzalutamide-resistant cells to growth inhibition by enzalutamide. Overall, this study highlights a critical role of c-Myc in regulating the coordinated expression of AR-FL and AR-Vs that is commonly observed in CRPC and suggests the utility of targeting c-Myc as an adjuvant to AR-directed therapy."

IgA is induced by both T cell-dependent and -independent (TI) pathways. However, little is known about TI regulation. We report that IEC endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces a polyreactive IgA response, which is protective against enteric inflammation. IEC ER stress causes TI and microbiota-independent expansion and activation of peritoneal B1b cells, which culminates in increased lamina propria and luminal IgA. Increased numbers of IgA-producing plasma cells were observed in healthy humans with defective autophagy, who are known to exhibit IEC ER stress. Upon ER stress, IECs communicate signals to the peritoneum that induce a barrier-protective TI IgA response."

We have previously reported that incorrectly identified nucleotide sequence reagents are characteristic of highly similar human gene knockdown studies, some of which have been retracted from the literature on account of possible research fraud. Because of the throughput limitations of manual verification of nucleotide sequences, we developed a semi-automated fact checking tool, Seek & Blastn, to verify the targeting or non-targeting status of published nucleotide sequence reagents. From previously described and unknown corpora of 48 and 155 publications, respectively, Seek & Blastn correctly extracted 304/342 (88.9%) and 1066/1522 (70.0%) nucleotide sequences and a predicted targeting/ non-targeting status. Seek & Blastn correctly predicted the targeting/ non-targeting status of 293/304 (96.4%) and 988/1066 (92.7%) of the correctly extracted nucleotide sequences. A total of 38/39 (97.4%) or 31/79 (39.2%) Seek & Blastn predictions of incorrect nucleotide sequence reagent use were correct in the two literature corpora. Combined Seek & Blastn and manual analyses identified a list of 91 misidentified nucleotide sequence reagents, which could be built upon through future studies. In summary, incorrect nucleotide sequence reagents represent an under-recognized source of error within the biomedical literature, and fact checking tools such as Seek & Blastn may help to identify papers and manuscripts affected by these errors."

Low birth weight can cause complications in adult life, and is therefore a public health concern. In this study, we determined the maternal factors that contribute to low birth weight (LBW) deliveries in Tshwane District, South Africa. Methods We conducted a case control study of 1073 randomly selected mothers who delivered babies in four hospitals in the district. We reviewed antenatal and maternity registers to obtain information about the mothers and their offspring. We fitted a multiple logistic regression to examine relationships between possible factors associated with LBW. Results From the total sample of mothers (n = 1073), 77% (n = 824) were adult women, aged 20 to 35 years. Of the adult mothers, 38.54% (n = 412) delivered low birth weight (LBW) infants. The mean gestational age and weight of all infants at birth was 37.16 weeks (SD 2.92) and 2675.48 grams (SD 616.16) respectively. LBW was associated with prematurity, odds ratio (OR) 7.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.18 to 9.89; premature rupture of membranes OR 7.33, 95% CI 2.43 to 22.12 and attending fewer than five antenatal care (ANC) visits OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.61. Male infants were less likely to be LBW, in this population. Conclusion Women who attended fewer than five ANC visits were predisposed to give birth to low birth weight babies. Mothers should be encouraged to attend ANC visits to detect adverse events like premature rupture of membranes and premature labour timeously."

Methods The papillary renal cell carcinoma RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data set was downloaded from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). We identified the differentially expressed mRNAs between cancer and normal tissues and performed annotation of differentially expressed mRNAs to figure out the functions and pathways they were enriched in. Then, we constructed a risk score that relied on the 5-mRNA. The optimal value for the patients’classification risk level was identified by ROC analysis. The relationship between mRNA expression and prognosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma was evaluated by univariate Cox regression model. The 5-mRNA based risk score was validated in both complete set and testing set. Result In general, the 5-mRNA (CCNB2, IGF2BP3, KIF18A, PTTG1, and BUB1) were identified and validated, which can predict papillary renal cell carcinoma patient survival. This study revealed the 5-mRNA expression profile and the potential function of a single mRNA as a prognostic target for papillary renal cell carcinoma. Conclusion In addition, these findings may have significant implications for potential treatments options and prognosis for patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma."

Methods A retrospective chart review was performed of patients who were diagnosed with infectious keratitis and underwent corneal scrapings for cultures at Seoul National University Hospital between 2007 and 2016. Demographics, clinical characteristics, microbiological data, antibiotic resistance and sensitivity, and treatment outcome were collected. Results Out of 129 scrapings, bacteria were isolated in 101 samples (78.3%). The most frequent isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) (15.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.3%). All gram-positive isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, but methicillin resistance was found in 29.4% of CNS and 15.4% of Staphylococcus aureus. All gram-negative isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime and carbapenem while 11.5%, 3.3% and 2.8% of gram-negative isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, respectively. Ciprofloxacin resistance was observed in 10.3% of gram-positive isolates and 8.8% of gram-negative isolates. No significant changes were observed in profiles of microbial isolates and antibiotic sensitivity over time. Eight eyes of 101 eyes (7.9%) eventually underwent evisceration for infection control. The use of topical glaucoma medication (p = 0.006) and history of ocular surgery (p = 0.019) were significant risk factors related to evisceration. Conclusions CNS, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common microorganisms responsible for bacterial keratitis. The duo-therapy using vancomycin and ceftazidime should be considered for empirical treatment until the culture and sensitivity results become available."

The dependence of the diffusion coefficient explored by ITIR-FCS together with MD simulations yields insights into Lti30 binding, domain partitioning, and aggregation. The effect of Lti30 on membrane lipid diffusion was studied on fluorescently labeled supported lipid bilayers of different lipid compositions at mechanistically important pH conditions. In parallel, we compared the mode of diffusion for short individual K-segment peptides. The results indicate that Lti30 binds the lipid bilayer via electrostatics, which restricts the mobility of lipids and bound protein molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2919612068,"Surgical transection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the porcine model leads to posttraumatic osteoarthritis if left untreated. However, a recently developed surgical treatment, bridge-enhanced ACL repair, prevents further cartilage damage. Since the synovial fluid bathes all the intrinsic structures of knee, we reasoned that a comparative analysis of synovial fluid protein contents could help to better understand the observed chondroprotective effects of the bridge-enhanced ACL repair. We hypothesized that post-surgical changes in the synovial fluid proteome would be different in the untreated and repaired knees, and those changes would correlate with the degree of cartilage damage. Thirty adolescent Yucatan mini-pigs underwent unilateral ACL transection and were randomly assigned to either no further treatment (ACLT, n = 14) or bridge-enhanced ACL repair (BEAR, n = 16). We used an isotopically labeled high resolution LC MS/MS-based proteomics approach to analyze the protein profile of synovial fluid at 6 and 12 months after ACL transection in untreated and repaired porcine knees. A linear mixed effect model was used to compare the normalized protein abundance levels between the groups at each time point. Bivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the correlations between the macroscopic cartilage damage (total lesion area) and normalized abundance levels of each of the identified secreted proteins. There were no significant differences in cartilage lesion area or quantitative abundance levels of the secreted proteins between the ACLT and BEAR groups at 6 months. However, by 12 months, greater cartilage damage was seen in the ACLT group compared to the BEAR group (p = 0.005). This damage was accompanied by differences in the abundance levels of secreted proteins, with higher levels of Vitamin K-dependent protein C (p = 0.001), and lower levels of Apolipoprotein A4 (p = 0.021) and Cartilage intermediate layer protein 1 (p = 0.049) in the ACLT group compared to the BEAR group. There were also group differences in the secreted proteins that significantly changed in abundance between 6 and 12 months in ACLT and BEAR knees. Increased concentration of Ig lambda-1 chain C regions and decreased concentration of Hemopexin, Clusterin, Coagulation factor 12 and Cartilage intermediate layer protein 1 were associated with greater cartilage lesion area. In general, ACLT knees had higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory proteins and lower concentrations of anti-inflammatory proteins than BEAR group. In addition, the ACLT group had a lower and declining synovial concentrations of CILP, in contrast to a consistently high abundance of CILP in repaired knees. These differences suggest that the knees treated with bridge-enhanced ACL repair may be maintaining an environment that is more protective of the extracellular matrix, a function which is not seen in the ACLT knees."
https://openalex.org/W2919465623,"Melaphidina aphids (Rhus-gall aphids; Eriosomatinae: Fordini) comprise five genera from eastern Asia and one monotypic genus from eastern North America. Melaphidina are unique in feeding on plant species of Rhus subgenus Rhus (Anacardiaceae), on which they form galls during the summer. The phylogenetic relationships among some species of Melaphidina aphids remain controversial. In this study, we sought to resolve the backbone phylogeny of Melaphidina aphids by sampling 15 accessions representing all six genera, all species, and all subspecies except Meitanaphis microgallis using 20 gene regions: five nuclear genes as well as 13 protein-coding genes and two rRNA genes of the mitochondrial genome. Phylogenetic analyses included Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Independent analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genes returned congruent topologies, and analyses of all gene regions combined showed well-supported relationships among Melaphidina species. In particular, these were: (1) Nurudea (excluding N. ibofushi) is sister to a clade composed of the five remaining genera; (2) the monotypic North American genus Melaphis is sister to a clade comprising the four remaining genera; and (3) (Schlechtendalia + N. ibofushi) is sister to the clade (Floraphis (Meitanaphis + Kaburagia). Our results support the transfer of Meitanaphis flavogallis to Kaburagia as an additional subspecies or species, and the recognition of Floraphis as a distinct genus. This study provides important molecular resources for subsequent evolutionary studies using more nuclear genes on the Melaphidina aphids and their close allies."

Only Gyk isoform b is present in whole cells, but its function in the nucleus remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that nuclear orphan receptor subfamily 4 group A member (NR4A)-1 is an important regulator of hepatic glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. We aimed to elucidate the functional interaction between nuclear Gyk and NR4A1 during hepatic gluconeogenesis in the unfed state and diabetes. We identified nuclear Gyk as a novel corepressor of NR4A1 in the liver; moreover, this recruitment was dependent on the C-terminal ligand-binding domain instead of the N-terminal activation function 1 domain, which interacts with other NR4A1 coregulators. NR4A1 transcriptional activity was inhibited by Gyk via protein-protein interaction but not enzymatic activity. Moreover, Gyk overexpression suppressed NR4A1 ability to regulate the expression of target genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis in vitro and in vivo as well as blood glucose regulation, which was observed in both unfed and diabetic mice. These results highlight the moonlighting function of nuclear Gyk, which was found to act as a coregulator of NR4A1, participating in the regulation of hepatic glucose homeostasis in the unfed state and diabetes.—Miao, L., Yang, Y., Liu, Y., Lai, L., Wang, L., Zhan, Y., Yin, R., Yu, M., Li, C., Yang, X., Ge, C.

The reversibility of the reaction also enables production of lengthened glycans from the sugar 1-phosphate donor and glycan acceptor of choice. Sugar 1-phosphate donors for GPs are relatively cheap and accessible compared with the nucleotide sugars required for glycosyltransferases, therefore making GPs attractive as biocatalysts for β-(1→3)-glucan production.

However, genes that relate to the β-(1→3)-d-glucan phosphorylase activity from heterokonts have yet to be described.

However, these studies did not identify GPs, likely due to the lack of sequence information corresponding to phosphorylase activity. Therefore, the identification of candidate sequences is a key step in the investigation of heterokont β-(1→3)-d-glucan phosphorylases.

In contrast to GH149, for which the majority of sequences are from Gram-negative bacteria and Euglenophyceae, the majority of GH161 sequences were identified from the genomes of Gram-positive bacteria and heterokonts. Despite repeated attempts, expression of recombinant OcP1 protein in Escherichia coli was unsuccessful. To establish the activity of GH161 family members, a bacterial GH161 gene sequence (PapP) from the Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa ATCC 842 was cloned and expressed in E. coli. Biochemical characterization of recombinant PapP protein showed that the enzyme operates on β-(1→3)-gluco-oligosaccharide acceptors with a degree of polymerization (DP) ≥ 2 and that it cannot use monosaccharide glucose (Glc) as an acceptor substrate. The acceptor length specificity of PapP is distinct from that of the characterized GH149 enzymes, which can act on Glc (Fig. 1). Bacterial GH161 genes were found in close proximity to genes encoding β-glucosidases (GH1, GH3, or GH30) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, highlighting a probable involvement of these gene clusters in carbohydrate degradation. Significantly, some GH161 genes were found located adjacent to genes in the GH94 family, suggesting that GPs from different CAZy families may work in concert to enable sequential degradation of oligosaccharides. Ochromonas β-(1→3)-glucan phosphorylases were expected to share residual sequence similarity to genes encoding these enzymes in the GH94 and GH149 families. To investigate this hypothesis, the translated transcriptome of Ochromonas sp. BG-1 from the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome (MMET) database was interrogated using BLASTP with GH94 (21 sequences) and GH149 EgP1 sequences as queries. Three sequences were recovered (CAMPEP_0173148212, CAMPEP_0173133844, and CAMPEP_0173155066), with 21% identity to a GH94 laminaribiose phosphorylase (LBP) sequence from Halorhadus tiamatea and 24% to EgP1 sequence (Table 1). These three sequences were found to be 99% identical, and therefore CAMPEP_0173155066 was taken forward as a representative, designated OcP1 (see supporting information for the full sequence).Table 1BLASTP analysis of Ochromonas sp. transcriptomic sequences using 21 sequences of GH94 family and EgP1 of GH149 as queriesQuerySubjectHit IDQuery coverageE-valueIdentity%%WP_020936056.1|LBP GH94| (Halorhabdus tiamatea)Ochromonas sp. strain BG-1 transcriptome (MMETSP1105)CAMPEP_0173148212653e−0621CAMPEP_0173133844658e−0621CAMPEP_0173155066 (OcP1)658e−0621EgP1|GH149 (Euglena gracilis)Ochromonas sp. strain BG-1 transcriptome (MMETSP1105)CAMPEP_0173148212313e−0824CAMPEP_0173133844313e−0824CAMPEP_0173155066 (OcP1)313e−0824 Open table in a new tab Interrogation of the NCBI nonredundant protein database and the MMET database using PSI-BLAST with OcP1 as a query uncovered several hundred orthologs (File S1). Of these, 69 sequences (with 32–58% sequence identity to OcP1; File S2) originated from eukaryotes in the phyla Bacillariophyta, Ochrophyta, Haptophyta, and Miozoa, all of which belong to infrakingdom Heterokonta (collectively termed heterokonts) (Fig. 2, orange). One sequence, GenBankTM accession number BAU78234.1 (identity = 58%, E-value = 0), was identified from Ochromonas danica. The remaining 332 sequences identified that share 31–41% sequence identity to OcP1 (File S2) were from Gram-positive bacteria in the phylum Firmicutes (Fig. 2, cyan; 229 sequences), 85 of which were from Paenibacillus spp. To establish the relationship between OcP1 orthologs and GH families containing β-(1→3)-d-glucan phosphorylases (GH94 and GH149), phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using amino acid sequences. Maximum likelihood analyses indicated that the OcP1 orthologs form a distinct clade that is alienated from GH94 and GH149 (Fig. 3A, blue); thus, OcP1 and its orthologs constitute a new family, designated GH161. Despite their low overall sequence similarity (∼20% across the three families), multiple-sequence alignment of amino acid sequences revealed conservation of aspartate catalytic residues, residues located in the −1 (donor substrate) subsite, as well as a histidine residue involved in phosphate recognition previously identified in GH94 and GH149 (Fig. 3B). Together, these data support the placement of the GH161 family into the GH-Q clan, together with GH149 and GH94. Notably, sequences in the GH161 family were identified in the genomes of heterokonts for which other chrysolaminarin metabolic enzymes have previously been identified (28Kroth P.G. Chiovitti A.

By analysis of the heterokont genomes, we were able to analyze genomic sequences and found that all genes contain at least one intron (Table S1). Introns were also identified previously in other β-(1→3)-glucan metabolic enzymes, such as laminarin synthase from P. tricornutum (32Huang W. Haferkamp I. Lepetit B. Molchanova M. Hou S. Jeblick W.

Although many conditions were trialed, we were unable to express recombinant OcP1 protein in E. coli. To characterize the bacterial activity of enzymes in the GH161 family, candidates from Paenibacillus spp. were selected because several studies report that Paenibacillus carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) can act on β-(1→3)-glucan and mixed linkage β-(1→3;1→4)-glucan (e.g. identification of a β-(1→3)-endo-glucanase (LamA) in Paenibacillus sp. CCRC 17245 able to digest β-(1→3;1→4)-glucan (33Cheng Y.-M. Hong T.-Y. Liu C.-C. Meng M. Cloning and functional characterization of a complex endo-β-1,3-glucanase from Paenibacillus sp.Appl.

Also, a laminarin-degrading β-glucanase (BglA1) and a β-(1→3;1→4)-endo-glucanase (BglA2) have been identified from Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 (34Chow V. Kim Y.S. Rhee M.S. Sawhney N. St John F.J.

Bai Y. Meng K. Luo H. Yuan T. Yao B. Cloning and overexpression of a Paenibacillus β-glucanase in Pichia pastoris: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17 (18051354): 58-66PubMed Google Scholar). Second, an LBP from Paenibacillus sp. YM-1 (PsLBP) in the GH94 family has been described previously (14Kitaoka M. Matsuoka Y. Mori K. Nishimoto M. Hayashi K. Characterization of a bacterial laminaribiose phosphorylase.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2012; 76 (22313784): 343-34810.1271/bbb.110772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, characterization would enable comparison between the GH94, GH149, and GH161 β-(1→3)-d-glucan phosphorylases and perhaps provide further insights into their newly discovered activity. A GH161 sequence from Paenibacillus polymyxa ATCC 842 (GenBankTM accession number WP_019688419.1, 37% identity to OcP1), designated PapP, was chosen as a target for recombinant protein expression and in vitro biochemical characterization. The coding sequence (gene locus: PPT_RS0121460) was amplified and cloned into a pOPINF vector (36Berrow N.S. Alderton D. Sainsbury S. Nettleship J. Assenberg R. Rahman N. Stuart D.I. Owens R.J. A versatile ligation-independent cloning method suitable for high-throughput expression screening applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 (17317681): e4510.1093/nar/gkm047Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), which installs a fused N-terminal His6 tag, and expressed in E. coli (Rosetta PLysS). The recombinant PapP protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (Fig. S1, A and B) and subsequently by gel filtration (Fig. S1C). Protein with an approximate molecular mass of 120 kDa, based on SDS-PAGE analysis, was recovered (Fig. S1D). Gel filtration analysis of PapP against protein standards revealed that PapP formed a dimer in solution under nondenaturing conditions, with an estimated molecular mass of 241 kDa. A dimeric form of PapP is similar to that described for PsLBP, EgP1, and Pro_7066 (Table S2). To investigate function, the recombinant PapP was assayed in vitro in a glycan synthetic reaction using Glc and Glc1P as acceptor and donor substrates, respectively. The reaction mixture was analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), which showed that there was no detectable activity on these substrates (Fig. S2A). Similarly, phosphorolysis assays were performed in the presence of Glc-Glc disaccharides with varying glycosidic linkages as substrates, again showing no turnover (Fig. S2B). These initial experiments suggested that PapP may prefer substrates with a higher DP. The enzyme was assayed in a phosphorolysis reaction in the presence of a trisaccharide (either β-(1→3)- (laminaritriose, G3) or β-(1→4)-oligosaccharides (cellotriose)) and Pi as substrates, which showed that PapP could phosphorolyse laminaritriose but not cellotriose. This confirms that PapP prefers β-(1→3)-glycosidic linkages (Fig. 4A), which was substantiated in the phosphorolysis direction with laminarihexaose (G6) and Pi, which showed that G6 was broken down by PapP into shorter oligosaccharides (G2–G5). However, in contrast to the characterized GH94 and GH149 enzymes, PapP could not phosphorolyse laminaribiose (G2) to Glc (Fig. 4B). Because the phosphorolysis is reversible, peaks corresponding to oligosaccharide products longer than the G6 substrate were also detected (G7–G14; Fig. 4, B and C, and Table S3). Previously, two GH149 enzymes (EgP1 and Pro_7066) were confirmed as β-(1→3)-d-glucan phosphorylases that can carry out the phosphorolysis of β-(1→3)-oligosaccharides to liberate Glc, representing a different substrate preference from the GH161 enzyme PapP. To emphasize the difference in substrate chain length preferences between the GH149 and GH161 enzymes, assays were carried out in the"
https://openalex.org/W2918408034,"Horticulturalists and gardeners in temperate regions often claim that planting marigolds next to tomato plants protects the tomatoes from the glasshouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood). If shown to hold true, this technique could be used in larger-scale tomato production, protecting the crop and helping to introduce greater plant diversity into these agro-ecosystems. Here we present two large-scale glasshouse trials corresponding to the two main ways growers are likely to use marigolds to control whiteflies. In the first, marigolds are grown next to tomato throughout the growing period and we quantify whitefly population growth from the seedling stage over a 48 day infestation period. Here we show that association with marigolds significantly slows whitefly population development. Introducing additional whitefly-attractive ‘pull’ plants around the perimeter of plots has little effect, but reducing the proportion of marigolds and introducing other non-hosts of whiteflies (basil, nasturtium and Chinese cabbage) also reduces whitefly populations on tomato. The second experiment assesses the efficacy of marigolds when used as an ‘emergency’ measure. Here we allow whitefly populations to build to a high density on unprotected tomatoes then introduce marigolds and assess whitefly population over a further period. Following laboratory work showing limonene to be a major chemical component of French marigolds and a negative behaviour response of whiteflies to this compound, limonene dispensers are added as an additional treatment to this experiment. “Emergency” marigold companion planting yielded minimal reductions in whitefly performance, but the use of limonene dispensers was more effective. Our work indicates that companion planting short vine tomatoes with French marigolds throughout the growing season will slow development of whitefly populations. Introducing marigolds to unprotected tomatoes after significant whitefly build-up will be less effective. The use of limonene dispensers placed near to tomato plants also shows promise. It is argued that this work supports the possibility of the development of a mixture of tomato companion plants that infer ‘associational resistance’ against many major invertebrate pests of tomato. Such a mixture, if comprising edible or ornamental plants, would be economically viable, would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control, and, if used outdoors, would generate plant-diverse agro-ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife."
https://openalex.org/W2918843780,"Background Factors associated with efficacy and safety of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) are not well established. The aim is to elucidate the predictors of R0 resection and immediate bleeding of CSP. Methods We retrospectively reviewed a database of patients who underwent CSP for subcentimetric polyps at the University of Tokyo Hospital in Japan. Using the data regarding the characteristics of patients and polyps, such as location, size, and macroscopic appearance; use of narrow band imaging with magnification (NBI-M); and endoscopists’ experience, we revealed the predictive factors associated with R0 resection and immediate post-CSP bleeding by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results In total, 399 polyps, in 200 patients without antithrombotics, were removed. Failure of tissue retrieval was noted in 4% of resected lesions. There was no intramucosal carcinoma observed. The overall rate of R0 resection was 46%. Multivariate analysis elucidated that the observation of the polyp with NBI-M was an independent predictor associated with R0 resection (odds ratio [OR] 1.90; p = 0.024). Although immediate post-CSP bleeding occurred in 19 polyps (4.8%), no delayed bleeding or perforation was observed. Multivariate analysis revealed protruded lesion as an independent risk factor for immediate bleeding (OR 3.54; p = 0.018). Conclusions A higher rate of R0 resection with CSP can be achieved by performing colonoscopy with NBI-M, than with white-light imaging. Macroscopic protruding appearance of a polyp is a risk factor for immediate bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W2920469971,"Metabolic syndrome encompasses obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; however, the interactions between diet and host physiology that predispose to metabolic syndrome are incompletely understood. Here, we explored the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on energy balance, gut microbiota, and risk factors of metabolic syndrome in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHRSP) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We found that the SHRSP rats were hypertensive, hyperphagic, less sensitive to hypophagic effects of exendin-4, and expended more energy with diminished sensitivity to sympathetic blockade compared to WKY rats. Notably, key thermogenic markers in brown and retroperitoneal adipose tissues and skeletal muscle were up-regulated in SHRSP than WKY rats. Although HFD promoted weight gain, adiposity, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic lipidosis, and hyperleptinemia in both SHRSP and WKY rats, the SHRSP rats weighed less but had comparable percent adiposity to WKY rats, which supports the use of HFD-fed SHRSP rats as a unique model for studying the metabolically obese normal weight (MONW) phenotype in humans. Despite distinct strain differences in gut microbiota composition, diet had a preponderant impact on gut flora with some of the taxa being strongly associated with key metabolic parameters. Together, we provide evidence that interactions between host genetics and diet modulate gut microbiota and predispose SHRSP rats to develop metabolic syndrome.—Singh, A., Zapata, R.

https://openalex.org/W2899278427,"BTB–Kelch proteins are substrate-specific adaptors for cullin-3 (Cul3) RING-box–based E3 ubiquitin ligases, mediating protein ubiquitylation for subsequent proteasomal degradation. Vaccinia virus encodes three BTB–Kelch proteins: A55, C2, and F3. Viruses lacking A55 or C2 have altered cytopathic effects in cultured cells and altered pathology in vivo. Previous studies have shown that the ectromelia virus orthologue of A55 interacts with Cul3 in cells. We report that the N-terminal BTB-BACK (BB) domain of A55 binds directly to the Cul3 N-terminal domain (Cul3–NTD), forming a 2:2 complex in solution. We solved the structure of an A55BB/Cul3–NTD complex from anisotropic crystals diffracting to 2.3/3.7 A resolution in the best/worst direction, revealing that the overall interaction and binding interface closely resemble the structures of cellular BTB/Cul3–NTD complexes, despite low sequence identity between A55 and cellular BTB domains. Surprisingly, despite this structural similarity, the affinity of Cul3–NTD for A55BB was stronger than for cellular BTB proteins. Glutamate substitution of the A55 residue Ile-48, adjacent to the canonical φX(D/E) Cul3-binding motif, reduced affinity of A55BB for Cul3–NTD by at least 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, Ile-48 and the φX(D/E) motif are conserved in A55 orthologues from other poxviruses, but not in the vaccinia virus proteins C2 or F3. The high-affinity interaction between A55BB and Cul3–NTD suggests that, in addition to directing the Cul3–RING E3 ligase complex to degrade cellular/viral target proteins that are normally unaffected, A55 may also sequester Cul3 from cellular adaptor proteins, thereby protecting substrates of these cellular adaptors from ubiquitylation and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2919087339,"The objective of this paper is to propose a lot-sizing methodology for an inventory system that faces time-dependent random demands and that seeks to minimize total cost as a function of order, purchase, holding and shortage costs. A two-stage stochastic programming framework is derived to optimize lot-sizing decisions over a time horizon. To this end, we simulate a demand time-series by using a generalized autoregressive moving average structure. The modeling includes covariates of the demand, which are used as predictors of this. We describe an algorithm that summarizes the methodology and we discuss its computational framework. A case study with unpublished real-world data is presented to illustrate the potential of this methodology. We report that the accuracy of the demand variance estimator improves when a temporal structure is considered, instead of assuming time-independent demand. The methodology is useful in decisions related to inventory logistics management when the demand shows patterns of temporal dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2920493620,"The formation of new myofibers in vertebrates occurs by myoblast fusion and requires fusogenic activity of the muscle-specific membrane protein myomaker. Here, using in silico (BLAST) genome analyses, we show that the myomaker gene from trout includes 14 minisatellites, indicating that it has an unusual structure compared with those of other animal species. We found that the trout myomaker gene encodes a 434–amino acid (aa) protein, in accordance with its apparent molecular mass (∼40 kDa) observed by immunoblotting. The first half of the trout myomaker protein (1–220 aa) is similar to the 221-aa mouse myomaker protein, whereas the second half (222–234 aa) does not correspond to any known motifs and arises from two protein extensions. The first extension (∼70 aa) apparently appeared with the radiation of the bony fish clade Euteleostei, whereas the second extension (up to 236 aa) is restricted to the superorder Protacanthopterygii (containing salmonids and pike) and corresponds to the insertion of minisatellites having a length of 30 nucleotides. According to gene expression analyses, trout myomaker expression is consistently associated with the formation of new myofibers during embryonic development, postlarval growth, and muscle regeneration. Using cell-mixing experiments, we observed that trout myomaker has retained the ability to drive the fusion of mouse fibroblasts with C2C12 myoblasts.

Our work reveals that trout myomaker has fusogenic function despite containing two protein extensions. Skeletal muscle is largely composed of myofibers: multinucleated cells whose formation depends on fusion of progenitor cells known as myoblasts. Myoblasts proliferate, differentiate into myocytes, fuse to form multinucleated myotubes, and finally mature into functional myofibers. The fusion process is a critical step in the formation and regeneration of muscle. In mammals, some proteins involved in myoblast fusion have been identified, but the complete molecular mechanisms that coordinate this process are not completely understood. Nephrin, a cell surface protein, has been shown to be essential for myocyte fusion in mice and normal muscle development in zebrafish (1Sohn R.L. Huang P. Kawahara G. Mitchell M. Guyon J. Kalluri R.

As shown in our previous study, myomaker expression in the zebrafish myotome is no longer detected just before hatching (14Landemaine A. Rescan P.-Y. Gabillard J.-C.

However, no data are available on myomaker characteristics and function in nonmodel species. In the present study, we characterized the trout myomaker gene, which encodes an unexpectedly longer 434-aa protein. Whole-mount in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that myomaker is expressed not only in hyperplasic zones of embryonic myotome but also in postlarval myotomal muscle. Our results clearly show that myomaker up-regulation was associated with myotube formation during muscle regeneration and the in vitro fusion of trout myocytes. Furthermore, the 14 tandem repeats (minisatellites) in the coding region of the trout myomaker gene do not disrupt its fusogenic capacity. We performed a BLAST search in the trout genome (17Berthelot C. Brunet F. Chalopin D. Juanchich A. Bernard M. Noel B. Bento P. Da Silva C. Labadie K. Alberti A. Aury J.-M. Louis A. Dehais P.

Although the number of exons was similar to the zebrafish gene, the length of the trout myomaker protein was twice as long as the zebrafish and the mouse orthologs, which only comprise 220 and 221 aa, respectively (9Millay D.P. O'Rourke J.R. Sutherland L.B. Bezprozvannaya S. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N.

As shown in the protein sequence alignment, the first half (1–220 aa) of the trout myomaker protein sequence was well-conserved, sharing 88 and 71% identity with the zebrafish and mouse myomaker proteins, respectively. An analysis of the amino acid sequence showed that the two cysteines essential for myomaker fusogenic function were also present in the trout myomaker protein at positions 219 and 220. The second half of the protein (221–434 aa) was encoded by the sixth exon and exhibited no homology with the zebrafish or mouse myomaker protein. We amplified exons 5 and 6 from total trout cDNA and sequenced the PCR product to confirm our in silico results. The sequencing results confirmed the splicing site of the sixth exon of the myomaker cDNA, leading to an ORF encoding 434 aa. Moreover, using the sequence identified in the trout genome (GSONMG00014531001), we performed BLAST searches in the trout expressed sequence tag database (NCBI) and the PhyloFish database (16Pasquier J.

Furthermore, using a specific antibody against trout myomaker, we confirmed that the molecular mass of trout myomaker (∼40 kDa) is double that of mouse myomaker by Western blotting (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4). The in silico analysis revealed the presence of three E-boxes (CANNTG) in the myomaker promoter.Figure 2Myomaker protein has an apparent molecular mass of 40–42 kDa.

B, Cos7 cells were transfected with the full-length (WT) or truncated (dRE) myomaker cDNA, and Western blotting was performed 48 h later. A band of similar apparent mass (∼40 kDa) was observed with the full-length, and no band was observed with the truncated form of myomaker (aa 1–219) that did not contain the epitope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) According to the results of the synteny analysis, the trout myomaker gene is located in the FAM163b–Adamtsl2–Tmem8c–TCC16–Slc2a8 locus (Fig. 3) in scaffold_482. Interestingly, a synteny conservation of this locus was observed within a region of chromosome 2 of the zebrafish genome and in the equivalent chromosomal region of the mouse genome (Chr 2). A whole genome duplication event occurred in salmonid genome, leading to the duplication of some genes in the trout genome. Indeed, we were also able to identify another myomaker syntenic group in scaffold_2354 of the trout genome (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, whereas complete copies of the FAM163b, Adamtsl2, and Slc2a8 genes were identified in this scaffold, only a partial sequence homologous to trout myomaker was identified between Adamtsl2 and TCC16. This sequence contained several deletions and stop codons in the ORF, thus coding for an additional but nonfunctional myomaker gene (data not shown). Trout myomaker protein is 214 aa longer than the zebrafish orthologs because of a long C-terminal extension. A BLAST analysis of this protein extension revealed no homology with known motifs or other proteins. Surprisingly, a thorough analysis of the sequence encoding this extension revealed the presence of 14 tandem repeats of 30 nt coding amino acids 265–424 (Fig. 1). The sequences of these 14 repeats are very well-conserved with each other, with sequence identities ranging from 70 to 96% (Fig. 4A). These tandem repeats are therefore minisatellites, as defined in a previous study (18Gemayel R. Vinces M.D. Legendre M. Verstrepen K.J. Variable tandem repeats accelerate evolution of coding and regulatory sequences.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44 (20809801): 445-47710.1146/annurev-genet-072610-155046Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We performed protein alignments and a phylogenetic analysis of myomaker proteins from several species to determine whether these minisatellites were widespread in teleost fish (Fig. 5). All tetrapod sequences were found to encode a myomaker protein of 220–221 aa. A protein of the same length (221 aa) was observed in ancestral nonteleost fish, such as the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), and teleosts that belong to the Otocephala lineage, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), cave fish (Astyanax mexicanus), and herring (Clupea harengus). In sharp contrast, all teleosts examined that belonged to Euteleostei had a myomaker protein containing more than 220 aa. More specifically, in all considered Neoteleostei species, myomaker consisted of 283–289 aa, and the first 220 aa were highly similar (>85% identity) to the zebrafish myomaker protein. Within the Neoteleostei species, the extension of 63–69 aa was well-conserved (∼70% identity) but showed no homology with zebrafish or mouse myomaker. Species belonging to the Protacanthopterygii lineage, such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and pike (Esox lucius) contained a myomaker gene encoding a protein with more than 434 aa. After sequence alignment, we discovered that all these species contained an insertion of minisatellites within the first extension of 63–69 aa specific to the Neoteleostei (Fig. 4B). Although the number of minisatellites varied by species (14 for trout, 17 for salmon, and 15 for pike), the minisatellite sequences were highly conserved (>70%) among these species. In contrast, only two minisatellites remain in the nonfunctional copy of myomaker.Figure 5Phylogenetic analysis of myomaker in tetrapods and teleosts.

In contrast, the myomaker transcript was not detected in the undifferentiated myogenic dermomyotome-like epithelium surrounding the primary myotome. In addition, we measured myomaker expression in white muscle from 4-, 8-, and 18-month-old fish weighing 15, 150, and 1500 g, respectively (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, at all three stages, myomaker expression was readily detected in trout muscle samples, although its expression decreased as body weight increased. We analyzed trout myomaker expression in several tissues by qRT-PCR to determine whether myomaker expression was restricted to muscle. As shown in Fig. 6C, the myomaker gene was only expressed in white and red muscle and was expressed at similar levels between both muscle types. In line with this observation, Western blotting analysis revealed the presence of myomaker protein only in myocyte extract and not in other tissues (Fig. S4). In vertebrates, the formation of new muscle fibers occurs during both embryogenesis and muscle regeneration. We studied the kinetic of muscle regeneration in adult trout following mechanical muscle injury to determine whether myomaker is up-regulated during regeneration of trout muscle. The histological analysis (Fig. 7A) showed that 16 days after muscle injury (Fig. 7B), a large number of myofibers was degraded, with many immune cells infiltrating into the injury site. After 30 days, all the injured fibers disappeared and were replaced with connective tissue containing small (<20 μm) round cells labeled in green (Fig. 7C). Immunocytofluorescence staining revealed that these cells expressed myosin and that their nuclei was often centrally positioned (Fig. 7D). These observations point out the presence of newly formed muscle fibers on day 30, showing that muscle regeneration had occurred. Importantly, uninjured control muscle did not contain small nascent myofibers (Fig. 7A), indicating that myofiber formation had ceased at this stage, consistent with the results reported by Rescan et al. (20Rescan P.-Y. Rallière C. Lebret V. Fretaud M. Analysis of muscle fibre input dynamics using a myog:GFP transgenic trout model.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218 (25657208): 1137-114210.1242/jeb.113704Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). According to the qRT-PCR analysis, myogenin and myomaker gene expression in muscle did not change until day 16 postinjury (Fig. 7, E and F). In contrast, 30 days after injury, a sharp increase in both myomaker and myogenin expression was observed in the injured muscle. Indeed, myogenin and myomaker were expressed at 10- and 15-fold higher levels, respectively, in injured muscle compared with control muscle (Fig. 7, E and F). After extracting trout satellite cells from white muscle, we induced the differentiation and fusion of trout satellite cells in vitro (22Gabillard J.C. Sabin N. Paboeuf G. In vitro characterization of proliferation and differentiation of trout satellite cells.Cell Tissue Res. 2010; 342 (21086139): 471-47710.1007/s00441-010-1071-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR analysis showed an increase (2-fold) in myomaker expression soon after satellite cell differentiation was induced (Fig. 8A). By performing immunofluorescence staining with an anti-myosin antibody, we quantified the number of small myotubes (2 < nuclei ≤ 4) and large myotubes (5 ≤ nuclei) during differentiation (Fig. 8B). Small myotubes began to form 1 day after the induction of differentiation and were strongly increased up to day 3 of differentiation, whereas large myotubes appeared on day 2. These results showed that the maximum level of myocyte fusion occurred on days 2 and 3 and correlate with highest myomaker expression. We performed cell-mixing experiments using myoblasts (C2C12) and fibroblasts expressing GFP infected with a vector expressing trout myomaker cDNA to determine whether trout myomaker is able to drive cell fusion. We first showed that the infection of fibroblasts with trout myomaker construct actually resulted in the production of trout myomaker protein using immunofluorecence staining (Fig. 9A). After 5 days of co-culture, we failed to observe any fusion between C2C12 and the GFP-empty fibroblasts (Fig. 9B). In contrast, GFP-myomaker–infected fibroblasts were able to fuse with C2C12 myoblasts. We implemented a dual split luciferase assay previously used to monitor cell–cell fusion to accurately quantify the fusion between fibroblasts and myoblasts (21Ishikawa H. Meng F. Kondo N. Iwamoto A. Matsuda Z. Generation of a dual-functional split-reporter protein for monitoring membrane fusion using self-associating split GFP.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2012; 25 (22942393): 813-82010.1093/protein/gzs051Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this assay, luciferase activity is only reconstituted when fusion between fibroblasts and myoblasts occurs (Fig. 9C). Fibroblasts were infected with full-length or truncated trout myomaker along with mouse myomixer to increase the basal fusion level (5Bi P. Ramirez-Martinez A. Li H. Cannavino J. McAnally J.R. Shelton J.M. Sánchez-Ortiz E. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Control of muscle formation by the fusogenic micropeptide myomixer.Science. 2017; 356 (28386024): 323-32710.1126/science.aam9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This assay confirms that the full-length myomaker protein is able to drive the fusion of fibroblasts with myoblasts. Surprisingly, deletion of trout myomaker C terminus resulted in a significant reduction in cell fusion. Together, our results confirmed that trout myomaker drove heterologous cell fusion, although to a lesser extent than mouse myomaker (Fig. 9D). Given the unique structure of the trout myomaker protein, we aimed in this study to determine whether the expression and function of myomaker are conserved in this nonmodel fish. Based on sequence alignments and phylogenetic and syntenic analyses, we identified the unique functional myomaker gene in the trout genome. We also identified a myomaker pseudogene containing long deletions in the coding region. This pseudogene probably results from the salmonid-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) that occurred ∼96 α 5 million years ago (17Berthelot C. Brunet F. Chalopin D. Juanchich A. Bernard M. Noel B. Bento P. Da Silva C. Labadie K. Alberti A. Aury J.-M. Louis A. Dehais P. Bardou P. Montfort J. et al.The rainbow trout genome provides novel insights into evolution after whole-genome duplication in vertebrates.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (24755649)3657 10.1038/ncomms4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). After the WGD, the salmonid genome underwent a process of gene pseudogenization that resulted in the loss of half of the duplicated genes in the trout genome (17Berthelot C. Brunet F. Chalopin D. Juanchich A. Bernard M. Noel B. Bento P. Da Silva C. Labadie K. Alberti A. Aury J.-M. Louis A. Dehais P. Bardou P. Montfort J. et al.The rainbow trout genome provides novel insights into evolution after whole-genome duplication in vertebrates.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (24755649)3657 10.1038/ncomms4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that the second identified myomaker gene originated from the WGD and became a pseudogene through deletions and mutations. The trout myomaker protein consists of 434 aa with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa and is nearly twice the size of the mouse and zebrafish myomaker proteins. As shown in the sequence alignment, the first 220 aa of trout myomaker are 71–88% similar to the mouse and zebrafish orthologs. Importantly, trout myomaker contains the two conserved cysteines essential for mouse myomaker function (12Millay D.P. Gamage D.G. Quinn M.E. Min Y.-L. Mitani Y. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Structure–function analysis of myomaker domains required for myoblast fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, the hydrophobicity analysis (data not shown) strongly suggested the presence of seven transmembrane domains, similar to the mouse myomaker protein (9Millay D.P. O'Rourke J.R. Sutherland L.B. Bezprozvannaya S. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N.

Together, these results highlight the strong evolutionary conservation of the first section of the trout myomaker protein. The additional amino acid stretch in trout myomaker mainly consists of 14 tandem repeats of 30 nucleotides in the coding region. A tandem repeat is a short sequence (unit) that is repeated several times in a head-to-tail orientation (18Gemayel R. Vinces M"
https://openalex.org/W2919652957,"The basidiomycete Chondrostereum purpureum (Silverleaf fungus) is a saprotroph and plant pathogen commercially used for combatting forest “weed” trees in vegetation management. However, little is known about its lignocellulose-degrading capabilities and the enzymatic machinery that is responsible for the degradative potential, and it is not yet clear to which group of wood-rot fungi it actually belongs. Here, we sequenced and analyzed the draft genome of C. purpureum (41.2 Mbp) and performed a quantitative proteomic approach during growth in submerged and solid-state cultures based on soybean meal suspension or containing beech wood supplemented with phenol-rich olive mill residues, respectively. The fungus harbors characteristic lignocellulolytic hydrolases (GH6 and GH7) and oxidoreductases (e.g. laccase, heme peroxidases). High abundance of some of these genes (e.g. 45 laccases, nine GH7) can be explained by gene expansion, e.g. identified for the laccase orthogroup ORTHOMCL11 that exhibits a total of 18 lineage-specific duplications. Other expanded genes families encode for proteins more related to a pathogenic lifestyle (e.g. protease and cytochrome P450s). The fungus responds to the presence of complex growth substrates (lignocellulose, phenolic residues) by the secretion of most of these lignocellulolytic and lignin-modifying enzymes (e.g. alcohol and aryl alcohol oxidases, laccases, GH6, GH7). Based on the genetic and enzymatic constitution, we consider the ‘marasmioid’ fungus C. purpureum as a ‘phytopathogenic’ white-rot fungus (WRF) that possesses a complex extracellular enzyme machinery to accomplish efficient lignocellulose degradation during both saprotrophic and phytopathogenic life phases."

The obtained results show how the method proposed is effective and computational tractable. It allows to improve performance on an extended version of the double-pole balancing problem, outperform the best available human-designed controllers on a car racing problem, and generate effective solutions for a swarm robotic problem. The comparison of different algorithms indicates that the CMA-ES and xNES methods, that operate by optimizing a distribution of parameters, represent the best options for the evolution of robust neural network controllers."

The study’s main objective was to assess the association between facility ownership and long-term, all-cause mortality. Research design and methods We conducted a mortality follow-up study on a cohort of 611 nursing-home residents in the city Madrid, Spain, from their 1998–1999 baseline interviews up to September 2013. Residents lived in three types of facilities: public, subsidized and private, which were also sub-classified according to size (number of beds). Residents’ information was collected by interviewing the residents themselves, their caregivers and facility physicians. We used time-to-event multivariable models and inverse probability weighting to estimate standardized mortality risk differences. Results After a 3728 person-year follow-up (median/maximum of 4.8/15.2 years), 519 participants had died. In fully-adjusted models, the standardized mortality risk difference at 5 years of follow-up between medium-sized private facilities and large-sized public facilities was -18.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -33.4 to -4.5%), with a median survival (95% CI) of 3.6 (0.5 to 6.8) additional years. The fully-standardized 5-year mortality difference (95% CIs) between for-profit private facilities and not-for-profit public institutions was -15.1% (-31.1% to 0.9%), and the fully-standardized median survival difference (95% CIs) was 3.0 (-1.7 to 7.7) years. Discussion and implications These results are compatible with an association between factors related with the ownership of facilities and the long-term mortality risk of their residents. One of these factors, the facility size, could partly explain this association."
https://openalex.org/W2918735737,"Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an autologous immunomodulatory cell therapy that consists of the ex vivo collection of mononuclear cells (MNCs), which are irradiated with UVA in the presence of the photosensitizing agent 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) to induce cell apoptosis. This photoactivated cell preparation is then reinfused into the patient. While the clinical benefits of ECP are well-demonstrated, no study has yet characterized the influence of variations in the composition of the cell preparation on the efficacy of ECP in vitro. Here, we describe a standardized methodology for the in vitro assessment of ECP that uses the human lymphoma T-cell line and mimics the clinical procedure. By quantifying cell apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and 8-MOP consumption, we used this approach to characterize the specific influence of key variables on the cellular response to ECP. We found that (i) increases in hematocrit and plasma concentrations attenuated the cellular response to ECP; (ii) plasma concentration was the only variable tested that influenced 8-MOP consumption; and (iii) the loss of efficacy due to variations in the concentration of certain blood components could be counteracted by modulating the UVA dose. This methodology may enable evaluation of other leukapheresis preparation protocols and better determination of the optimal working parameters for ECP."
https://openalex.org/W2949663570,"Aim of the study was to compare metabolic response of leg skeletal muscle during functional electrical stimulation-driven unloaded cycling (FES) to that seen during volitional supine cycling.Fourteen healthy volunteers were exposed in random order to supine cycling, either volitional (10-25-50 W, 10 min) or FES assisted (unloaded, 10 min) in a crossover design. Whole body and leg muscle metabolism were assessed by indirect calorimetry with concomitant repeated measurements of femoral venous-arterial differences of blood gases, glucose, lactate and amino acids.Unloaded FES cycling, but not volitional exercise, led to a significant increase in across-leg lactate production (from -1.1±2.1 to 5.5±7.4 mmol/min, p<0.001) and mild elevation of arterial lactate (from 1.8±0.7 to 2.5±0.8 mM). This occurred without widening of across-leg veno-arterial (VA) O2 and CO2 gaps. Femoral SvO2 difference was directly proportional to VA difference of lactate (R2 = 0.60, p = 0.002). Across-leg glucose uptake did not change with either type of exercise. Systemic oxygen consumption increased with FES cycling to similarly to 25W volitional exercise (138±29% resp. 124±23% of baseline). There was a net uptake of branched-chain amino acids and net release of Alanine from skeletal muscle, which were unaltered by either type of exercise.Unloaded FES cycling, but not volitional exercise causes significant lactate production without hypoxia in skeletal muscle. This phenomenon can be significant in vulnerable patients' groups."

We were interested in whether rhythmic sensory stimulation would promote significant changes in fibromyalgia and associated symptoms, and whether treatment effects would differ between two distinct treatment parameters. Fifty patients with a formal diagnosis of fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to two test groups. One group received vibrotactile stimulation from a continuous sine wave single-frequency stimulation (40 Hz) for 30 minutes, five days per week, over five weeks, concomitant with usual care. The second group completed the same treatment protocol but received a different stimulation, consisting of random and intermittent complex wave gamma-range vibrotactile stimulation. Fibromyalgia symptoms, pain severity and interference, depression symptoms, quality of life and sleep quality were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results indicated that there were statistically significant changes from baseline to post-treatment in measures of fibromyalgia symptom severity, pain interference, depression, and sleep quality. However, treatment outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. These findings provide preliminary evidence that gamma-frequency rhythmic vibroacoustic stimulation may decrease fibromyalgia symptoms and ease associated comorbidities, opening new avenues for further investigation of the effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation on chronic pain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2919576453,"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) suppresses apoptosis and plays key roles in the development, growth, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Therefore, XIAP has recently attracted much attention as a potential antineoplastic therapeutic target, requiring elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying its biological activities. Here, using shRNA-mediated gene silencing, immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR, anchorage-independent growth assay, and invasive assay, we found that XIAP's RING domain, but not its BIR domain, is crucial for XIAP-mediated up-regulation of c-Myc protein expression in human bladder cancer (BC) cells. Mechanistically, we observed that the RING domain stabilizes c-Myc by inhibiting its phosphorylation at Thr-58 and that this inhibition is due to activated ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at Ser-9. Functional studies further revealed that c-Myc protein promotes anchorage-independent growth and invasion stimulated by the XIAP RING domain in human BC cells. Collectively, the findings in our study uncover that the RING domain of XIAP supports c-Myc protein stability, providing insight into the molecular mechanism and role of c-Myc overexpression in cancer progression. Our observations support the notion of targeting XIAP's RING domain and c-Myc in cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2918575720,"The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (LeConte) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an economically important pest of corn in the northern United States. Some populations have developed resistance to management strategies including transgenic corn that produces insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Knowledge of insect dispersal is of critical importance for models of resistance evolution. Larval density affects survival in the field, and stress from crowding often affects facultative long-distance dispersal of adult insects. In this study, we used laboratory flight mills to characterize western corn rootworm flight performance as a function of larval rearing density. Larvae were reared under three densities and the resulting adult females were either allowed to fly voluntarily for 22 h or forced to fly specified durations. For both experiments we also measured lifetime fecundity following flight. The three rearing densities placed differential levels of stress on individuals, as evidenced by decreased survival to adulthood and decreased size of adults at greater rearing density. When larvae were reared under crowded conditions the resulting females were more likely to engage in flight activity, including long uninterrupted flights lasting >10 min, than those reared under low density conditions. Flight and egg production are both energy intensive processes. However, we found no evidence in either voluntary or forced flight experiments of a tradeoff between flight activity and female fecundity. The results suggest that females emerging from high density populations in cornfields are more likely to disperse and disperse farther than those emerging from low density populations. These results are important because they imply that variation in population density in the landscape will affect dispersal, which may in turn require computer models of resistance evolution to incorporate multiple dispersal rates arising from varying larval densities among fields."
https://openalex.org/W2919137200,"Swine influenza viruses (SIVs), the causal agents of swine influenza, are not only important to control due to the economic losses in the swine industry, but also can be pandemic pathogens. Vaccination is one of the most relevant strategies to control and prevent influenza infection. Current human vaccines against influenza induce strain-specific immunity and annual update is required due to the virus antigenic shift phenomena. Previously, our group has reported the use of conserved hemagglutinin peptides (HA-peptides) derived from H1-influenza virus as a potential multivalent vaccine candidate. Immunization of swine with these HA-peptides elicited antibodies that recognized and neutralized heterologous influenza viruses in vitro and demonstrated strong hemagglutination-inhibiting activity. In the present work, we cloned one HA-peptide (named NG34) into a plasmid fused with cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA4) which is a molecule that modifies T cell activation and with an adjuvant activity interfering with the adaptive immune response. The resulting plasmid, named pCMV-CTLA4-Ig-NG34, was administered twice to animals employing a needle-free delivery approach. Two studies were carried out to test the efficacy of pCMV-CTLA4-Ig-NG34 as a potential swine influenza vaccine, one in seronegative and another in seropositive pigs against SIV. The second one was aimed to evaluate whether pCMV-CTLA4-Ig-NG34 vaccination would overcome maternally derived antibodies (MDA). After immunization, all animals were intranasally challenged with an H3N2 influenza strain. A complete elimination or significant reduction in the viral shedding was observed within the first week after the challenge in the vaccinated animals from both studies. In addition, no challenged heterologous virus load was detected in the airways of vaccinated pigs. Overall, it is suggested that the pCMV-CTLA4-Ig-NG34 vaccine formulation could potentially be used as a multivalent vaccine against influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2919171951,"A series of traction force microscopy experiments involving pairs of keratocytes migrating on compliant substrates were analyzed. We observed several instances where keratocytes that are about to collide turn before they touch. We term this phenomenon collision avoidance behavior and we propose that the turning is caused by the substrate mediated elastic interactions between the cells. A multipole analysis of the cell traction reveals that the left-right symmetry of the keratocyte traction pattern is broken during collision avoidance events. The analysis further shows that the cell migration direction reorients before the principal traction dipoles as the cells turn. Linear elasticity theory is used to derive the cell-cell interaction energy between pairs of keratocytes. The traction force applied by each cell is modeled as a two points (dipole) or three points (tripod) force model. We show that both models predict that cells that are about to collide in a head-on manner will turn before touching. The tripod model is further able to account for the quadrupole components of the traction force profile that we observed experimentally. Also, the tripod model proposes a mechanism that may explain why cells tend to scatter with a finite angle after a collision avoidance event. A relationship between the scattering angle and the traction force quadrupole moment is also established. Dynamical simulations of migrating model cells are further used to explain the emergence of other cell pair trajectories that we observed experimentally."

T-loops are considered to be an evolutionarily-conserved structure for protecting linear chromosome termini. However, many questions regarding the establishment and maintenance of t-loops in cells remain to be elucidated (11Luke-Glaser S. Poschke H. Luke B. Getting in (and out of) the loop: regulating higher order telomere structures.Front. Oncol. 2012; 2 (23226680): 180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, very little is known about how t-loops are negotiated by DNA replication machinery during S phase. The mechanism underlying the formation and maintenance of t-loops through the cell cycle is also poorly understood. Moreover, it is not yet known what happens to telomeres/chromosome ends if massive t-loops are disrupted in vivo. The answers to these questions are the foundation for better understanding the function of t-loops in protection of chromosome ends. One of the roadblocks to answering these critical questions is the lack of a reliable, sensitive, and commonly used method to detect t-loops in cells and/or cell-free extracts. Electron microscopy (EM) and the recently developed stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) are valuable tools for studying and visualizing t-loops, but they are low-throughput and labor-intensive, and they require equipment that is prohibitive for most research groups (5Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97 (10338214): 503-51410.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 12Doksani Y.

Therefore, an accurate and sensitive biochemical method to detect t-loops is needed to stimulate progress in this important research area. Based on the structural similarity between t-loop and well-characterized rolling circle replication intermediates (RCIs), the RCIs migrate in a unique size- and shape-dependent sigmoid pattern in nondenatured two-dimensional (2D) agarose gel electrophoresis (13Cohen S. Agmon N. Yacobi K. Mislovati M. Segal D.

Here, we report the development of a nondenatured 2D agarose gel electrophoresis method (2D gel method) that readily detects t-loops from human cells. The method was carefully validated by a series of biochemical assays as well as conventional EM. Evidence presented here supports the following four major conclusions about the formation and dynamics of t-loops in human cells: 1) t-loops are present throughout the cell cycle; 2) t-loop formation is tightly coupled with telomere replication; 3) less condensed telomeric chromatin showed fewer t-loops in human ALT cells; and 4) trichostatin A (TSA)-induced hyperacetylation of telomeric nucleosomes promotes disruption of t-loops that is associated with the formation of APBs and increased frequency of T-SCE, indicating the homologue recombination occurs at unprotected telomeres. RCIs are a unique and extensively characterized type of replication intermediate. RCIs and t-loops are similar to each other, both comprising a circular dsDNA and a linear dsDNA tail. Several methods are available to detect RCIs based on their structure, including those based on characteristic gel electrophoretic mobility. RCIs with a fixed loop size but different tail lengths are detected as an “eyebrow”-like shape (see inset in Fig. 1A) (13Cohen S. Agmon N. Yacobi K. Mislovati M. Segal D. Evidence for rolling circle replication of tandem genes in Drosophila.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (16091629): 4519-452610.1093/nar/gki764Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Cohen S.

Genome Res. 2009; 124 (19556784): 327-33810.1159/000218136Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The multiple “eyebrows” formed from RCIs with different loop sizes converged into a sigmoidal arc (Fig. 1A) (13Cohen S. Agmon N. Yacobi K. Mislovati M. Segal D. Evidence for rolling circle replication of tandem genes in Drosophila.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (16091629): 4519-452610.1093/nar/gki764Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we exploit nondenatured two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis followed by hybridization to a telomere-specific probe (2D gel method) to specifically detect t-loops in human cells. Given the structural similarity between RCIs and t-loops, both consisting of loops and tails that highly variable in size (5Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97 (10338214): 503-51410.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), a telomeric sigmoidal arc is expected. As expected, a sigmoidal arc of telomere-homologous species is detected in genomic DNA from nonsynchronized HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). To exclude the possibility that the sigmoidal arc is the unique structure of HeLa, we detected the sigmoidal arcs using a 2D gel method in a variety of human cells, including primary cells (human T cell and fibroblast BJ), telomerase-positive cells (HeLa S3 and A549), and ALT cells (VA13 and U2OS) (Fig. 1C). The sigmoidal arcs were observed in all of these cells, some of which have been observed by EM in a previous study (5Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97 (10338214): 503-51410.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). It seems that the sigmoidal arc represents a special telomeric structure, which predicted t-loops. The DNA in the sigmoidal arc region of the 2D gel method was characterized by biochemical methods as follows. First, the sigmoidal arc gradually decreased as the temperature rises to 65 °C, the temperature at which most t-loops dissociate (Fig. 2A), indicating the low thermal stability of t-loops. Second, the sigmoidal arc is barely detected in undigested HeLa genomic DNA (Fig. S1A), indicating that the telemetric DNA in the sigmoidal arc is not extrachromosomal DNA. Trace amounts of the sigmoidal arc signal may be due to DNA breakage at the subtelomere or telomere during purification. Third, after a second round of purification of HeLa genomic DNA, the sigmoidal arc decreased, suggesting that this DNA fraction is not an artifact of genomic DNA caused by purification (Fig. S1B). Fourth, in the experiments described above, HeLa genomic DNA was purified without proteinase treatment at 55 °C to preserve the t-loop structure. To test the susceptibility of putative t-loop structures to protease digestion, the cell lysate was digested with proteinase K at 55 °C (10 min) before purified by phenol/chloroform extraction or chromatography on QiagenTM resin. Results showed that the sigmoidal arcs were almost the same as Fig. S1B (left panel) (Fig. S1C). This result suggests that structures in the sigmoidal arc are not mediated by obligate protein–protein or protein–DNA interactions. In addition, HeLa genomic DNA was digested with Plasmid-SafeTM DNase, an ATP-dependent exonuclease that degrades linear dsDNA to deoxymononucleotides, but not circular dsDNA. Based solely on its enzymatic properties, Plasmid-SafeTM DNase should remove the linear tail from a t-loop, leaving a loop (circular DNA) (Fig. 2, B and C). Plasmid-SafeTM DNase digested ∼80% of linear telomeres, removing the sigmoidal arc entirely, while generating a new signal corresponding to circular telomeric DNA (Fig. 2C). In t-loop structure, the telomeric ssDNA 3′-G–rich overhang is thought to invade into the dsDNA telomeric repeat tract, adapting a D-loop structure (5Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97 (10338214): 503-51410.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Under this circumstance, the invading G-rich strand would be resistant to exonucleolytic digestion because of lacking a free 3′-end. To test this hypothesis, HeLa genomic DNA was digested with exonuclease I (ExoI), analyzed by 2D gel method, and hybridized under native and denatured conditions to G-strand- or C-strand–specific probes. The exact same amount of undigested DNA was used as control. Results showed that DNA in the sigmoidal arc includes G-rich ssDNA (C-probe hybridization) but not C-rich ssDNA (G-probe hybridization) (Fig. 2D). In particular, most of the signal detected by the C-rich probe in the sigmoidal arc is resistant to ExoI, whereas little of the signal detected by the C-rich probe in the linear chromosome fraction is ExoI-resistant (Fig. 2D). These results support the conclusion that the DNA structures in the sigmoidal arc are t-loops, in which the G-rich 3′-ssDNA telemetric overhang invades into the dsDNA telomeric repeat tract to adapt a D-loop. Moreover, we observed the t-loop structure in the sigmoidal arc by EM. The area of gel corresponding to sigmoidal arc (equal to linear fragments ≥7.5 kb in length) was excised (Fig. S2, A and B), and DNA was purified and analyzed by EM. In three independent experiments, we observed about 400 DNA molecules, of which 74 were scored as t-loops (Fig. S2C) with an average size of 11.7 kb, consistent with excised telomeric DNA ranging from 7.5 to 15 kb (Fig. S2D). The loop sizes were varied from 2 to 16 kb with a mean size of 7.8 kb, whereas the t-loop tails range from 0.3 to 11.3 kb with the average length of 3.8 kb (Fig. S2D). Tail lengths of t-loops were positively correlated with their loop sizes, indicating that the bigger loop carries a longer tail in general (Fig. S2E). Linear telomere-homologous molecules excised from the linear dsDNA region were used as a control (Fig. S2A). No t-loop–shaped structure was observed (data not shown). In conclusion, this evidence suggested that the sigmoidal arc detected by the 2D gel method represents t-loops. TRF2 is a component of shelterin that protects telomeres by repression of ATM signaling and non-homologous end-joining (17Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. p53- and ATM-dependent apoptosis induced by telomeres lacking TRF2.Science. 1999; 283 (10037601): 1321-132510.1126/science.283.5406.1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 18Sfeir A. de Lange T.

Previous studies have revealed that TRF2 has the ability to generate t-loops in vitro (5Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97 (10338214): 503-51410.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 19Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. T-loop assembly in vitro involves binding of TRF2 near the 3′ telomeric overhang.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11574485): 5532-554010.1093/emboj/20.19.5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also demonstrated that TRF2 is required for the formation or maintenance of t-loops in vivo (12Doksani Y. Wu J.Y. de Lange T. Zhuang X. Super-resolution fluorescence imaging of telomeres reveals TRF2-dependent T-loop formation.Cell. 2013; 155 (24120135): 345-35610.1016/j.cell.2013.09.048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To further verify this conclusion, we constructed TRF2 knockout HeLa cells with two stably expressed sgRNAs (targeting TRFH domain of TRF2) and inducible Cas9 (Fig. 3A), and cells with empty vector were used as control. After 7 days of doxycycline treatment, TRF2 is depleted in sgTRF2 cells (Fig. S3A), resulting in a dramatic increase of chromosome end fusion (from 0 to 32.3%) and a decrease in free chromosome end compared with the control (Fig. 3, D and E, and Fig. S3B). Results of the 2D gel method were quantified, and the percentage of t-loops was calculated as described under “Experimental procedures.” Compared with control, t-loops were dramatically decreased in TRF2-deficient cells (30.7 to 12.2%) (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, we found that inhibition of ATM phosphorylation in TRF2-deficient cells could suppress the chromosome fusion but barely rescue the t-loop disruption (Fig. 3, B–E, and Fig. S3), which means TRF2 is directly responsible for t-loop formation or maintenance, consistent with a previous study (12Doksani Y. Wu J.Y. de Lange T. Zhuang X. Super-resolution fluorescence imaging of telomeres reveals TRF2-dependent T-loop formation.Cell. 2013; 155 (24120135): 345-35610.1016/j.cell.2013.09.048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Our previous studies implied that telomeres must be unfolded (i.e. not in t-loops) at least twice during S phase in proliferating cells: once during S phase to permit telomere replication, and then again at the end of S phase to permit C-strand fill-in DNA synthesis (20Zhao Y. Sfeir A.J. Zou Y. Buseman C.M. Chow T.T. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Telomere extension occurs at most chromosome ends and is uncoupled from fill-in in human cancer cells.Cell. 2009; 138 (19665970): 463-47510.1016/j.cell.2009.05.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Dai X. Huang C. Bhusari A. Sampathi S. Schubert K. Chai W. Molecular steps of G-overhang generation at human telomeres and its function in chromosome end protection.EMBO J. 2010; 29 (20639858): 2788-280110.1038/emboj.2010.156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this instance, t-loops could either refold immediately after they are replicated, or they could remain unfolded in an open linear confirmation until C-strand fill-in synthesis completed at the end of S phase. To verify the folding states of t-loops during replication, HeLa S3 cells were synchronized at G1/S, released into S phase, and then harvested at different time points, corresponding to early S, middle S, late S/G2, and G1 phase (Fig. 4A). Genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed for the presence of t-loops by the 2D gel method. The results demonstrate that the amount of t-loops is fairly constant throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with the hypothesis that telomeres unfold and immediately refold after being replicated during S phase; therefore, they must unfold and refold a second time to allow for C-strand fill-in DNA synthesis at late S/G2 phase. To further confirm that t-loop unfolding/refolding is tightly coupled to telomere replication, HeLa S3 cells were synchronized at G1/S phase, released into S phase for 3 h, pulse-labeled for 1 h with BrdU during mid-S phase, and harvested immediately (Fig. 4C). DNA was isolated from the pulse-labeled cells and separated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation according to density. Telomere DNA that had replicated during the 1-h pulse (labeled with BrdU) was divided from unreplicated and previously replicated DNA (unlabeled) (Fig. 4D) and analyzed by 2D gel method. It shows that both newly synthesized leading and lagging telomeres have t-loops (Fig. 4E). Because the density-labeled telomeres represent the cohort of telomeres that were replicating during the 1-h time window of exposure to BrdU, these data indicate that t-loops refold immediately following telomere replication. The structure of t-loops was compared in primary cells (T cells and BJ fibroblasts), telomerase-positive cells (HeLa S3 and A549), and ALT cells (VA13 and U2OS) (Fig. 1C). The results show that the percentage of t-loops was varied by cell type as follows: T cells from human blood, 24.5%; BJ fibroblasts, 16.9%; HeLa cells, 17.2%; A549, 17%; U2OS cells, 6.5%; VA13 cells, 7.3% (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with a previous report that 6.9–9.2% of telomeres have t-loops in ALT cells and 15–40% in telomerase-positive HeLa cells (5Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97 (10338214): 503-51410.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 22Cesare A.J.

In addition, it has been reported that telomeric DNA is less compacted in ALT cells than in telomerase-positive cancer cells (25Episkopou H. Draskovic I. Van Beneden A. Tilman G. Mattiussi M. Gobin M. Arnoult N. Londoño-Vallejo A. Decottignies A. Alternative lengthening of telomeres is characterized by reduced compaction of telomeric chromatin.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24500201): 4391-440510.1093/nar/gku114Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To explore whether the decondensation of telomeric chromatin is correlated with the low abundance of t-loops, non-ALT HeLa cells were treated with TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that regulates histone acetylation indirectly. After 48 h of treatment with TSA, the density of acetylated histones H3 and H4 on telomeres increased, suggesting the level of telomeric heterochromatin decreased (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistently, micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assay showed that up to 60% of telomeric DNA in HeLa cells treated with TSA was digested to mononucleosomes by MNase (16-min digestion), similar to U2OS cells (65% of telomeric DNA was converted to mononucleosomes by MNase digestion for 16 min), whereas only 30% of telomeric DNA in untreated HeLa cells was converted to mononucleosomes under comparable digestion conditions (Fig. 5C). When HeLa cells were exposed to TSA, the intensity of the t-loops decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, D and E). In addition, we also observed that the t-circle is increased after TSA treatment, a mechanism that needs further research (Fig. 5D). Linear chromosomes lacking functional telomeres induce a DNA damage response (DDR), one marker of which is formation of 53BP1 foci at DNA damage sites (26Panier S. Boulton S.J. Double-strand break repair: 53BP1 comes into focus.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 (24326623): 7-1810.1038/nrm3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Here, the colocalization of antibody to 53BP1 and a hybridization probe for telomeric DNA sequences were used to assess the abundance of telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) (27Takai H. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. DNA damage foci at dysfunctional telomeres.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13 (12956959): 1549-155610.1016/S0960-9822(03)00542-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The results showed that ∼58% of TSA-treated HeLa cells have at least one TIF, compared with ∼20% in DMSO-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating the DNA damage level increasing at telomere in cells exposed to TSA. Aggregates of nuclear protein, known as PML bodies, begin to accumulate after HeLa cells are exposed to TSA (Fig. 6C). Some of these PML bodies are associated with telomeric chromatin, forming APBs. 48 h after treatment with TSA, the number of PML bodies, as well as APBs, in HeLa cells increased dramatically, to include up to 50% of telomeres (data not shown). Quantitative analysis showed >9 APBs/cell in ∼27% of TSA-treated cells and >4 APBs/cell in ∼64% cells (Fig. 6D). In control cells treated with DMSO, 98% cells had <3 APBs/cell and in 42% of the cells, no APBs were detected (Fig. 6D). APBs are often associated with telomeric recombination in human ALT cells (28Pickett H.A. Reddel R.R. Molecular mechanisms of activity and derepression of alternative lengthening of telomeres.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26581522): 875-88010.1038/nsmb.3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To this end, chromosome orientation-FISH (CO-FISH) was performed to determine the frequency of T-SCEs (29Bailey S.M. Cornforth M.N. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. Goodwin E.H. Strand-specific postreplicative processing of mammalian telomeres.Science. 2001; 293 (11577237): 2462-246510.1126/science.1062560Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). By scoring the signals on 1688 and 1633 chromosomes from control cells and TSA-treated cells, respectively, we found that although T-SCEs were rare in control cells (2.4%), TSA-treated cells exhibited a more than 10-fold increase in the frequency of T-SCEs (30.7%) (Fig. 6, E and F), indicating the occurrence of HR at telomeres. In addition, it is possible that telomeric HR, which is induced by TSA-mediated chromatin decondensation, subsequently results in loss of t-loops. If so, unchanged t-loops would be expected if HR is inhibited in TSA-treated cells. To test this, HeLa cells were co-treated with TSA and B02, the latter is a specific inhibitor of Rad51 that plays an essential role in HR. We still observed a decrease of t-loops (Fig. S4, A and B) and generation of a t-circle, demonstrating that the loss of t-loops is not caused by HR. We also showed that TSA and/or B02 treatment did not significantly alter telomere length (Fig. S4C). In addition, telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) level transcribed from 6p, 7p, XpYp, 7q, and 17q telomeres was not changed by TSA treatment (Fig. S4D).

Breeding for BSR resistance traditionally relies upon cultivated sunflower germplasm that has only partial resistance thus lacking an effective resistance against the pathogen. In this study, we report the transfer of BSR resistance from sunflower wild species, Helianthus praecox, into cultivated sunflower and molecular assessment of the introgressed segments potentially associated with BSR resistance using the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. Eight highly BSR-resistant H. praecox introgression lines (ILs), H.pra 1 to H.pra 8, were developed. The mean BSR disease incidence (DI) for H.pra 1 to H.pra 8 across environments for four years ranged from 1.2 to 11.1%, while DI of Cargill 270 (susceptible check), HA 89 (recurrent parent), HA 441 and Croplan 305 (resistant checks) was 36.1, 31.0, 19.5, and 11.6%, respectively. Molecular assessment using GBS detected the presence of H. praecox chromosome segments in chromosomes 1, 8, 10, 11, and 14 of the ILs. Both shared and unique polymorphic SNP loci were detected throughout the entire genomes of the ILs, suggesting the successful transfer of common and novel introgression regions that are potentially associated with BSR resistance. Downy mildew (DM) disease screening and molecular tests revealed that a DM resistance gene, Pl17, derived from one of the inbred parent HA 458 was present in four ILs. Introgression germplasms possessing resistance to both Sclerotinia BSR and DM will extend the useful diversity of the primary gene pool in the fight against two destructive sunflower diseases."

However, the antichlamydial mechanism of BAH is not known. Whereas 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (i.e., SNP1-4) were identified in a rare Chlamydia variant with a low level of BAH resistance, termed MCR, previous studies failed to establish a causal effect of any particular SNP(s). In the present work, we performed recombination to segregate the four SNPs. Susceptibility tests indicate that the R51G GrgA allele is both necessary and sufficient for the low level of BAH resistance. Thus, the Chlamydia-specific transcription factor GrgA either is a direct target of BAH or regulates BAH susceptibility. We further confirm an extremely low rate of BAH resistance in Chlamydia. Our findings warrant exploration of GrgA as a therapeutic and prophylactic target for chlamydial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2917136422,"“What is the biggest challenge of graduate school?” an undergrad asked the panel of graduate students at an event I helped organize last summer. “Not letting the support from my community turn into pressure,” one panelist responded. That answer might have surprised some, who probably expected to hear about experiments that didn't work or trudging through literature reviews. But I understood exactly what she meant. The speaker was an African-American woman. I am a member of an underrepresented minority group myself, pursuing a doctoral degree in chemistry, so her comment resonated with me. With my oral candidacy exam approaching, I needed to find a way to keep well-meaning support from adding to my stress.

Throughout my education, friends and family have expected me to take advantage of every opportunity I come across because I may not get the same chance again. Members of my community expect me to give outstanding performances everywhere I go because I represent them and our culture. Mentors expect that I will never give up. This has been a great source of motivation, but also of pressure. And when I heard the panelist echo my experience, I understood that I needed to educate my community about how their comments made me feel—and how to keep their support from becoming oppressive.

I remembered a conversation with a mentor that illustrated how the right language can make all the difference. At the end of my first year of graduate school, I wrestled with an overwhelming desire to leave the program with a master's degree. I was accustomed to hearing “Don't give up” and “You have to finish”—words that were meant to be motivational. Instead, they made me feel I would be a disappointment if I left, and that I owed it to all the people who had helped me get there to stick with it.

After discussing the pros and cons of leaving with my mentor, she offered a response that was completely different from what I expected. “I support any decision you make,” she said. “I will always be proud of you and your achievements.” Hearing this simple, explicit statement of support, I felt every muscle of my body loosen. I hadn't realized that the prospect of disappointing her was causing me so much stress. Perhaps counterintuitively, knowing that she was behind me no matter what helped me decide to stick with my Ph.D. program.

My mentor knew the right thing to say, but we can't expect the same from everyone. Now, when people in my community—always with the best intentions—say something that creates pressure and stress and makes me feel bad, I tell them and we talk about it. This was a bit awkward at first. But they want to support me, so I need to give them the tools to do that.

Sometimes, friends and family ask me, “How long until you get your degree?” As many grad students will agree, this question is a stress trigger. Now, I respond by telling them that I prefer to be asked “How is your progress in your program?” and I explain why. When I tell my supporters about the challenges I'm experiencing in grad school, they frequently say things like “You'll be OK. Don't stress out,” thinking that this is what I need to hear. I now explain to them that it has the opposite effect of what they intended. It makes me feel I'm doing something wrong or that my feelings are invalid. Instead, I tell them that I prefer to hear, “Do you need someone to talk to? How can I help you through this rough time?” I've started to notice a change. It has required a lot of patience and reminders, but these days, I get fewer stress-inducing questions and comments.

All graduate students, but especially those of us who are members of underrepresented groups, carry a weight of expectations from family, friends, and community. Being explicit about our needs and opening up the lines of communication with supporters is a starting point for making the journey less stressful.

https://openalex.org/W2919332965,"There are more than one billion smokers globally according to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2017. Every year tobacco use causes nearly 6 million deaths worldwide. To deal with the smoking epidemic, society needs to invest resources efficiently. In this paper we introduce an optimal control model to determine the optimal mix of smoking initiation and cessation interventions to reduce smoking. We construct the model to reach a smoking prevalence target within a specific time horizon while minimizing cost. Our performance measure captures the cost of policy implementation over time, adjusting for inflation and social discounting. The analytical solutions to the model are presented in forms of ordinary differential equations (ODE). We then conduct several numerical simulations using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and empirical studies. We first present analytical solutions for our model to solve for the optimal mix of smoking interventions. Then we simulate a public health policy to achieve 5% smoking prevalence in the US by 2030 using different combinations of real-life interventions. We examine the optimal trajectories, allocative efficiency and annual total cost of smoking cessation and initiation interventions. We find consistent results across all simulations. Our specific example reveals that the most efficient way to reach stated goal is by targeting cessation interventions first, and then gradually shifting resources to initiation interventions over time. While our numerical results are specific to the intervention we selected, our framework can be easily expanded to consider other potential interventions. We discuss the implications of our approach for the formulation of dynamic public health policies."

This knowledge could facilitate consideration by fishery managers of additional regulatory alternatives with high likelihoods of meeting program objectives, minimal disruption to fishing operations and lifestyles, and high levels of acceptance and compliance from the fishing fleet. In this case study, we interviewed Pacific halibut fishermen (n = 76) in four communities across Southeast Alaska, to document their preferences about different types of data collection methods on their vessels. We demonstrate how to use interviewing to gather preference data from a relatively small group of fishermen and get a reliable snapshot of preferences across an entire region. Pairwise comparisons from interviews were analyzed using a three-stage analytic hierarchy process model. Results characterize the variability of fishermen's preferences about data collection methods."
