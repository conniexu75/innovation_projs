https://openalex.org/W2083395714,"URINE, collected from the nephridial bladders of the common Indian cattle leech, Hirudinaria granulosa (Savigny), and analysed by the Conway's microdiffusion technique1, was found to contain 28.3–48.1 µg of ammonia nitrogen (mean 35.8) ; 12.9–34.9 µg of urea nitrogen (mean 21.6) ; 180–897 µg of total nitrogen (mean 484.2) ; and 45.8–228.7 µg of non-protein nitrogen (mean 126.6) per ml. Supernatant fluid of the centrifugated (4,000 r.p.m.) urine contained 30.6–55.6 µg of ammonia nitrogen (mean 44.9) ; 10.5–15.9 µg of urea nitrogen (mean 13.3) ; and 99.9–276.0 µg of total nitrogen (mean 177.6) per ml. 8–69 per cent of the total nitrogen present in the urine was found to be due to bacterial growth in it. Deproteinized urine, analysed chromatographically, contained approximately 50–60 µg of amino-acid nitrogen per ml. On an average 31.8 per cent of the total non-protein nitrogen is thus excreted by the leeches in the form of ammonia nitrogen, 13.7 per cent in the form of urea nitrogen, the rest of the non-protein nitrogen being mainly due to amino-acids."

https://openalex.org/W2046961394,"PREVIOUS experiments1 have shown that the levels of plasma free fatty acids in the domestic fowl, which are markedly elevated in laying birds2, were also increased in immature pullets by treatment with œstrogens. They were not altered by the injection of crude extracts of pig anterior pituitary, though these extracts were effective in increasing the levels of plasma free fatty acids in the rabbit. Since this difference could be attributed to the difference in responsiveness of the two species to a hormone derived from a third species, it was not possible to decide whether or not the increased levels of plasma free fatty acids, normally found in the laying bird, were directly due to the secretion of pituitary hormones or to some other cause. Experiments to investigate this point have now been performed with preparations of avian pituitary powder. Pituitaries from broiler hens were dehydrated and powdered by dispersing in acetone in a high-speed macerator. The whole pituitary was used since the object of the experiment was to determine whether there was a pituitary factor, present in either lobe, capable of increasing the plasma free fatty acids in the bird. The results of experiments in which suspensions of the whole powder, in saline, were administered to birds and to rabbits are presented in Table 1. It is clear that avian pituitary powder, though effective in increasing the levels of plasma free fatty acids in the rabbit, had little effect in the domestic fowl."
https://openalex.org/W2072796630,A RECENT investigation into the effect of repetition of items on paired associate learning1 has indicated that a single repetition of a presented item aids learning but that further presentations of the item yield no additional benefit. The design of this experiment involved the replacement of all items not correctly associated on a trial with randomly selected new items. In this way the list length remained constant (12 paired associate letter-number items) and all items on each trial had yet to be learned.

https://openalex.org/W2985467298,"CONCERNING Prof. C. A. Pannett's communication1, under the above title, confirming, and the further elucidation of the observation made by me2, his essential findings can conveniently be resumed schematically thus:"
https://openalex.org/W2985495709,"IN a recent article1, Dr. Ponnamperuma arrives at the conclusion that “life is only a special and complicated property of matter and au fond there is no difference between a living organism and lifeless matter”. For many years the evidence has been strongly in favour of this view and, in any event, experience in every field of science suggests powerfully that Nature is a unity which can be divided into categories for Human convenience, but that we must never lose sight of the fact that the boundaries so introduced are man-made and possess no counterparts in reality; it was to be expected, therefore, that the division of matter into living and dead forms would ultimately be revealed as an artificial one, convenient for distinguishing extreme cases such as man and rock, but quite inappropriate when consideration is being given to intermediate forms such as the virus and the newly dead. Nature appears to satisfy a principle of continuity, so that the marking of dividing lines on her fabric may throw into relief some features of the pattern, but it inevitably distorts the reality."
