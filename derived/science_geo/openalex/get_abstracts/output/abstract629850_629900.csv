https://openalex.org/W2924487690,"Molecular biology provides an inspiring proof-of-principle that chemical systems can store and process information to direct molecular activities such as the fabrication of complex structures from molecular components. To develop information-based chemistry as a technology for programming matter to function in ways not seen in biological systems, it is necessary to understand how molecular interactions can encode and execute algorithms. The self-assembly of relatively simple units into complex products1 is particularly well suited for such investigations. Theory that combines mathematical tiling and statistical–mechanical models of molecular crystallization has shown that algorithmic behaviour can be embedded within molecular self-assembly processes2,3, and this has been experimentally demonstrated using DNA nanotechnology4 with up to 22 tile types5–11. However, many information technologies exhibit a complexity threshold—such as the minimum transistor count needed for a general-purpose computer—beyond which the power of a reprogrammable system increases qualitatively, and it has been unclear whether the biophysics of DNA self-assembly allows that threshold to be exceeded. Here we report the design and experimental validation of a DNA tile set that contains 355 single-stranded tiles and can, through simple tile selection, be reprogrammed to implement a wide variety of 6-bit algorithms. We use this set to construct 21 circuits that execute algorithms including copying, sorting, recognizing palindromes and multiples of 3, random walking, obtaining an unbiased choice from a biased random source, electing a leader, simulating cellular automata, generating deterministic and randomized patterns, and counting to 63, with an overall per-tile error rate of less than 1 in 3,000. These findings suggest that molecular self-assembly could be a reliable algorithmic component within programmable chemical systems. The development of molecular machines that are reprogrammable—at a high level of abstraction and thus without requiring knowledge of the underlying physics—will establish a creative space in which molecular programmers can flourish. A set of 355 self-assembling DNA ‘tiles’ can be reprogrammed to implement many different computer algorithms—including sorting, palindrome testing and divisibility by three—suggesting that molecular self-assembly could be a reliable algorithmic component in programmable chemical systems."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the infiltration of TAMs into HCC microenvironment is largely unclear. Recent studies have reported that alteration of mitochondrial nucleoid structures induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release into the cytosol, which is recognized as mtDNA stress, and consequently regulates innate immunity. Here we aimed to investigate whether mitochondrial fission induces mtDNA stress and then promotes TAM infiltration and HCC progression. Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR were used to detect cytosolic mtDNA content in HCC cells. The relationship between the expression of mitochondrial fission key regulator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and the percentage of CD163 (a marker of TAMs)-positive cells was investigated in HCC tissues using immunohistochemistry. Finally, the effect of Drp1 overexpression in HCC cells on recruitment and polarization of TAMs was investigated. Our data showed that increased Drp1 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of TAMs into HCC tissues. Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission induced the cytosolic mtDNA stress to enhance the CCL2 secretion from HCC cells by TLR9-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway, and thus promoted the TAM recruitment and polarization. Depleting cytosolic mtDNA using DNase I or blocking TLR9 pathway by TLR9 antagonist, siRNA for TLR9 or p65 in HCC cells with Drp1 overexpression significantly decreased the recruitment and polarization of TAMs. Blocking CCR2 by antagonist significantly reduced TAM infiltration and suppressed HCC progression in mouse model. In conclusion, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of TAM infiltration in HCC by mitochondrial fission-induced mtDNA stress."
https://openalex.org/W2922944575,"Evidence has increasingly mounted in recent decades that outflows of matter and energy from the central parsecs of our Galaxy have shaped the observed structure of the Milky Way on a variety of larger scales. On scales of ~15 pc, the Galactic centre has bipolar lobes that can be seen in both X-rays and radio, indicating broadly collimated outflows from the centre, directed perpendicular to the Galactic plane. On far larger scales approaching the size of the Galaxy itself, gamma-ray observations have identified the so-called Fermi Bubble features, implying that our Galactic centre has, or has recently had, a period of active energy release leading to a production of relativistic particles that now populate huge cavities on both sides of the Galactic plane. The X-ray maps from the ROSAT all-sky survey show that the edges of these cavities close to the Galactic plane are bright in X-rays. At intermediate scales (~150 pc), radio astronomers have found the Galactic Centre Lobe, an apparent bubble of emission seen only at positive Galactic latitudes, but again indicative of energy injection from near the Galactic centre. Here we report the discovery of prominent X-ray structures on these intermediate (hundred-parsec) scales above and below the plane, which appear to connect the Galactic centre region to the Fermi bubbles. We propose that these newly-discovered structures, which we term the Galactic Centre Chimneys, constitute a channel through which energy and mass, injected by a quasi-continuous train of episodic events at the Galactic centre, are transported from the central parsecs to the base of the Fermi bubbles."
https://openalex.org/W2925126312,"Changing forest cover is a key driver of local climate change worldwide, as it affects both albedo and evapotranspiration (ET). Deforestation and forestation are predicted to have opposing influences on surface albedo and ET rates, and thus impact local surface temperatures differently. Relationships between forest change, albedo, ET, and local temperatures may further vary regionally, as the strengths of warming by albedo effects and cooling by ET effects vary with latitude. Despite these important relationships, the magnitude of forest cover effects on local surface temperature across the globe remains unclear. Using recently-released global forest change data, we first show that forestation and deforestation have pervasive and opposite effects on LST, ET and albedo worldwide. Deforestation from 2000 to 2010 caused consistent warming of 0.38 ± 0.02 (mean ± SE) and 0.16 ± 0.01°C in tropical and temperate regions respectively, while forestation caused cooling in those regions of -0.18 ± 0.02 and -0.19 ± 0.02°C. Tropical forests were particularly sensitive to the climate effects of forest change, with forest cover losses of ~50% associated with increased LST of 1.08 ± 0.25°C, whereas similar forest cover gains decreased LST by -1.11 ± 0.26°C. Secondly, based on a new structural equation model, we show that these changes on LST were largely mediated by changes in albedo and ET. Finally, based on this model, we show that predicted forest changes in Brazil associated with a business-as-usual land use scenario through 2050 may increase LST up to 1.45°C. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanistic inter-relationships between forest change and changes in albedo, ET and LST, and provide additional evidence that forestation has the potential to reverse deforestation impacts on local climate, especially in tropical and temperate regions."

https://openalex.org/W2923286781,"A cross-sectional survey of men attending antenatal care with their partners at three London Maternity Units. We assessed level of pregnancy planning using the partner version of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP), preconception health behaviours, and whether they had sought information and health professional advice before conception.We recruited 573 men (91% response rate). Mean age was 34 years, 86% were in employment or full time education and 66% had a degree. Half were overweight or obese, 16% were still smoking and 79% had consumed alcohol in the three months before conception. Of 250 men answering questions about medication, a third were taking medication with potentially adverse effects on male reproductive health, while 23% reported taking pre-pregnancy vitamins. 46.9% had looked at information about pregnancy from a variety of sources, including online, before their partner became pregnant. Assessed by the LMUP, 74% of pregnancies were planned. Male 'planners' were more likely than other men to reduce smoking, reduce alcohol consumption and to eat more healthily in preparation for pregnancy. However, 57% took no action to improve their health.In a sample of relatively educated men accompanying their partners on an antenatal visit, nearly half had made at least one positive health behaviour change before pregnancy, but half were overweight or obese and a third were on medication that could impair male reproductive health. These findings, together with a high prevalence of alcohol consumption and smoking, indicate the need for greater paternal preconception health awareness and care. Innovative ways to promote positive messages about fatherhood, including medication review as part of preconception care, should be evaluated for impact on improving paternal reproductive health and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2925166956,"Cachexia is frequently accompanied by severe metabolic derangements, although the mechanisms responsible for this debilitating condition remain unclear. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4, a critical regulator of cellular energetic metabolism, was found elevated in experimental models of cancer, starvation, diabetes, and sepsis. Here we aimed to investigate the link between PDK4 and the changes in muscle size in cancer cachexia. High PDK4 and abnormal energetic metabolism were found in the skeletal muscle of colon-26 tumor hosts, as well as in mice fed a diet enriched in Pirinixic acid, previously shown to increase PDK4 levels. Viral-mediated PDK4 overexpression in myotube cultures was sufficient to promote myofiber shrinkage, consistent with enhanced protein catabolism and mitochondrial abnormalities. On the contrary, blockade of PDK4 was sufficient to restore myotube size in C2C12 cultures exposed to tumor media. Our data support, for the first time, a direct role for PDK4 in promoting cancer-associated muscle metabolic alterations and skeletal muscle atrophy.-Pin, F., Novinger, L. J., Huot, J. R., Harris, R.

https://openalex.org/W2924536847,"Recent advances in mass spectrometry-based techniques have inspired research into lipidomics, a subfield of ‘–omics’, which aims to identify and quantify large numbers of lipids in biological extracts. Although lipidomics is becoming increasingly popular as a screening tool for understanding disease mechanisms, it is largely unknown how the lipidome naturally varies by age and sex in healthy individuals. We aimed to identify cross-sectional associations of the human lipidome with ‘physiological’ ageing, using plasma from 100 subjects with an apolipoprotein E (APOE) E3/E3 genotype, and aged between 56 to 100 years. Untargeted analysis was performed by liquid chromatography coupled-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and data processing using LipidSearch software. Regression analyses confirmed a strong negative association of age with the levels of various lipid, which was stronger in males than females. Sex-related differences include higher LDL-C, HDL-C, total cholesterol, particular sphingomyelins (SM), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing phospholipid levels in females. Surprisingly, we found a minimal relationship between lipid levels and body mass index (BMI). In conclusion, our results suggest substantial age and sex-related variation in the plasma lipidome of healthy individuals during the second half of the human lifespan. In particular, globally low levels of blood lipids in the ‘oldest old’ subjects over 95 years could signify a unique lipidome associated with extreme longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2924573369,"Dolphin stranding events occur frequently in Florida and Massachusetts. Dolphins are an excellent sentinel species for toxin exposures in the marine environment. In this report we examine whether cyanobacterial neurotoxin, β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), is present in stranded dolphins. BMAA has been shown to bioaccumulate in the marine food web, including in the muscles and fins of sharks. Dietary exposure to BMAA is associated with the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles and β-amyloid plaques in nonhuman primates. The findings of protein-bound BMAA in brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer’s disease has advanced the hypothesis that BMAA may be linked to dementia. Since dolphins are apex predators and consume prey containing high amounts of BMAA, we examined necropsy specimens to determine if dietary and environmental exposures may result in the accumulation of BMAA in the brains of dolphins. To test this hypothesis, we measured BMAA in a series of brains collected from dolphins stranded in Florida and Massachusetts using two orthogonal analytical methods: 1) high performance liquid chromatography, and 2) ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. We detected high levels of BMAA (20–748 μg/g) in the brains of 13 of 14 dolphins. To correlate neuropathological changes with toxin exposure, gross and microscopic examinations were performed on cortical brain regions responsible for acoustico-motor navigation. We observed increased numbers of β-amyloid+ plaques and dystrophic neurites in the auditory cortex compared to the visual cortex and brainstem. The presence of BMAA and neuropathological changes in the stranded dolphin brain may help to further our understanding of cyanotoxin exposure and its potential impact on human health."
https://openalex.org/W2925085490,"Background Chronic pain is among the most burdensome conditions. Its prevalence ranges between 12% and 30% in Europe, with an estimated 21% among Austrian adults. The economic impact of chronic pain from a societal perspective, however, has not been sufficiently researched. This study aims to provide an estimate of the societal costs for working-age adults with chronic pain in Austria. It explores the impact of sex, number of pain sites, self-reported pain severity, health literacy and private health insurance on costs associated with chronic pain. Methods A bottom-up cost-of-illness study was conducted based on data collected from 54 adult patients with chronic pain at three Viennese hospital outpatient departments. Information on healthcare costs including out-of-pocket expenses and productivity losses due to absenteeism and informal care were collected over 12 months. Resource use estimates were combined with unit costs and mean costs per patient were calculated in € for year 2016. Results Mean annual societal costs were estimated at EUR 10191. Direct medical costs were EUR 5725 including EUR 1799 out-of-pocket expenses (mainly pain relieving activities and private therapy). Productivity losses including informal care amounted to EUR 4466. Total costs for women and patients with three or more pain sites were significantly higher. No association with health literacy was found but there was a tendency towards higher out-of-pocket expenses for patients with complementary private health insurance. Conclusion This study is the first to provide a comprehensive assessment of the individual and societal burden of chronic pain in Austria. It highlights that chronic pain is associated with substantial direct medical costs and productivity losses. Patient costs may show systematic differences by health insurance status, implying a need for future research in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2923728492,"School socioeconomic status (SES) is studied primarily as a variable to explain academic achievement; however, few previous studies have investigated how SES can influence individual student’s academic achievement. The present study used a national representative sample of 10,784 grade 7 to 9 students (53.2% boys and 46.8% girls) in mainland China to examine the links between school SES and students’ math and Chinese achievements, including the math and Chinese teacher-student relationships as mediating factors. The parents provided family socioeconomic information and the students reported on their teacher-student relationships. Achievements in math and Chinese were assessed using standardized tests. Multilevel mediation analyses revealed that school SES was positively related to students’ math and Chinese achievements. Moreover, the link between school SES and students’ math achievement was partially mediated by students’ perception of the math teacher-student relationship. The Chinese teacher-student relationship had no mediating effect. This study indicated that school SES can influence individual student’s academic achievement via their perception of teacher-student relationship. The poverty and lack of resources is obvious, yet low SES schools could make efforts in improving teacher-student relationship’s quality to promote students’ academic performance. Meanwhile, low SES schools should receive more attention from policymakers to improve teaching quality and school climate. Furthermore, the study findings could be used for future research on the gap between low and high SES schools."
https://openalex.org/W2924097665,"Current pharmacological intervention for the treatment of osteolytic bone diseases such as osteoporosis focuses on the prevention of excessive osteoclastic bone resorption but does not enhance osteoblast-mediated bone formation. In our study, we have shown that 4-iodo-6-phenylpyrimidine (4-IPP), an irreversible inhibitor of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), can inhibit receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and potentiate osteoblast-mediated mineralization and bone nodule formation in vitro. Mechanistically, 4-IPP inhibited RANKL-induced p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by preventing the interaction of MIF with thioredoxin-interacting protein-p65 complexes. This led to the suppression of late osteoclast marker genes such as nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1, resulting in impaired osteoclast formation. In contrast, 4-IPP potentiated osteoblast differentiation and mineralization also through the inhibition of the p65/NF-κB signaling cascade. In the murine model of pathologic osteolysis induced by titanium particles, 4-IPP protected against calvarial bone destruction. Similarly, in the murine model of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis, 4-IPP treatment ameliorated the bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency by reducing osteoclastic activities and enhancing osteoblastic bone formation. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for the pharmacological targeting of MIF for the treatment of osteolytic bone disorders.-Zheng, L., Gao, J., Jin, K., Chen, Z., Yu, W., Zhu, K., Huang, W., Liu, F., Mei, L., Lou, C., He, D.

https://openalex.org/W2922757291,"Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged globally as an important pathogen, since it has been recognized as a cause of microcephaly and other neurologic processes and sequalae in newborns. The virus shares homology with Hepaciviruses and therefore may be a cause of hepatitis. We sought to characterize ZIKV replication in hepatocyte-derived cell lines. Huh7.5 and HepG2 cells were infected with ZIKV and replication potential was evaluated by multiple methods including plaque assay, qRT-PCR, negative-strand ZIKV RNA production, and ZIKV NS1 protein production. Growth curves in cells and supernatant were compared to replicative capacity in Vero cells. Overall, viral replication in both hepatocyte lines approximated that observed in the Vero cells. Cell cytopathology was observed after 3 days of infection and apoptosis markers increased. Transmission electron microscopy revealed evidence of viral capsids in cells and negative staining revealed ZIKV particles in the supernatant. Conclusions: Hepatocyte-derived cell lines are permissive for ZIKV replication and produce an overt cytopathic effect consistent with development of an acute viral hepatitis. Further evaluation of replication and injury is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2923331169,"KGF-1 plays an important role in the wound healing process. Loss of the KGF-1 gene in diabetic mice attenuated the process of wound contraction, suggesting that KGF-1 contributes to wound contraction. However, the mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the role of KGF-1 in diabetic wound contraction, we established a keratinocyte–fibroblast co-culture system. Concentrations of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) in conditioned supernatant treated with KGF-1 (KGF-1 group), tk;4KGF-1-neutralizing antibody (anti-KGF-1 group), TGF-β1 (TGF-β1tk;1 group), KGF-1 and TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody (KGF-1 + anti-TGF-β1 group) were tested by ELISA. Conditioned medium was added to fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL) to investigate the effect of KGF-1 on fibroblastqj contraction. TGF-β1, Col-I, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were examined by Western blotting. A diabetic rat wound model was utilized to evaluate wound morphology, histology, immunohistochemistry, and protein expression in wound tissue after treatment with KGF-1. ELISA assays revealed that the concentration of TGF-β1 in the conditioned supernatant in the KGF-1 group was significantly higher. The contractile capacity of FPCL stimulated by conditioned medium derived from the KGF-1 group was significantly elevated; however, the contractile activity of FPCL induced by KGF-1 was attenuated by TGF-β1–neutralizing antibody. The Western blot results suggest that KGF-1 is able to stimulate TGF-β1 activation with increased Col-I, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, and α-SMA expression. Diabetic wounds treated with KGF-1 had a higher degree of contraction with significantly higher expression of TGF-β1, Col-I, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, and α-SMA.

https://openalex.org/W2923174437,"Interventions that preserve motor neurons or restore functional motor neuroplasticity may extend longevity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Delivery of neurotrophins may potentially revive degenerating motor neurons, yet this approach is dependent on the proper subcellular localization of neurotrophin receptor (NTR) to plasmalemmal signaling microdomains, termed membrane/lipid rafts (MLRs). We previously showed that over-expression of synapsin-driven caveolin-1 (Cav-1) (SynCav1) increases MLR localization of NTR [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB)], promotes hippocampal synaptic and neuroplasticity, and significantly improves learning and memory in aged mice. The present study crossed a SynCav1 transgene-positive (SynCav1+) mouse with the mutant human superoxide dismutase glycine to alanine point mutation at amino acid 93 (hSOD1G93A) mouse model of ALS. When compared with hSOD1G93A, hSOD1G93A/SynCav1+ mice exhibited greater body weight and longer survival as well as better motor function. Microscopic analyses of hSOD1G93A/SynCav1+ spinal cords revealed preserved spinal cord α-motor neurons and preserved mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, hSOD1G93A/SynCav1+ spinal cords contained more MLRs (cholera toxin subunit B positive) and MLR-associated TrkB and Cav-1 protein expression. These findings demonstrate that SynCav1 delays disease progression in a mouse model of ALS, potentially by preserving or restoring NTR expression and localization to MLRs.—Sawada, A., Wang, S., Jian, M., Leem, J., Wackerbarth, J., Egawa, J., Schilling, J.

https://openalex.org/W2924434884,"Aging and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) can increase the risk of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are highly susceptible to cognitive dysfunction. Recent research has indicated that metformin, a prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes, may affect cognitive function; however, findings regarding its efficacy are largely controversial. The current study reported that a 5-mo metformin administration (300 mg/kg/d) starting at 13 mo old improved the spatial memory of ApoE3-target replacement (TR) mice, not ApoE4-TR mice. It found that in aged ApoE3-TR mice, metformin treatment, at a molecular level, inhibited AMPK activity, increased insulin signaling, and activated mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, resulting in an enhanced expression of postsynaptic proteins; but the response of the neuronal AMPK activity and insulin signaling to metformin was blunt in aged ApoE4-TR mice. Meanwhile, metformin treatment also increased the phosphorylation of tau in both ApoE3-TR and ApoE4-TR mice, implying that metformin may have side effects in human. These findings suggest that metformin can improve the cognitive performance of aged mice in an APOE genotype-dependent manner, which provides empirical insights into the clinical value of metformin for ApoE4- and age-related AD prevention and treatment.-Zhang, J., Lin, Y., Dai, X., Fang, W., Wu, X., Chen, X.

https://openalex.org/W2963168676,"Given a real-world graph, how can we measure relevance scores for ranking and link prediction? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides an excellent measure for this and has been applied to various applications such as friend recommendation, community detection, anomaly detection, etc. However, RWR suffers from two problems: 1) using the same restart probability for all the nodes limits the expressiveness of random walk, and 2) the restart probability needs to be manually chosen for each application without theoretical justification. We have two main contributions in this paper. First, we propose Random Walk with Extended Restart (RWER), a random walk based measure which improves the expressiveness of random walks by using a distinct restart probability for each node. The improved expressiveness leads to superior accuracy for ranking and link prediction. Second, we propose SuRe (Supervised Restart for RWER), an algorithm for learning the restart probabilities of RWER from a given graph. SuRe eliminates the need to heuristically and manually select the restart parameter for RWER. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method provides the best performance for ranking and link prediction tasks."

Early identification of the severity of illness and timely provision of critical care is helpful; however, the risk factors associated with mortality remain unclear and controversial. We undertook a retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients with myocarditis in a tertiary care referral hospital for over 12 years to identify the predictive factors of mortality. Demographics, presentation, laboratory test results, echocardiography findings, and treatment outcomes were obtained. Regression analyses revealed the clinical parameters for predicting mortality. During the 12-year period, 94 patients with myocarditis were included. Of these, 16 (17%) patients died, with 12 succumbing in the first 72 hours after admission. Fatal cases more commonly presented with arrhythmia, hypotension, acidosis, gastrointestinal symptoms, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, and elevated isoenzyme of creatine kinase and troponin I levels than nonfatal cases. In multivariate analysis, troponin I > 45 ng/mL and left ventricular ejection fraction < 42% were significantly associated with mortality. Pediatric myocarditis had a high mortality rate, much of which was concentrated in the first 72 hours after hospitalization. Children with very high troponin levels or reduced ejection fraction in the first 24 hours were at higher risk of mortality, and targeting these individuals for more intensive therapies may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2924833205,"This article describes the procedures used to isolate pure B-cell populations from whole blood using various Miltenyi magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) bead Isolation kits. Such populations are vital for studies investigating the functional capacity of B-cells, as the presence of other cell types may have indirect effects on B-cell function through cell-cell interactions or by secretion of several soluble molecules. B-cells can be isolated by two main approaches: 1) Negative selection—in which B-cells remain “untouched” in their native state; this is advantageous as it is likely that B-cells remain functionally unaltered by this process. 2) Positive selection–in which B-cells are labelled and actively removed from the sample. We used three Negative B-cell isolation kits as well as the Positive B-cell isolation kit from Miltenyi and compared the purity of each of the resulting B-cells fractions. Contamination of isolated B-cell fractions with platelets was the conclusive finding for all of the isolation techniques tested. These results illustrate the inefficiency of current available MACS B-cell isolation kits to produce pure B-cell populations, from which concrete findings can be made. As such we suggest cell sorting as the preferred method for isolating pure B-cells to be used for downstream functional assays."
https://openalex.org/W2923947489,"Recent studies indicated that osteopontin (OPN) was involved in the genesis and progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); however, its role in congenital heart disease–associated PAH (CHD/PAH) remains unknown. Our results showed that OPN was increased in lungs and plasma of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome; moreover, OPN and αvβ3-integrin expression levels were augmented in rat lungs exposed to systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. Cell culture assay demonstrated that distal pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from rat lungs suffering from volume and pressure overload exhibited enhanced proliferation compared with those from healthy rats. Mechanical stretch (20% at 1 Hz) increased OPN expression and activated ERK1/2 and protein kinase B (Akt) signal pathway in distal PASMCs from healthy rats. Interestingly, OPN enhanced the proliferation and migration of PASMCs while blocking αvβ3-integrin with neutralizing antibody LM609 or Arg-Gly-Asp peptidomimetic antagonist cyclo(Ala-Arg-Gly-Asp-3-aminomethylbenzoyl) (XJ735), rectified the proliferative and migratory effects of OPN, which were partially mediated via ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Furthermore, surgical correction of systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, particularly XJ735 supplementation after surgical correction of systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, significantly alleviated the pulmonary hypertensive status in terms of pulmonary hemodynamic indices, pulmonary vasculopathy, and right ventricular hypertrophy. In summary, OPN alteration in lungs exposed to systemic-to-pulmonary shunt exerts a deteriorative role in pulmonary vascular remodeling through modulating the proliferation and migration of PASMCs, at least in part, via αvβ3-ERKl/2 and αvβ3-Akt signaling pathways. Antagonizing OPN receptor αvβ3-integrin accelerated the regression of pulmonary vasculopathy after surgical correction of systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with CHD/PAH.—Meng, L., Liu, X., Teng, X., Gu, H., Yuan, W., Meng, J., Li, J., Zheng, Z., Wei, Y., Hu, S.

Standard methodological requirements were followed during translation and cultural adaptation of the English version of the BERNCA-R questionnaire into Polish.

Cronbach’s alpha and inter-item correlations were used to analyse the internal consistency of the Polish BERNCA-R questionnaire. The mean total BERNCA-R score was 1.9 points (SD = 0.74) on a scale of 0–4. Cronbach’s alpha for the unidimensional scale was 0.96. The mean inter-item correlation was 0.4 (range 0.1–0.84), which indicates high internal consistency. A single-factor solution demonstrated stable loadings above 0.5 for almost all items of the Polish BERNCA-R questionnaire. The study using the Polish BERNCA-R questionnaire demonstrated that the instrument is valid and reliable for use in investigating care rationing in groups of Polish nurses."
https://openalex.org/W2923128159,"Mycobacteriophages express various peptides/proteins to infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Particular attention has been paid to mycobacteriophage-derived endolysin proteins. We herein characterized a small mycobacteriophage-derived peptide designated AK15 with potent anti-M. tb activity. AK15 adopted cationic amphiphilic α-helical structure, and on the basis of this structure, we designed six isomers with increased hydrophobic moment by rearranging amino acid residues of the helix. We found that one of these isomers, AK15-6, exhibits enhanced anti-mycobacterial efficiency. Both AK15 and AK15-6 directly inhibited M. tb by trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate (TDM) binding and membrane disruption. They both exhibited bactericidal activity, cell selectivity, and synergistic effects with rifampicin, and neither induced drug resistance to M. tb. They efficiently attenuated mycobacterial load in the lungs of M. tb-infected mice. We observed that lysine, arginine, tryptophan, and an α-helix are key structural requirements for their direct anti-mycobacterial action. Of note, they also exhibited immunomodulatory effects, including inhibition of proinflammatory response in TDM-stimulated or M. tb-infected murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and M.tb-infected mice and induction of only a modest level of cytokine (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) production in murine BMDMs and a T-cell cytokine (interferin-γ (IFN-γ) and TNF-α) response in murine lung and spleen. In summary, characterization of a small mycobacteriophage-derived peptide and its improved isomer revealed that both efficiently restrain M. tb infection via dual mycobactericidal-immunoregulatory activities. Our work provides clues for identifying small mycobacteriophage-derived anti-mycobacterial peptides and improving those that have cationic amphiphilic α-helices."
https://openalex.org/W2924200935,"Objective Whereas research has demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive restructuring (CR) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), little is known about the efficacy of specific metacognitive interventions such as detached mindfulness (DM). Therefore, this study compared the efficacy of CR and DM as stand-alone interventions. Design We conducted a randomized waitlist-controlled trial. n = 43 participants were randomly assigned to either DM or CR. Out of those participants, n = 21 participants had been previously assigned to a two-week waitlist condition. Materials and methods In both conditions, treatment comprised four double sessions within two weeks. Assessment took place at baseline (Pre1), after treatment (Post) and four weeks after the end of treatment (FU). There was a second baseline assessment (Pre2) in the waitlist group. Independent evaluators were blinded concerning the active condition. Adherence and competence ratings for the two therapists were obtained from an independent rater. Results 40 patients completed the treatment. Two patients dropped out because of exacerbated depression. There were no further adverse events. Both CR and DM were shown to be superior to waitlist and equally effective at reducing OCD symptoms from pre to post assessment as measured with the Y-BOCS (CR: d = 1.67, DM: d = 1.55). In each of the two treatment conditions, eight patients (40%) exhibited a clinical significant change at post assessment. Conclusions The results of this clinical trial suggest the potential efficacy of DM as a stand-alone intervention for OCD, however, our findings need to be interpreted with caution. Results indicate that both CR and DM should be considered as possible alternative treatments for OCD, whereas the working mechanisms of DM have yet to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2925335746,"Brazilians are a rapidly increasing Latino immigrant group in the United States (US), yet little research has examined factors influencing physical activity (PA) levels and behaviors of children growing up in Brazilian immigrant families. This information is needed to develop culturally sensitive interventions tailored to this population. Therefore, this qualitative study explored PA parenting practices used by Brazilian immigrant mothers living in the US. Thirty-seven Brazilian immigrant mothers with at least one child between the ages of 2 and 5 years participated in 1of 7 focus group discussions. Thematic analysis identified seven parenting practices that mothers employ that may encourage or facilitate physical activity their preschool-aged children’s PA including: 1) modeling PA; 2) engaging and being physically active with child; 3) providing logistic support; 4) encouraging, praising, and offering motivational support; 5) watching, supervising, and teaching children how to engage in PA; 6) monitoring and setting limits to child’s screen time; and 7) prompting child to be physically active. In addition, analysis identified four parenting practices that may discourage or inhibit children’s PA including: 1) modeling of sedentary behaviors; 2) having rules and restrictions due to safety- and weather-related concerns; 3) limiting child’s outdoor time due to parental time constraints; and 4) restricting child’s outdoor and play time as punishment. Furthermore, analyses demonstrated that social contextual factors (e.g., income, housing, neighborhood safety, etc.) influence mothers’ PA parenting practices and consequently, their children’s PA. This is the first qualitative study, to our knowledge, to explore PA parenting practices of Brazilian-born immigrant mothers living in the US. Future research should further explore PA parenting practices of Brazilian immigrant parents including quantifying PA parenting practices that encourage and discourage PA, as well as examining the influence of fathers’ PA parenting practices on young children’s PA."
https://openalex.org/W2923534071,"A retrospective medical record review including 344 patients who were admitted with severe microbial keratitis at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, from January 2010 to December 2016 was conducted. Causative organisms were identified in 136 patients based on positive culture results, pathological reports and confocal microscopy findings. Eighty-six eyes (63.24%) were bacterial keratitis, while 50 eyes (36.76%) were fungal keratitis. Demographics, clinical history, and clinical findings from slit-lamp examinations were collected. We found statistically significant differences between fungal and bacterial infections in terms of age, occupation, contact lens use, underlying ocular surface diseases, previous ocular surgery, referral status, and duration since onset (p < 0.05). For clinical features, depth of lesions, feathery edge, satellite lesions and presence of endothelial plaque were significantly higher in fungal infection compared to bacterial infection with odds ratios of 2.97 (95%CI 1.43–6.15), 3.92 (95%CI 1.62–9.45), 6.27 (95%CI 2.26–17.41) and 8.00 (95%CI 3.45–18.59), respectively. After multivariate analysis of all factors, there were 7 factors including occupation, history of trauma, duration since onset, depth of lesion, satellite lesions, endothelial plaque and stromal melting that showed statistical significance at p < 0.05. We constructed the prediction model based on these 7 identified factors. The model demonstrated a favorable receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC = 0.79, 95%CI 0.72–0.86) with correct classification, sensitivity and specificity of 81.48%, 70% and 88.24%, respectively at the optimal cut-off point. In conclusion, we propose potential prediction factors and prediction model as an adjunctive tool for clinicians to rapidly differentiate fungal infection from bacterial infection in severe microbial keratitis patients."

https://openalex.org/W2924470908,"The purpose of this study was to examine the agreement in percent body fat estimates among 7 laboratory and field assessments against dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry using equivalence testing. Participants were 437 college students (mean age = 19.2±0.6 years). Dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry was used as the criterion with hydrostatic weighing, skinfold thickness, air displacement plethysmography, near infrared reactance, and three methods of bioelectrical impedance analysis examined as surrogate assessments. Relative agreement was examined using intraclass correlation coefficients. Group level agreement was examined using equivalence testing. Individual-level agreement was assessed using Mean Absolute Percent Error and Bland-Altman Plots. Single measure intraclass correlation coefficient scores ranged from 0.71-0.80. Hydrostatic weighing, skinfold thickness, air displacement plethysmography, and 4-electrode bioelectrical impedance analysis showed statistical equivalence with the criterion using a 10% Equivalence Interval with absolute mean differences ranging from 1.0%-4.9% body fat. Mean Absolute Percent Error ranged from 11.7% using skinfold thickness to 21.9% using Omron (hand-held) bioelectrical impedance analysis. Limits of Agreement were heteroscedastic across the range of mean scores compared to dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry, with greater mean differences observed at higher levels of percent body fat. Hydrostatic weighing, skinfold thickness, air displacement plethysmography, and 4-electrode bioelectrical impedance analysis showed strong evidence for statistical equivalence with dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry in a sample of college students."
https://openalex.org/W2923002029,"N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are fatty acid derivatives that in animal systems include the well-known bioactive metabolites of the endocannabinoid signaling pathway. Plants use NAE signaling as well, and these bioactive molecules often have oxygenated acyl moieties. Here, we report the three-dimensional crystal structures of the signal-terminating enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) from Arabidopsis in its apo and ligand-bound forms at 2.1- and 3.2-Å resolutions, respectively. This plant FAAH structure revealed features distinct from those of the only other available FAAH structure (rat). The structures disclosed that although catalytic residues are conserved with the mammalian enzyme, AtFAAH has a more open substrate-binding pocket that is partially lined with polar residues. Fundamental differences in the organization of the membrane-binding ""cap"" and the membrane access channel also were evident. In accordance with the observed structural features of the substrate-binding pocket, kinetic analysis showed that AtFAAH efficiently uses both unsubstituted and oxygenated acylethanolamides as substrates. Moreover, comparison of the apo and ligand-bound AtFAAH structures identified three discrete sets of conformational changes that accompany ligand binding, suggesting a unique ""squeeze and lock"" substrate-binding mechanism. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we evaluated these conformational changes further and noted a partial unfolding of a random-coil helix within the region 531-537 in the apo structure but not in the ligand-bound form, indicating that this region likely confers plasticity to the substrate-binding pocket. We conclude that the structural divergence in bioactive acylethanolamides in plants is reflected in part in the structural and functional properties of plant FAAHs."
https://openalex.org/W2923853794,"New approaches are needed for understanding and treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MicroRNAs (miRs) are important regulators of gene expression in all cells and disruption of their normal expression can lead to changes in phenotype of a cell, in particular the emergence of a leukemic clone. We collected peripheral blood samples from 10 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML, prior to induction chemotherapy, and 9 controls. Two and a half ml of whole blood was collected in Paxgene RNA tubes. MiRNA was purified using RNeasy mini column (Qiagen). We sequenced approximately 1000 miRs from each of 10 AML patients and 9 controls. In subset analysis, patients with NPM1 and FLT3 mutations showed the greatest number of miRNAs (63) with expression levels that differed from control with adjusted p-value of 0.05 or less. Some of these miRs have been described previously in association with leukemia, but many are new. Our approach of global sequencing of miRs as opposed to microarray analysis removes the bias regarding which miRs to assay and has demonstrated discovery of new associations of miRs with AML. Another strength of our approach is that sequencing miRs is specific for the 5p or 3p strand of the gene, greatly narrowing the proposed target genes to study further. Our study provides new information about the molecular changes that lead to evolution of the leukemic clone and offers new possibilities for monitoring relapse and developing new treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2924734089,"Osteoblast differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is stimulated by 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1α,25(OH)2D3] and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D3]; the latter's effects require intracellular hydroxylation to 1α,25(OH)2D3. Thus, hMSCs are both a source of and target for 1α,25(OH)2D3. Megalin is a transmembrane receptor for serum d-binding protein (DBP) in kidney cells and is required for uptake of the 25(OH)D3-DBP complex. We tested the hypothesis that megalin is required for D actions in hMSCs with cells from surgically discarded marrow for RT-PCR, for effects of 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3, for 1α,25(OH)2D3 biosynthesis, for osteoblastogenesis, and for small interfering RNA for megalin (si-Meg) and control (si-Ctr). In hMSCs with high constitutive megalin expression, both 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 stimulated osteoblastogenesis (P < 0.05), but only 1α,25(OH)2D3 did so in hMSCs with lower megalin (lo-Meg, P < 0.001) or in si-Meg cells (P < 0.05). In addition, 1α,25(OH)2D3 biosynthesis was significantly lower in lo-Meg (46%, P = 0.034) and in si-Meg (23%, P < 0.001) than each control. Leptin significantly stimulated megalin expression 2.1-fold in lo-Meg cells (P < 0.01). These studies show that megalin is expressed in hMSCs and is required for the biosynthesis of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and for the 25(OH)D3/DBP complex to stimulate vitamin D receptor targets and osteoblastogenesis.-Gao, Y., Zhou, S., Luu, S., Glowacki, J.

https://openalex.org/W2923223559,"There is a demonstrated relationship between couples’ division of household chores—and, to a lesser extent, the division of shared expenses—and their relationship quality. Less is known, however, about whether and how individuals’ perceived fairness of these arrangements is associated with couples’ relationships in different ways. Using a gendered equity framework, and drawing on 10,236 responses collected via an online national news website, this study examines how equity evaluations of housework and shared expenses are related to relationship satisfaction and sex frequency among different-gender household partners. Consistent with previous findings, the results indicate that evaluations of unfairness to oneself are a stronger predictor of relationship quality than perceived unfairness to one’s partner. Additionally, fairness evaluations over shared expenses are a stronger predictor of relationship quality than perceived equity in housework. Incorporating notions about traditional gender norms and expectations into the justice framework, the results point to some variation in relationship outcomes based on men’s and women’s differential equity evaluations."

The motif defining these LU domains contains five plesiotypic disulfide bonds stabilizing its prototypical three-fingered fold having three protruding loops. Notwithstanding the detailed knowledge on structure-function relationships in uPAR, one puzzling enigma remains unexplored. Why does the first LU domain in uPAR (DI) lack one of its consensus disulfide bonds, when the absence of this particular disulfide bond impairs the correct folding of other single LU domain-containing proteins? Here, using a variety of contemporary biophysical methods, we found that reintroducing the two missing half-cystines in uPAR DI caused the spontaneous formation of the corresponding consensus 7–8 LU domain disulfide bond. Importantly, constraints due to this cross-link impaired (i) the binding of uPAR to its primary ligand urokinase and (ii) the flexible interdomain assembly of the three LU domains in uPAR. We conclude that the evolutionary deletion of this particular disulfide bond in uPAR DI may have enabled the assembly of a high-affinity urokinase-binding cavity involving all three LU domains in uPAR. Of note, an analogous neofunctionalization occurred in snake venom α-neurotoxins upon loss of another pair of the plesiotypic LU domain half-cystines.

https://openalex.org/W2923860633,"Heterogeneity in geomorphological and hydrographical conditions throughout the Mediterranean Sea could be the driving factors behind the significant differences between putative sub-populations, although the existence of a large panmictic population of striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba (Meyen 1833) in this marine region could not be excluded. However, understanding the ecological implications of such genetic differentiation is difficult, as inferences about gene flow are usually made on evolutionary time scales and not along the ecological time frame over which most management and conservation practices are applied. In fact, as stated by the IUCN Red List, in the case of species assessed as vulnerable, the degree of genetic exchange between populations within a biogeographic region and its ecological implications represent a fascinating challenge that should be very deeply explored. This is even more significant in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea), where the geomorphological and hydrographic characteristics support the hypothesis of a separated striped dolphin population genetically diverging from its original Mediterranean counterpart. To assess this hypothesis, a genetic analysis was carried out on DNA fragments of the mitochondrial cyt b gene to explore the evolutionary origin of S. coeruleoalba in the investigated area and its genetic diversity in comparison with available sequences from other Mediterranean and Atlantic populations. Results were discussed indicating ecological implications and suggesting conservation objectives. Moreover, a delphinid systematic was also suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2924438351,"Introduction Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality in children younger than five years of age in developing countries, including India. Hence, this prospective study was performed to estimate the incidence of CAP in children (2–59 months)in four districts of Northern India. Methods A cross-sectional survey in rural Lucknow was conducted using cluster sampling technique to assess the proportion of CAP cases that were hospitalized in last 12 months (hospitalization fraction). Another prospective study was done to assess number of hospitalized CAP cases in same districts in 2016. For this, a surveillance network of hospitals that admitted children was established. Cases with WHO-defined CAP with less than 14 days of illness were eligible for inclusion. Informed written parental consent was obtained. A mathematical model was developed to estimate the incidence of CAP in each district, taking into account number of cases hospitalized in one year, assuming it to be equal to hospitalization fraction and using Lucknow district as reference, correcting for child-population per hospital for each district. Population census data of 2011 was taken as denominator. Results In cross-sectional survey (February to May 2016), 3351 children (2–59 months) from 240 villages were included. Of these 24.58% (824/3351) children suffered from CAP in last 12 months and out of these 4% (33/824) children were hospitalized. Computed incidence of CAP per 1000 child-year for Lucknow was 86.50 (95%CI: 85.72–87.29); Etawah 177.01(95%CI: 175.44–178.58); Patna 207.78 (95%CI: 207.20–208.37) and Darbhanga 221.18 (95%CI: 220.40–221.97). Infants (2–11 months)had almost five to ten times higher incidence of CAP than those in 12–59 months age category. Conclusions Incidence of CAP in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is high, being much higher in infants. Hence there is an urgent need for introduction of preventive strategies, improving health seeking behavior and quality of care for CAP."
https://openalex.org/W2924049063,"In this paper, we propose a method that estimates an average delay of frames for each queue and finds an optimal number of aggregated Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) to maximize the system throughput with satisfying the delay requirement of each queue when using the Aggregate MPDU (A-MPDU) aggregation in IEEE 802.11ac. The delay is defined as the sum of the queuing delay and the service delay. If few frames in a queue are aggregated, the frames which remain in the queue for next transmissions may violate the target delay because of the overhead for the next transmissions such as the backoff time, Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) preamble, and PLCP header. If many of the frames in the queue are aggregated, the frames of the queue and the other queues may violate their target delays because of a long transmission duration and a long channel occupancy. In this paper, we obtain the average delay for each queue and the optimal number of aggregated MPDUs for the delay requirement of each queue in IEEE 802.11ac. At the last, we evaluate and show the performance of our proposed method through simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed method can estimate the average delay for each queue accurately. The simulation results also show that the proposed method can obtain the violation rates on the target delays less than 0.1. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the proposed method can yield higher system throughput than other conventional methods."

To clarify it, we constructed a noninvasive in vivo calcium-imaging model of zebrafish Mauthner cells and monitored subcellular calcium dynamics during axonal regeneration. Using the calcium indicator GCamp6f, we observed that the regenerative length correlated with the peak amplitude of the evoked calcium response before axotomy, which suggested that the evoked calcium response might serve as a useful indicator of evoked neuronal activity and axonal regenerative capacity. To investigate this possibility, we overexpressed an inward rectifying potassium channel protein, Kir2.1a, to decrease the Mauthner neuronal activity and found that the inhibition of the calcium response correlated with decreased axonal regeneration. In contrast, treatment of pentylenetetrazol and knockout of the sodium voltage-gated channel ol subunit 1 gene increased the calcium response and thus enhanced axonal regeneration. Our results therefore increased the understanding of the correlation between the neural activity and the vertebrate axonal regeneration.—Chen, M., Huang, R.-C, Yang, L.-Q., Ren, D.-L., Hu, B.

Bacterial and archaeal MPE proteins belong to the binuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily that includes the well-studied DNA repair nucleases Mre11 and SbcD. Here, we report that the Pseudomonas putida MPE protein is a manganese-dependent DNA endonuclease that incises either linear single strands or the single-strand loops of stem-loop DNA structures. MPE has feeble activity on duplex DNA. A crystal structure of MPE at 2.2 A resolution revealed that the active site includes two octahedrally coordinated manganese ions. Seven signature amino acids of the binuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily serve as the enzymic metal ligands in MPE: Asp33, His35, Asp78, Asn112, His124, His146, and His158 A swath of positive surface potential on either side of the active site pocket suggests a binding site for the single-strand DNA substrate. The structure of MPE differs from Mre11 and SbcD in several key respects: (i) MPE is a monomer, whereas Mre11 and SbcD are homodimers; (ii) MPE lacks the capping domain present in Mre11 and SbcD; and (iii) the topology of the β sandwich that comprises the core of the metallophosphoesterase fold differs in MPE vis-a-vis Mre11 and SbcD. We surmise that MPE exemplifies a novel clade of DNA endonuclease within the binuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2924911635,"Evidence suggests that ethanol-induced hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular responsiveness to vasopressors in vivo and enhanced reactivity of isolated arteries to vasopressors ex vivo. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood and the contribution of ethanol metabolites to vascular effects induced by ethanol consumption are unclear. Mesenteric resistance arteries were harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats. Pressure myography was utilized to test effects of ethanol, acetaldehyde and phosphatidylethanol on myogenic tone and on vasoconstriction induced by phenylephrine, arginine vasopressin (aVP), endothelin-1 and KCl. Ethanol, acetaldehyde and phosphatidylethanol concentrations were monitored during the experiments. Ethanol concentrations in the vessel bath decreased with a half-life of 25min; acetaldehyde and phosphatidylethanol concentrations remained constant. Pretreatment with ethanol dose-dependently increased the potency of phenylephrine to induce vasoconstriction 4-fold (p<0.01). These effects were comparable when arteries were pre-treated with a single dose of ethanol for 30min and when ethanol concentrations were kept constant during 30min and 60min of pretreatment. While ethanol also dose-dependently increased the potency of aVP to induce vasoconstriction 1.7-fold (p<0.05), it did not affect vasoconstriction induced by endothelin-1 or KCl. Acetaldehyde pre-treatment (30 min) dose-dependently increased the potency of phenylephrine to induce vasoconstriction 2.7-fold (p<0.01) but did not affect other vasoconstrictor responses. Phosphatidylethanol did not affect any vasoconstrictor responses. Ethanol and its metabolites did not affect myogenic tone. These data suggest that ethanol and acetaldehyde selectively sensitize intrinsic constrictor responses upon activation of vascular α1-adrenergic and/or vasopressin receptors at clinically relevant concentrations. Our findings support the concept that enhanced vasoreactivity to vasoactive hormones contributes to the development of hypertension induced by ethanol consumption. Ex vivo exposure of resistance arteries to ethanol and acetaldehyde resembles effects of chronic ethanol consumption on intrinsic vascular function, and thus could serve as test platform to evaluate interventions aimed to mitigate vascular effects associated with ethanol consumption."

However, registered salespersons' knowledge and awareness of precautions regarding unsuitable OTC drugs for use in patients with CKD are unclear.This study aimed to clarify the awareness, knowledge, and implementation of precautions by registered salespersons regarding OTC drugs used by patients with CKD. Additionally, we evaluated the change of registered salespersons' knowledge and awareness of this topic generated by a pharmacist intervention.A questionnaire survey and pharmacist intervention were applied to 175 registered salespersons. The intervention comprised a 50-minute lecture imparted by a pharmacist who was trained in nephrology. The knowledge, awareness, and implementation of precautions by participants with respect to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antacids were evaluated before and after the intervention.Approximately half of the registered salespersons reported previous experience with selling OTC drugs that were inappropriate for patients with CKD (NSAIDs, 48.0%; antacids, 39.7%). Few participants recognized the need to check renal function when selling those drugs to such patients (NSAIDs, 25.7%; antacids, 47.5%). The registered salespersons' awareness and knowledge were significantly higher after the intervention than before it.The results indicate that before the intervention, the registered salespersons had low levels of awareness and knowledge regarding OTC drug use in patients with CKD despite having prior experience selling unsuitable OTC drugs. However, the pharmacist intervention improved the registered salespersons' awareness and knowledge. The educational program for registered salespersons might be necessary to prevent inappropriate OTC drug use by patients with CKD."

https://openalex.org/W2923988296,"This paper uses regression adjustment and entropy matching to achieve an appropriate balance between the two groups. Having achieved this balance any difference in the overall performance between the two groups can then be attributed directly to the new language policy that has been implemented. Our results indicate, after matching, that a significant difference in performance between the two groups occurs with Black African Zulu home language speakers in particular not performing as well as students from the other race and language groups. The data came from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the study has been approved by the University Ethics committee and Research committee.Using a weighted mean of marks to measure performance, the ATT estimates that result indicate that students in the treated group would all perform significantly better had they been allowed instead to enrol in the non-treated group. Furthermore, Zulu home language speakers, who are not actually forced to take this course, are significantly underperforming whether they have chosen to take this course in Zulu or not. Surprisingly, their underperformance is worse in the treated group. Because one would expect them to be scoring a higher mark for Zulu in this treated group, forfeiting the chance to take another course in their chosen area of study is clearly affecting the type of mark they could be getting for their other courses had they chosen to remain in the non-treated group. With English being the medium of instruction at this university, should the university not also consider introducing a compulsory course in English for these Zulu home language speakers? Females are doing better than males in both groups. The effect being stronger in the treated group suggests that females appear to cope better with the learning of a new language. Significant college effects are also being observed, suggesting that this new language rule possibly needs to be adjusted for the college a student wants to study in."
