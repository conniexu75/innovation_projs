https://openalex.org/W1532140047,"The presence of adenosine 3‘,5‘-monophosphate was demonstrated in bovine luteal tissue. The addition of luteinizing hormone to incubating slices of a bovine corpus luteum caused a rapid accumulation of this cyclic nucleotide which preceded the increase in progesterone synthesis. This effect appeared to be specific for luteinizing hormone. Puromycin did not inhibit this action of luteinizing hormone on cyclic AMP accumulation. In view of the previous finding that exogenous cyclic AMP added to incubating slices can mimic the effect of luteinizing hormone on steroidogenesis, these results indicate that the cyclic nucleotide is a mediator of this action of luteinizing hormone. An increase in the concentration of cyclic AMP has also been demonstrated in a human corpus luteum stimulated in vitro by human chorionic gonadotropin."

https://openalex.org/W2029917954,"DEFICIENCY of selenium and vitamin E in the diet of late-gestation ewes is known to cause white muscle disease (WMD) in lambs1,2. It is generally characterized by degenerative changes in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Since the myopathy is prenatally influenced, the development of the disease presumably has a direct relationship with the deprivation of protectors essential for the prevention of nutritional muscular dystrophy."

https://openalex.org/W1993371159,"SEVERAL workers1–4 have shown that there are two electrophoretically and chromatographically separable forms of GOT*. These two forms are found at different sites in the cell and have different properties, and it has been shown that they are both isoenzymes of GOT. While one isoenzyme is localized in mitochondria the other is localized in the cytoplasm, and moreover, unlike the latter, the mitochondrial enzyme is markedly inhibited by its reaction product OAA."

https://openalex.org/W2038132305,"RECENT reports on the occurrence of “pink spot” in the urines of schizophrenics are somewhat conflicting and cast doubt on its chemical identity and its relationship to schizophrenia1–6. In this hospital we began an experiment earlier in the year to isolate “pink spot” in milligram amounts with the intention of establishing its chemical structure by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance, but we soon found difficulty in finding “pink spot” excreters7. The urines from ten chronic schizophrenics were examined by the method of Friedhoff and Van Winkle1 but only one (J.W.) “pink spot” excreter was found, although four of our patients were “Schneider-positive non-paranoid” schizophrenics3. Admittedly, J.W. was one of these four, but our failure to find a higher incidence led us to examine the clinical records of our series of patients in greater detail, and it then became evident that patient J.W. differed from the other nine patients in several respects. She was 69 years of age and had had a leucotomy in 1947. Her symptoms had improved temporarily after the operation, but had then worsened, so that she needed massive and prolonged treatment with phenothiazines (mainly chlorpromazine) until early in 1966. Dyskinesia was first noticed in 1963 and by 1966 it became severe with choreiform movements of the mouth and tongue, jerky breathing and speech, opisthotonos and oculogyral spasm. Severe dyskinesia is well known in leucotomized patients after prolonged phenothiazine treatment. It is thought that leucotomy causes secondary changes in the basal ganglia which render them susceptible to toxic damage by these drugs8."
https://openalex.org/W1994853675,Selective occlusions of straight-chain paraffins in the presence of branched-chain hydrocarbons by naturally occurring zeolites of suitable dimension was reported as early as 1944 by Barrer and Ibbitson. More recently the capacity of synthetic zeolites or molecular sieves to absorb exclusively the straight-chain hydrocarbons from complex hydrocarbon mixtures has found extensive application in the petroleum industry. Under the conditions developed for most sieving operations any normal olefins present are occluded along with the normal paraffins. A supplemental separation technique must be employed to obtain n-paraffins free of olefins.

https://openalex.org/W2036428957,"IN some of the Chlorococcales the biosynthesis of secondary carotenoids (astaxanthin-esters and canthaxanthin1) and the complete decomposition of the primary pigments (chlorophyll a and b, carotenes and xanthophylls) in conditions of nitrogen deficiency can be inhibited by chloramphenicol2. With 5 × 10−5 molar chloramphenicol, growth is reduced to about 85 per cent of the normal rate. Chloramphenicol has no influence on the biosynthesis of the nitrate reducing enzymes in these algae3, and this insensitivity seems to be partly caused by the ability of these organisms to decompose chloramphenicol4."

Microphysiological investigation at a single neuromuscular junction can provide some information about pre- and post-synaptic factors and can also be used to study the common assertion1,2 that the disorder arises from “electrical instability” in the muscle membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2015218259,"Heathcote and Mooney1 reported results from which they concluded that vitamin B12 is more efficacious therapeutically in patients with pernicious anaemia when given by mouth with five times its weight of glutamic acid than when given alone. This claim was based on the haematological responses of two patients. The observation suggested that glutamic acid may enhance the absorption of vitamin B12 from the gut in pernicious anaemia. If confirmed, this could have an important bearing on theories concerning the mechanism of the absorption of vitamin B12 from the gut. We therefore decided to see whether addition of glutamic acid to test doses of cyanocobalamin labelled with cobalt-58 influenced the absorption by patients with pernicious anaemia, using the total body counter described by Warner and Oliver2."
