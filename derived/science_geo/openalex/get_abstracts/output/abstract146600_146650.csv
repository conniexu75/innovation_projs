The latter can be achieved by activating protein-tyrosine kinases and/or inactivating protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). A highly abundant PTP, PTP-1B, is known to be inactivated by oxidation of its catalytic site Cys-215. We show that O·̄2 is kinetically more efficient and chemically more specific oxidant than H2O2 for inactivating PTP-1B. The second-order rate constant for the O·̄2- and H2O2-mediated inactivation is 334 ± 45 m−1 s−1 and 42.8 ± 3.8 m−1 s−1, respectively. PTP-1B oxidized by H2O2 exhibits significantly more oxidized methionine residues and shows a lower degree of reversibility. The initial oxidative product, the Cys-215 sulfenic derivative, can easily be oxidized further to its irreversible sulfinic and sulfonic derivatives. This step is prevented by glutathionylation of the sulfenic derivative to form aS-glutathionylated PTP-1B, which can be reactivated by dithiothreitol or thioltransferase. Thus, a signal transduction mechanism mediated by the O·̄2 and the participation of glutathione is proposed for the regulation of PTP-1B. This mechanism is supported by the in vivo demonstration that glutathionylated PTP-1B at Cys-215 is formed in A431 cells when they were treated with epidermal growth factor.

This elevation can be achieved by the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)1 and/or inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The latter is particularly important, since PTPs exhibit much higher specific activity relative to that of PTKs (7Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as O·̄2 and H2O2, have been shown to be transiently generated intracellularly when non-phagocytic cells were stimulated with cytokine or growth factors (3Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 4Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

While there is no convincing evidence to show that the PTKs can be activated by ROS, PTPs have been shown to be regulated by a redox mechanism (9Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Among them, PTP-1B, a highly abundant PTP, contains a low pK a (about 5.6) active site cysteine 215 (14Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), making it an ideal specific regulatory site for ROS. Furthermore, Cys-215 is surrounded by main chain amides, which constitute the phosphate binding loop, and the positively charged amino acid residues Arg-45, Arg-47, Lys-116, Lys-120, Arg-112, and Arg-221, likely for attracting the negatively charged phosphate moiety of its substrate (7Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar,15Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to expect that it will be a favorable target for the negatively charged O·̄2. In order to identify which ROS, H2O2 or O·̄2, is the more efficient oxidant in regulating PTP-1B during signaling, we investigated the kinetics of PTP-1B inactivation by each of these oxidants and examined the reversibility of the oxidatively inactivated PTP-1B. Based on the results, a regulatory mechanism was proposed and verified by data obtained from an in vivo study. 30% hydrogen peroxide was supplied by Fisher. Chelex 100 Resin (200–400 mesh, sodium form) was from Bio-Rad. Glutathione, manganese superoxide dismutase (Escherichia coli) (MnSOD), DTT, and xanthine (X) were from Sigma. Xanthine oxidase (bovine) (XO) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The synthetic peptide DADEpYLIPQQG (corresponding to EGFR988–998) was from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). Recombinant PTP-1B was purified as described previously (16Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. Anti-PTP-1B was supplied by Upstate Biotechnology. The activity of PTP-1B was monitored using a continuous spectrofluorometric assay described previously (17Zhang Z.Y. McLean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide substrate was incubated at 25 °C in 50 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, and 60 μm DTPA, pH 7.0, that had been chelexed overnight. An aliquot of PTP-1B was added to the substrate and activity was monitored by the increase in fluorescence at 305 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Kinetic constants are calculated using a nonlinear least squares with the MLAB program (Civilized Software Inc., Bethesda, MD). When PTP-1B was inactivated by O·̄2, the reaction was carried out in either the presence or absence of catalase. 500 nm of PTP-1B was incubated with 2 mm xanthine, 18–36 nm XO, and O2, which was supplied by bubbling air. Inactivation of PTP-1B by H2O2 was carried out using two methods. One involved incubating 500 nm PTP-1B with H2O2 generated by dismutating the O·̄2produced by twice the concentration of XO as described above with 10 μm MnSOD as catalyst. The other involved direct addition of 5–50 μm H2O2 to 500 nm PTP-1B. The second-order rate constant for the latter case was determined by a H2O2concentration-dependent study. The second-order rate constant for the inactivation of PTP-1B by O·̄2 generated by the XO-catalyzed reaction and by H2O2 generated from O·̄2 were determined by curve fitting using a combined Adams-Gear method (18Knott G.D. Comput. Programs Biomed. 1979; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) (Civilized Software Inc.) to solve the differential equations required to describe the reaction schemes and the specific activity of XO. In each case, only the inactivating rate constant was treated as a variable. The rate constants used for calculating the formation of H2O2 catalyzed by MnSOD are those reported by Pick et al. (19Pick M. Rabani J. Yost F. Fridovich I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 7329-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In-gel tryptic digests and peptide extractions were performed as described previously (10Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. König S. Fales H.M. Keng Y.-F. Zang Z.-Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6699-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 20Qin J. Fenyo D. Zhao Y. Hall W.W. Chao D.M. Wilson C.Y. Young R.A. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 3995-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Oxidized PTP-1B tryptic fragments appeared as a higher mass of 16 Da or its higher multiple for those containing oxidized cysteine and/or oxidized methionine residue(s), and 305 Da for glutathionylated cysteine, relative to their corresponding unoxidized tryptic fragments. When 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) was added to trap the sulfenic derivatives, the resulting fragments exhibited a high mass of 163 Da for thioether-linked NBD-Cl and 179 Da for the sulfoxide derivative of NBD-Cl. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis was performed when additional confirmation of the oxidative modification was required through peptide sequencing as described (10Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. König S. Fales H.M. Keng Y.-F. Zang Z.-Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6699-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Fragmentation data (MS/MS) was acquired in centroid format using the data-dependent mode where a preselected set of ions were fragmented after a threshold of at least 5 × 105counts (as detected by the quadrupole ion trap liquid chromatography software) is exceeded. The LC/MS/MS analysis was repeated twice for a total of three scans for averaging. The differential in mass due to oxidative modification is similar to the data obtained with the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). The mass isolation window for parent ions was 4 Da, the scan range (during parent ion scan) was m/z 200–2000, and the arbitrary relative collision energy was set to 30%. PTB-1B was immunoprecipitated with anti-PTP-1B antibody following the recommended protocol with modification. Four μg of anti-PTP-1B was added directly to cell lysates. The mixture was incubated overnight with rocking. The immunocomplex was captured with the addition of 100 μl of protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were collected by pulsed centrifugation and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. PTP-1B was eluted with a 100 mm glycine solution containing 1.5 mMgCl2 at pH 2.65. The protein was then desalted by exchanging three times using a Centricon-30 (Amicon) and separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The kinetics of PTP-1B inactivation by H2O2 and O·̄2 was investigated. Fig.1 shows the time course for the inactivation of PTP-1B by O·̄2 as it is generated by the XO-catalyzed reaction of X (2 mm) with oxygen and by H2O2 generated by twice the concentration of xanthine oxidase in the presence of excess Mn(II)-superoxide dismutase (10 μm). The doubling of the xanthine oxidase for the latter reaction is to account for the fact that two O·̄2 are needed to form one H2O2. It is important to note that in all of the experiments reported here the buffer used was chelexed overnight, and the enzymes were dialyzed to remove contaminating metal ions, particularly those of iron and copper. The solid line for the O·̄2-mediated inactivation was calculated using the O·̄2 inactivation rate constant of 334 ± 45m−1 s−1. This second-order rate constant was determined by curve fitting using a combined Adams-Gear numerical integration method (18Knott G.D. Comput. Programs Biomed. 1979; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) (Civilized Software Inc.) to solve the differential equations required to describe the reaction scheme. The rate of O·̄2 production was calculated using the specific activity of XO. The kinetics of the inactivation was not altered by the presence of excess catalase (data not shown). The second-order rate constant for the PTP-1B inactivation by H2O2was similarly calculated to be 42.8 ± 3.8m−1 s−1, which was used to obtain the calculated curve shown in Fig. 1. For both curve fittings, only the inactivating rate constant was treated as a variable. The time course for the H2O2 production was calculated using the mechanism and rate constants reported for the MnSOD (19Pick M. Rabani J. Yost F. Fridovich I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 7329-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The value for the H2O2 inactivation so determined is in good agreement with a value of 43 m−1s−1 obtained from a H2O2concentration-dependent study by direct H2O2 addition (data not shown). This value is somewhat higher than the 7 m−1s−1 reported for the thiolate ion reacting with H2O2 to form its sulfenic derivative (21Zhang N. Schuchman H.-P. vonSonntage C. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 4718-4722Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The discrepancy can be attributed to the difference in experimental conditions or to the positive effect of the protein structure. Table I shows that, in addition to the oxidation of Cys-215, some other residues were also found to be oxidized within 30 min of incubation of PTP-1B with either 50 μm H2O2, XO/SOD, or XO/Cat in the presence of 2 mm xanthine with the enzyme concentrations similar to those described in the legend of Fig. 1. It is clear that, with H2O2 as oxidant, the mass spectrometric analysis revealed that there are more residues, particularly those of methionine, that were oxidized. Fig. 2shows that when PTP-1B was inactivated to approximately 10% of its total activity by either O·̄2, the XO/Cat system, or H2O2, the XO/SOD system, there is a clear differential in its reversibility induced by DTT. The H2O2-inactivated PTP-1B shows only a 20% recovery, while the O·̄2-inactivated enzyme recovered about 60–65% of its activity.Table IOxidized PTP-1B residues detected by quadrupole ion trap LC/MS/MS in addition to Cys-21550 μmH2O2XO/X/SODXO/X/CatMet-1 or Met-3Met-109Met-109Met-74Met-114Cys-121Met-109Met-253Met-114Met-258Met-133Cys-121Met-253Met-258Met-282Cys-32Cys-121The incubation time was 30 min with the oxidant or its generating systems. Open table in a new tab The incubation time was 30 min with the oxidant or its generating systems. Since the reversible sulfenic derivative, produced initially, can easily be oxidized to form its irreversible sulfinic and sulfonic derivatives, it is necessary to trap the sulfenic derivative in order to verify its formation by mass spectrometric method. The NBD-Cl was used to trap the cysteine sulfenic derivative after oxidation of PTP-1B. NBD-Cl has been shown to react with sulfhydryls and sulfenic acids of cysteine to form a thioether and sulfoxide derivative, respectively (22Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The mass difference of 16 Da between thioether and the sulfoxide derivative can be distinguished readily by mass spectrometry. Fig. 3 shows the mass spectrum obtained for the quadrupole ion trap LC/MS/MS of the tryptic fragment of the O·̄2-oxidized PTP-1B, which contains the active site Cys-215. The fragments b162*, b17+2*, b20+2, y7+1*, y9+2, y12+1*, y13+1*, y13+2*, y18+2*, and y22+3* all contain the NBD-sulfoxide derivative of Cys-215. The y6+1*, b10+1*, b12+1*, b13+1, and b13+1* fragments do not contain the modifying group. A similar spectrum was also obtained for the same tryptic fragment derived from the NBD-Cl-treated H2O2-oxidized PTP-1B. Thus, both O·̄2 and H2O2 are capable of oxidizing the Cys-215 to its reversible sulfenic derivative. Glutathionylation of the sulfenic derivative, which can be achieved by the addition of GSH to the O·̄2-oxidized PTP-1B, will convert it to a relatively more stable inactive phosphatase. Using a mass spectrometric method, we showed that when PTP-1B was oxidized by O·̄2 and then reacted with 10 mm glutathione, a mixed disulfide was formed between Cys-215 and GSH (data not shown). The glutathionylated PTP-1B may then be reactivated by the addition of thiols or enzymatically by thioltransferase. The latter can provide an efficient and selective reactivation mechanism (23Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-337Google Scholar). Thus, a plausiblein vivo mechanism is proposed (Fig.4) for the signal transduction pathway involving O·̄2-mediated inactivation and glutathionylation of PTP-1B. The validity of the proposed mechanism was tested by monitoring the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the PTP-1B in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. It had been previously shown (4Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) that addition of EGF to serum-starved A431 cells resulted in a transient increase in the ROS concentration and the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. EGF was incubated with serum-starved A431 cells for 20 min, and the cells were harvested and lysed. PTP-1B was immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-PTP-1B antibody, following the recommended protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, and eluted from the antibody with a 100 mm glycine solution containing 1.5 m MgCl2 at pH 2.65 prior to electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The PTP-1B band was then excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digest similar to thein vitro experiments described above. The sample was analyzed by LC/MS/MS for any Cys-215 glutathionylated PTP-1B, which will yield a mass change of 305 Da. Fig.5 shows a mass spectrum obtained using this procedure. It clearly reveals the presence of a glutathionylated peptide that contains Cys-215. The fragments y7+2*, y10+2*, y19+2*, y22+3, and b16+3 all contain a glutathionylated Cys-215 residue, while fragments b5+1* and b6+1 do not contain the modified Cys-215. Furthermore, fragments y7+1* and b22+3* contain the modifications but have lost the glycine residue from the fragmentation of glutathione itself. Fragment y13+2* contains the glutathionylated fragment but has lost the glutamate residue of glutathione. In the control experiment performed with identical procedures except that no EGF was added, no glutathionylated PTP-1B was observed (data not shown). Our data clearly show that relative to H2O2, O·̄2 is kinetically and chemically a more efficient regulator for PTP-1B. It initially forms an unstable sulfenic derivative at the active site Cys-215 of the phosphatase. The inactivation likely proceeds via the following mechanism in the presence of oxygen and GSH, RS−+O·̄2+H+→RSO·+OH−Equation 1Reaction RSO·+GSH→GS·+RSOHEquation 2Reaction GS·+GSH→GSSG·̄+H+Equation 3Reaction GSSG·̄+O2→GSSG+O·̄2Equation 4Reaction RSOH+GSH→RSSG+H2OEquation 5Reaction where RS− and RSOH represent the protein sulfhydryl and its sulfenic derivative, respectively. In this reaction scheme, the GS⋅ and RSO⋅ radicals are intermediates or chain carriers, both of which were detected and described in our previous reports (24Yim M.B. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1621-1626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kwak H.S. Yim H.S. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4582-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the formation of RSOH and RSSG was verified by the current results. The rate constant, 334m−1 s−1, for O·̄2inactivation of PTP-1B is significantly higher than that of H2O2, which is 43 m−1s−1. If the ROS generated due to EGF binding is O·̄2 and two O·̄2 are required to form one H2O2, this should further enhance the kinetic advantage of O·̄2 over H2O2. Furthermore, O·̄2 should be more specific than the neutral H2O2 when the site of action is surrounded by positively charged residues, like the catalytic site of PTP-1B. In addition, the O·̄2-inactivated PTP-1B is more reversible than that of H2O2, due to the fact that significantly more methionine residues are oxidized by H2O2. Since the sulfenic derivative can easily be oxidized to form the irreversible sulfinic and sulfonic products, we show that in the presence of GSH, the sulfenic derivative is converted to a more stable S-glutathionylated PTP-1B, which can be reactivated by either DTT or thioltransferase. Thus, it provides an efficient regulatory mechanism for the regulation of PTP-1B in signal transduction. The proposed regulatory mechanism is supported by the observation that glutathionylated PTP-1B at Cys-215 is formed in A431 cells when they were treated with EGF. Since PTP active sites share similar structural features (26Zhang Z.Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the proposed regulatory mechanism will likely apply to the whole PTP family. We thank Drs. J. Michael Poston, Henry Fales, and Simone König (NHLBI) and Dr. David Davis (NCI) for helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. Chien-Chung Chao for helping with the preparation of A431 cells."

Oxidative species that might mediate this damage include hydroxyl radical, tyrosyl radical, or reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite. In mice, we showed that MPTP markedly increased levels of o,o′-dityrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine in the striatum and midbrain but not in brain regions resistant to MPTP. These two stable compounds indicate that tyrosyl radical and reactive nitrogen species have attacked tyrosine residues. In contrast, MPTP failed to alter levels of ortho-tyrosine in any brain region we studied. This marker accumulates when hydroxyl radical oxidizes protein-bound phenylalanine residues. We also showed that treating whole-brain proteins with hydroxyl radical markedly increased levels of ortho-tyrosine in vitro. Under identical conditions, tyrosyl radical, produced by the heme protein myeloperoxidase, selectively increased levels ofo,o′-dityrosine, whereas peroxynitrite increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and, to a lesser extent, of ortho-tyrosine. These in vivo and in vitro findings implicate reactive nitrogen species and tyrosyl radical in MPTP neurotoxicity but argue against a deleterious role for hydroxyl radical in this model. They also show that reactive nitrogen species and tyrosyl radical (and consequently protein oxidation) represent an early and previously unidentified biochemical event in MPTP-induced brain injury.

Parkinson's disease butylated hydroxytoluene diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine high performance liquid chromatography Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is attributed to a profound deficit in dopamine (1Fahn S. Wyngaarden J.B. Smith Jr., L.H. Cecil's Textbook of Medicine. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1988: 2143-2147Google Scholar) that follows the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum (2Hornykiewicz O. Kish S.J. Yahr M. Bergmann K.J. Parkinson's Disease. Raven Press, New York1987: 19-34Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms are uncertain, a large body of experimental evidence implicates oxidative stress (reviewed in Refs. 3Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1998; 11: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 5Ames B.N.

In light of these human and animal studies, at least three pathways have been proposed. Studies with the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD suggest a pivotal role for superoxide radical (O·̄2) both in vitro and in vivo (6Poirier J. Barbeau A. Biochem.

Takeshige K. Oishi T. Murai Y. Minakami S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). O·̄2 is not highly reactive, however, and is generally thought not to cause serious direct injury (4Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 11Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1991Google Scholar). Instead, it is believed to exert many or most of its toxic effects by generating reactive species such as hydroxyl radical (HO⋅), whose oxidative properties can ultimately kill cells (4Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 11Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1991Google Scholar). For instance, O·̄2 facilitates HO⋅ production in the metal-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction both by reducing redox-active transition metals (Mn+) and by dismutating to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (4Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 11Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1991Google Scholar). Mn++O·̄2→Mn+−1+O2Mn+−1+H2O2→Mn++HO·+HO−Reactions 1 and 2 This noxious reaction may be relevant to PD because the post-mortem concentration of nonheme iron is dramatically elevated in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients (12Riederer P.

Jenner P. Marsden C.D. Lancet. 1987; 2: 219-220Google Scholar). Moreover, neuromelanin, believed to be a by-product of dopamine autooxidation, may promote the formation of reactive species such as HO⋅through various mechanisms (14Swartz H.M. Sarna T. Zecca L. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32 suppl.: S69-S75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Superoxide can also react with nitric oxide (NO) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO−), another potent oxidant (15Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6675) Google Scholar). O·̄2+NO→ONOO−Reactions 3 Under normal conditions, O·̄2 may be limiting, resulting in little ONOO− formation. Appreciable amounts could form if O·̄2 concentrations increased, as in the response to MPTP or PD, however. NO is implicated by the observation that nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors attenuate MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice and monkeys (16Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Yokoyama R.

Med. 1996; 2: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Mutant mice deficient in neuronal nitric-oxide synthase also are resistant to MPTP (16Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Yokoyama R. Shibata T. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4565-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). While investigating oxidative damage in atherosclerosis and other inflammatory conditions (5Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5382) Google Scholar, 19Heinecke J.W. Biofactors. 1997; 6: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we described an oxidative pathway that does not require free metal ions. It involves myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by activated phagocytes (20Klebanoff S.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase uses H2O2 to convert the phenolic amino acid tyrosine into a reactive intermediate that promotes the oxidation of proteins and lipids (21Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23080-23088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We have recently used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to demonstrate that the oxidizing intermediate generated by myeloperoxidase and other peroxidases is free tyrosyl radical (24McCormick M.L. Gaut J.P. Lin T.S. Britigan B.E. Buettner G.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32030-32037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These studies support the idea that tyrosyl radical may promote oxidative reactions at sites of inflammation. One powerful strategy for understanding the underlying mechanisms of oxidative injury is to identify stable end products of protein oxidation by different reaction pathways in vitro and then to determine whether these markers are present at elevated levelsin vivo (19Heinecke J.W. Biofactors. 1997; 6: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Heinecke J.W. Hsu F.F. Crowley J.R. Hazen S.L. Leeuwenburgh C. Mueller D.M. Rasmussen J.E. Turk J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 300: 124-144Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For instance, HO⋅ converts protein-bound phenylalanine residues to the unnatural amino acid isomerortho-tyrosine. Tyrosyl radical formso,o′-dityrosine as the major product, whereas ONOO− generates 3-nitrotyrosine. These compounds are stable to acid hydrolysis, making them potentially useful markers of protein oxidation in vivo. Immunohistochemical and HPLC methods have been used to detect products such as 3-nitrotyrosine (26Beal M.F. Neuroscientist. 1997; 3: 21-27Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Kaur H. Lyras L. Jenner P. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2220-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but both approaches may be confounded by structurally distinct molecules. Moreover, antibody-based analyses are semi-quantitative at best. HPLC can be more sensitive and specific than immunohistochemistry, but brain tissue may contain materials that interfere with this method (27Kaur H. Lyras L. Jenner P. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2220-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hypothesis that neuronally derived NO reacts with O·̄2 to generate ONOO− remains questionable, as does the idea that HO⋅ is produced in the MPTP model and PD. Using isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), we developed sensitive and highly specific quantitative assays for measuring tissue levels of ortho-tyrosine,o,o′-dityrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine (25Heinecke J.W. Hsu F.F. Crowley J.R. Hazen S.L. Leeuwenburgh C. Mueller D.M. Rasmussen J.E. Turk J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 300: 124-144Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the relative product yields of each marker in brain proteins oxidizedin vitro by HO⋅, tyrosyl radical, or ONOO−. We also assayed the oxidized amino acids in brain proteins from control and MPTP-treated mice. Our results suggest that reactive nitrogen species and tyrosyl radical, perhaps generated by ONOO− or heme proteins, mediate protein oxidation in this mouse model of PD. Reagents were obtained from either Sigma or Aldrich unless otherwise specified. All organic solvents were HPLC grade. Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) supplied13C-labeled amino acids for the preparation of internal standards. o,o′-[13C12]Dityrosine and ortho-[13C6]tyrosine were synthesized as described previously (21Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). 3-Nitro[13C6]tyrosine was synthesized using tetranitromethane (28Sokolovsky M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Concentrations of 13C-labeled amino acids were determined by HPLC analysis (29Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1861-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Male C57/BL mice (8 weeks old; 22–25 g; Charles River Breeding Laboratories) were used in the study. Animals were housed three per cage in a temperature- and light-controlled room with a 12-h/12-h light-dark cycle. The mice were provided with water and food ad libitum. On the day of the experiment, mice received four intraperitoneal injections of MPTP-HCl (20 mg/kg; Research Biochemicals, Natick, MA) in saline every 2 h over an 8-h period. Control mice received saline only. All procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of live animals and were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized and sacrificed 24 h after the last injection; this time point was based on our previous study of nitration of tyrosine hydroxylase in the MPTP mouse model (30Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To minimize ex vivo oxidation, mice were perfused with ice-cold antioxidant buffer (100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA; a metal chelator), 1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT; an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation), 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (an inhibitor of peroxidases and nitric-oxide synthase), 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4). Then, cerebellum, ventral midbrain, striatum, and cerebral cortex were dissected out on an ice-cold plate, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until analysis (30Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared sample from the indicated brain area was homogenized at 4 °C in 5 ml of buffer A (0.1 mm DTPA, pH 7.4), freeze-thawed once, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The low speed supernatant was dialyzed against distilled, deionized water that had been passed over a Chelex resin (Bio-Rad) column to remove free metal ions. In vitro oxidation reactions (1 mg brain protein/ml) were performed at 37 °C in buffer B (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4). When indicated, buffer B was supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3. Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.2 mm DTPA (pH 7.4), 300 nmcatalase, and 0.1 mm BHT. Proteins were precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration), acid-hydrolyzed, and subjected to GC/MS analysis. ONOO−was synthesized from 2-ethoxyethyl nitrite and H2O2 (31Leis J.R. Pena M.E. Rios A.A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; 16: 1298-1299Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. ONOO− was thawed immediately prior to use, and its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε302= 1, 670 m−1 cm−1; Ref. 32Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Brain tissue (∼ 10 mg wet weight) was homogenized in 1 ml of antioxidant buffer. After dialysis overnight against buffer A, samples were delipidated by extraction with water/methanol/water-washed diethyl ether (1:3:7; v/v/v) for 10 min. Protein precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min. The resulting protein pellet was lipid extracted once more and dried under N2. Samples (∼1 mg of protein) were dried under vacuum in 1-ml glass reaction vials and immediately suspended in 0.5 ml of 6 n HCl (Sequenal grade, Pierce) containing 0.1% benzoic acid and 0.1% phenol (w/v). Isotopically labeled internal standards were added, and samples were hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 24 h under argon. Aromatic amino acids were isolated using a solid-phase C-18 column (3 ml; Supelclean SPE, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) (21Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and converted to n-propyl esters by addition of 200 μl of HCl/n-propanol (prepared by the addition of one volume of 12 n HCl to three volumes of n-propanol) and heating for 1 h at 65 °C. After evaporation of excess reagent under N2, heptafluorobutyric anhydride/ethyl acetate (1:3, v/v) was added, and the samples were heated at 65 °C for 15 min. Amino acids were quantified using isotope dilution negative-ion electron capture GC/MS using a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5988A mass spectrometer with extended mass range (21Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Under these chromatography conditions, authentic compounds and isotopically labeled standards exhibited retention times identical to those of analytes derived from tissue samples. The limit of detection (signal/noise >10) was <1 pmol for all of the amino acids. The ions used for detecting analyte and internal standard were: phenylalanine,m/z 383 and 389 ions; tyrosine, m/z 417 and 423 ions; 3-nitrotyrosine, m/z 464 and 470 ions;ortho-tyrosine, m/z 595 and 601 ions;o,o′-dityrosine m/z 1208 and 1220 ions. Differences between two groups were compared using an unpaired Student's t test. Multiple comparisons were performed using a two-way analysis of variance. The null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. To determine whether oxidized amino acids are present in normal mouse brain, we assayed freshly isolated tissue from frontal cortex, cerebellum, ventral midbrain and striatum. When amino acids from acid hydrolysates of each tissue were isolated and derivatized with n-propanol and heptafluorobutyric anhydride and then analyzed by GC/MS in the negative-ion electron capture mode, we detected compounds that exhibited major ions and retention times identical to those of authentic 3-nitrotyrosine, ortho-tyrosine, ando,o′-dityrosine. Selected ion monitoring demonstrated that the ions derived from the amino acids co-eluted with ions derived from authentic 13C-labeled internal standards, as shown in Fig.1 for 3-nitrotyrosine ando,o′-dityrosine. Levels of the oxidized amino acids varied both in absolute magnitude and in different parts of the brain (Fig.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). All regions demonstrated relatively high levels of ortho-tyrosine (∼ 0.5–1 mmol/mol of phenylalanine), which were highest in the striatum. In contrast, levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine were lower than those of ortho-tyrosine, and unlikeortho-tyrosine levels, those of o,o′-dityrosine were lowest in the striatum. However, 3-nitrotyrosine levels were comparable in all areas of the brain. These results indicate that acid hydrolysates of normal brain tissue proteins contain detectable levels of oxidized amino acids.Figure 3o,o′-Dityrosine in brain proteins isolated from control and MPTP-treated mice.

We also analyzed samples from the frontal cortex and cerebellum, two regions of the brain that are little affected by MPTP. Tissue was prepared and analyzed by isotope dilution GC/MS as described above. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine in the ventral midbrain and striatum of the MPTP-treated animals were markedly higher (110% and 90%, respectively) than in the controls (Fig. 2). In contrast, there was no difference in level of 3-nitrotyrosine in the frontal cortex or cerebellum. These results indicate that levels of 3-nitrotyrosine increase selectively in the regions of the brain that are susceptible to the neurotoxic action of MPTP. Levels of o,o′-dityrosine showed a strikingly similar pattern of increase as 3-nitrotyrosine (elevations of 120% and 170% compared with controls) in ventral midbrain and striatum, two regions of the brain that are vulnerable to MPTP-mediated neurotoxicity (Fig. 3). As with 3-nitrotyrosine, there was no difference in levels ofo,o′-dityrosine in the frontal cortex or cerebellum. These results indicate that levels of o,o′-dityrosine increase selectively in the regions of the brain that are vulnerable to MPTP-mediated neuronal injury. In contrast to 3-nitrotyrosine ando,o′-dityrosine, there was no change in the levels ofortho-tyrosine in any of the regions of the brain examined (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results indicate that levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine increase selectively in the regions of the brain that are susceptible to the neurotoxic action of MPTP. In contrast,ortho-tyrosine does not accumulate in increased amounts in any region of the brain examined in MPTP-treated animals. To evaluate the potential usefulness of 3-nitrotyrosine, ortho-tyrosine ando,o′-dityrosine as markers for oxidation in vitro, we investigated the product yield of these compounds in brain proteins that had been oxidized in vitro by ONOO−, tyrosyl radical, and HO⋅. Protein used for the in vitro studies was isolated by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) from homogenate prepared from different regions of the brain. In brain proteins exposed to 1 mm ONOO−, there was a dramatic increase (∼ 80-fold) in 3-nitrotyrosine (Fig.5 A). Proteins isolated from different regions of the brain demonstrated similar increases after they were oxidized in vitro with ONOO−. When brain protein was added 2 min after ONOO−, however, protein nitration was minimal, indicating that ONOO− or a short-lived species derived from ONOO− nitrates the aromatic ring of protein-bound tyrosine (data not shown). Because ONOO− also hydroxylates aromatic compounds and promotes cross-linking of phenolic groups (33Van derVliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), we determined whetherortho-tyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine form in brain proteins exposed to ONOO−. Levels ofortho-tyrosine and o,o′-dityrosine increased 2–3-fold when we exposed brain protein to this reactive nitrogen species, but the product yields of o,o′-dityrosine andortho-tyrosine were <5% and <25% that of 3-nitrotyrosine (Fig. 5, B and C). In vitro studies of model proteins exposed to a wide variety of different oxidation systems have previously demonstrated that 3-nitrotyrosine is a specific marker for protein oxidation by reactive nitrogen species (34Leeuwenburgh C.

Recent studies indicate that ONOO− rapidly reacts with carbon dioxide to generate ONO2CO2− (35Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem.

Bicarbonate is in equilibrium with carbonic acid that is present in extracellular fluids primarily as carbon dioxide, its conjugate acid. Bicarbonate/carbon dioxide is present at high concentrations in vivo, and the reactivity of ONO2CO2− differs from that of ONOO− (35Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 36Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 37Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the addition of 25 mm NaHCO3 to the reaction buffer affected the product yields of oxidized amino acids in brain proteins exposed to ONOO−. The absolute increases and relative yields of 3-nitrotyrosine, o,o′-dityrosine, andortho-tyrosine in brain proteins exposed to ONOO− were almost identical in the presence and absence of added bicarbonate/carbon dioxide (Fig. 5). The failure of NaHCO3 to affect the product yields of the oxidized amino acids likely reflects the presence of bicarbonate in brain proteins and/or reaction mixture used for the experiments (35Lymar S.V.

Taken together, these results indicate that 3-nitrotyrosine is an excellent marker for proteins oxidized by reactive nitrogen speciesin vitro. They also suggest that ortho-tyrosine is a significant product of protein oxidation by ONOO−. In contrast, o,o′-dityrosine is a relatively minor product. We exposed protein derived from various areas of the brain to tyrosyl radical generated by the myeloperoxidase-tyrosine-H2O2 system, using physiologically plausible levels of oxidant and substrate (0.1 mm H2O2 and 0.2 mmtyrosine; Ref. 21Leeuwenburgh C.

All regions of the brain exposed to tyrosyl radical showed a similar increase in o,o′-dityrosine. These results indicate that tyrosyl radical generated by myeloperoxidase selectively raiseso,o′-dityrosine levels without changing levels of 3-nitrotyrosine or ortho-tyrosine"

RNA polymerase II positive transcription elongation factor b 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole carboxyl-terminal domain human immunodeficiency virus β-mercaptoethanol Accumulating evidence indicates that the expression of many protein coding genes is regulated at the level of transcription elongation. Understanding of elongation control by RNAPII has been hampered by slow progress in the identification of factors involved in transcription elongation. An emerging model is that the interplay of positive and negative elongation factors determines the elongation potential of RNAPII1 in different promoters (1Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Support for this view comes from the recent identification of the negative elongation factors 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor, negative elongation factor, and factor 2 and the positive elongation factor P-TEFb. Factor 2 is an ATP-dependent termination factor that releases transcripts associated with stalled RNAPII molecules (2Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3771-3777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DSIF is a repressor of elongation that was identified as a factor that renders in vitro transcription reactions sensitive to the drug DRB (3Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 343-356Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). NELF works in conjunction with DSIF to repress RNA polymerase II elongation (4Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). P-TEFb is a DRB-sensitive kinase that is believed to stimulate the elongation potential of RNAPII by phosphorylating the CTD of RNAPII molecules that are engaged in early transcription elongation (5Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 6Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). It was recently suggested that P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation of the CTD prevents the association of DSIF with RNAPII and thereby overcomes DSIF-dependent repression (7Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although it has been long accepted that CTD phosphorylation plays a critical role in transcription, it has been difficult to ascertain the mammalian kinases responsible for CTD phosphorylation in vivo. The observation that the ability of several drugs to block CTD phosphorylation in vivo correlates with the ability of these compounds to inhibit P-TEFb in vitro strongly suggests that P-TEFb might indeed function as a CTD kinase in vivo (8Casse C. Giannoni F. Nguyen V.T. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16097-16106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Additional evidence showing that P-TEFb kinase functions as a positive elongation factor in vivo comes from studies with the HIV Tat protein that have shown that the catalytic activity of P-TEFb is required for Tat-dependent stimulation of transcription elongation (9Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 10Flores O. Lee G. Kessler J.

Native human P-TEFb appears to exists as a polyprotein complex composed of a catalytic subunit (CDK9), a regulatory subunit (cyclin T), and potentially several additional polypeptides that are found in immunoprecipitates isolated with CDK9 antibodies (11Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 12Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T.

The observation that CDK9 can be found in different chromatographic fractions 2O. Flores, unpublished observations. and that two different cyclin genes (cyclin T1 and cyclin T2) can function as CDK9 regulatory subunits (12Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) suggests that CDK9 might associate with functionally different complexes and thereby participate in different cellular processes. To further characterize the components of CDK9-containing complexes we used the yeast two-hybrid interaction system to identify proteins that associate with CDK9. In this report we show that cyclin K associates with CDK9 in vivo and in vitro and demonstrate that cyclin K is a CDK9 regulatory subunit. The yeast two-hybrid screen utilized the Mammalian MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid Assay Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The screening and selection of clones was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. The bait was constructed by inserting the full-length CDK9 gene (EcoRI/SalI fragment) into the pAS2 plasmid. A cDNA library made from Jurkat cell RNA cloned in the pACT2 target plasmid (CLONTECH) was used in the screen. The Jurkat library was screened two times in order to confirm screening results. More than 1 × 107 colonies were analyzed in each screen. The cyclin K gene isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen was missing 20 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus when compared with a previously published sequence. A full-length cDNA clone was generated using a polymerase chain reaction method. CDK9-cyclin T1, CDK9-cyclin K, and cyclin K were purified by successive chromatographic steps on nickel-agarose and gel filtration using identical conditions. The nickel-agarose step was performed as described previously (12Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Five ml of the material eluting from nickel-agarose (2.5–5.0 mg) was loaded into a Superdex 200 column (Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 500 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME). One 30-ml fraction (corresponding to the void volume) and 90 1.5-ml fractions (included volume) were collected. CDK9 was obtained from insect cells that were infected with a virus expressing His-tagged human CDK9 and untagged Drosophilacyclin T(dT). The CDK9-dT complex was purified on a nickel-agarose column using the same conditions used to purify the CDK9/human-cyclin T1 complex (12Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The complex formed between human CDK9 and dcT is unstable in 0.5 m KCl, and most of dcT was removed in the nickel-agarose step (data not shown). The CDK9 nickel-agarose fraction was further fractionated on a Mono Q (HR 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm BME and CDK9 recovered in the flow-through fraction was used in subsequent experiments. The Mono Q step yields CDK9 that is completely free of dcT. Kinase reactions (50 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 0.3 μCi of [32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol), 10 mm BME, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a 0.3 mm amount of a biotinylated peptide containing four copies of the consensus CTD heptapeptide YSPTSPS. Reactions were performed on 96-well microtiter plates coated with NeutraAvidin (Reacti-Bind NeutraAvidin plates, Pierce). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. At the end of the incubation time, reaction mixtures were removed, the plates were washed three times with distilled water and allowed to air dry before the addition scintillation mixture (Wallac). Plates were read in a microplate scintillation counter (Packard). To further characterize CDK9-containing complexes we decided to employ the two-hybrid protein interaction method to identify CDK9-interacting proteins. We used the full-length CDK9 gene as bait to screen an expression library generated from Jurkat cell cDNA. Three different strong positive genes that were also positive in secondary screens were isolated (see “Materials and Methods”). Sequence analysis of these genes revealed that one of them encoded a novel protein and the other two encoded cyclin T1 and cyclin K, respectively. The isolation of cyclin T1 validated the screen in that it showed the Gal4-CDK9 bait protein was competent for binding to a physiologically relevant CDK9-interacting protein. Cyclin K was recently identified in a genetic screen in yeast by virtue of its ability to complement the lethality associated with the deletion of G1 cyclin genes (14Edwards M.C. Wong C. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was previously reported that cyclin K interacts with RNA polymerase II and that immunoprecipitates obtained with cyclin K antibodies contained CTD and Cdk kinase kinase activity (14Edwards M.C. Wong C. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Those studies, however, did not identify the kinase that associates with cyclin K and could not rule out the possibility that contaminating kinases present in the immunoprecipitates were responsible for the observed CTD and Cdk kinase kinase activities. The interaction between CDK9 and cyclin K in the yeast two-hybrid assay was specific as suggested by the observation that neither the CDK9 bait plasmid, cyclin T1, or cyclin K target plasmids conferred significant growth to yeast cells when transfected independently (Fig.1). Cyclin T1 and cyclin K scored similarly in the growth selection assay when cotransfected together with the CDK9 bait plasmid (Fig. 1), suggesting that both proteins interact with CDK9 with similar efficiency in this assay system. The results described above suggested that cyclin K can interact with CDK9in vivo. To extend this observation we expressed both proteins using a baculovirus expression system and asked whether cyclin K could form a stable protein complex with CDK9 in vitro. Insect cells were either infected with a virus expressing cyclin K or co-infected with both CDK9 and cyclin K expressing baculoviruses. Cyclin K contained a histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus and CDK9 was untagged. Purification of cyclin K on nickel-agarose columns indicated that CDK9 could be readily isolated together with cyclin K from extracts derived from co-infected cells but not from extracts that were infected with the cyclin K expressing virus alone, indicating that this was not endogenous CDK9 (data not shown). The stability of the nickel-agarose CDK9-cyclin K complex was further analyzed by fractionation on a gel filtration column equilibrated in a buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. Analyses of columnn fractions by Coomassie staining of protein gels revealed that all of the CDK9 isolated together with cyclin K by nickel-agarose chromatography remained tightly bound to cyclin K after size exclusion fractionation in high salt conditions (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, the elution profile of CDK9 in the CDK9-cyclin K complex was indicative of a complex with larger molecular mass than that of CDK9 purified in the absence of a cyclin partner (Fig. 2 A). These results demonstrate that cyclin K can form an stable protein complex with CDK9. Next we analyzed whether cyclin K could regulate CDK9 activity. To begin to address this possibility we analyzed the kinase activity of the gel filtration column fractions using a CTD peptide as substrate (Fig. 2 B). Potent kinase activity was detected that perfectly overlapped with the elution profile of the CDK9-cyclin K complex (Fig. 2 B). To rule out the possibility that this activity could come from complexes formed between CDK9 and endogenous cyclin T rather than from the CDK9-cyclin K complex detected by Coomassie staining, we compared its elution profile to that of the human CDK9-cyclin T1 complex and determined that the elution profiles of both complexes could be readily distinguished. Furthermore, the levels of kinase activity recovered from both fractionations were in the same range (2-fold difference), which also argues against the possibility that cyclin T from insect cells could be responsible for the activity associated with the CDK9-cyclin K complex (Fig. 2 B). It was important to quantitate the activity of the CDK9-cyclin K complex and to compare its specific activity to that of the better characterized CDK9-cyclin T1 complex. CDK9 and both kinase complexes were purified from insect cells to near homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods.” The only difference between each kinase complex is that the CDK9-cyclin T1 complex contains a histidine tag in the CDK9 subunit while the CDK9-cyclin K complex contains a histidine tag at the NH2 terminus of the cyclin K subunit. Expression of CDK9 in the absence of a cyclin subunit yielded very low levels of purified protein, and therefore we decided to co-express CDK9 withDrosophila cyclin T, because this cyclin readily dissociates from CDK9 under high ionic strength. Each protein preparation was carefully quantitated (Fig.3 A) and used in dose-response experiments. We found that the specific activity of the CDK9-cyclin K complex was almost half of that of CDK9-cyclin T1 complex but between 10–15 times greater than that of CDK9 alone (Fig. 3 B). We cannot rule out the possibility that the small levels of kinase activity detected with CDK9 alone might come from contamination withDrosophila cyclin T1. These experiments clearly indicate that binding of cyclin K to CDK9 results in the reconstitution of an active CTD kinase. We have previously shown that extracts depleted of P-TEFb activity with CDK9 antibodies do not support efficient transcript elongation and that this transcription deficiency can be complemented with the recombinant CDK9-cylin T1 complex (12Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). To test whether the CDK9-cyclin K complex was also transcriptionally competent, CDK9-depleted extracts were supplemented with different amounts of each kinase complex and found that CDK9-cyclin K promoted the formation of DRB sensitive transcripts (Fig. 4). The transcription activity of the CDK9-cyclin K complex was lower than that of the CDK9-cyclin T1 complex, and the difference in transcription activity between both kinase complexes seems to be proportional to their kinase activity (Fig. 4). Importantly, CDK-cyclin K-dependent transcription was inhibited by DRB (Fig. 4) and by other drugs previously shown to inhibit P-TEFb kinase activity (data not shown). In this study we provide conclusive biochemical evidence indicating that cyclin K can function as a CDK9 regulatory subunit. This is an unexpected finding because the cyclin box of cyclin K is only 29% identical to the cyclin T1 cyclin box at the amino acid level. Despite the seemingly low sequence similarity, cyclin K is most closely related to human cyclins T1 and T2 among all other known human cyclin genes in the cyclin box region (data not shown). Interestingly, our unpublished observations 3T. J. Fu and O. Flores, unpublished results. indicate that the binding of Drosophila cyclin T to CDK9 is weaker than that of cyclin K despite the fact that the sequence similarity of Drosophila cyclin T to human cyclin T1 is much higher (60% identity). The functional consequence of having multiple regulatory subunits for CDK9 is not yet understood. Thus far we have not found obvious differences in substrate specificity among CDK9 complexes assembled with different cyclins suggesting that they might be functionally equivalent at least in vitro (data not shown). Consistent with this interpretation we have shown that like CDK9-cyclin T1/2, CDK9-cyclin K also phosphorylates CTD substrates and stimulates the synthesis of DRB-sensitive transcripts in vitro (Figs. 3 and4). Moreover, we have found that CDK9-cyclin K has the same sensitivity to a panel of structurally diverse inhibitors of CDK9-cyclin T1 (data not shown). It is also possible that functional differences among recombinant CDK9 complexes cannot be detected in these in vitro assays due to the absence of additional factors involved in kinase function. Such factors might be scaffold proteins that bind to different cyclin subunits and confer selectivity by mediating interaction with specific protein substrates and recruitment of the kinase complex to a specific promoters. Precedent for this type of regulation comes from the finding that the HIV Tat protein binds directly to a domain within the cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb and thereby recruits the P-TEFb complex to early elongation complexes formed at the HIV long terminal repeat promoter (15Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The Tat interaction region is located outside the cyclin box homology region of cyclin T1 (16Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), is not present in cyclins T2 and K, and is therefore cyclin T1-specific. Since the activation of T cells is accompanied by an up-regulation of cyclin T1 levels (18Garriga J. Peng J. Parreno M. Price D.H. Henderson E.E. Grana X. Oncogene. 1999; 17: 3093-3102Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Herrmann C.H. Carroll R.G. Wei P. Jones K.A. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9881-9888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that cyclin K levels may be regulated in a developmental or tissue specific manner to modulate the P-TEFb activity. Work with the P-TEFb complex has shown conclusively that CDK9 is involved in transcription regulation and has led to the proposal that phosphorylation of the RNAPII CTD mediates the positive effect of P-TEFb in transcription elongation (1Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Flores O. Lee G. Kessler J. Miller M. Schlief W. Tomassini J. Hazuda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7208-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we show that CDK9-cyclin K phosphorylates the RNAPII CTD and stimulates transcription elongation but with slightly lower efficiency than the CDK9-cyclin T1 complex (Figs. 3 and 4). The transcription activity of both complexes seems to be directly proportional to their CTD kinase activity and the activity of the CDK9-cyclin K complex is lower than that of CDK9-cyclin T1 in both assays. This difference in activity might simply reflect a lower specific activity of the CDK9-cyclin K complex or might indicate that the CTD is not the preferred substrate of the CDK9-cyclin K complex. It is also entirely possible that phosphorylation of other protein factors instead of or in addition to the CTD of RNAPII might mediate CDK9-dependent transcription regulation. The identification of cyclin K as a CDK9 regulatory subunit will undoubtedly help to address many important questions that will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism by which CDK9 modulates gene expression. We thank members of the Price and Flores laboratories for helpful discussions."

The requirements and pathways involved in novel (nPKC) phosphorylation have been investigated here. The evidence presented for nPKCδ shows that there are two independent kinase pathways that act upon the activation loop (Thr-505) and a C-terminal hydrophobic site (Ser-662) and that the phosphorylation of the Ser-662 site is protected from dephosphorylation by the Thr-505 phosphorylation. Both phosphorylations require C1 domain-dependent allosteric activation of PKC. The third site (Ser-643) appears to be an autophosphorylation site. The serum-dependent phosphorylation of the Thr-505 and Ser-662 sites increases nPKCδ activity up to 80-fold. Phosphorylation at the Ser-662 site is independently controlled by a pathway involving mammalian TOR (mTOR) because the rapamycin-induced block of its phosphorylation is overcome by co-expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR. Consistent with this role of mTOR, amino acid deprivation selectively inhibits the serum-induced phosphorylation of the Ser-662 site in nPKCδ.

This includes the various second messenger-dependent kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKG, the CAMkinases, and the lipid-dependent protein kinases C (PKC)1 (see Ref. 1Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar for classification). The ability of the relevant effectors to cause activation of these protein kinases has colored the view that they operate exclusively to relay changes in their particular effector concentrations to their respective target proteins. While this remains a key component of their action, it has become clear that for many of these protein kinases, there are additional controls. Broadly these fall into two categories, one relating to the subcellular compartmentalization of the protein kinases and the other to the phosphorylation of the kinases themselves. The subcellular distribution has profound effects upon the specificity of action of these proteins, by localizing the kinase close to substrate(s) and regulators (reviewed Refs. 2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar and 3Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430PubMed Google Scholar). The control through phosphorylation can serve a number of functions, including the regulation of catalytic potential (e.g. Refs. 4Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol.

The phosphorylation of the cPKC isotypes within these three sites acts cooperatively to maintain the kinase in an active conformation, although still requiring diacylglycerol (DAG) for activity (13Bornancin F.

The other two sites are toward the C terminus and include a predicted autophosphorylation site followed by (19 residues C-terminal) a hydrophobic site in an FXXFS/TF/Y motif. These phosphorylations play more subtle roles in maintaining a closed conformer that has optimum thermal stability and resistance to proteases and phosphatases (14Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Regulatory domain contacts are also influenced by phosphorylation at the C terminus, as evidenced by a shift in Ca2+ dependence (18Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For other PKC isotypes (novel/atypical PKC (n/aPKC)), there is less information on the detailed behavior of phosphorylation site mutants although there is accumulating evidence that in mammalian cells these proteins are all phosphorylated to some degree in these conserved sites (19Le Good J.A.

This input to PKC provides an explanation for the controlling influence of PI 3-kinase that has been observed (21Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y.

Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), i.e. PI 3-kinase activation of PKC is channeled through PDK1 via PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production. The pathway(s) to the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic C-terminal site in PKC is less well understood. Previous studies have suggested that this may be an autophosphorylation site for cPKC isotypes (23Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be the case for nPKC isotypes. For these latter proteins, there is evidence that an aPKC may be responsible for this phosphorylation (25Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D.H. Kelly J.J. Frech M.M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However the particular upstream kinase involved physiologically remains to be identified unequivocally.In assessing the role of upstream kinases in controlling the phosphorylation of the C-terminal hydrophobic sites in nPKCδ in vivo, it has been noted that their phosphorylation is inhibited by the treatment of cells with the potent immunosuppressant drug rapamycin (25Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D.H. Kelly J.J. Frech M.M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This parallels the effect of rapamycin on the equivalent phosphorylation in p70S6k (26Ferrari S. Pearson R.B. Siegmann M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16091-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that PKC may lie on a similar signaling pathway with respect to the phosphorylation of this site. Here we define the requirements for serum-induced phosphorylation of nPKCδ and nPKCε and show that mTOR plays a selective role in controlling phosphorylation in the hydrophobic C-terminal site. Consistent with the defined role for TOR in nutrient sensing (reviewed in Ref. 27Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), amino acid deprivation is shown to influence nPKC phosphorylation specifically at this C-terminal site.DISCUSSIONThe control of PKC isotypes by phosphorylation has become a central feature of our understanding of PKC signaling. The results here elucidate three key aspects of these upstream controls acting upon nPKCs. First, there is a requirement for allosteric activation. Second, there are two distinguishable protein kinase inputs neither of which require activity of the nPKC itself. Third, one of these phosphorylations is shown to be under the control of mTOR. Coupled to previous studies on the activation loop phosphorylation of nPKCδ by PDK1, a summary of nPKC control can be made (Fig.8) that serves as a working model (discussed below).Elucidation of the phosphorylation of PKC by upstream protein kinases has been complicated by the behavior of the cPKC isotypes which, while best understood in respect of phosphorylation sites, have proven difficult to work with in dephosphorylated form either in vitro or in vivo (discussed in Ref. 14Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recent progress in this area has come from work on nPKC and aPKC isotypes (19Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar,20Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have provided compelling evidence that PDK1 phosphorylates nPKCδ and aPKCζ in vitro and in vivo. In fact all PKC isotypes tested have been shown to form a complex with PDK1 (19Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), indicating that PDK1 has the potential to be a common upstream kinase for PKC isotypes. Evidence that this is indeed the case for cPKCs has been reported (24Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The conservation of the PKC activation loop sequences at the predicted phosphorylation sites is consistent with this notion.The two C-terminal phosphorylation sites identified in cPKC isotypes are also conserved in nPKC and aPKC isotypes although in aPKCs the serine/threonine at the more C-terminal hydrophobic site is replaced by a glutamic acid residue, with conservation of the surrounding FXXFEF/Y motif. It has been proposed that for cPKCs this C-terminal hydrophobic site is an autophosphorylation site (23Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). While this has yet to be corroborated in vivo, the evidence for nPKC is that this phosphorylation involves an upstream kinase acting on this V5 domain. Thus nPKCδ expressed in bacteria is not phosphorylated on Ser-662 while it is phosphorylated on the adjacent autophosphorylation site Ser-643. More compelling evidence is presented here through use of the catalytic site inhibitors BIM I and Gö6983, which under serum-starved conditions block Ser-643 phosphorylation of nPKCδ in vivo while having no such effect on the phosphorylation of Ser-662 (or Thr-505). The conclusion that there is a heterologous kinase required to phosphorylate PKC isotypes at these hydrophobic sites is consistent with the evidence that an aPKC complex may be responsible for this phosphorylation (25Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D.H. Kelly J.J. Frech M.M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).It is of note that both serum-induced phosphorylations (Thr-505 and Ser-662) are inhibited by the DAG competitive inhibitor calphostin C, indicating that activation at the membrane is important for effective phosphorylation. The PDK1 phosphorylation of PKC resembles that of PKB where co-recruitment to or allosteric activation at membranes is required for phosphorylation (35Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 36Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). There is, however, a key difference for nPKC isotypes in that two distinct signaling pathways are involved, i.e. PtdIns-phospholipase C (DAG) and PI 3-kinase (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3). PKC thus serves to integrate these two cellular inputs.Once in an activated conformation, nPKCδ can be phosphorylated on either the Thr-505 or Ser-662 sites. However the Ser-662 phosphorylation is subject to efficient dephosphorylation in the absence of Thr-505 phosphorylation. This is evidenced by the behavior of the nPKCδ T505A mutant, which only becomes phosphorylated at the Ser-662 site in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. This property is partly reminiscent of that described for PKCα where lack of phosphates at one of the three priming sites can sensitize the other sites to TPA-induced dephosphorylation (13Bornancin F. Parker P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This relationship means that for PKCδ, while there is no conditional requirement, there would appear to be a preferred order of phosphorylations, with Thr-505 preceding Ser-662. This is also consistent with the response to rapamycin, which has a specific effect on the Ser-662 site without influencing the Thr-505 site,i.e. the occupation of the Ser-662 site has little influence on the Thr-505 site under these conditions.With respect to the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic sites in nPKCδ/ε, the studies here demonstrate that mTOR has a dominant role in controlling phosphorylation; this is particular to the nPKCδ Ser-662 site (and nPKCε Ser-729 site), with no acute effect upon the activation loop site. In extending these observations to a physiological pathway, we have demonstrated that amino acid deprivation blocks nPKCδ-induced phosphorylation at the Ser-662 site. Under these conditions, no effect of amino acid depletion is observed for the Thr-505 site, showing that the PI 3-kinase/PDK1 pathway is not affected and illustrating the independent control of these phosphorylation events. Thus at least one further pathway acts upon nPKC isotypes in a manner controlled by mTOR. It is possible that as predicted for p70S6k the effect of mTOR on Ser-662 phosphorylation is mediated by the control of a protein phosphatase (see Ref. 27Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), although alternative mechanisms may be involved (for example, see Ref.37Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar).The various inputs to nPKC discussed above are summarized in Fig. 8, including the points at which inhibitors act. The overall picture is of agonist-dependent nPKC allosteric activation at the membrane through the C1 domain. In this conformation, the nPKC is acted upon by two membrane-associated kinases, PDK1 and a hydrophobic site kinase, probably comprising an aPKC complex. This activated nPKC can also autophosphorylate. A permissive input (mTOR) operates in parallel to this such that, under certain unfavorable conditions (e.g. amino acid deprivation), the hydrophobic C-terminal site remains dephosphorylated. Hence nPKC acts to integrate information from three defined inputs and a fourth yet to be fully defined. It is the combined effect of these inputs that leads to optimum nPKC function. Lack of phosphorylation at Ser-662 (rapamycin) or Thr-505/Ser-662 (LY294002) reduces the specific activity of immunopurified nPKCδ by ∼10- and ∼90-fold, respectively, while lack of DAG interaction would both block phosphorylation and prevent allosteric activation of otherwise phosphorylated nPKC. This integration of information and the ability to store it (PKC once phosphorylated can remain phosphorylated for minutes to hours) represent important features of cellular control.It is established that in yeast, TOR1/2 controls amino acid sensing with consequent effects upon translation and cell cycle progression (27Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 38Kunz J. Henriques R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In mammals, a similar situation pertains with mTOR acting to control translation through p70S6k and 4E-BP1phosphorylation (see Refs. 27Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar and 39Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It has been thought that the proximal downstream effects of rapamycin, via inhibition of mTOR, were largely accounted for by the inhibition of these phosphorylation events. However, the studies here identify the nPKC isotypes as additional downstream targets of this pathway. The site-specific effect of amino acid starvation on PKCδ and the control of this phosphorylation by rapamycin, leads to the conclusion that mTOR couples this sensing pathway to PKCδ. The recent studies on p70S6k (34Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 40Shigemitsu K. Tsujishita Y. Hara K. Nanahoshi M. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) suggests that mTOR may play a pleiotropic role in controlling the phosphorylation of hydrophobic sites in multiple AGC subfamily kinases. The demonstration that PKCε is also subject to mTOR control supports assignment of such a broad role. The placement of nPKCs on an amino acid sensing pathway implies that this is part of the cells adaptive response. How nPKC function may be deployed to protect cells from amino acid deprivation (e.g.in reducing protein synthesis, enhancing protein degradation) remains to be determined. The allosteric control of a number of protein kinases is an essential feature of their operation as signal transducers. This includes the various second messenger-dependent kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKG, the CAMkinases, and the lipid-dependent protein kinases C (PKC)1 (see Ref. 1Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar for classification). The ability of the relevant effectors to cause activation of these protein kinases has colored the view that they operate exclusively to relay changes in their particular effector concentrations to their respective target proteins. While this remains a key component of their action, it has become clear that for many of these protein kinases, there are additional controls. Broadly these fall into two categories, one relating to the subcellular compartmentalization of the protein kinases and the other to the phosphorylation of the kinases themselves. The subcellular distribution has profound effects upon the specificity of action of these proteins, by localizing the kinase close to substrate(s) and regulators (reviewed Refs. 2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar and 3Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430PubMed Google Scholar). The control through phosphorylation can serve a number of functions, including the regulation of catalytic potential (e.g. Refs. 4Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC is an interesting example of this class of proteins, and there is ample evidence for both types of control acting, i.e. PKC-targeting proteins (7Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and PKC phosphorylation (8Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar); both are established as critical to the roles of PKC in controlling cell behavior (for example Refs. 9Whelan D.H. Parker P.J.

Despite the critical nature of these controls, there is only limited information on the additional signaling pathways that input to PKC through these mechanisms. Classical PKC (cPKC) isotypes (α, β1, β2, γ) are known to be phosphorylated in at least three sites (11Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol.

In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor and lysophosphatidic acid receptor, these processes can lead to ERK activation. Here we identify a novel mechanism whereby the activity of GRK2 is regulated by feedback inhibition. GRK2 is demonstrated to be a phosphoprotein in cells. Mass spectrometry and mutational analysis localize the site of phosphorylation on GRK2 to a carboxyl-terminal serine residue (Ser670). Phosphorylation at Ser670 impairs the ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate both soluble and membrane-incorporated receptor substrates and dramatically attenuates Gβγ-mediated activation of this enzyme. Ser670 is located in a peptide sequence that conforms to an ERK consensus phosphorylation sequence, and in vitro, in the presence of heparin, ERK1 phosphorylates GRK2. Inhibition of ERK activity in HEK293 cells potentiates GRK2 activity, whereas, conversely, ERK activation inhibits GRK2 activity. The discovery that ERK phosphorylates and inactivates GRK2 suggests that ERK participates in a feedback regulatory loop.

Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). GRK-phosphorylated GPCRs bind stoichiometrically to inhibitory proteins known as arrestins. The binding of β-arrestin1 or -2, extraretinal isoforms, prevents receptor-mediated G protein activation, recruits other molecules such as Src to the receptor, and serves to target the phosphorylated receptor for internalization via clathrin-coated pits (2Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Src and engagement of the clathrin-coated pit system by the phosphorylated β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) have been shown to be essential for β2AR-mediated ERK activation (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The GRKs thus play a critical role in regulating GPCR-mediated signal transduction. Following agonist exposure, GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation leads to an attenuation of G protein-mediated signaling (receptor desensitization) while at the same time initiating receptor-mediated ERK activation. The activity of the GRKs is tightly regulated via a number of mechanisms. These include regulation by the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gβγ), lipids (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylserine), and cytoskeletal (actin) and calcium-binding proteins (recoverin, calmodulin), as well as by protein kinase C (reviewed in Ref. 1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In most cases regulation of the GRKs is subfamily-specific. Here we identify a previously unappreciated and apparently specific mechanism by which GRK2 activity is regulated. GRK2 is demonstrated to exist as a phosphoprotein in cells. Mapping the site of phosphorylation, elucidating the functional consequences of this phosphorylation event, and identifying the GRK2 kinase in cells yields new insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling GPCR-mediated signal transduction. GRK2 was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (4Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar).

Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), and the dominant-negative ERK/MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) (MEK1(K97A)) and constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1(S218D/S222D)) constructs were provided by Edwin G. Krebs (University of Washington) and Raymond L. Erikson (Harvard University), respectively. Using polymerase chain reaction, a 5′ Kozak sequence was added to bovine GRK2 and inserted into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pRK5 to form the wild type construct pRK5-GRK2 wildtype. The carboxyl-terminal Ser was mutated to Ala or Asp to form pRK5-GRK2(S670A) and pRK5-GRK2(S670D). The baculovirus plasmids pVL1392 (PharMingen)-GRK2(S670A) and pVL1392-GRK2(S670D) were made by excising and ligating theEcoRI/BamHI fragment of the respective pRK5 construct into pVL1392. Purified phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GRK2 (2 μm) was incubated with purified ERK1 (30 nm) in 40 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol containing 60 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 25 μl. Incubations were performed ± heparin (7 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 45 min. The stoichiometry of ERK-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). When the activity of ERK-phosphorylated GRK2 was assessed, radiolabeled ATP was omitted and reactions were terminated by desalting on d-Salt Polyacrylamide 6000 Plastic Desalting columns (Pierce) to remove heparin and ATP. GRK2 remaining in solution following the desalting procedure was determined by quantitative Western blot using anti-GRK2 antibodies (10Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled phosphorylation reaction was performed alongside nonradioactive reactions to assess the stoichiometry of ERK-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation. GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of tubulin, rhodopsin in ROS membranes, and purified reconstituted β2AR were performed as described (11Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S.

Cells were treated with staurosporin (1 μm) during the32Pi labeling period and with the β2AR agonist (isoproterenol, 10 μm) for 5 min prior to harvest. 32P-labeled β2AR was immunoprecipitated from cells transiently transfected with GRK2 and a dominant-negative or constitutively active MEK construct. The phosphorylation status of ERK was determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphoERK antibody (Promega) (13Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). GRK2 was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using previously published procedures (4Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant protein appeared pure by Coomassie Blue staining, but isoelectric focusing revealed two distinct major bands and a number of minor associated bands. GRK2 purified enzyme was resolved into two peaks of GRK2 protein and activity on Source-S (Fig.1). Notably, as compared with the first peak (P1), the second peak (P2) exhibited a higher specific activity. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that P1 contained a major and a minor species of GRK2 with molecular mass values of 79,777 and 79,646 Da, respectively, whereas P2 contained a single species of 79,690 Da. Because the predicted molecular mass of bovine GRK2 is 79,656 Da, and amino-terminal sequencing of the protein failed, P2 appears to correspond to amino-terminally acylated, full-length GRK2. The major P1 species is larger than the mass of P2 by the mass of one phosphate. The minor P1 species appears to lack the amino-terminal methionine with respect to the major species. P1 and P2 GRK2 were both subjected to tryptic digestion, and the peptides from each were analyzed on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. By comparing these spectra, a single candidate peptide (Met664–Lys677) was found whose mass appeared augmented by 80 Da in P1 versus P2. This peptide (MKNKPRSPVVELSK) contains two phosphorylatable residues, Ser670 and Ser676. Thus P1 and P2 likely differ by virtue of a single phosphorylation event at either Ser670 or Ser676. Notably, Ser670resides in a sequence that conforms to an ERK consensus phosphorylation sequence, i.e. PX(S/T)P. Indeed, the peptide sequence immediately surrounding Ser670 in GRK2 is identical to the ERK phosphorylation site in c-ELK (PRSP) (14Cobb M.H. Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Factsbook. Academic Press, London1995: 214-216Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to P1 or P2 were assessed for their ability to phosphorylate purified reconstituted β2AR or the soluble GRK2 substrate tubulin. As shown in Table I, P1 exhibited a higher affinity for substrate than P2 as reflected in the lower K mof phosphorylated GRK2 for β2AR and tubulin. The maximal rate of substrate phosphorylation (V max) was, however, significantly lower for P1 than P2. The most profound difference was observed when β2AR, in the presence of Gβγ subunits, was utilized as substrate. Under these conditions P1 had an approximately 8-fold lower V max than P2 (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GRK2 for β2AR and tubulinSubstratePhosphorylated GRK2 (P1)Unphosphorylated GRK2 (P2)K mV maxK mV maxμmpmol/min/mgμmpmol/ min/mgβ2AR0.05 ± 0.030.01 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.040.02 ± 0.01β2AR + Gβγ0.05 ± 0.010.31 ± 0.140.14 ± 0.032.55 ± 1.53Tubulin0.15 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.030.50 ± 0.110.23 ± 0.92Purified reconstituted β2AR (0.3–0.9 μm) and tubulin (0.3–9.0 μm) were phosphorylated as previously described (11Pitcher J.A.

Phosphorylation reactions were performed for 10 min at 30 °C in either the presence or absence of Gβγ (100 nm). The results shown represent the mean values obtained from three separate determinations. We next examined the dose dependent activation of the two GRK2 species by Gβγ. As shown in Fig.2 A, P1 exhibits dramatically impaired Gβγ-mediated activation of GRK2. These results reveal a profound functional consequence of GRK2 phosphorylation, an impairment of the rate of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation, and further suggest that this modification may serve to attenuate receptor-mediated allosteric activation of GRK2. To demonstrate that Ser670 represents a site of phosphorylation, two mutant forms of GRK2 were constructed. In these mutants one of the candidate sites of phosphorylation, S670, was mutated to either an alanine (GRK2(S670A)) or an aspartic acid residue (GRK2(S670D)). If S670 indeed represents the site of GRK2 phosphorylation, it would therefore be predicted that mutating this site to alanine would produce a form of the kinase that behaves like unphosphorylated GRK2. Conversely, mutating this site to an aspartic acid residue would be predicted to produce an enzyme that mimics phosphorylated GRK2. If Ser676, and not Ser670, is a site of phosphorylation, then mutation of Ser670 would be predicted not to affect the phosphorylation status of GRK2. The two mutant forms of GRK2 were expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells. The chromatographic profile of these enzymes on Source-S and their responsiveness to Gβγ subunits when rhodopsin was used as a substrate was subsequently examined. GRK2(S670A) and GRK2(S670D) chromatographed as single peaks on Source-S eluting at 100 mm NaCl for GRK2(S670A) and 70 mm NaCl for GRK2(S670D). These elution positions are identical to P2 and P1, respectively, observations consistent with the identification of Ser670 as the site of GRK2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the Gβγ sensitivity of GRK2(S670A) and GRK2(S670D) is essentially identical to that observed using the unphosphorylated (P2) and phosphorylated (P1) forms of wild type GRK2 (compare Fig. 2,panels A and B). These results identify Ser670, a potential site of ERK phosphorylation, as the GRK2 residue phosphorylated in Sf9 cells. To determine whether ERK may indeed be the enzyme responsible for phosphorylating GRK2 in cells, the ability of purified ERK1 to phosphorylate unphosphorylated or phosphorylated GRK2 was examined in vitro. ERK1 phosphorylated unphosphorylated but not phosphorylated GRK2. However, this phosphorylation occurred only when heparin, an inhibitor of GRK2, was present in the phosphorylation reaction (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 5and 6). These results demonstrate that ERK1 can phosphorylate GRK2 in vitro and that this phosphorylation occurs on Ser670, because GRK2 phosphorylated at this site is not a substrate for ERK1 (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 6, upper and lower panels). There are several potential explanations for the requirement of heparin in these in vitro phosphorylation reactions. GRK2 may phosphorylate and inactivate ERK1. ERK1-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation would thus be predicted to occur only when GRK2 activity is inhibited,i.e. in the presence of heparin. Alternatively, ERK1-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation may be conformation-dependent. Heparin may mimic a natural ligand of GRK2 that upon binding exposes Ser670. GRK2 has no effect on ERK1 activity as assessed by the ability of ERK1 to phosphorylate myelin basic protein in the presence or absence of GRK2 (data not shown). Additionally, ERK1 fails to phosphorylate GRK2 in the presence of heparin when GRK2 is denatured. These results suggest that the conformation of GRK2 is critical for ERK1-mediated phosphorylation (data not shown). The nature of the putative ligand required for ERK-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation in cells remains to be elucidated. Known regulators of GRK2 activity including, Gβγ and/or PIP2, phosphatidylserine, and Ca2+/calmodulin failed to support ERK1-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation (data not shown). The ERK1-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 observed in vitrowould be predicted to alter the functional properties of this enzyme if ERK1 phosphorylates Ser670 and phosphorylation at this site is responsible for attenuating the Gβγ sensitivity of this enzyme. Unphosphorylated GRK2 incubated in the presence of heparin in either the presence or absence of ERK1 was subjected to gel filtration to remove heparin, and its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin in the presence of varying concentrations of Gβγ was examined. As shown in Fig. 3 B ERK1-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 dramatically impairs GRK2 activity and sensitivity to Gβγ activation. These results again support the assignment of Ser670 as the phosphorylated residue in GRK2 and suggest that under the appropriate conditions ERK1 is capable of mediating this phosphorylation event. The requirement of heparin in the in vitro ERK1 phosphorylation assays raises the question of whether this kinase is responsible for phosphorylating GRK2 in cells. To examine a potential role for ERKs in phosphorylating and regulating GRK2 activity in cellular systems, we examined the effect of modulating ERK activity on GRK2-mediated β2AR phosphorylation. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged β2AR, and GRK2 were additionally transfected with either a dominant-negative or a constitutively active form of ERK kinase-1 (MEK1). MEK1 is a dual specificity threonine/tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and activates ERK1 and -2. Transfection of dominant-negative (MEK(K/A)) or constitutively active (MEK(DD)) forms of MEK thus regulates ERK activity in cells. Transfected HEK293 cells were labeled with 32Pi and the ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate β2AR assessed by immunoprecipitation of32P-labeled receptor following agonist treatment. Transfection of dominant-negative MEK (MEK(K/A)) and inhibition of ERK activity led to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in GRK2-mediated β2AR phosphorylation (Fig.4). In contrast, transfection of a constitutively active MEK (MEK(DD)) construct and ERK activation mildly attenuated GRK2-mediated β2AR phosphorylation (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the identification of ERK as the kinase responsible for phosphorylating GRK2 in cells. Inhibition of the GRK2 kinase would be predicted to increase the amount of unphosphorylated GRK2 present in this cellular system and thus to increase GRK2 activity. In contrast, activation of the GRK2 kinase would be predicted to increase the amount of phosphorylated GRK2 impairing GRK2-mediated phosphorylation events. The high basal level of GRK2 phosphorylation observed in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1) may provide an explanation for the relatively small effect of MEK(DD) transfection on GRK2 activity (Fig. 4). The discovery that GRK2 exists as a phosphoprotein in cells provides a striking analogy between GRK2 and β-arrestin1 (13Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15971-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin1 binds to GRK-phosphorylated GPCRs and serves to uncouple the phosphorylated receptor from G proteins and to target it to clathrin-coated pits for internalization. β-Arrestin1, like GRK2, exists as a phosphoprotein in cells (13Lin F.T.

Indeed, ERK has recently been shown to phosphorylate β-arrestin1 in cells (15Lin F-T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15971-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 occurs at the plasma membrane following agonist occupancy of GPCRs and is required for the high affinity interaction of βarrestin1 and clathrin (13Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, two proteins required for mediating the internalization of agonist-occupied GPCRs, GRK2 and β-arrestin1, are ERK substrates. Engagement of the clathrin-coated pit endocytosis machinery has been shown to be required for ERK activation by the β2AR (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). By phosphorylating and regulating the activity of two key players in this internalization process, ERK can thus be envisioned as participating in a negative feedback regulatory loop. It is of interest to note that ERK phosphorylation at Ser412 is specific to β-arrestin1, because this residue is not conserved in other members of the arrestin family. Similarly Ser670 of GRK2 is not conserved in GRK3. It will be of interest to determine whether phosphorylation by ERK is a regulatory mechanism specific to GRK2 and β-arrestin1 or if other members of these protein families are regulated by ERK phosphorylation. The observation that β-arrestin1 is dephosphorylated at the plasma membrane following agonist occupancy of GPCRs suggests, by analogy, that a similar mechanism for dephosphorylating GRK2 may exist. These two proteins may be dephosphorylated by the same phosphatase. Although several questions remain concerning the exact mechanism of ERK-mediated GRK2 phosphorylation, the elucidation of a potential role for ERK in regulating this enzyme provides novel insights into the mechanisms controlling GPCR-mediated signal transduction.

This trimolecular interaction promotes conformational changes in the gp120-gp41 complex, leading to the ill-defined fusion process between the viral and host cell membranes (18Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The fact that some lentivirus strains are able to enter CD4-negative cells through a direct interaction with chemokine receptors has led to the suggestion that chemokine receptors constitute the primordial receptor for primate lentiviruses (19Martin K.A.

Transmission of HIV infection is typically mediated by viral strains that use CCR5 as a coreceptor (R5 or macrophage tropic strains), whereas development of AIDS is often associated with the emergence of strains that use CXCR4 exclusively (X4 or T-tropic strains) or in addition to CCR5 (R5X4 or dual tropic strains) (22Schuitemaker H.

The key role of CCR5 in HIV pathogenesis was demonstrated by the observation that individuals homozygous for a 32-base pair deletion in the CCR5 coding region (CCR5Δ32), resulting in the production of a truncated and non-functional receptor, are highly resistant to HIV infection (24Samson M.

The understanding at the molecular level of how CCR5 interacts with chemokines and HIV could help the design of new drugs and vaccines endowed with more potent HIV suppressive activities. For example, broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies have been generated by immunization with an HIV Env protein conformationally modified by its interaction with CD4 and coreceptors (38LaCasse R.A.

By using CCR5-CCR2b chimeras, we have shown previously that the amino terminus of CCR5 plays a dominant role in coreceptor activity but that all other extracellular domains of CCR5 contribute to this mechanism as well (40Rucker J.

We have also identified the second extracellular loop of CCR5 as the major determinant of ligand specificity (50Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The study of other chemokine receptors such as CXCR1 and CCR2, however, suggested the existence of two sites contributing to the high affinity binding of chemokines, one located in the amino terminus, the other within the extracellular loops and possibly the transmembrane segments of the receptors (51LaRosa G.J.

Also, studies dealing with chimeras between structurally related receptors do not adequately investigate the regions that are conserved between the two molecules. Therefore, the contribution of shared determinants can easily be overlooked. In the present study, we have investigated the role of the distal region of CCR5 amino terminus in the interaction of the receptor with chemokines and gp120, as well as the functional consequences of these interactions, using a panel of amino-terminal truncations and alanine substitution mutants. We showed that multiple charged and aromatic residues spread along CCR5 amino terminus contribute significantly to the high affinity binding of both chemokines and HIV gp120. CCR5 amino-terminal truncations (Δ2–5, Δ2–9, Δ2–13, and Δ2–17) and alanine substitution mutants were previously described (40Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J.F. Yi Y. Smyth R.J.

All constructs were verified by sequencing before transfection. RANTES was chemically synthesized as described (57Ylisastigui L. Vizzavona J. Drakopoulou E. Paindavoine P. Calvo C.F. Parmentier M. Gluckman J.C. Vita C. Benjouad A. AIDS. 1998; 12: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MIP-1β was synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer (Pioneer, Perspective-Perkin Elmer Biosystems) using fluoremethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry,O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate/diisopropylethylamine activation, and an Fmoc Asn(tri)-polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylserine resin (0.1-mmol scale). All amino acids were coupled twice. The polypeptide was released from the resin by trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/H2O/ethanedithiol/triisopropylethylsilane (85/5/5/2.5/2.5), precipitated in cold diethyl ether, dissolved in aqueous 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, and kept for 1 h at room temperature in order to remove the indole protective group from trytophan. After lyophilization, the crude polypeptide was dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.5, and 16% 2-mercaptoethanol, stirred at 37 °C for 2 h, and then acidified to pH 4. The reduced chemokine was purified on a preparative medium pressure liquid chromatography C18 column (313 × 26 mm, 100-Å, 20-μm Nucleoprep, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) using a 20–80% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions of the major 214-nm UV-absorbing peak were analyzed by high pressure liquid chomatography, and pure fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The reduced chemokine was solubilized in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1m Tris acetate, pH 8.5, then rapidly diluted into 0.1m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.5. The final chemokine concentration was 0.4 mg/ml in 1 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.5. The solution was stirred overnight to allow chemokine folding and gentle air oxidation of the four cysteines. The folded chemokine was submitted to medium pressure liquid chromatography purification as described above. Final purity of MIP-1β was superior to 95% as judged by high pressure liquid chromatography. The molecular weight determined by ion spray mass spectrometry was 7814.23 ± 0.27 (calculated, 7814.79). Protein concentration was determined by amino acids analysis (6300 Beckman amino acid analyzer) following 6 n HCl, 0.2% phenol hydrolysis with norleucine as internal standard. The total yield was 3.5 mg. All chemicals used for the synthesis were purchased from Perspective-Perkin-Elmer. The binding properties of synthetic RANTES and MIP-1β as well as their biological activity were identical to those of commercially available preparations. Other chemokines were purchased from R & D Systems. CHO-K1 cells were cultured using Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A plasmid encoding apo-aequorin under control of the SRα promoter (58Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected into CHO-K1 cells, using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and zeocin (250 μg/ml, Invitrogen), and selection was initiated 2 days later. Individual clones were isolated 3 weeks after transfection, and the most responding clone was selected on the basis of its functional response (luminescence signal) to ionomycin A (100 nm) and ATP (10 μm). Constructs encoding wild-type CCR5 or mutant receptors in the pEFIN bicistronic vector were further transfected using Fugene 6 in this apo-aequorin-expressing cell line. Selection of transfected cells was made for 14 days with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the population of mixed cell clones expressing wild-type or mutant receptors was used for binding and functional studies. The level of receptor expression was measured by quantitative flow cytometry using standardized microbeads (Sigma) and three antibodies directed against CCR5. The phycoerythrin-conjugated 2D7 antibody was obtained from PharMingen, and the phycoerythrin-conjugated 45531 and fluorescein-conjugated 45549 monoclonals were obtained from R & D Systems. CHO-K1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant CCR5 were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000 ×g, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% BSA). Competition binding assays were performed in Minisorb tubes (Nunc), using 0.08 or 0.24 nm125I-MIP-1β (2200 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) as tracer, variable concentrations of competitors, and 40,000 cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Total binding was measured in the absence of competitor, and nonspecific binding was measured with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 27 °C, and then bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 1% BSA. Filters were counted in a β-scintillation counter. Binding parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition model. Functional response to chemokines was analyzed by measuring the luminescence of aequorin as described (59Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cells were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free DMEM supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, pelleted for 2 min at 1000 × g, resuspended in DMEM at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated for 2 h in the dark in the presence of 5 μmcoelenterazine H (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were diluted 7.5-fold before use. Agonists in a volume of 50 μl of DMEM were added to 50 μl of cell suspension (33,000 cells), and luminescence was measured for 30 s in a Berthold luminometer. Inhibition of HIV fusion was performed as described previously (60Rucker J. Doranz B.J. Edinger A.L. Long D. Berson J.F. Doms R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 288 (118–133): 118-133PubMed Google Scholar). PA317-T4 cells cotransfected with CCR5 mutants and a T7 polymerase-dependent luciferase gene were mixed with HeLa cells expressing an R5 strain Env and T7 polymerase in the presence or absence of RANTES (1 μg/ml). After 8 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Plasmids encoding the HIV-1 ADA and JRFL Envs were provided by John Moore (Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center). The NL4–3 luciferase virus backbone (pNL-Luc-E−R−) was provided by Ned Landau (Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York). Luciferase reporter viruses were prepared as described previously by cotransfecting 293T cells with the indicated Env and the NL4–3 luciferase virus backbone (61Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Target cells were prepared by cotransfecting 293T cells with CD4 and a constant amount of coreceptor-encoding plasmid. Incubation was done at 37 °C. Three days post-infection, cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and analyzed for luciferase activity. Soluble JRFL gp120 was iodinated as described elsewhere (56Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Env binding assays were performed by resuspending 2 × 105 transfected 293T cells in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5% BSA. Iodinated JRFL gp120 and 100 nm sCD4 were added to cells, and indubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters presoaked in 0.2% polyethyleneimine (Sigma), and washed twice with 4 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2. Filters were counted in a Wallac 1470 Wizard gamma counter. By using chimeras between CCR5 and the closely related receptor CCR2b, we have previously identified the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CCR5 as the main determinant of ligand specificity. Indeed, CCR5 ECL2, when introduced into a CCR2b background (2252), was able to confer high affinity binding for MIP-1α, as well as functional responses to MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (50Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, the replacement of the amino-terminal domain of CCR5 by the corresponding region of other chemokine receptors, such as CCR1, CCR2b, CXCR2 or CXCR4, did not affect MIP-1β, MIP-1α, or RANTES binding (62Baik S.W. Doms R.W. Doranz B.J. Virology. 1999; 259: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These experiments suggested that the amino-terminal domain of CCR5 was not involved in ligand selectivity as is the amino terminus from other chemokine receptors such as CCR2 and CXCR2 but did not rule out that structural determinants shared by other receptors could play an important role in the high affinity binding of chemokines. To investigate the potential involvement of the CCR5 amino terminus in ligand binding and receptor activation, stably transfected cell lines expressing amino-terminal deletions (CCR5Δ2–5, Δ2–9, Δ2–13, and Δ2–17) were generated (Fig. 1). Cell surface expression of these constructs was tested by quantitative FACS analysis using 2D7, an anti-CCR5 mAb mapping to ECL2 (36Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). All mutant receptors were found to be expressed at high and similar levels (Table I), allowing us to perform binding and functional studies. Quantitative FACS analysis using two other monoclonals, one (45531) directed against another region of ECL2 and the other recognizing a conformational epitope (56Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1998173688,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp; mouse MDR3) was expressed inPichia pastoris, grown in fermentor culture, and purified. The final pure product is of high specific ATPase activity and is soluble at low detergent concentration. 120 g of cells yielded 6 mg of pure Pgp; >4 kg of cells were obtained from a single fermentor run. Properties of the pure protein were similar to those of previous preparations, except there was significant ATPase activity in absence of added lipid. Mutant mouse MDR3 P-glycoproteins were purified by the same procedure after growth of cells in flask culture, with similar yields and purity. This procedure should open up new avenues of structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies of Pgp. Equilibrium nucleotide-binding parameters of wild-type mouse MDR3 Pgp were studied using 2′-(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine tri- and diphosphate. Both analogs were found to bind withK d in the low micromolar range, to a single class of site, with no evidence of cooperativity. ATP displacement of the analogs was seen. Similar binding was seen with K429R/K1072R and D551N/D1196N mutant mouse MDR3 Pgp, showing that these Walker A and B mutations had no significant effect on affinity or stoichiometry of nucleotide binding. These residues, known to be critical for catalysis, are concluded to be involved primarily in stabilization of the catalytic transition state in Pgp. P-glycoprotein (Pgp; mouse MDR3) was expressed inPichia pastoris, grown in fermentor culture, and purified. The final pure product is of high specific ATPase activity and is soluble at low detergent concentration. 120 g of cells yielded 6 mg of pure Pgp; >4 kg of cells were obtained from a single fermentor run. Properties of the pure protein were similar to those of previous preparations, except there was significant ATPase activity in absence of added lipid. Mutant mouse MDR3 P-glycoproteins were purified by the same procedure after growth of cells in flask culture, with similar yields and purity. This procedure should open up new avenues of structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies of Pgp. Equilibrium nucleotide-binding parameters of wild-type mouse MDR3 Pgp were studied using 2′-(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine tri- and diphosphate. Both analogs were found to bind withK d in the low micromolar range, to a single class of site, with no evidence of cooperativity. ATP displacement of the analogs was seen. Similar binding was seen with K429R/K1072R and D551N/D1196N mutant mouse MDR3 Pgp, showing that these Walker A and B mutations had no significant effect on affinity or stoichiometry of nucleotide binding. These residues, known to be critical for catalysis, are concluded to be involved primarily in stabilization of the catalytic transition state in Pgp.

Consisting of two duplicated “halves” and a total length of around 1280 residues, it is a prominent member of the ABC transporter superfamily (6Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar) and shows the typical ABC transporter domain arrangement consisting of two transmembrane domains (TMD) and two nucleotide-binding sites (NBS), in a linear sequence that can be represented as TMD1-NBS1-TMD2-NBS2. Current studies in many laboratories are aimed at understanding Pgp structure, function, normal physiology, and pharmacology. Our laboratory has studied the two nucleotide sites, and we have established that both are catalytic MgATP hydrolysis sites, which interact together closely (7Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J.

Earlier, we proposed (11Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) a catalytic mechanism for Pgp, in which the two NBS hydrolyze MgATP alternately, and hydrolysis is coupled to drug transport from an inner-facing, higher affinity, drug-binding site to an outer-facing, lower affinity site.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with the closely related LmrA protein showed that transport is indeed from the inner lipid leaflet to the outer surface as proposed in Ref. 22Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 747-754PubMed Google Scholar. The mechanism of coupling of energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport of drugs is not well understood, however, at the present time. A preliminary structure of Pgp at low resolution has been published (23Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and, clearly, future structure resolution will be pivotal to more complete understanding of function. Studies of structure and function of proteins depend on availability of pure material. Many of the advances made in the Pgp field so far have come from utilization of the multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell model, originally devised by Ling and colleagues (24Bech-Hansen N.T. Till J.E. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 88: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). By using enriched plasma membranes or purified Pgp (23Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C.

Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) from such cells, an extensive body of literature has been built up, dealing with enzymatic, transport, and structural properties of Pgp and using a range of biochemical and biophysical approaches. The Chinese hamster ovary cell model has two drawbacks, however, which are that it is too expensive to scale up to truly large scale production of pure Pgp, and mutant proteins cannot be purified. Mutagenesis has been successfully employed in studies of Pgp in membrane preparations from insect (Sf9) or cultured mammalian cells and has proved extremely valuable, for example see Refs. 13Szabo K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13660-13673Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. However, there is no method so far for purifying mutant Pgp in significant amounts. Earlier methods (31Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) produced only 10-μg amounts of protein, and more recent methods, although improved (12Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), have not yet provided large quantities (>200 μg). Among promising methods for further scale-up, expression of Pgp in yeast cells appears foremost. At time of writing, Pgp has been purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (32Mao Q. Scarborough G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1327: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Pichia pastoris (12Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 33Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with the latter system shown to be amenable to expression and purification of mutant Pgp (12Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this paper we have scaled up purification of Pgp using growth ofP. pastoris cells in a fermentor and a new purification method. The final material is pure, active in detergent-soluble form, and activated to high specific ATPase activity on addition of minimal amounts of lipid. Wild-type mouse MDR3 Pgp and several mutant mouse MDR3 proteins containing substitutions in the Walker A and Walker B consensus sequences were purified by the same procedure. The purified Pgp is readily amenable to fluorescence analysis. We report the nucleotide-binding properties of wild-type and mutant Pgp using the fluorescent nucleotides TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP, and we demonstrate that mutations in the Walker A and B sequences that fully impair catalysis have little or no effect on equilibrium nucleotide binding. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside with low intrinsic fluorescence was from Anatrace (catalog number D310). Imidazole with low intrinsic fluorescence was from Sigma (catalog number I-0250). Ni2+-NTA agarose resin was from Qiagen. C219 monoclonal antibody was from Signet Laboratories.Escherichia coli lipids were from Avanti (acetone/ether-precipitated, catalog number 100600). Asolectin (crude soybean phospholipid) was from Sigma. TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP (sodium salts) were obtained from Molecular Probes. Antifoaming agent MAZU DF204 (catalog number 558958) was from BASF Corp. All other chemicals were from recognized sources. A strain carrying wild-type mouse MDR3 cDNA incorporated into the chromosome behind the AOX1 promoter was described previously (12Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 33Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Strains carrying the following mutations were described (12Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar): K429R, K1072R, and K429R/K1072R (Walker A single and double mutants); D551N, D1196N, and D551N/D1196N (Walker B single and double mutants). In all cases, the Pgp contained a C-terminal six His-tag to facilitate purification. The P. pastoris cell line GS115 (Invitrogen, license number 145 457) was used and grown according to the supplier's guidelines. Media were as follows: MGY, 1.34% w/v yeast nitrogen base without amino acid (Difco), 1% v/v glycerol, 0.4 mg/liter biotin; MM, same as MGY but with 0.5% v/v methanol replacing glycerol. Conditions for growth of P. pastoris GS115 cells transformed with wild-type or mutant mouse MDR3 Pgp were as described previously (33Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,34Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9073-9082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single colony from an MGY agar plate was inoculated into 10 ml of liquid MGY medium and incubated at 30 °C with shaking to A 600 of 2.0 (∼18 h), then this 10 ml was inoculated into 1 liter of MGY medium in a 2-liter baffled Fernbach flask. Incubation at 30 °C with shaking toA 600 of 2.0 was continued (∼24 h), then the cells were centrifuged in sterile bottles (2500 × gfor 10 min at 23 °C). The cells were resuspended toA 600 of 2.0 in 0.5% v/v methanol-containing MM medium, and 1 liter was added to a 2-liter baffled Fernbach flask covered with cheesecloth. Incubation continued for 72 h with additions of methanol (0.5% v/v) at 24 and 48 h. Cells were finally collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min at 23 °C and resuspended in ice-cold “homogenization buffer” (0.33 m sucrose, 300 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid) at a concentration of 0.5 g wet wt cells/ml buffer. The fermentation was done according to Invitrogen guidelines in a BiofloIV bench-top fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific) equipped with a 20-liter water-jacketed stainless steel vessel and microprocessor control of pH, dissolved oxygen, agitation, temperature, and nutrient-feed and with electronic foam control. The temperature was kept at 29 °C. The vessel containing medium composed of 0.93 g/liter CaSO4, 18.2 g/liter K2SO4, 14.9 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, and 4% v/v glycerol in 10-liter volume was sterilized for 30 min at 122 °C, then 9 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 25 g/liter sodium hexametaphosphate, and 4.25 ml/liter trace salts (Invitrogen, PTM1) were added aseptically. Fermentation proceeded in three phases. To begin the initial “glycerol batch phase,” 1-liter of start-up culture was added. The start-up culture consisted of 1 liter of cells grown in flasks in MGY, as described above. Agitation was maintained at a minimum of 500 rpm and was programmed to increase up to 1000 rpm to maintain a dissolved oxygen above 40% of the initial setting (100%). A pH of 5.0 was maintained using 14% (w/v) ammonium hydroxide. The glycerol batch phase was run until glycerol was completely consumed (24 h), i.e. whenA 600 was stable for 2 h. A yield of 104 g wet wt cells/liter was achieved at this stage. The second phase was the “glycerol-fed phase,” that was initiated by continuously feeding the culture with a medium containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and 12 ml/liter PTM1 trace salts. The feed rate was 18.15 ml/h/liter and was carried out until cell density was 213 g wet wt cells/liter (4–5 h). The feed was stopped for 2 h to ensure total glycerol depletion. The third phase was the “methanol-fed phase.” The methanol feed, containing 12 ml of PTM1 trace salts per liter of methanol, was initiated at the rate of 1 ml/h/liter of initial fermentation volume for 13 h, was increased to 2 ml/h/liter for 24 h, then further to 2.4 ml/h/liter for 24 h, and finally to 3 ml/h/liter for the rest of the methanol-fed phase. This phase lasted in total for 6 days. A sample of cells was taken daily and checked for A 600, cell density (wet wt cells/liter), and Pgp expression. The cells reached a cell density of 425 g/liter on day 6. The fermenter was cooled to 10 °C prior to harvesting. The cells were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with distilled water, and frozen at −70 °C in 15% (v/v) glycerol in water. A rapid procedure was used to obtain a crude membrane fraction from cells grown in the fermentor or flasks, to monitor Pgp expression. Cells from 10 ml of flask culture or 0.5–1 ml of fermentor culture were centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 5 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer (above). The suspension was transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, 2.5 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 mm PMSF, and then 100 μl of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma G-9268, 425–600 μm) were added. The mixture was vortexed vigorously six times for 1 min each, with 2 min on ice between each vortexing. The supernatant was spun at 2000 ×g for 2 min to remove beads, then at 14,000 ×g for 20 min, and then finally the remaining supernatant was spun at 250,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet (“rapid membranes,” 100–200 μg of protein) was dissolved in 2% (w/v) SDS, analyzed by protein assay, SDS-gel electophoresis, and Western blotting with C219 antibody against Pgp. For flask cultures, frozen cells in homogenization buffer were rapidly thawed at 30 °C. For fermentor cultures, cells were thawed, centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min, and then resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer at a concentration of 0.5 g wet wt cells per ml. All further steps were at 4 °C or on ice. Protease inhibitors were added as follows: 2 μg/ml pepstatin A and leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm PMSF. Cells were passed one to three times through a French press set at 20,000 pounds/square inch, adding fresh PMSF (1 mm) every 25 min and adjusting the pH to 7.4 after each pass with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. These steps removed unbroken cells, nuclei, and mitochondrial fractions, which contained little Pgp as shown by Western blotting. The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 90 min, and the pellet containing the microsomes was resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10% v/v glycerol containing 2 μg/ml pepstatin A and leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm PMSF), to the same volume as before the 200,000 × g centrifugation. Resuspension was achieved initially by use of a paintbrush and then by passage through a 22-gauge needle, followed by 10 strokes by hand in a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon pestle homogenizer. The microsomes were recentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min and resuspended as above, this time in “buffer A” consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 30% v/v glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmimidazole, plus protease inhibitors as follows: 2 μg/ml pepstatin A and leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm PMSF. At this stage the microsomes could be stored frozen at −70 °C. Yield of microsomes was 40–50 mg per 10 g wet wt cells. To 1 volume of thawed microsomes (4 mg protein/ml) was added an equal volume of 1.2% w/vn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) in buffer A plus protease inhibitors as above. The suspension was mixed by inversion and allowed to sit on ice for 10 min. It was then centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min. Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) was pre-equilibrated in buffer A and added to the supernatant from the DM solubilization at a ratio of 1 ml of packed resin per 100 mg of solubilized microsomal protein. The slurry was incubated at 4 °C for 16–20 h on a Labquack rotator. The resin with bound Pgp was transferred into a column and washed with 25-bed volumes of buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) DM and then with 5 volumes of buffer A containing 0.1% DM plus 20 mm imidazole. Pgp was eluted with 3 volumes of buffer A containing 0.1% DM plus 200 mm imidazole. The 200 mmimidazole eluate from the Ni2+-NTA column was diluted 4-fold with buffer B (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 30% v/v glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% DM) and applied to a column of Whatman DE52 cellulose, which had been precycled according to the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated in buffer B. The column volume was 2 ml of resin per 100 mg of solubilized microsomal protein. Pgp did not adsorb and was collected in the flow-through. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer B, and the wash fraction was pooled with the flow-through. This material contained pure Pgp. Elution of the DE52 column with 300 mm NaCl in buffer B showed that all the contaminant proteins in the eluate from the Ni2+-NTA column step were adsorbed to the DE52 column. Pgp was concentrated by ultrafiltration under N2 using an Amicon concentrator with a YM10 or XM50 membrane membrane to a final concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. The concentrated material was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Lipid stocks were made from asolectin or E. coli lipids by adding 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, to solid lipid and sonicating in a bath sonicator at 4 °C until the suspension clarified (final concentration was 20 mg of lipid/ml). This stock was stored under N2. For activation, Pgp and lipid were mixed at the appropriate ratio (w/w) in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, with DTT (2 mm), and incubated 20 min at 23 °C, then sonicated in a bath sonicator at 4 °C for 30 s. The protein was stored on ice for the minimum period until assay. Fluorescence measurements were made in a SPEX Fluorolog 2 fluorimeter. For TNP-nucleotide binding experiments, using stirred 2-ml cuvettes at room temperature, excitation wavelength was 408 nm, and emission spectra from 500 to 600 nm were collected. Pgp was activated as above using 2/1 ratio of asolectin/Pgp (w/w) before addition to the cuvette. Final Pgp concentration in the cuvette was 140 nm. Control cuvettes containing every component except Pgp (including lipid and detergent) were used to correct for inner filter and volume effects. The buffer was 50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.5, with 2 mm MgCl2 (“with Mg2+”) or with 0.5 mm EDTA (“without Mg2+”). TNP-nucleotides were added, and the fluorescence spectra were taken when equilibration was reached (≤3 min). Concentrations of stock solutions of TNP-nucleotides were determined by measurement of absorption at 408 nm using an extinction coefficient of 26,400m−1 cm−1 (35Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Titration curves were fit using nonlinear regression to a model assuming a single class of sites, which in all cases gave a satisfactory fit to the data. Further details of individual experiments are given in figure legends. SDS-gel electrophoresis on 8 or 10% gels used the Bio-Rad Minigel system with manufacturer supplied gels. Western blotting followed standard procedures and used the monoclonal anti-Pgp C219 antibody (Signet Laboratories). ATPase assay at 37 °C by continuous linked-enzyme procedure was as in Ref. 7Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar. Protein estimation was by the BCA (36Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) methods. The procedure is described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” A strain of P. pastoris expressing wild-type mouse MDR3 protein (12Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 33Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was grown in the fermentor. After initiation of the methanol feed to induce Pgp expression, small samples were taken at daily intervals for analysis of Pgp. Cells were broken, and a rapid membrane preparation was made as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed. Pgp expression was evident first at 24 h after beginning the methanol feed, and the Pgp level remained constant as a fraction of total membrane protein each 24 h for 6 days (data not shown). However, cell density increased steadily from 234 g/liter at day 1 to 425 g/liter at day 6, thus yielding a total of over 4 kg of cells at harvesting on day 6 after methanol induction. Previously Gros and colleagues (12Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) purified Pgp from the same P. pastoris strain, from cells grown in flask culture, using a procedure involving preparation of purified plasma membranes by sucrose gradient centrifugation, solubilization of Pgp from purified plasma membranes, Ni2+-NTA (His-tag) chromatography, and reconstitution into proteoliposomes. Here we adapted this procedure as follows. First, we avoided purifying plasma membranes, because we were dealing with large amounts of cells, and also we wished to harvest any Pgp resident in intracellular membrane locations. Thus we prepared a microsome fraction and solubilized Pgp from it directly. Second, we changed the solubilization conditions, omitting addition of exogenous lipid. Third, we added a DEAE-cellulose chromatography step, which removed all contaminants in material obtained at the Ni2+-NTA step. Fourth, we omitted reconstitution in proteoliposomes, so that the final product would be detergent-soluble and monodisperse for fluorescence studies. Table I (columns 2 and 3) shows a typical purification of wild-type mouse MDR3 Pgp from a 120-g batch of fermentor-grown cells, which yielded 5.8 mg of final product. The procedure has been repeated many times with excellent reproducibility. Yield of pure Pgp ranged from 1% of microsomal protein (as in Table I) up to 1.5% and was usually close to 0.05 mg of Pgp per g wet wt cells. Fig. 1 shows a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel documenting the purification procedure, with the final pure Pgp shown in lane 7. We have run larger amounts of pure Pgp (up to 10 μg) on the gel and have seen no contaminants. The very minor band just visible at around 60 kDa on the gel is a proteolysis product from Pgp, as demonstrated by Western blotting with C219 antibody and also vanadate trapping with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. At the stage of detergent solubilization, the average distribution of total protein was around 80% in the supernatant and 20% in the pellet. Western blotting showed that the supernatant was enriched in Pgp so that extraction of Pgp was efficient. Recovery of Pgp at the Ni2+-NTA and DE52 chromatography steps is excellent. The band in the 300 mm NaCl eluate from the DE52 column which runs at the same position as Pgp (Fig. 1, lane 8) was shown to be Pgp by Western blotting. Thus a small amount of Pgp adsorbs to the DE52 column, but the bulk clearly did not adsorb under our conditions. The final pure Pgp after concentration to 1–2 mg/ml is in a buffer containing 0.1% DM and behaves as a soluble protein. It is stable to freezing at −70 °C; however, loss of activity was noted on multiple freezing and thawing.Table IPurification of wild-type and mutant mouse mdr3 PgpWild-typeMutant1-aPurification of mutant K429R/K1072R is described.

However, microglial activators that are produced in the brain are not yet defined. In this study, we showed that gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, could be a microglial activator. Gangliosides induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The effect of gangliosides on NO release increased dose-dependently in the range of 10–100 μg/ml; however, the effect decreased at concentrations higher than 200 μg/ml. Specific types of gangliosides showed differential effects on microglial activation. Similar to gangliosides, GT1b induced production of NO and TNF-α and expression of COX-2. However, GM1 and GD1a induced expression of COX-2 but had little effect on NO and TNF-α release. The effect of gangliosides and GT1b on NO release was reduced in the presence of neuraminidase, which removes sialic acid residues from gangliosides and GT1b. Gangliosides activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase significantly but activated c-junN-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 relatively weakly. The inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase by PD98059 reduced NO release from both gangliosides- and GT1b-treated microglia whereas inhibition of p38 by SB203580 increased it rather slightly. Gangliosides activated NF-κB, and N-acetyl cystein, an inhibitor of NF-κB, reduced NO release. These results suggest that gangliosides could be a microglial activator that functions via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB.

Activated microglia induced the expression of the genes encoding iNOS,1 TNF-α, and COX-2, which are responsible for the production of inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α, and prostaglandins, respectively (4Giulian D.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6021-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been clarified by what microglia are activated in diverse pathological conditions of the brain. Although lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon-γ, and beta-amyloid (Aβ) have been known as microglial activators, LPS is a cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, and interferon-γ is produced by T lymphocytes, which are absent in the brain (9Renno T. Lin J.Y. Piccirillo C. Antel J. Owens T. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 49: 1-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Renno T. Krakowski M. Piccirillo C. Lin J.Y. Owens T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 944-953PubMed Google Scholar). Although Aβ is produced in the brain, it is confined to Alzheimer's disease. Because microglial activation accompanies brain damage, a component(s) released from injured cells could be involved in microglial activation. Gangliosides are glycosphingolipid-containing sialic acid residues. Gangliosides exist in mammalian cell membrane and are particularly rich in neuronal cell membrane (11Derry D.M. Wolfe L.S. Science. 1967; 158: 1450-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). GM1, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b are major types of gangliosides found in the brain (12Kotani M. Kawashima I. Ozawa H. Terashima T. Tai T. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Dreyfus H. Guerold B. Freysz L. Hicks D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). They are different in the number and sites of sialic acid residues attaching to the carbohydrates. Gangliosides have been reported to participate in proliferation and differentiation of various types of cells. Gangliosides reduced proliferation of Schwann cells (14Sobue G. Tak T. Yasuda T. Misuma T. Brain Res. 1988; 474: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and induced differentiation of keratinocytes (15Paller A.S. Arnsmeier S.L. Fisher G.J. Yu Q.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Gangliosides regulated the function of several inflammatory cells. Gangliosides increased phagocytic activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and microglia (16Yamaguchi S. Miyazaki Y. Oka S. Yano I. Glycoconj.

In Vivo. 1998; 12: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar), and GM1 enhanced production of interlukin-1β from reactive astrocytes (19Oderfeld-Nowak B. Zaremba M. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MAPK is at least one of the common intracellular signaling molecules involved in microglial activation. LPS and Aβ activated three subtypes of MAPKs, ERK, p38, and JNK/SAPK. Furthermore, the inhibition of ERK and p38 significantly reduced LPS-induced NO release and Aβ-induced TNF-α release (20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Gangliosides have also been reported to activate MAPKs. GM1 activated ERK2 in human glioma cells (21Van Brocklyn J.R. Vandenheede J.R. Fertel R. Yates A.J. Rampersaud A.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and GM3-induced CD4 down-regulation was blocked by inhibition of ERK (22Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Cinques B.

NF-κB could be another common intracellular signaling molecule activated by interferon-γ, Aβ, and LPS (23Bonaiuto C. McDonald P.P. Rossi F. Cassatella M.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The NF-κB-binding sites are found in the promoter regions of iNOS, TNF-α, and COX-2 (24Xie Q.W.

In T lymphocytes and monocytes, gangliosides prevented the activation of NF-κB (30Irani D.N. Lin K.I. Griffin D.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4333-4340PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar), was also reported in human blood T lymphocytes (33Norihisa Y. McVicar D.W. Ghosh P. Houghton A.N. Longo D.L. Creekmore S.P. Blake T. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 485-489PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether gangliosides could activate microglia and whether gangliosides induced microglial activation via activation of MAPKs and NF-κB as did LPS and Aβ (20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,34McDonald D.R. Bamberger M.E. Combs C.K. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4451-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microglia were cultured from the cerebral cortices of 1–3-day old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (4Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortices were triturated into single cells in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) and plated into 75 cm2 T-flasks (0.5 hemisphere/flask) for 2–3 weeks. Microglia were then detached from the flasks by mild shaking and applied to a nylon mesh to remove astrocytes. Cells were plated into 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) or 100-mm dishes (1–5 × 106 cells/dish). After 1 h, unattached cells were removed. Microglia plated into 24-well plates were treated with 1–300 μg/ml gangliosides (mixture), GM1, GD1a, or GT1b (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA) for various time points. The amount of nitrite converted from NO was measured by mixing the culture media (50 μl) with an equal volume of Griess reagent (0.1% naphthylethylene diamine, 1% sulfanylamide, 2.5% H3PO4). The optical densities at 540 nm were measured (35Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of MAPKs and NF-κB in NO release, PD98059 (inhibitor of ERK kinase, Calbiochem), SB203580 (inhibitor of p38, Calbiochem), or N-acetyl cystein (inhibitor of NF-κB, Sigma) was co-treated with gangliosides or GT1b. To test whether sialic acid residues are important for the action of gangliosides, gangliosides and GT1b were preincubated with 550 milliunits/ml neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues at 37 °C for 2 h. Microglia plated into 24-well plates were treated with gangliosides (50 μg/ml), GT1b (20 μg/ml), GM1 (50 μg/ml), or GD1a (50 μg/ml). TNF-α released into 50 μl of culture media was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of iNOS and COX-2 was determined by immunoblot analysis. Microglia (1 × 106 cells) were treated with gangliosides (50 μg/ml), GT1b (10–20 μg/ml), GM1 (50 μg/ml), or GD1a (50 μg/ml) for 12–48 h. The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH7.2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmEDTA, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with iNOS antibodies (1:2000 dilution, UBI, Lake Placid, NY) or COX-2 antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline including 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA). iNOS and COX-2 were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. Microglia (1 × 106 cells) were incubated in serum-free media overnight and then treated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides or 100 ng/ml LPS (fromSalmonella enteritidis, Sigma). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and then applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and activation of MAPKs was examined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of ERK, p38, and JNK (New England Biolabs, UK). Some membranes were stripped with 0.2 N NaOH for 20 min and used for immunoblot analysis using antibodies against ERK (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The intensity of each band was analyzed by NIH image 1.61. The relative intensities of phosphorylated ERK, p38, and JNK were normalized and compared to the intensities of unphosphorylated counterbands. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay was carried out as previously described (36Delude R.L. Fenton M.J. Savedra Jr., R. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Thieringer R. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22253-22260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microglia (5 × 106 cells) were harvested and suspended in 900 μl of a hypotonic solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) including 0.5% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 5 min. Cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet (nuclear fraction) was saved. The nuclear fraction was resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated on ice for 60 min with occasional gentle shaking, and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min. The crude nuclear proteins in the supernatant were collected and stored at −70 °C for electrophoresis mobility shift assay experiments. Two synthetic oligonucleotides (Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) containing the NF-κB binding sequence of the murine immunoglobulin light chain gene (5-GGGAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGG-3) and its complementary sequence were end-labeled using Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled DNA probe (approximately 0.2 ng) was incubated with 0.5 μg of nuclear proteins in a reaction mixture containing 8.5 mm EDTA, 8.5 mm EGTA, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6 mm MgCl2 for 30 min. The reaction mixture was applied to an 8% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and an autoradiogram was obtained. To confirm specific binding of labeled oligonucleotides to the nuclear protein, the excess amount of unlabeled oligonucleotide (5 ng) was added to the reaction mixture, and disappearance of the shifted band was examined. For super-shift assay, the nuclear extract was pre-incubated with 1 μg of anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. The reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The effect of gangliosides on NO release was dose-dependent up to 100 μg/ml: 0.8 ± 2.2 (mean ± S.E. of indicated number of samples in figures), 13.4 ± 3.4, 27.0 ± 2.1, and 29.4 ± 1.0 μm NO were released from cells (5 × 104) treated with 1, 10, 50, and 100 μg/ml gangliosides, respectively, whereas 2.3 ± 0.8 μm was released from untreated cells (Fig.1 A). However, the effect of gangliosides rather decreased at higher concentrations; at 200 and 300 μg/ml, 19.5 ± 0.9 and 16.9 ± 1.9 μm were released (Fig. 1 A). The decrease of NO release was not because of toxicity of gangliosides on these cells, which was confirmed by morphology of cells under a light microscope. iNOS expression was detected within 12 h after gangliosides treatment and was maintained until 48 h (Fig. 1 A, inset). Thus, the effect of gangliosides on NO release was because of the expression of iNOS. NO release from cells treated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides was continuously increased during the experimental period (Fig. 1 B). At 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, 5.5 ± 0.6, 9.9 ± 0.3, 18.1 ± 1.1, and 31.0 ± 0.2 μm NO were detected. In contrast, 1.8 ± 0.9, 3.2 ± 0.3, 3.3 ± 0.8, and 7.7 ± 0.3 μmNO were detected from untreated cells at the same time point. Gangliosides induced TNF-α release. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TNF-α was detected within four h after microglia (5 × 104) were treated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides. At 4, 10, 24, and 48 h, 975 ± 59, 797 ± 24, 432 ± 22, and 404 ± 18 pg/ml TNF-α was detected. However, untreated microglia barely produced TNF-α; 59 ± 5, 105 ± 23, 51 ± 7, and 65 ± 4 pg/ml were detected at the same time point (Fig.2). The decrease in TNF-α at later time points could be because of degradation of TNF-α in the media. Gangliosides also induced the expression of COX-2. The increased expression of COX-2 could represent the production of prostaglandins because COX-2 catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandins (37Dewitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression was detected 12 h after 50 μg/ml gangliosides were treated, and expression slightly decreased but was maintained up to 48 h (Fig. 3). These results showed that gangliosides could induce all three inflammatory mediators tested. Thus, gangliosides could be considered as a microglial activator. Gangliosides are composed of various types of gangliosides. Thus, we tested the effect of three major types of gangliosides in the brain, GM1, GD1a, and GT1b, on microglial activation. Both GM1 and GD1a had little effect on NO release. Microglia treated with 1.5, 15, 75, and 150 μg/ml GM1 released 2.1 ± 0.5, 6.5 ± 1.3, 4.3 ± 0.8, and 4.9 ± 0.9 μm, respectively. The cells treated with 2, 20, and 100 μg/ml GD1a also released only 4.5 ± 1.1, 3.4 ± 1.4, and 0.0 ± 1.1 μm, respectively (Fig.4, A and B). However, cells treated with 2 and 10 μg/ml GT1b released 7.0 ± 0.9 and 23.9 ± 3.0 μm of NO, respectively. GT1b showed a similar dose-dependent effect on NO release as did gangliosides. NO release was maximum at 10 μg/ml GT1b but rather decreased at higher concentrations; at 20, 100, and 200 μg/ml GT1b, 16.5 ± 1.9, 4.0 ± 2.1, and −1.1 ± 0.5 μm NO were detected (Fig. 4 C). GT1b also induced the expression of iNOS (Fig. 4 C, inset). The reduction of NO release at higher concentrations of GT1b was not because of the toxicity. The effect of GM1, GD1a, and GT1b on TNF-α release was similar to that on NO release (Fig. 5 A). TNF-α released from GT1b (20 μg/ml)-treated microglia for 10 h was 497 ± 30 pg/ml whereas that from untreated cells was 233 ± 26 pg/ml. However, TNF-α detected from cells treated with GM1 (50 μg/ml) and GD1a (50 μg/ml) was similar to the control level; thus, 249 ± 28 and 161 ± 31 pg/ml TNF-α were detected, respectively. However, in contrast to NO and TNF-α release, COX-2 expression was induced by GM1 and GD1a as well as GT1b (Fig. 5 B). Microglia treated with GT1b (20 μg/ml), GM1 (50 μg/ml), or GD1a (50 μg/ml) for 12 h expressed COX-2 with similar intensities. Thus, these results suggest that GT1b could be a major type of gangliosides that were responsible for the effect of gangliosides on NO and TNF-α release. However, GM1 and GD1a together with GT1b could be involved in COX-2 expression. We tested whether sialic acid residues of gangliosides and GT1b are important to activate microglia. For this, gangliosides and GT1b were treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues. Compared with untreated gangliosides and GT1b, neuraminidase-treated gangliosides (desialylated gangliosides) and neuraminidase-treated GT1b (desialylated GT1b) produced only 15.6 ± 1.9 and 26.0 ± 3.3% of NO, respectively (Fig.6, A and B). Neuraminidase alone had no effect on NO release (data not shown). These results suggest that sialic acid residues of gangliosides and GT1b are important for inducing micoglial activation. We studied whether gangliosides could activate MAPKs because ERK and p38 mediated LPS- and Aβ-induced microglial activation (20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 34McDonald D.R. Bamberger M.E. Combs C.K. Landreth G.E. J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK/SAPK was detected within 15 min and that of p38 was detected within 30 min after treatment of cells with 50 μg/ml gangliosides. The activities of ERK1/2 and JNK/SAPK were sustained up to 2 h whereas those of p38 decreased to the control level. It is noticeable that ERK was significantly activated, but JNK/SAPK and p38 were relatively weakly activated (Fig. 7). LPS treatment induced activation of three subtypes of MAPKs as previously reported (20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 38Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacological studies using inhibitors of ERK kinase (PD98059) and p38 (SB203580) showed comparable results to the activation pattern of MAPKs. In the presence of 1 and 5 μm PD98059, NO release was reduced to 54.5 ± 8.9 and 45.6 ± 15.5%, respectively. However, in the presence of 10 and 50 μm of SB203580, NO release was 123.1 ± 15.7 and 120.8 ± 16.4% of that in the absence of SB203580 (Fig.8 A). PD98059 and SB203580 also showed a similar effect on NO release from GT1b-treated cells. In the presence of 5 μm PD98059, NO release was reduced to 43.5 ± 2.6%; however, in the presence of 10 and 50 μm SB203580, NO release was 104 ± 4.0 and 130.7 ± 1.5% of that in the absence of any inhibitor (Fig.8 B). These results suggest that ERK could function more importantly than p38 in ganglioside-induced microglial activation, although the function of JNK/SAPK could not be estimated in this study.Figure 8PD98059 but not SB203580 reduced NO release from ganglioside- or GT1b-treated microglia. Microglia were treated with 50 μg/ml gangliosides (A) or 10 μg/ml GT1b (B) for 48 h in the presence or absence of the indicated amounts of PD98059 (PD) or SB203580 (SB).

A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that both Aβ and LPS induced activation of NF-κB in microglia (23Bonaiuto C. McDonald P.P. Rossi F. Cassatella M.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether gangliosides could activate NF-κB. The electrophoresis mobility shift assay showed that gangliosides activated NF-κB within 15 min and that the activity was gradually increased up to 1 h (represented by arrows in Fig.9 A). In the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides the shifted bands disappeared (Fig. 9 A). To investigate which subunits of NF-κB were activated by gangliosides we carried out super-shift assay using antibodies against p50 and p65. In the presence of p65 antibodies, a super-shifted band appeared (represented by an arrow head in Fig. 9 B), and the intensity of the upper shifted band was reduced (represented by the upper arrow in Fig.9 B). However, the intensity of the lower shifted band was barely changed (represented by the lower arrow in Fig.9 B). In contrast, p50 antibodies neither induced any super-shifted band nor reduced the intensity of shifted bands (Fig.9 B). Thus, these results suggested that p65 could be a major subunit of NF-κB activated by gangliosides. We further examined whether the activation of NF-κB was directly related to the induction of NO release. For this, N-acetyl cystein (NAC), a known NF-κB inhibitor (39Fox E.S. Leingang K.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was treated with gangliosides or GT1b. NAC reduced NO release from both ganglioside- and GT1b-treated cells. In the presence of 1, 5, and 10 mm NAC, ganglioside-induced NO release was reduced to 59.6 ± 7.0, 33.4 ± 9.6, and 32.0 ± 3.5%, and GT1b-induced NO release was reduced to 85.0 ± 6.1, 1.7 ± 4.6, and −17.1 ± 5.0% (Fig. 10, A andB). Thus, these results suggest that gangliosides activate microglia via activation of NF-κB. Gangliosides are found in neuronal cell membranes. Thus, gangliosides could be released from damaged neuronal cells to the extracellular space in injured brain. Several studies support this possibility; the amount of gangliosides in cerebrospinal fluid increases in neurodegenerative disease (41Blennow K. Davidsson P. Wallin A. Fredman P. Gottfries C.G. Karlsson I. Mansson J.E. Svennerholm L. Arch. Neurol. 1991; 48: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in HIV-infected brain (42Gisslen M. Hagberg L. Norkransm G. Lekman A. Fredman P. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The results in this study showed that gangliosides induced expression of iNOS and COX-2 and release of TNF-α; all are markers of activated microglia. Furthermore, gangliosides produced these effects via activation of MAPKs and NF-κB. Thus, gangliosides released from damaged brain cells could act as a microglial activator. The specific types of gangliosides showed a differential effect on microglial activation (Figs. 4 and 5). GT1b induced production of NO and TNF-α and expression of COX-2 whereas GM1 and GD1a induced COX-2 expression only. Differential functions of specific types of gangliosides have been reported in several cell types. GM3 but not GM1 inhibited autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (43Zhou Q. Hakomori S. Kitamura K. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GM3 induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells but other gangliosides did not (44Nojiri H. Takaku F. Terui Y. Miura Y. Saito M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These differential functions of specific types could be because of differences in sialic acid residues. In human platelets, GM3 induced intracellular Ca2+ increase whereas neither de-N-acetyl-ganglioside nor asialoganglioside produced this effect (45Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells, blockage of conversion of highly sialylated gangliosides to GM1 changed cellular morphology and inhibited differentiation of these cells (46Kopitz J. Von Reitzenstein C. Muhl C. Cantz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 47Kopitz J. Muhl C. Ehemann V. Lehmann C. Cantz M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The results in this study strongly suggested that the differential functions of specific types of gangliosides could be due to sialic acid residues because neuraminidase significantly inhibited the effect of gangliosides and GT1b on NO release (Fig. 6). Gangliosides showed a bell-shaped effect on microglial activation as dose increased (Figs. 1 and 4). In a previous report, GT1b showed a similar dose-dependent effect on activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II purified from rat brain; the effect of GT1b on calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II was maximum at 25 μm but was reduced at higher concentrations (48Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Soderling T.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this is that at higher concentrations, gangliosides and GT1b might turn on other signaling pathway(s) that inhibit microglial activation. However, further studies should be done to clarify this hypothesis, because the intracellular signaling pathways activated by gangliosides have not been yet fully understood. Gangliosides could produce their cellular functions in several ways. One way is through the specific binding of gangliosides to the surface receptors. Although receptors for each ganglioside have not been clearly elucidated, galectins have been suggested as receptors for GM1 because GM1 bound to galectin-1 and -3 but GM3 did not (49Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The effect of gangliosides on cells could be potentiated by an increase in the number of receptors for ganglioside as well. The expression of receptors for gangliosides could be changed during the modulation of cellular properties. Galectin-1-like protein in macrophages was up-regulated in activation of these cells (50Rabinovich G. Castagna L. Landa C. Riera C.M. Sotomayor C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 51Rabinovich G.A. Iglesias M.M. Modesti N.M. Castagna L.F. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Riera C.M. Sotomayor C.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4831-4840PubMed Google Scholar), and galectin-3 in murine microglia was up-regulated by the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (52Pesheva S. Urschel K. Frei K. Probstmeier R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other way is through the incorporation into the plasma membrane. GM3 was incorporated into the plasma membrane and down-regulated CD4 molecules in T lymphocytes (22Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Cinques B. Giammatteo M. Pontieri G.M. Cifone M.G. Pavan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35153-35160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and into modulated growth factor receptors in glial cells (53Meuillet E. Cremel G. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. Glia. 1996; 17: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GM1 was also incorporated into Jurkat T cells and activated phospholipase C (54Gouy H. Deterre P. Debre P. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3271-3281PubMed Google Scholar). However, gangliosides did not induce microglial activation via expression of other glycosphingolipids. d-threo-PDMP (1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol), a blocker of synthesis of all glycosphingolipids, did not inhibit gangliosides-induced NO, TNF-α, and COX-2 expression (data not shown). The results in this study showed that gangliosides activated MAPKs and NF-κB in microglia (Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10). MAPKs and NF-κB might be common pathways to mediate microglial activation because LPS and Aβ also activated MAPKs and NF-κB in microglia (20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 34McDonald D.R. Bamberger M.E. Combs C.K. Landreth G.E. J.

Joe, unpublished observation. However, some distinctive effects were detected between gangliosides and LPS. 1) JNK/SAPK and p38 were less strongly activated by gangliosides than LPS whereas ERK was strongly activated by both gangliosides and LPS. 2) The inhibition of p38 reduced LPS-induced NO release (20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) but neither gangliosides-, nor GT1b-induced NO release (Fig. 8). 3) In dose-response experiments, gangliosides and GT1b showed a bell-shaped effect on NO release in the range of 1 to 200 μg/ml, and 2 to 20 μg/ml, respectively. However, LPS linearly increased NO release in the range of 1 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml and did not show a bell-shaped effect at even higher concentrations (data not shown). Although ERK and NF-κB could be common pathways involved in microglial activation, they might not be sufficient to induce NO and TNF-α release. GM1 and Aβ activated ERK and NF-κB as strongly as did gangliosides (data not shown). However, GM1 failed to produce NO and TNF-α release (Figs. 4 and 5), and Aβ had little effect on NO release (20Pyo H. Jou I. Choung S. Hong S. Joe E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These results suggested that activation profiles of microglia could be different depending on stimulators and that gangliosides might activate other signaling pathways as well as ERK and NF-κB."

https://openalex.org/W2024522655,"Retention of low density lipoproteins (LDL) by vascular proteoglycans and their subsequent oxidation are important in atherogenesis. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) can bind LDL and proteoglycans, although the effect of different proteoglycans to influence the ability of LPL to act as a bridge in the formation of LDL-proteoglycan complexes is unknown. Using an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, [35S]SO4-labeled versican and biglycan, two extracellular proteoglycans secreted by vascular cells, bound native LDL in a saturable fashion. The addition of bovine milk LPL dose-dependently increased the binding of native LDL to both versican and biglycan, approaching saturation at 30–40 μg/ml LPL for versican and 20 μg/ml LPL for biglycan. LDL was oxidized by several methods, including copper, 2,2-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)-2HCl and hypochlorite. Extensively copper- and hypochlorite-oxidized LDL bound poorly to versican and biglycan. Proteoglycan binding to LDL was correlated inversely with the extent of LDL; however, the addition of LPL to oxidized LDL together with biglycan or versican allowed the oxidized LDL to bind the proteoglycans in an LPL dose-dependent manner. Addition of LPL had a greater relative effect on the binding of extensively oxidized LDL to proteoglycans compared with native LDL. LPL had a slightly greater effect on increasing the binding of native and oxidized LDL to biglycan than versican. Thus, LPL in the artery wall might increase the atherogenicity of oxidized LDL, since it enables its binding to vascular biglycan and versican. Retention of low density lipoproteins (LDL) by vascular proteoglycans and their subsequent oxidation are important in atherogenesis. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) can bind LDL and proteoglycans, although the effect of different proteoglycans to influence the ability of LPL to act as a bridge in the formation of LDL-proteoglycan complexes is unknown.

Uptake of oxidized LDL via scavenger receptor(s) on macrophages can lead to the intracellular accumulation of lipid (1Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin.

The binding and retention of lipoproteins by proteoglycans is believed to be critical in the initiation of atherosclerosis (4Tang-Christensen M. Larsen P.J. Goke R. Fink-Jensen A. Jessop D.S.

Proteoglycans contain long carbohydrate side chains of glycosaminoglycans, which are covalently linked to a core protein by a glycosidic linkage. The interaction of proteoglycans with lipoproteins is thought to be primarily ionic in nature, such that negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups on glycosaminoglycan side chains interact with clusters of positively charged amino acid residues within apolipoproteins (apo) B100 and E on lipoproteins (7Camejo G.

The major proteoglycans present in atherosclerotic arteries are large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, such as versican, and small dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, such as biglycan (10Riessen R.

In human atherosclerotic arteries, versican is found primarily in regions rich in smooth muscle cell, whereas biglycan is particularly abundant in the extracellular matrix immediately adjacent to areas of macrophage infiltration (11O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recently it has been suggested that biglycan plays an especially significant role in the trapping and retention of lipoproteins, since it was found to be the predominant proteoglycan that co-localizes with apolipoproteins B and E in human atherosclerotic lesions (11O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has domains that can bind both lipoproteins and proteoglycans (20Margelin D. Pigier A.M. Gardette J. Bertrand J. Vu-Dac N. Picard J. Int. J.

It has been suggested that LPL may play a role in facilitating lipoprotein-proteoglycan interactions, independent of its enzymatic activity (24Beisiegel U. Weber W. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Proc.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL plays an important bridging role in the binding of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to hepatic heparan sulfate proteoglycans, where it is involved in non-receptor-dependent lipoprotein removal by hepatocytes (26Williams K.J. Fless G.M. Petrie K.A. Snyder M.L. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mulder M. Lombardi P. Jansen H. van Berkel T.J.C. Frants R.R. Havekes L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). On the endothelium, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins bind to LPL that is anchored to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans before the lipoproteins undergo hydrolysis (28Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 187-196Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition to mediating the binding of lipoproteins to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, LPL also may act as a bridge between lipoproteins and extracellular vascular proteoglycans. Several studies have shown that the addition of LPL to endothelial cell extracellular matrices increases the retention of apoB- and E-containing lipoproteins (29Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,30Saxena U. Ferguson E. Auerbach B.J. Bisgaier C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans play a role in this interaction, as evidenced by the observation that the apolipoprotein binding is decreased following the enzymatic removal of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains (31Eisenberg S. Sehayek E. Olivecrona T. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Addition of LPL also has been shown to enhance the binding of arterial wall proteoglycans to native LDL immobilized to microtiter plates (22Edwards I.J. Goldberg I.J. Parks J.S. Xu H. Wagner W.D. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1155-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPL enhances the binding of oxidized LDL to extracellular matrix derived from endothelial cells (32Auerbach B.J. Bisgaier C.L. Wolle J. Saxena U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1329-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although the nature of the matrix molecules to which LPL and the lipoproteins bind is not known. Oxidation of LDL inhibits its ability to interact with purified proteoglycans (33Olin K.L. Chait A. Wight T.N. Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.): I-40Google Scholar, 34Oorni K. Pentikainen O. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21303-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yet oxidized LDL appears to be present in the extracellular matrix of atherosclerotic lesions (35O'Brien K.D. Alpers C.E. Hokanson J.E. Wang S. Chait A. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, LPL may play an important role in allowing oxidized LDL to bind to extracellular vascular proteoglycans. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine whether LPL has specific affinities for the extracellular vascular proteoglycans, versican and biglycan, that are present in atherosclerotic lesions in regions associated with deposited LDL. Furthermore, studies were performed to determine whether different proteoglycans influence the ability of LPL to modulate the formation of native and/or oxidized LDL-proteoglycan complexes. Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated from plasma from a pool of healthy human subjects by preparative ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Vti65 vertical rotor, as described previously (36Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). LDL was oxidized by several different methods that resulted in different degrees of oxidative modification. Transition metal-dependent oxidation was achieved by incubating LDL (0.3 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 5 μm copper sulfate for 4 or 18 h at 37 °C (37Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Oxidative modification by hypochlorite (HOCl) was achieved by incubating 0.4 ml of LDL (1.5 mg/ml) with 5 μl of reagent grade HOCl (diluted 1:4, v/v with distilled water) for 20 min on ice (38Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To prepare LDL with more moderate oxidative changes, LDL (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with the thermally dependent free radical generator 2,2-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)-2HCl (AAPH) (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) for 18 h at 37 °C (39Noguchi N. Gotoh N. Niki E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All oxidative reactions were terminated with the addition of butylated hydroxytoluene (25 μm final concentration). The LDL preparations were dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C against HEPES sample buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) with 25 μm butylated hydroxytoluene, and stored at 4 °C in the dark, in preparation for the gel mobility shift assay, which evaluated lipoprotein-proteoglycan interactions. The extent of LDL oxidation was assessed by measurement of electrophoretic mobility on agarose gels in barbital buffer at pH 8.6 (36Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), the presence of conjugated dienes determined by measuring the absorbance at 234 nm (37Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar), lipid peroxides (40El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) reactivity (41Kawamura M. Heinecke J.W. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which is a measure of free amino groups. Protein concentrations were quantified by the Lowry method (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL was isolated from fresh bovine milk using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, as described previously (43Iverius P.-H. Ostlund-Lindqvist A.-M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining and Western blot analysis with the monoclonal antibody 5D2 (a kind gift from Dr. J. Brunzell, University of Washington, Seattle), which showed one distinct band with a molecular mass of approximately 55 kDa. For some experiments LPL was inactivated by incubating it at 50 °C for 4 h, as described previously (44vanBarlingen H.H.J.J. deJong H. Erkelens D.W. deBruin T.W.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 754-763PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain radiolabeled proteoglycans, subconfluent human aortic smooth muscle cells (a generous gift of Elaine Raines, Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle), grown in modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were metabolically labeled with either 100 μCi/ml Na2[35S]SO4 or 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for 24 h, as described previously (19Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Yanagashita M. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The medium was combined with protease inhibitors (5 mm benzamidine (Eastman Kodak Co.), 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 50 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and purified and concentrated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel in 8 m urea buffer (8 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100 detergent, pH 7.4). Proteoglycans were eluted with 8 m urea buffer containing 3m NaCl, concentrated on 50-kDa Centricon membranes (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and applied to a preparative Sepharose CL-2B molecular sieve column in 8 m urea buffer (46Hascall V.C. Kimura J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 769-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteoglycans eluting at K av <0.3 were pooled for versican, and those eluting at K av 0.44 to 0.60 were pooled for biglycan. Aliquots containing approximately 30,000 dpm 35S were precipitated in 80% ethanol and 1.3% potassium acetate and applied to gradient SDS-PAGE (4–12%). Prior to application to PAGE, some pellets were digested with 2.3 units per ml chondroitin ABC lyase in Tris-buffered solution (45 mmTris, 0.09 mg/ml BSA, 2.7 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors at 37 °C for 3 h (47Saito H.T. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were dried, subjected to autoradiography, and quantitated using NIH Image software. Eluted material in each pool was applied to DEAE-Sephacel, washed extensively with 8 m urea buffer lacking detergent, and eluted with 4 m guanidine buffer (4m guanidine, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 7.4) (45Yanagashita M. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The eluted fractions were concentrated and exchanged into HEPES sample buffer on 50-kDa Centricon membranes, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C for use in the gel shift assay. The glycosaminoglycan content of the [35S]SO4-labeled versican and biglycan was quantitated using dimethylmethylene blue as described previously (48Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar). Calculated molarities were based on the assumption that versican contained 15 chains of 70 kDa each and that biglycan contained 2 chains each of 59 kDa (16Yao L.Y. Moody C. Schonherr E. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. Matrix Biol. 1994; 4: 213-225Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Schonherr E. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, we estimated that 1 μm [35S]SO4-labeled versican was equal to approximately 1050 μg/ml glycosaminoglycan and that 1 μm [35S]SO4-labeled biglycan was approximately 118 μg/ml glycosaminoglycan. Versican and biglycan preparations were digested with chondroitin ABC lyase or heparitinase I and II (Sigma) in Tris-buffered solution (45 mm Tris, 0.09 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors, applied to SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). The transferred proteins then were detected with a series of primary antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Light Chemiluminescent Detection System with CSPDTM substrate; Tropix, Bedford, MA). Antibodies specific for biglycan (LF-51) and decorin (LF-136) (50Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Gehron R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) were a gift from Larry Fisher, Bone Research Branch, NIDR, National Institutes of Health. Antibodies to versican (51LeBaron R.G. Zimmerman D.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10003-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were from Richard LeBaron, Division of Life Science, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX. The interaction of lipoproteins with purified arterial proteoglycans was assessed using a modification of the gel mobility shift assay described by Camejo et al.(52Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Sartipy P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 110: 267-279PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, increasing concentrations of lipoproteins are mixed with a fixed amount (approximately 2000 dpm) of [35S]SO4-labeled versican or biglycan in HEPES sample buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, with or without the inclusion of LPL. The samples then were applied to wells in 0.7% (w/v) NuSieve-agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME), and electrophoresed in a HEPES running buffer that contains no NaCl (10 mm HEPES, 3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) at 60 V for 3 h at 4 °C. [35S]SO4-labeled proteoglycans bound to lipoproteins remained at the origin, whereas free proteoglycans migrated into the gel. The gels were fixed in cetylpyridinium chloride (0.1% w/v, in 70% ethanol) for 1 h, air-dried, and exposed to Hyper-Film MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for autoradiography. The amount of complexed versus free proteoglycan in each lane was quantitated using a scanner (Hewlett-Packard ScanJet II cx) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics); apparentK a values were calculated for each lipoprotein-proteoglycan interaction (SAAM Computer Software Package, Seattle, WA). To visualize the migration of non-radioactive components (LDL and LPL) in the gel mobility shift assay, Western blotting was performed on some agarose gels immediately following the gel shift assay. Proteins in the agarose gel were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. LDL was detected using a monoclonal antibody (MB47; a kind gift from Dr. L. Curtiss, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), and LPL was detected using the 5D2 antibody, followed by incubation with the appropriate IgG-peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. The peroxidase reaction was developed using a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiolabeled proteoglycans that were synthesized and secreted into the culture medium were isolated by DEAE ion exchange chromatography in the presence of protease inhibitors (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and separated according to hydrodynamic size on Sepharose CL-2B columns under dissociative conditions. Washing the DEAE columns with buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl will remove any hyaluronan, the large, non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan produced by arterial smooth muscle cells (54Chait A. Ross R. Albers J.J. Bierman E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4084-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purification of proteins by DEAE affinity chromatography will remove most proteins not modified by the addition of glycosaminoglycan chains (45Yanagashita M. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). DEAE-purified [35S]SO4− and [35S]methionine-labeled preparations were subjected to molecular sieve chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B. Fractions withK av values of 0–0.30 and 0.44–0.60 were pooled (pools 1 and 2, respectively) (Fig.1 A). The pools were subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–12%) before and after chondroitin ABC lyase treatment (Fig. 1 B). Pool 1 remained at the top of the 3.5% stacking gel and was sensitive to chondroitin ABC lyase digestion, generating 3 bands of [35S]methionine-labeled material ranging from 390 to 500 kDa. The most predominant band electrophoresed at ∼420 kDa. This pattern is typical of highly purified preparations of versican from arterial smooth muscle cells (16Yao L.Y. Moody C. Schonherr E.

Quantitation of the versican bands using NIH Image shows that they contain approximately 97% of the total detectable radioactivity in the [35S]methionine-labeled pool 1. Western blot analysis of this pool demonstrated 2 bands at approximately 420–500 kDa with polyclonal anti-versican antibody (Fig. 1 C). This peak was negative when tested by Western blot analysis for the presence of biglycan and decorin using antibodies generated against the core proteins of these proteoglycans (Fig. 1 C). Pool 2 (Fig. 1 A) also was subjected to SDS-PAGE before and after digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase. Before digestion this pool ran as a broad band above the 200-kDa standard marker (Fig.1 B). Proteoglycans from primate arterial smooth muscle cells found in this location on SDS-PAGE have been identified as biglycan (17Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin and biglycan core proteins electrophorese as doublets at ∼50 kDa on SDS-PAGE (17Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N.

Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation by NIH Image indicated that the 50-kDa doublet comprises about 84% of the total [35S]methionine radioactivity detectable in pool 2 after chondroitin ABC lyase digestion (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). Identification of the doublet was aided by Western blot analysis where it was stained by antibodies to biglycan but not by antibodies to versican or decorin. The decorin blot contained a positive control for that antibody (Fig. 1 C), which was the CL-2B fraction that eluted at K av 0.7. Digestion of [35S]SO4-labeled pools 1 and 2 resulted in the disappearance of any radioactive signal on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). To determine if versican and biglycan exhibit different affinities for native LDL, a fixed amount (∼2000 dpm per lane) of [35S]SO4-labeled versican or [35S]SO4-labeled biglycan was mixed with increasing concentrations of LDL and subjected to an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (52Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Sartipy P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 110: 267-279PubMed Google Scholar), in which the interaction is performed under physiological conditions (e.g. salt and divalent cation concentrations, pH, temperature). This assay also allows determination of binding constants (e.g. K a) for the interaction, and thus, estimated concentrations of each of the components, providing information helpful in defining the interaction in molecular terms. Results indicate that both versican and biglycan bound to native LDL with saturable kinetics and exhibited K a values of 2.3 × 10−8 and 1.7 × 10−7m, respectively (Table I). Furthermore, maximum binding to native LDL was achieved with a lower concentration (∼8-fold lower) of [35S]SO4-labeled versican, 0.023 μm (Fig.2 A), compared with [35S]SO4-labeled biglycan, 0.187 μm (Fig. 2 B), indicating that versican has a greater binding capacity than biglycan. By using K avalues generated with the SAAM statistical software, and assuming a molecular mass of 550 kDa for apoB on LDL, we can estimate the stoichiometry of the interaction. Therefore, these data indicate that at half-maximal binding, there are approximately 30–40 mol of native LDL per mol of versican and approximately 4–8 mol of native LDL per mol of biglycan. These estimates are consistent with the idea that several LDL molecules are able to interact with the long glycosaminoglycan side chains on proteoglycans (52Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that versican has a greater binding capacity than biglycan du"
https://openalex.org/W2145125499,"Cryptogein is a 98-amino acid proteinaceous elicitor of tobacco defense reactions. Specific binding of cryptogein to high affinity binding sites on tobacco plasma membranes has been previously reported (K d = 2 nm; number of binding sites: 220 fmol/mg of protein). In this study, biochemical characterization of cryptogein binding sites reveals that they correspond to a plasma membrane glycoprotein(s) with anN-linked carbohydrate moiety, which is involved in cryptogein binding. Radiation inactivation experiments performed on tobacco plasma membrane preparations indicated that cryptogein bound specifically to a plasma membrane component with an apparent functional molecular mass of 193 kDa. Moreover, using the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate and tobacco plasma membranes incubated with 125I-cryptogein, we identified, after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, two125I-cryptogein linked N-glycoproteins of about 162 and 50 kDa. Similar results were obtained using Arabidopsis thaliana and Acer pseudoplatanus plasma membrane preparations, whereas cryptogein did not induce any effects on the corresponding cell suspensions. These results suggest that either cryptogein binds to nonfunctional binding sites, homologues to those present in tobacco plasma membranes, or that a protein involved in signal transduction after cryptogein recognition is absent or inactive in both A. pseudoplatanus and A. thaliana.

Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). Such reactions are induced by elicitors, which either originate from the pathogens or are produced from plant cell walls by fungal hydrolytic enzymes (2Ebel J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Pathogen recognition in cultivar-specific interaction can often be determined by a gene-for-gene relation. Race-specific elicitors, which are encoded directly or indirectly by pathogen avirulence genes, induce resistance in plants carrying the corresponding dominant Rgenes, whose products were assumed to be receptors for avirulence gene products (3Flor H.H. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1971; 9: 275-296Crossref Google Scholar, 4Keen N.T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Many such R genes have been identified (for review, see Ref. 5Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones J.D.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 575-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Most of them encode cytoplasmic proteins that contain a central nucleotide binding site and a C-terminal domain with a variable number of leucine-rich repeats (5Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones J.D.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 575-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region contains either leucine zipper motifs or shows homology with the cytoplasmic domain of the DrosophilaToll and mammalian interleukin-1 receptors (6Jones D.A. Jones J.D.G. Adv. Bot. Res. 1997; 24: 89-167Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeats containing proteins show homologies to proteins regulating apoptosis in mammals and worms (7van der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 226-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the corresponding proteins may be involved in a conserved pathway in the response of eukaryotes to pathogens (8Thomas C.M. Dixon M.S. Parniske M. Golstein C. Jones J.D.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Sci. 1998; 353: 1413-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), including the hypersensitive response. Nevertheless, there is no clear evidence thatR gene products function as receptors for elicitors. For example, the tomato Cf-9 gene, which confers resistance to the race of Cladosporium fulvum carrying the correspondingavr9 gene, encodes an extracellular membrane-anchored glycoprotein consisting predominantly of leucine-rich repeats (9Jones D.A. Thomas C.M. Hammond-Kosack K.E. Balint-Kurti P.J. Jones J.D.G. Science. 1994; 266: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) that did not directly interact with the AVR9 elicitor (10Kooman-Gersmann M. Honée G. Bonnema G. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 929-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among at least 14 identified R genes, only 1 R gene product has been shown to interact with the corresponding Avr elicitor, namely the product of the tomato Pto gene, which confers resistance to the race of Pseudomonas syringae expressingavrPto gene and which encodes a cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase (11Martin G.B. Brommonschenkel S.H. Chunwongse J. Frary A. Ganal M.W. Spivey R. Wu T. Earle E.D. Tanksley S. Science. 1993; 262: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 12Scofield S.R. Tobias C.M.

Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular basis of plant pathogen recognition remains to be elucidated. Besides these plant/pathogen-specific interactions, many elicitors do not induce defense responses in a cultivar- or species-specific manner, although their recognition is likely to be mediated by high affinity receptors. Results have reported the presence of high affinity binding sites for different kinds of elicitors including glucans (14Yoshikawa M. Sugimoto K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1983; 34: 1229-1237Google Scholar, 15Cosio E.G. Frey T. Verduyn R. Van Boom J. Ebel J.

Okinaka Y. Takeuchi Y. Tsurushima T. Buzzell R.I. Sims J.J. Midland S. Slaymaker D. Yoshikawa M. Yamaoka N. Keen N.T. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity binding sites for these elicitors have been identified in membrane-enriched fractions, with the exception of syringolide 1, whose binding sites were found in a soluble protein fraction from soybean leaves (21Ji C. Okinaka Y. Takeuchi Y. Tsurushima T. Buzzell R.I. Sims J.J. Midland S. Slaymaker D. Yoshikawa M. Yamaoka N. Keen N.T. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Information on the biochemical properties of these putative receptors mainly concerns their apparent molecular masses. For instance, the binding site for the Pep-13 elicitor, a peptide derived from a 42-kDa glycoprotein from Phytophthora sojae, corresponds to a 91-kDa nonglycosylated plasma membrane protein identified after cross-linking with 125I-Pep-13 (22Nürnberger T. Nennstiel D. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2338-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A 75-kDa binding protein for the N-acetylchito-oligosaccharide elicitor was identified by photoaffinity labeling and cross-linking in plasma membrane preparations of rice cells (23Ito Y. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Plant J. 1997; 12: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The binding site for a β-glucan elicitor derived from Phytophthora megaspermaforme sp. glycinea was identified as a 70-kDa soybean plasma membrane protein by photolabeling using a 125I-derivatized β-glucan (24Cosio E.G. Frey T. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A β-glucan binding protein was purified from soybean root microsomes, and cDNA cloning indicated that it encodes a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 74 kDa, which has no clear membrane-spanning domain, suggesting that the protein may require other components for localization in the plasma membrane (25Umemoto N. Kakitani M. Iwamatsu A. Yoshikawa M. Yamaoka N. Ishida I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized the cryptogein plant plasma membrane binding sites. Cryptogein, a proteinaceous elicitor of tobacco defense responses, that was isolated from Phytophthora cryptogea, belongs to a family of 10-kDa holoproteins called elicitins (26Ricci P. Panabières F. Bonnet P. Maia N. Ponchet M. Devergne J-C. Marais A. Cardin L. Milat M-L. Blein J-P. Mechanisms of Plant Defense Responses. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1993: 121-135Google Scholar). Elicitins cause hypersensitive response and induce systemic acquired resistance of tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) against fungal and bacterial pathogens (27Bonnet P. Bourdon E. Ponchet M. Blein J-P. Ricci P. Eur. J. Plant. Pathol. 1996; 102: 181-192Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using tobacco cell suspensions, we previously established that cryptogein induces the following early events: protein phosphorylation (28Viard M-P. Martin F. Pugin A. Ricci P. Blein J-P. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv ). 1994; 104: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), large calcium influx (29Tavernier E. Wendehenne D. Blein J-P. Pugin A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv ). 1995; 109: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), chloride and potassium efflux, plasma membrane depolarization, activation of a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase (30Pugin A. Frachisse J-M. Tavernier E. Bligny R. Gout E. Douce R. Guern J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2077-2091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (31Lebrun-Garcia A. Ouaked F. Chiltz A. Pugin A. Plant J. 1998; 15: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar), and defense gene activation (33Suty L. Blein J-P. Ricci P. Pugin A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 644-651Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Petitot A.S. Blein J.P. Pugin A. Suty L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These events are thought to occur after specific binding of cryptogein to high affinity binding sites on tobacco plasma membranes (19Wendehenne D. Binet M-N. Blein J-P. Ricci P. Pugin A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These binding sites conform to criteria defined for receptors: high affinity, saturability, reversibility, and drug displacement and could correspond to the putative receptor of cryptogein. Using three other elicitins, we have shown that they bound to the same site with similar affinities and induced the same events on tobacco cells (20Bourque S. Ponchet M. Binet M-N. Ricci P. Pugin A. Lebrun-Garcia A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the intensity of these events (calcium influx, extracellular medium alkalinization, and active oxygen species production) differed from one elicitin to the other. Results obtained in this present work have defined the biochemical nature of these binding sites, the molecular mass of the potential cryptogein receptor, and the subunit organization. Interestingly, similar binding sites were also detected in other cryptogein-insensitive plant species. Tobacco plants (N. tabacum cv. Xanthi) were grown in a greenhouse for two months. Tobacco cells (N. tabacum cv. Xanthi) were cultivated in Chandler medium (35Chandler M.T. Tandeau de Marsac N. Kouchkovsky Y. Can. J. Bot. 1972; 50: 2265-2270Crossref Google Scholar) on a rotary shaker (150 rpm, 24 °C) under continuous light (photon flux rate 30–40 μmol m−2 s−1) and used during the exponential growth phase. A. pseudoplatanus cells were cultivated as described previously (36Pugin A. Tirilly Y. Barbier-Brygoo H. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 26: 347-356Google Scholar). Cryptogein was purified according to Bonnet et al. (27Bonnet P. Bourdon E. Ponchet M. Blein J-P. Ricci P. Eur. J. Plant. Pathol. 1996; 102: 181-192Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Tobacco plasma membrane-enriched fractions were obtained as described previously (20Bourque S. Ponchet M. Binet M-N. Ricci P. Pugin A. Lebrun-Garcia A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane-enriched fractions from A. pseudoplatanuscells were prepared according to the same protocol with some modifications. The aqueous polymer two-phase system was 6.4% (w/w) dextran (M r 500,000) and 6.4% (w/w) polyethylene glycol (M r 3350) in a 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.3 msucrose and 3 mm KCl. The protein content of plasma membrane preparations was measured according to Lowry et al.(37Lowry H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Iodination of cryptogein was performed as described previously (20Bourque S. Ponchet M. Binet M-N. Ricci P. Pugin A. Lebrun-Garcia A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of cryptogein were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C with 185 MBq of Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, using Iodogen (Pierce) as the catalyst. Radiolabeled cryptogein (125I-cryptogein) was purified by gel filtration on a G-25 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Binding experiments were performed as described previously (20Bourque S. Ponchet M. Binet M-N. Ricci P. Pugin A. Lebrun-Garcia A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane preparations (50 μg protein) were incubated in a 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 0.1m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2 binding buffer (final volume of 100 μl) with 1 to 30 nm125I-cryptogein. Binding was performed for 90 min on ice. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled cryptogein. Bound ligand was separated from free ligand by filtration under a vacuum through GF/B filters (Whatman) presoaked in 1% bovine serum albumin. After 3 washes, each with 5 ml ice-cold binding buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, radioactivity remaining on the filters was measured in a Beckman LS 600 TA scintillation counter. Endogeneous protease activity in plasma membrane preparations that could result in decreased specific binding was not detected in plasma membranes incubated in binding buffer for 16 h at 37 °C. Plasma membrane preparations (5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in binding buffer for 30 min at 37 °C on a rotary shaker (80 rpm) with appropriate protease concentrations: 100 μg/ml trypsin, 25 μg/ml Pronase, or 50 μg/ml XVIIB protease fromStaphylococcus aureus (Sigma). Protease treatments were terminated using an antiprotease mixture consisting of 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, trypsin inhibitor (trypsin/trypsin inhibitor = 1:2, w/w), 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Plasma membrane preparations were then used for125I-cryptogein binding assays. In the binding medium, proteases did not lead to 125I-cryptogein proteolysis during the binding step as verified by SDS-PAGE1 and autoradiography. Control assays contained the same antiprotease mixture and proteases inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 15 min before plasma membrane treatments. Plasma membrane preparations (5 mg protein/ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h in the dark in binding buffer without sucrose but supplemented with 5 mm NaIO4 and then used in binding experiments. In control experiments, the same concentration of NaIO4 was added to plasma membrane preparations 30 s before initiation of125I-cryptogein binding, which lasted 90 min. When treated with glycosidases, plasma membrane preparations were incubated in binding buffer without sucrose for 16 h at 37 °C but with either O-glycosidase (10 units/ml), which hydrolyzes the bond between serine/threonine residues and the carbohydrate chain, or with N-glycosidase F (20 units/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which cleaves the N-glycan linkage between asparagine and the carbohydrate chain. Protease activity was not detected in either the commercial glycosidase preparations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or the plasma membrane preparation when incubated during 16 h at 37 °C in the binding buffer without sucrose. In control assays, plasma membrane preparations were incubated in the same conditions with heat-inactivated glycosidases (100 °C for 15 min). Plasma membranes were then stored on ice before125I-cryptogein binding assays. After125I-cryptogein binding, cross-linking reagents were added to the ligand binding mixture at the appropriate concentrations: 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), 0.5 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), 0.5 mm3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP) (Pierce), or 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma). Cross-linking reactions were performed on ice for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. When the photoactivable cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (SASD) was used, it was first bound to an NH2-containing amino acid of the 125I-cryptogein. Then the derivatized elicitor was used in a binding experiment, and photoactivation was performed for 2 min at 320 nm. Cross-linked plasma membrane proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min at 100,000 ×g), solubilized in a modified Laemmli buffer with or without 50 mm dithiothreitol, and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis in both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Gels were dried and subsequently analyzed by autoradiography. Metaperiodate and N-glycosidase treatments after cross-linking were performed as described.125I-Cryptogein-cross-linked plasma membrane proteins, solubilized in Laemmli buffer (10 μl), were diluted in 10% (w:v) Nonidet P-40 containing 0.25 units/ml N-glycosidase F or 5 mm NaIO4 (final volume, 50 μl) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C or at 4 °C respectively, before analysis by SDS-PAGE. In these conditions, no protease activity in the glycosidase preparation was detected (assayed on pure labeled cryptogein and bovine serum albumin). Decrease in biological activity due to radiation exposure of gamma rays is an exponential function of the absorbed dose and is related to target size or molecular mass. The decrease of 125I-cryptogein-specific binding was compared with the decrease of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity, which was used as an internal standard, and to the decrease of plasma membrane ATPase intrinsic activity as a control. A 5-ml solution containing 1 mg of plasma membrane proteins in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 0.2 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2 buffer with 25 units of G6PDH type XXIII from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Sigma) was distributed in 10 microcentrifuge tubes (0.5 ml/tube). Samples were flushed under nitrogen and arranged in a circle in a Thermos full of dry ice. The Thermos was placed near a 60Co source (30 TBq) and revolved (2 rpm) to ensure isodoses for each sample. Samples were maintained in dry ice throughout the radiation exposure. Every 2 days, one sample was removed and stored at −80 °C. A control sample was stored at −80 °C without radiation. At the end of the experiment, samples were thawed, and 125I-cryptogein binding, G6PDH, and ATPase activities were measured. We have previously shown that radiolabeling of cryptogein (9.25 TBq/mmol−1) or iodination with a large excess of nonradioactive iodine did not reduce cryptogein effects on tobacco cell suspensions (20Bourque S. Ponchet M. Binet M-N. Ricci P. Pugin A. Lebrun-Garcia A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Binding characteristics of125I-cryptogein were previously established on plasma membranes prepared from tobacco leaves (19Wendehenne D. Binet M-N. Blein J-P. Ricci P. Pugin A.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To verify whether the specific cryptogein binding sites corresponded to a protein, tobacco plasma membrane preparations were treated with various proteases: trypsin, Pronase, and protease XVIIB. These treatments reduced 125I-cryptogein-specific binding in tobacco plasma membrane preparations by 90 to 100%, whereas treatments with heat-inactivated proteases were ineffective (TableI). Interestingly, a heat treatment of plasma membranes at 100 °C for 15 min led to only a 15% decrease in cryptogein-specific binding (Table I).Table IEffects of proteolytic cleavages and heat treatment on the specific binding of 125I-cryptogein (10 nm) on tobacco plasma membranesTreatmentControlTrypsin (100 μg·ml−1)Pronase (25 μg·ml−1)Protease XVIIB (50 μg·ml−1)Heat treatment (15 min at 100 °C)Bound125I-cryptogein1009.9 ± 9.50.9 ± 7.310.5 ± 0.786.4 ± 3.5(% control)(94.1 ± 15.3)(88 ± 3.8)(91.1 ± 3.6)Data are expressed as a percentage of 125I-cryptogein-specific binding in control experiments.

To determine whether cryptogein-specific binding involved a carbohydrate moiety, plasma membranes were treated with metaperiodate, which oxidizes glycosides to form aldehydes, or treated withO- and N-glycosidases. Both the oxidation of plasma membrane carbohydrates and N-glycosidase treatments induced a strong decrease in 125I-cryptogein-specific binding (Table II), whereasO-glycosidase treatment did not. Taken together, these results indicated that cryptogein bound to plasma membrane glycoprotein(s) with an N-linked carbohydrate moiety, which played a role in the cryptogein binding site.Table IIEffects of metaperiodate oxidation and glycosidase treatments on the specific binding of 125I-cryptogein (10 nm) on tobacco plasma membranesTreatmentControlNalO4 (5 mm)O-Glycosidase (10 units/ml)N-Glycosidase (20 units/ml)Bound125I-cryptogein10027.4 ± 5.6133.6 ± 13.618.6 ± 4.8(% control)(136.9 ± 24.9)(84.3 ± 8.3)Data are expressed as a percentage of 125I-cryptogein-specific binding in control experiments.

Radiation inactivation is a suitable method for the determination of the functional molecular mass of a membrane protein without prior solubilization and purification (38Jung C.Y. Molecular and Chemical Characterization of Membrane Receptors. Alan R. Liss, New York1984: 193-208Google Scholar). This method was used to establish the functional molecular mass of the cryptogein binding site. Plasma membrane radiation was performed using a60Co source (30 TBq). The decrease of cryptogein-specific binding was measured as a function of the radiation dose in comparison to the decrease of the activity of an exogenous enzyme of known molecular mass, G6PDH (M r = 104 kDa). We verified the reliability of this method by estimating the functional molecular mass of the endogeneous plasma membrane ATPase at the same time. Fig. 1 shows that the activity decay obeys a single exponential function of the absorbed dose. The functional molecular mass of ATPase was estimated to be 196 ± 5 kDa (average of three independent experiments), which is in agreement with published data showing that the enzyme corresponds to a 100-kDa polypeptide (39Michelet B. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv ). 1995; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), which functions as a dimer (40Briskin D.P. Hanson J.B. J. Exp. Bot. 1992; 43: 269-289Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the same experiment the functional molecular mass deduced for the cryptogein binding site was 193 ± 9 kDa. The homobifunctional cross-linking reagent DSS was used to covalently bind125I-cryptogein to its tobacco plasma membrane binding site. 125I-Cryptogein-cross-linked plasma membrane proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and revealed by autoradiography. We detected two bands corresponding to cryptogein-linked proteins with apparent molecular masses of 172 ± 15 and 60 ± 4 kDa (based on the average of 10 independent experiments) (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). In 20% of the experiments, the band corresponding to the 60-kDa cryptogein-linked protein was not detected (data not shown). Labeling of plasma membrane proteins was abolished when binding assays were performed in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled cryptogein (Fig. 2, lanes 2) or when other elicitins (10 μm) were used as competitors in binding experiments (data not shown). Assuming that cryptogein is cross-linked to these polypeptides in a 1:1 ratio, the molecular masses of these polypeptides should be 162 and 50 kDa respectively. With the assumption that both proteins are associated, thus forming a complex, one would expect a band around 222 kDa corresponding to a tripartite complex that includes the 10-kDa-labeled cryptogein. However, the generally low efficienc"
https://openalex.org/W1977048250,"The pointed end capping protein, tropomodulin, increases the critical concentration of barbed end capped actin,i.e. it lowers the apparent affinity of pointed ends for actin monomers. We show here that this is due to the conversion of pointed end ADP·Pi-actin (low critical concentration) to ADP-actin (high critical concentration) when 70–98% of the ends are capped by tropomodulin. We propose that this is due to the low affinity of tropomodulin for pointed ends (K d ∼ 0.3 μm), which allows tropomodulin to rapidly exchange binding sites and transiently block access of actin monomers toall pointed ends. This leaves time for ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release to go to completion between successive monomer additions to the pointed end. When the affinity of tropomodulin for pointed ends was increased about 1000-fold by the presence of tropomyosin (K d < 0.05 nm), capping of 95% of the ends by tropomodulin did not alter the critical concentration. However, the critical concentration did increase when the tropomodulin concentration was raised to the high values effective in the absence of tropomyosin. This may reflect transient tropomodulin binding to tropomyosin-free actin molecules at the pointed ends of the tropomyosin-actin filaments without a high affinity tropomodulin cap,i.e. the ends that determine the value of the actin critical concentration.

Tropomodulin is a ∼40-kDa actin- and tropomyosin-binding protein that caps the pointed ends of actin filaments (1Fowler V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Tropomodulin isoforms are associated with the actin cytoskeleton in a variety of post-mitotic, differentiated cell types in vertebrates, including striated muscle, erythrocytes, lens fiber cells, and neurons (2Fowler V.M. Conley C.A. Kreis T.E. Vale R.D. Guidebook to Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 154-159Google Scholar, 3Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28466-28475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, tropomodulin homologs have also been identified in flies (4Dye C.A. Lee J.K. Atkinson R.C. Brewster R. Han P.L. Bellen H.J. Development. 1998; 125: 1845-1856PubMed Google Scholar) and in worms (2Fowler V.M. Conley C.A. Kreis T.E. Vale R.D. Guidebook to Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 154-159Google Scholar, 3Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28466-28475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) but not in yeast or fungi. In vertebrate striated muscle, tropomodulin is tightly bound to both tropomyosin and actin at the pointed ends of the thin filaments where it is believed to function to maintain thin filament length, sarcomere organization, and contractile function (1Fowler V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Littlefield R. Fowler V.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although tropomodulin function has generally been considered in the context of its tight association with the stable, tropomyosin-actin filaments in striated muscle and erythrocytes, it is an open question as to whether tropomodulin could also regulate the assembly of more dynamic actin filaments in other contexts (6Fowler V.M. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility is suggested by the observation that tropomodulin, in addition to inhibiting elongation, increases the steady state monomer concentration of barbed end-capped actin 2-fold, close to the value for ADP-actin (7Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This is not the result of monomer sequestration by tropomodulin, because tropomodulin binds exclusively to the pointed filament ends and not to actin monomers or alongside actin filaments (7Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, tropomodulin must have increased the pointed end critical concentration (the critical concentration of barbed end-capped actin filaments). The critical concentration of barbed end capped actin filaments represents the monomer concentration at steady state with the actin filament pointed ends and is the same after polymerization of actin monomers to filaments or after partial depolymerization of filaments (F-actin) to monomers (G-actin). The value of the pointed end critical concentration is determined by the affinity of the filament ends for actin monomers and is independent of the number of pointed filament ends or the total amount of F-actin (for a detailed treatment see Ref.9Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins. Academic Press, New York1975Google Scholar). This means that the effect of tropomodulin on the pointed end critical concentration (7Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) must have been due to a decrease in the affinity of pointed ends for actin monomers and not to a decrease in the number of free pointed ends because of capping by tropomodulin. The aim of the present study was to determine how tropomodulin changes the affinity of pointed ends for monomers and increases the pointed end critical concentration. The apparent affinity of filament ends for actin monomers depends on the nucleotide content of the actin molecules at the filament ends. As the result of ATP hydrolysis, newly incorporated ATP-actin molecules very rapidly become ADP·Pi-actin and then change to ADP-actin after the slow release of phosphate (for reviews see Refs. 10Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand 11Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of the filament ends for actin monomers is higher before than after phosphate release, thus the critical concentration is lower for ADP·Pi ends than for ADP ends. Here, we present data indicating that the tropomodulin-induced increase in the critical concentration depends on the conversion of pointed end ADP·Pi-actin to ADP-actin. To influence the critical concentration, this conversion must take place at the free pointed ends because tropomodulin-blocked filament ends are not at steady state with actin monomers. We propose that the relatively low affinity of tropomodulin for pointed ends allows tropomodulin to move rapidly from one pointed end to another and thus to bind transiently toall ends. This would have the effect of slowing down monomer addition at all ends, permitting ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release between monomer additions. Consistent with this mechanism, we find that the critical concentration is not increased by high affinity binding of tropomodulin to tropomyosin-actin filament pointed ends. However, the steady state monomer concentration at the end point of polymerization is increased at high tropomodulin concentrations, the same concentrations that increase the critical concentration in the absence of tropomyosin. We attribute this to transient tropomodulin binding to tropomyosin-free actin molecules at the pointed ends of those tropomyosin-actin filaments that are not blocked by a high affinity tropomodulin cap and therefore are at steady state with G-actin. We explain the reasons why we expect most pointed ends of tropomyosin-actin filaments to terminate with one or more actin molecules that are not bound to tropomyosin. In cells, tropomodulin might increase the critical concentration in regions of the cell where all barbed ends are tightly capped and the extent of tropomodulin-capping of the tropomyosin-free actin molecules at the pointed ends is between 70 and 98%. An increase in the critical concentration would be expected to increase the size of the sequestered actin monomer reservoir because the free actin monomer concentration is in equilibrium with monomers bound to sequestering proteins (12Weber A. Nachmias V.T. Pennise C.R. Pring M. Safer D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6179-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This could play a role in the regulation of actin-based motility and/or the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during cell differentiation. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from rabbit muscle acetone powder as described previously (13Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Pyrenyl labeling of muscle actin was carried out according to Kouyama and Mihashi (14Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously (15Northrop J. Weber A. Mooseker M.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Bishop M.F. Dubyak G.R. Tucker M. Walsh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9274-9281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was stored in liquid nitrogen and defrosted as described previously (13Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ADP-actin was prepared in 50% sucrose by incubating 25 μm ATP-G-actin with 1.0 mm glucose and 0.05 mg/ml hexokinase and 50 μmP1,P5-di(adenosine-5′-pentaphosphate) (myokinase inhibitor) and 2.0 mm ADP overnight. When the stock solution is diluted into the assays (about 10-fold), it is essential to have myokinase inhibitor present, otherwise there is some reconversion to ATP-actin. The ADP-actin had the same critical concentration in the absence and presence of a barbed end capper (gelsolin), indicating complete conversion of ATP-actin to ADP-actin. We prepared and stored ADP-actin in 50% sucrose because, as recently confirmed (16De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5452-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), Oosawa and co-workers (17Kasai M. Nahano E. Oosawa F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 94: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) had shown that even nucleotide-free actin remained polymerizable in sucrose. The ADP-actin is quite stable in 50% sucrose with little loss in activity over several days. Interestingly, in the assays that contain 100 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 without sucrose, ADP-G-actin is stable overnight, although in low salt without sucrose ADP-G-actin deteriorates within hours (18Asakura S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 92: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). (Because of that, the conversion period from calcium-actin to magnesium-actin in low salt was shortened to 2 min for ADP-actin). The critical concentration of our ADP-actin varied between 1.2 and 1.5 μm. Recombinant chicken skeletal muscle tropomodulin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described (19Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gelsolin, a generous gift from J. Bryan, was prepared as described previously (20Bryan J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin was prepared according to Ref. 21Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar and stored as the lyophilized powder. Protein concentrations were determined for actin, gelsolin, tropomyosin, and tropomodulin by light absorption, usingE 290 = 24.9 mm−1cm−1, E 280 = 150 mm−1 cm−1,E 276 = 24 mm−1cm−1, and E 280 = 14.7 mm−1 cm−1, respectively. Gelsolin concentrations were also followed by tryptophane fluorescence (290 nm) calibrated against the specific extinction. Measurements of elongation rates were carried out as described previously (13Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), using pyrenyl-labeled actin (extent of labeling is indicated in the legends) and gelsolin-capped actin filaments as nuclei for polymerization (in the absence of tropomyosin, actin:gelsolin = 10–20:1 and in the presence of tropomyosin, actin:gelsolin = 150:1). Actin polymerization was followed continuously for 5–7 h and measured again the next morning. The fluorescence changes (excitation, 366.5; emission, 407 nm) were standardized against a Raman excitation peak and measured in a photon counting fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Princeton, NJ). All experiments were carried out at 20 °C with Mg2+-actin (converted from Ca2+-actin as described previously (13Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) in a medium containing 10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmazide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (polymerizing medium). Gelsolin-capped actin filaments serving as nuclei for polymerization were obtained by copolymerizing actin (usually 10 μm) with gelsolin in the presence of calcium. Average sizes for filaments are given in the legends as the ratios of actin:gelsolin. Because the accuracy of the rate constants depends on the accuracy of the nuclei concentration we checked the biological activity of our gelsolin preparation in low salt and the presence of calcium, by titrating gelsolin against increasing concentrations of pyrenyl-actin until the fluorescence reached a plateau, when gelsolin-actin dimer formation was complete. This usually occurred at the stoichiometry of two actin molecules per gelsolin, indicating that all of the gelsolin was active. For the preparation of tropomyosin-actin filaments, tropomyosin in excess over that necessary for filament saturation (excess of about 1.0 μm) was mixed with G-actin and, when present, tropomodulin (excess of 0.1–2.5 μm), before copolymerization was started by the addition of salt. In addition, 1.0 μm tropomyosin was added directly to the assay medium during elongation and depolymerization to ensure that actin filaments were always saturated with tropomyosin. The effect of tropomodulin on the critical concentration was measured by calculating the G-actin concentration at the end point of polymerization (see below for calculations). End points of polymerization were measured either at the end of the day or after overnight incubation to ensure completion of polymerization. (The 24-h end points could not always be used: sometimes the pointed ends were not stable and some of the F-actin depolymerized again overnight.) In some experiments, to minimize errors at very low critical concentrations or at the very low polymerization rates associated with a high extent of capping, the critical concentration was measured instead with the nullpoint method. For nullpoint measurements, actin filaments were mixed with G-actin in concentrations near the anticipated critical concentration to ascertain whether the G-actin polymerized ([G-actin] > critical), or the filaments depolymerized ([G-actin] < critical), or there was no change ([G-actin] = critical). For each tropomodulin concentration (and controls) about three to five measurements with different actin concentrations were made. The concentrations of F-actin and G-actin were calculated according to Equation 1, μMF­actin=Fluorescence−a[Total actin]b−aEquation 1 where a, fluorescence of 1 μm G-actin andb, fluorescence of 1 μm F-actin, and [G-actin] = [total actin] − [F-actin]. The extent of capping, 1 − (p free/p total), was calculated from the inhibited elongation rate, (c− c ∞)k +[p free]/(c− c ∞)k +[p total], wherep total is the total concentration of pointed ends (equivalent to the gelsolin concentration),p free is the concentration of uncapped pointed ends, and c − c ∞ is the polymerizable G-actin concentration, i.e., [total actin] − c ∞. In the absence of tropomyosin, we obtained the value fork +[p free], the pseudo first order rate constant (k′+) for the rate of formation of F-actin, from the half-time for reaching the end point of polymerization, k′+ = 0.7/t 12. Assuming that k +remains constant, the ratio of the pseudo first order rate constants is (0.7/t 12 control/0.7/t 12tropomodulin) =p free/p total. At the low elongation rates associated with higher tropomodulin concentrations, when we could not be certain that the end point of elongation was reached on the same day, we calculated F-actin at the end point of polymerization according to ([F-actin] = [total actin] −c ∞), using a value forc ∞ that was determined in separate assays by the null point method. If this is not done (as in our previous experiments (7Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar)), the polymerizable G-actin concentration (c − c ∞) is underestimated leading to a disproportionally high value fork′+ at higher tropomodulin concentrations, compared with the value forp free/p total that can be calculated for these tropomodulin concentrations from theK d value determined at low tropomodulin. This leads to the false conclusion of a leaky cap (7Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the presence of tropomyosin, the extent of capping was calculated by dividing the elongation rate in the presence of tropomodulin by the control rate measured over the identical range of c −c ∞. The K d of tropomodulin for the pointed ends was calculated according to K d= [p free] [tropomodulinfree]/[p-tropomodulin], where tropomodulinfree is the unbound tropomodulin, andp-tropomodulin is the pointed end-bound tropomodulin. There are several caveats as regards our calculations. First, the assumption that the monomer on-rate at the pointed end (k +) is constant during elongation is not quite correct in so far as k + depends on the nucleotide content of the pointed end actin. Because with increasing tropomodulin and decreasing rate of G-actin binding the fraction of pointed end ADP-actin increases and the fraction of ADP·Pi-actin decreases, the ratiok +/k + control is probably a little lower than 1.0 at high tropomodulin concentrations, resulting in a slight overestimation of the extent of capping. Second, there is also an unavoidable small inaccuracy in the normalization ofc − c ∞. This is due to the fact that the value for the critical concentration that applies during net elongation is lower than the critical concentration at the end point of polymerization because the critical concentration also depends on the nucleotide content and decreases with increasing ADP·Pi-actin at the pointed ends. Thus, the ratio (c − c ∞)/(c− c ∞)control that applies during elongation may not be identical to the ratio calculated using the critical concentration values at the end point of polymerization. However, the difference is probably within error of our measurements. We showed previously that 4 μm tropomodulin increases the critical concentration of gelsolin-capped actin about 2-fold (7Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The critical concentration of gelsolin-capped actin is entirely determined by the apparent K d of the pointed ends for actin monomers because gelsolin completely blocks all barbed filament ends from interacting with the free actin monomers (the K d of gelsolin for the barbed filament ends is in the picomolar range). We show now that the critical concentration of the gelsolin-capped actin filaments increases with increasing tropomodulin concentrations until it reaches a plateau at about 1.0–1.2 μm (Fig.1 A), a value close to the critical concentration of ADP-actin. The observation that a plateau is reached is additional confirmation of our previous data (7Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), showing that tropomodulin increases the steady state monomer concentration by increasing the concentration of free, unsequestered actin monomers (i.e. the critical concentration). By contrast, if tropomodulin had increased the steady state monomer pool by monomer sequestration, the monomer concentration would have continued to go up with increasing tropomodulin until all F-actin had been depolymerized. At a calculated value of 97% tropomodulin capping of pointed ends (based on theK d value), we measured a 95–97% inhibition of the elongation rate (Fig. 1 B). This is different from our earlier results when, limited by the amount of tropomodulin available to us, we used lower tropomodulin concentrations and obtained a value of 75–80% for maximal inhibition of the elongation rate by extrapolation to infinite tropomodulin concentration (7Weber A.

We therefore concluded at that time that tropomodulin was a leaky cap, allowing interactions between fully capped pointed ends and free monomers to continue at a residual rate of 20–25% of the control. However, this conclusion was in error because we had underestimated the concentration of polymerizable actin (c −c ∞) at higher tropomodulin concentrations, which led to a positive value for the elongation rate on extrapolation to 100% capping, rather than zero as expected for a blocking capper (for more details see “Calculations” under “Experimental Procedures”). In the more recent experiments shown here, complete blocking of the pointed ends by tropomodulin is strongly suggested by the fact that the observed inhibition of 95–97% of the elongation rate was within 2% of that expected from the calculated extent of capping. A possible explanation for the tropomodulin-induced decrease in the affinity of the pointed ends for actin monomers (the basis for the increase in the critical concentration) would be a change in the bound nucleotide of the pointed end actin molecules from ADP·Pi to ADP (see “Introduction”). Therefore, we investigated the effect of tropomodulin on the critical concentration of actin filaments whose pointed end actin molecules had been converted to ADP-actin prior to the addition of tropomodulin. Tropomodulin did not increase the high critical concentration of ADP-actin (about 1.2 μm) any further (Fig.2 A), although ADP-actin pointed ends were capped to a similar extent as the pointed ends in the presence of ATP (compare Figs. 1 B and 2 B). The elimination of the critical concentration effect was completely reversible; replacing ADP with ATP (by incubation of the ADP-actin with creatine phosphate + creatine phosphokinase) restored the tropomodulin-induced increase in the critical concentration. This is shown by the experiment of Fig. 1 A, which was done with actin that had been reconverted from ADP-actin to ATP-actin. These data support the idea that the tropomodulin-induced increase in the critical concentration is caused by the conversion of the pointed end actin molecules from ADP·Pi-actin to ADP-actin. If the tropomodulin-induced increase in the critical concentration is caused by the conversion of the pointed end actin molecules from ADP·Pi-actin to ADP-actin, then we might expect that inhibition of phosphate release would prevent the tropomodulin effect. Indeed, tropomodulin lost its ability to increase the critical concentration of ATP-actin by the addition of 100 mminorganic phosphate (Table I), which prevents phosphate release after the hydrolysis step (22Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the critical concentration in the presence of 100 mm inorganic phosphate is very low (Fig. 3), we measured the effect of tropomodulin on the critical concentration by a null point method (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pointed end critical concentration was not altered by 10 μmtropomodulin (Table I), which inhibited elongation by 85% under these conditions (data not shown). Note that in the absence of phosphate, this extent of inhibition is sufficiently high for a near maximal increase in the critical concentration (Fig. 1, compare Aand B). This experiment suggests that tropomodulin can no longer exert its effect on the critical concentration when the shift from ADP·Pi-actin to ADP-actin at the pointed ends is blocked. Elimination of the tropomodulin-induced critical concentration increase by inhibiting phosphate release after ATP hydrolysis also indicates that the tropomodulin effect depends on phosphate release (ADP·Pi → ADP) and not on the hydrolytic step itself (ATP → ADP·Pi).Table ITropomodulin does not alter the critical concentration of ATP-G-actin in the presence of 100 mm inorganic phosphate[Tropomodulin][G-actin]0.02 μm0.04 μm0.05 μmμm 0DepolymerizationNo changePolymerization10Not measuredNo changePolymerizationShort, gelsolin-capped actin filaments (actin:gelsolin = 30; 7.5 nm gelsolin) were diluted into different concentrations of G-actin (15% pyrenyl-actin) with or without tropomodulin as indicated and checked over a period of about 2 h for polymerization, depolymerization, or no change (null point method, see “Experimental Procedures”); this indicates whether the G-actin concentration was above, below, or at the critical concentration, respectively. Prolonged periods of observation are necessary because at actin concentrations close to the critical concentration, polymerization often undergoes a few oscillations between polymerization and depolymerization (30Weber A.

The interpretation of these experiments is based on the consensus view that phosphate shifts the equilibrium from the ADP state to the ADP·Pi state by entering the nucleotide pocket of polymerized ADP-actin (10Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is probably true, but it has never been proved. For instance, it has not been shown that at high phosphate levels the critical concentration is the same for both filament ends, as it should be if the bound nucleotide is the same at both filament ends. In Carlier and Pantaloni's experiments (22Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the critical concentration for the barbed ends was still about five times higher than that for the pointed ends at the inorganic phosphate concentrations used (75 mm, pH 7.4). Therefore, we compared the critical concentrations of uncapped actin (close to the barbed end critical concentration) and gelsolin-capped actin (pointed end critical concentration) in 100 mminorganic phosphate (Fig. 3). We found that the two critical concentrations were very close at 100 mm inorganic phosphate (Fig. 3 A) and that the linear extrapolation of the last part of the curves converged to 0.018 μm actin in the presence of about 200 mm inorganic phosphate (Fig.3 B). These data strongly support the assumption that inorganic phosphate enters the nucleotide pocket of actin. The data in Fig. 3 B lead to another conclusion not related to pointed end capping. Because the decrease in the critical concentration of uncapped filaments on the addition of high inorganic phosphate reflects a decrease in the barbed end critical concentration from about 0.1 μm to about 0.018 μm, these data also show that"

The common rapid (NAT2*4) and slow (NAT2*5B) acetylator human NAT2 alleles were also characterized for comparison. The novel recombinant NAT2 allozymes catalyzed bothN- and O-acetyltransferase activities at levels comparable with NAT2 5B and significantly below NAT2 4, suggesting that they confer slow acetylation phenotype. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of slow acetylation in the novel NAT2alleles, we assessed mRNA and protein expression levels and protein stability. No differences were observed in NAT2 mRNA expression among the novel alleles, NAT2*4 andNAT2*5B. However NAT2 5B and NAT2 5D, but not NAT2 6D and NAT2 14G protein expression were significantly lower than NAT2 4. In contrast, NAT2 6D was slightly (3.4-fold) and NAT2 14G was substantially (29-fold) less stable than NAT2 4. These results suggest that the 341T → C (Ile114 → Thr) common to the NAT2*5 cluster is sufficient for reduction in NAT2 protein expression, but that mechanisms for slow acetylator phenotype differ for NAT2 alleles that do not contain 341T → C, such as the NAT2*6 and NAT2*14 clusters.

Initial studies suggested that slow acetylator phenotype was due to decreased or absent hepatic N-acetyltransferase (5Grant D.M. Morike K. Eichelbaum M. Meyer U.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 968-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Further studies reported that the combination 341T → C/481C → T polymorphism and the 590G → A polymorphism in the NAT2coding region confer reduced expression of recombinant human NAT2 protein in COS-1 cells (6Blum M. Demierre A. Grant D.M. Heim M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies showed the 590G → A and 857G → A polymorphisms in the NAT2 coding region were associated with reduced expression of NAT2 protein in human liver (7Deguchi T. J. Biol.

Recombinant expression studies in prokaryotic systems, however, did not show a reduction in NAT2 protein associated with slow acetylator alleles (9Hein D.W. Ferguson R.J. Doll M.A. Rustan T.D.

Thus, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the slow acetylator phenotype(s) remain incompletely understood (reviewed in Ref. 13Meyer U.A. Zanger U.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In the course of molecular epidemiological investigations into the relationship between NAT2 genotype and cancer, we identified three novel NAT2 alleles. The novel NAT2 alleles, together with the most common rapid (NAT2*4) and slow (NAT2*5B) acetylator NAT2 alleles were characterized by recombinant expression in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Our findings suggest that the three novel human NAT2 alleles confer slow acetylator phenotype and that the mechanism for slow acetylator phenotype differs among the NAT2 alleles. NAT2 genotype was determined using a modification of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay (14Doll M.A. Fretland A.J. Deitz A.C. Hein D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This assay was modified in order to distinguish between all known human NAT2 alleles (23 when the study began). NAT2 was amplified by PCR using 250 ng of genomic DNA in a 50-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 0.5 μg of primer 5′-GGCTATAAGAACTCTAGGAAC-3′, 0.7 μg of 5′-AAGGGTTTATTTTGTTCCTTATTCTAAAT-3′, and 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase. The mixture was subjected to a 5-min pretreatment at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and concluded with a 5-min extension step at 72 °C. Nucleotide substitutions 191G → A, 434A → C, and 481C → T were detected by digestion with MspI and KpnI. The 590G → A, 759C → T, and 857G → A nucleotide substitutions were distinguished following digestion with TaqI andBamHI. The 590G → A and 759C → T substitutions were detected by digestions with TaqI. Nucleotide substitution 857G → A was detected by digestion with BamHI. Nucleotide substitutions 282C → T and 845A → C were detected by digestion withFokI and DraIII. The 341T → C and 803A → G nucleotide substitutions were detected following nested PCR. One μl of amplified NAT2 was used as the template in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 220 ng of primer 5′-CACCTTCTCCTGCAGGTGACCG-3′ and 5′-TGTCAAGCAGAAAATGCAAGGC-3′ (note: bold indicates the nucleotide change made in the primer sequence to generate a partialAciI restriction site that is underlined) or 240 ng of primer 5′-TGAGGAAGAGGTTGAAGAAGTGCT-3′ and 290 ng of 5′-AAGGGTTTATTTTGTTCCTTATTCTAAAT-3′, respectively, and 0.5 unit ofTaq DNA polymerase. The mixture was pretreated at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and concluded with a 5-min extension step at 72 °C. Twenty μl of the nested PCR product was digested with AciI and DdeI to detect 341T → C and 803A → G, respectively. HumanNAT2 alleles were amplified with human NAT2specific primers 5′-TGGAATTCCATATGGACATTGAAGCAT-3′ and 5′-AAGGCGCGCCCTAAATAGTAAGGGATCCATCAC-3′, which were engineered with restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate cloning. Following amplification, PCR products were digested withNdeI and AscI, ligated into similarly cut pESP-3 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and transformed in XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). Since Taq DNA polymerase lacks an editing function, representative clones were obtained from at least two independent PCRs. The PCR products were sequenced by a modified double-stranded dideoxy chain termination method (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52497) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The pESP-3 vector containingNAT2 alleles was then transformed into competent yeast (S. pombe) cells, expressed, and lysed according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), except that cytosols were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmleupeptin. DNA was isolated from yeast cells using the QIAmp tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. The DNA (10 μg) was digested withNdeI (10 units) and AscI (10 units) at 37 °C overnight, and run out on a 1% agarose gel. DNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad). Equal loading was verified by ethidium bromide staining of DNA. The membrane was hybridized with humanNAT2 PCR product labeled with [32P]deoxy-CTP (NEN Life Science Products) using the random primer method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Hybridization and wash procedures were conducted using the methods of Church and Gilbert (17Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar). Southern blots were quantitated by densitometry. Total RNA was isolated from yeast cells and extracted via the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. RNA (10 μg/lane) was denatured in formaldehyde, subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad). Equal loading per lane was verified by ethidium bromide staining of rRNA. For evaluation ofNAT2 mRNA, the membrane was hybridized, washed, and quantitated as described above for Southern blot analysis. Yeast cytosols (10 μg of total protein) containing NAT2 protein were mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer containing 5% (final) 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Protein samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to Immuno-Lite membranes (Bio-Rad), and reacted to a human NAT2 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Grant, University of Toronto). Chemiluminescent detection was achieved with an Immuno-Lite kit following manufacturer's instructions. Western blots were quantitated by densitometry. N-Acetyltransferase activities were measured with the human NAT2-selective substrate sulfamethazine (SMZ) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate N-acetyl-SMZ product from SMZ substrate as described previously (18Leff M.A. Epstein P.N. Doll M.A. Fretland A.J. Devanaboyina U.-S. Rustan T.D. Hein D.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 182-187PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (300 μl) containing yeast cytosol, SMZ (300 μm), and acetyl coenzyme A (1 mm) were carried out at 37 °C for 5 min, terminated by the addition of 30 μl of perchloric acid, and neutralized with 22 μl of 1 m NaOH. SMZ and N-acetyl-SMZ were quantitated by their absorbance at 260 nm. N-Hydroxy-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-OH-PhIP) O-acetyltransferase activity was determined by HPLC. Briefly, reactions (125 μl) containingN-OH-PhIP (100 μm; NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository), yeast cytosol (<2.5 mg/ml), and acetyl coenzyme A (2 mm) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated with 7.5 μl of acetic acid (1m). Reaction supernatant was injected onto a Waters μBondapak C18 column (3.9 x 300 mm) with an Alltech Alphabond C18 guard column (7.5 x 4.6 mm). The column was eluted with 30% methanol, 70% 20 mm diethylamine acetate, pH 4.0, for 10 min followed by a linear gradient to 76.6% methanol over 30 min. Product was was quantitated by absorbance at 317 nm. Yeast cytosols (2 mg/ml) expressing recombinant human NAT2 allozymes were incubated at 50 °C for up to 32 min. Following incubation, SMZ N-acetyltransferase activities were measured as described above. Differences observed between recombinant NAT2 alleles were tested for significance by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Three new human NAT2 alleles were identified via PCR-RFLP analysis and sequenced to verify specific nucleotide substitutions. Each novel allele was amplified in two independent PCR reactions, cloned, and sequenced separately. Two of the NAT2alleles contained new combinations of previously identified nucleotide substitutions and were designated NAT2*5D(GenBankTM accession number AF042740) andNAT2*14G (GenBankTM accession number AF055874) according to the consensus rules of NAT nomenclature (19Vatsis K.P.

TheNAT2*5D allele contained the 341T → C substitution alone, while the NAT2*14G allele contained the 191G → A, 282C → T, and the 803A → G substitutions. The third novel NAT2allele identified a 111T → C (silent) nucleotide substitution (Fig.1) that has not been reported. This allele also contained 282C → T and 590G → A nucleotide substitutions and was designated NAT2*6D(GenBankTM accession number AF055875) according to the consensus rules for NAT nomenclature (19Vatsis K.P. Weber W.W. Bell D.A. Dupret J.-M. Price-Evans D.A. Grant D.M. Hein D.W. Lin H.J. Meyer U.A. Relling M.V. Sim E. Suzuki T. Yamazoe Y.

The 111T → C nucleotide substitution created a novel TaqI restriction site that was confirmed by PCR-RFLP. The three human NAT2 alleles, as well as the most commonNAT2*4 (rapid) and NAT2*5B (slow) acetylator alleles, were recombinantly expressed in yeast. Southern blot analysis showed no differences in transformation efficiency (data not shown). The three novel NAT2 allozymes as well as the common slow acetylator NAT2 5B catalyzed SMZ N-acetyltransferase (Fig.2 A) and N-OH-PhIPO-acetyltransferase (Fig. 2 B) activities at levels significantly (p < 0.01) lower than NAT2 4. Thus, the novel NAT2 alleles were designated slow acetylator alleles. Western blot analysis was carried out to assess levels of NAT2 protein expression of the recombinant NAT2 allozymes. As shown in Fig.3, NAT2 5B and NAT2 5D expressed significantly (p < 0.01) lower levels of immunoreactive protein compared with NAT2 4. NAT2 6D and NAT2 14G protein levels were not significantly lower than NAT2 4, even though these allozymes exhibited significantly lower N- andO-acetyltransferase activities (Fig. 2, A andB). Protein expression of NAT2 14G actually was slightly higher than NAT2 4 (Fig. 3). To investigate possible pretranslational mechanisms for altered protein expression, we analyzed mRNA levels expressed for each of theNAT2 alleles. Levels of NAT2 mRNA did not differ between the NAT2 alleles as determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). To investigate if differences in NAT2 protein stability mediate reduced levels of N- and O-acetyltransferase activity, we determined heat inactivation rate constants for each recombinant NAT2 allozyme. NAT2 6D was slightly (3.4-fold) less stable than NAT2 4, whereas NAT2 14G was substantially (29-fold) less stable than NAT2 4 (Fig. 5). Novel human NAT2 alleles were identified and characterized in a yeast expression system. We observed significant reductions in protein expression levels for the NAT2*5B andNAT2*5D alleles. The 341T → C single nucleotide polymorphism present in NAT2*5D was sufficient to decrease NAT2 immunoreactive protein levels. This finding clarifies previous results in human liver (5Grant D.M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary (8Abe M. Deguchi T. Suzuki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) cells. Both the 341T → C and the 481C → T polymorphisms were reported to be necessary to reduce recombinant human NAT2 expression in COS-1 cells (6Blum M. Demierre A. Grant D.M. Heim M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The 341T → C polymorphism changes the amino acid sequence, Ile114 → Thr, while the 481C → T polymorphism does not alter an amino acid. Our data (Fig. 3) clearly demonstrate that the 341T → C polymorphism alone was sufficient to reduce immunoreactive protein levels compared with NAT2 4, a result consistent with previous studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Abe M. Deguchi T. Suzuki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data suggest the 341T → C and not the 481C → T is the important polymorphism that confers slow acetylator status in human populations. This is significant because most NAT2 genotyping procedures are designed to detect 481C → T but not 341T → C. Our findings as well as those of others (6Blum M. Demierre A. Grant D.M. Heim M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 7Deguchi T. J. Biol.

Commun. 1993; 191: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggest post-transcriptional mechanisms as mRNA levels did not vary between rapid and slow acetylator alleles. NAT2 6D and NAT2 14G catalyzed SMZ N-acetyltransferase andN-OH-PhIP O-acetyltransferase activities at levels significantly (p < 0.01) lower than NAT2 4 (Fig. 2, A and B), but immunoreactive protein levels were similar to that of NAT2 4. Thus, mechanisms for slow acetylator phenotypes encoded by alleles not containing the 341T → C polymorphism may include deficiencies in protein stability. NAT2 6D and NAT2 14G allozymes were less stable than NAT2 4, 5B, and 5D. These results are consistent with previous reports in a prokaryotic system (9Hein D.W. Ferguson R.J. Doll M.A. Rustan T.D. Gray K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Ferguson R.J. Doll M.A. Rustan T.D. Gray K. Hein D.W. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1994; 22: 371-375PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, NAT2 possessing the 590G → A polymorphism exhibited lower protein levels in human liver (7Deguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18140-18147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lower levels of recombinant NAT2 expression in COS-1 cells (6Blum M. Demierre A. Grant D.M. Heim M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, NAT2*6D, which contains the 590G → A polymorphism expressed similar recombinant NAT2 protein levels as NAT2*4in our study. A decrease in stability may be the mechanism by which theNAT2*6D confers slow acetylator status in humans. Our data suggests that NAT2*6D may yield a different phenotype thanNAT2*5B and NAT2*5D or NAT2*14G. Greater quantities of protein were expressed for NAT2*6D andNAT2*14G than for NAT2*5B and NAT2*5D, but the NAT2 5B and NAT2 5D proteins were more stable. In conclusion, these data identify and characterize three novel humanNAT2 slow acetylator alleles. One of these alleles (NAT2*6D) contained a 111T → C single nucleotide polymorphism not reported previously. This polymorphism creates a novelTaqI restriction site that is detectable by PCR-RFLP. The 341T → C single base substitution present in NAT2*5D was sufficient to decrease NAT2 immunoreactive protein levels. However, the mechanism for slow acetylator phenotype of the NAT2*6D andNAT2*14G alleles did not involve reduction in protein expression, but rather reductions in protein stability. These results suggest at least two mechanisms for slow acetylator phenotypes in humans, which are of high significance for the interpretation of molecular epidemiological studies investigating associations between acetylator phenotype and environmentally related disease."

Studies of several PDEs have suggested that the isolated catalytic domain alone is sufficient for catalytic activity. However, the importance of dimerization to the catalytic function of the PDE remained in question (31Degerman E. Moos Jr., M. Rascon A. Vasta V. Meacci E. Smith C. Lindgren S. Andersson K.-E.

An amino-terminal truncation mutant of PDE1 was CaM-independent but maintained catalytic properties (K m and V max) that were similar to those of wild type. The sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius of this mutant (subunit Mr ∼50,000) were used in combination to determine that this fragment was dimeric (ΔM5-PDE1A mutant (13Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D.

Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18929-18939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also shown to be dimeric (41Conti M. Iona S. Cuomo M. Swinnen J. Odeh J. Svoboda M.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7979-7987Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, Kovala et al. (42Kovala T. Sanwal B.D. Ball E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported a series of amino- and carboxyl-terminal mutants of PDE4; some constructs were active as monomeric PDEs, while others were dimers; however, these molecular weight estimations were based solely on Stokes radius determinations, which can be misleading. The present report determines physical and kinetic features of the recombinant catalytic domain of the PDE5 and investigates whether dimerization or the regulatory domain is required for catalytic domain function. Since the catalytic domain of PDEs is highly conserved among the different families, much of the new findings for PDE5 is likely to apply to other PDEs. The PDE5 clone was created in this laboratory as described previously (43McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. LeTrong H. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial format for this clone was the pBluescript (SK−) vector. This clone was transferred to a baculovirus expression vector, pBacPAK9. The PDE5 construct in the pBacPak9 vector (described in Ref. 44Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was digested withTth111I, which cuts once in the amino-terminal region of PDE5 after ∼17 codons, leaving a 5′ single base overhang, which was removed by digestion with mung bean nuclease using a short incubation time to prevent overdigestion. Linearized PDE5 pBacPAK9 DNA was cut again using BalI, which cleaved just before the sequence encoding the conserved catalytic region of PDE5, leaving blunt ends and produced 2 DNA fragments of 7697 and 1462 base pairs. The 7697-base pair piece containing the catalytic domain was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and Gelase enzyme, and then religated using T4 DNA ligase. This religated DNA was designed to maintain the frame of the original PDE5 DNA sequence, thus preserving the translated amino acid sequence and joining 17 amino acids from the amino terminus to the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. However, an additional base in the DNA on the 5′ side was removed by the mung bean nuclease which should have caused the entire protein to be out of frame, but only the first 11 amino acids of the entire recombinant catalytic fragment are incorrect. This was established by AA sequence analysis of the final protein product. The correct PDE5 catalytic domain sequence begins at residue 12 (a lysine, which is amino acid 508 numbering from the wild type sequence) and is identical to that of wild type PDE5. The results were consistent with a construct that encoded a protein of the predicted size, that is, one of 368 residues including the 11 heterologous amino acids joined to the carboxyl-terminal 357 residues of PDE5 beginning with the sequence Lys508-Gln-Met-Val-Thr-Leu-Glu514. In PDE5, the conserved sequence of ∼250 amino acids that contains the catalytic domain begins with the sequence Phe578-Gln-Met-Lys-His-Glu-Val584. A recombinant mutant of PDE5 which substituted alanine for each of the 3 amino acids in a leucine zipper consensus sequence heptad repeat was constructed using standard Kunkel mutagenesis of a HindIII fragment from the wild type PDE5 clone. The procedure was as described in McAllister-Lucas et al. (25McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

CTTCATAATGCTCAA GCCTATGAGACTTCACTGCTG and CAGGTG GCGCTTGACCTTGCTAGCTTA GCTTTTGAA (novel bases shown in bold, and codon is underlined), which were used to convert Leu309-Ala (with the GCC codon), Leu323-Ala (with the GCG codon), and Ile330-Ala (with the GCT codon), creating one final protein product with three substitutions. This protein was expressed in the baculovirus expression system as described previously (44Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Methodology for using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system was obtained from Baculovirus Expression Vectors (45O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To create recombinant baculovirus from the PDECat/pBacPAK9 DNA, this plasmid was co-transfected into Sf9 cells alongside BacPAK6 linearized baculoviral DNA (Bsu361I-digested DNA) using liposome-mediated transfection according toCLONTECH. At 6 days post-infection, the baculovirus-containing supernatant from these cells was collected and used to infect small numbers of Sf9 cells. At 4 days post-infection, these latter cells were harvested and tested for PDE catalytic activity as described. Viral stock which produced maximal PDE catalytic activity was then amplified to increase volume and titer. The final viral stock was used in several test harvests to determine the protocols which were optimal for enzyme production of either full-length PDE5s (44Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or catalytic fragment by the particular recombinant baculovirus. Sf9 cells were grown in attached form in tissue culture flasks at 27 °C. Optimum levels of the recombinant catalytic fragment baculovirus infections were 50 μl of high titer virus/3.5 × 106 Sf9 cells, and the PDE5 catalytic fragment was predominantly located in the medium surrounding the infected cells. The optimum post-infection day for harvesting PDE5 catalytic fragment was day 5 or 6, after which expression diminished dramatically. Five large scale preparations of PDE5 catalytic fragment were produced, purified, and utilized in the experiments detailed in this article. At 5–6 days post-infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus, the contents of the 10-layer Cell Faktories (Nunc) containing the infected cell monolayers were pooled and centrifuged at 1600 ×g in a JA-10 Beckman rotor for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet cells and cellular debris. This supernatant (∼5 liters) was used as the starting material. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. Media (estimated to contain 150 mm NaCl) containing catalytic fragment was diluted 5-fold with ice-cold 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors pepstatin and leupeptin (1 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively) and then mixed with 2 liters of settled DEAE-Sephacel pre-equilibrated in 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was incubated for 4 h with occasional stirring. The catalytic fragment did not bind to this resin even at lower ionic strengths (approximately 20 mm potassium phosphate), but this step removed many contaminating proteins. The mixture was filtered using sintered glass funnels and gravity flow, and the flow-through contained the PDE5 catalytic fragment (50% recovery of media PDE activity). This step improved the specific enzyme activity by 5-fold (15 nmol/min/mg). The flow-through was then applied to a 1-liter hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) column (5 × 17 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated in 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Resin volume varied according to the total protein to be loaded and the reported capacity of the hydroxyapatite resin. The HTP resin was then washed with 10 column volumes of 30 mmpotassium phosphate containing 1 mm EDTA and 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The catalytic fragment was eluted with a 3-liter linear gradient (30–350 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA, 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) used at the recommended concentration. Fractions were collected and analyzed with respect to PDE catalytic activity, protein content (by Bradford assay), and protein band pattern on SDS-PAGE in conjunction with Coomassie staining and silver staining. The hydroxyapatite step improved the specific activity about 13-fold (200 nmol/min/mg). This partially purified PDE5 catalytic fragment was used to characterize the enzyme where noted in this paper. Peak fractions of PDE catalytic activity (eluting from this column at ∼200 mm potassium phosphate) were pooled, dialyzedversus 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and applied to a 2-ml carboxymethyl Sephadex (CM-Sephadex) column (Sigma, C-25–120). The PDE catalytic fragment was eluted using a 20-ml linear gradient of sodium phosphate buffer (27–100 mm, at pH 7.0). CM-Sephadex fractions containing PDE activity were pooled and concentrated 3.7-fold using a Centricon-10 concentrator. The Centricon containing the pool was centrifuged at 12 °C in a JA-20 rotor at 2450 × g for 90 min. The concentrated CM-Sephadex pool was applied to a Sephacryl S-100 column (0.9 × 56 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA, 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (as described above). Fractions from this column were assayed for PDE catalytic activity. The PDE5 catalytic fragment was at least 40% pure after this step, based on densitometry (to determine percent of total protein which was PDE5 catalytic fragment) of SDS-PAGE protein band corresponding to the peak of PDE activity from this column. The identity of the protein band was verified by sequential Edman degradation through 20 cycles which yielded the following sequence:X 1AAATAMGPGPKQMVTLEVKS20. PDE catalytic activity was measured by a modified assay described for cGMP-stimulated PDE2 (46Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 40 mm MOPS (pH 7), 0.8 mm EGTA, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 μm cGMP, and [3H]cGMP (80,000–150,000 cpm/assay tube). The assay procedure was as described previously (47Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Stokes radius of the PDE5 catalytic fragment was determined using a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (0.9 × 54 cm) equilibrated in 10 mmpotassium phosphate containing 1 mm EDTA, 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm NaCl. The column was standardized with protein standards of known Stokes radii: cytochromec (16.6 Å), trypsin inhibitor (24 Å), catalytic subunit of purified bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase (27 Å), ovalbumin (30 Å), bovine serum albumin (35 Å), aldolase (48.1 Å), and catalase (50 Å). The thyroglobulin elution volume was taken as the void volume. Elution positions of the protein standards were used to generate a standard curve according to the method of Siegel and Monty (48Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was also performed under conditions that simulate those of the PDE assay to ensure that the oligomeric state of the PDE5 catalytic fragment was not altered under assay conditions. In this case, the enzyme was preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the chromatograpy buffer containing 1 mm cGMP and 5 mm MgCl2 prior to its application to the gel filtration column equilibrated in the same buffer. Assays of these samples, which had cGMP present initially, were handled differently from the usual PDE assays. To locate the peak of activity, the samples from gel filtration were diluted into assay mixtures which had trace amounts of [3H]cGMP and no cold cGMP. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed by the method of Martin and Ames in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, and 5–20% sucrose. Samples were centrifuged for 48 h at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Internal standards included for calculating the sedimentation coefficient were aldolase (7.35 S), cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (3.14 S), and cytochrome c (1.71 S). Migration of PDE was determined by assaying the PDE catalytic activity in the sucrose gradient fractions. Absorbance at 280 nm was used to locate internal protein standards except cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, which was followed by assaying protein kinase activity (49Sugden P.H. Holladay L.A. Reimann E.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Attempts to determine thes 20,w of the PDE5 catalytic fragment in the absence of internal standards were unsuccessful due to loss of catalytic activity. The molecular weight of the PDE5 catalytic fragment was calculated using the experimentally determined Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient of PDE5 catalytic fragment in the Siegel and Monty equation (48Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), Mr=(6πnNas)(1−νρ)Equation 1 where N = Avogadro's number; n = viscosity of medium, assumed to be 1; a = Stokes radius;s = sedimentation coefficient, ρ = density of medium, assumed to be 1, and ν = partial specific volume, assumed to be 0.725 ml/g. The K m values were determined using standard PDE assay conditions, except that the cGMP substrate concentration was varied from 1 to 1000 μmcGMP. The value for the K m of PDE5 catalytic fragment was compared in parallel assays to that of native and wild type recombinant PDE5. The PDE5 catalytic fragment (meanK m = 5.52 ± 0.51 (S.E.) μmcGMP), native PDE5 (K m = 5.6 μm cGMP) (28Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4200-4205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were assayed in the presence of standard assay conditions (as described above). When indicated, PDE inhibitors were added at various concentrations to the standard reaction mixtures containing 20 μm cGMP as substrate.

However, the mechanisms of receptor signaling to PLD in intact cells are only poorly understood and seem to involve distinct signal transduction components, in particular different small GTPases and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (for reviews, see Refs. 1Exton J.H.

Specifically, stimulation of PLD by the G protein-coupled M3 mAChR is dependent on ARF and Rho GTPases and apparently involves a tyrosine kinase and Rho kinase but not PKC. On the other hand, PLD stimulation by phorbol ester-activated PKC, which is phosphorylation-dependent in HEK-293 cells, is apparently ARF-independent and only poorly inhibited by inactivation of Rho proteins (6Rümenapp U.

Moreover, RalA has recently been shown to interact directly with PLD1 and to enhance ARF-stimulated PLD1 activity (15Luo J.-Q. Liu X. Hammond S.M. Colley W.C. Feig L.A. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J.

Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the existence of a Ras/Ral signaling cascade in Ral-mediated PLD stimulation by PKC in HEK-293 cells and to identify receptors stimulating PLD by such a signaling pathway. We report here that the Ral-dependent PLD stimulation by PKC involves Ras and a Ral-GEF. Most important, it is demonstrated that PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells by endogenously expressed RTKs is mediated by PKC and a Ras/Ral signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we provide evidence that a Ras/Ral signaling cascade is involved in stimulation of PLD activity by PKC in HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, and most important, strong evidence is provided that PLD stimulation by RTKs for EGF, PDGF, and insulin, but not by the G protein-coupled M3 mAChR, expressed in these cells, is mediated by a PKC- and Ras/Ral-dependent signaling pathway. The evidence is based on the following major findings. First, similar to inactivation of Ral proteins by C. difficile toxin B-1470, expression of dominant-negative RalA largely and specifically reduced PLD stimulation by phorbol ester-activated PKC and ligand-activated RTKs. Second, expression of dominant-negative Ras resulted in a similar specific inhibition of PLD stimulation. Third, endogenously expressed RalA was activated by PKC and RTKs. Fourth, overexpression of the Ras-activated Ral-GEF, Ral-GDS, specifically potentiated PLD stimulation by PKC and RTKs in intact HEK-293 cells. Fifth, recombinant Ral-GDS potentiated PKC-induced PLD stimulation in membranes of HEK-293 cells in a Ral-dependent manner. Finally, PLD stimulation by each of the three RTK agonists,i.e. EGF, PDGF, and insulin, was fully prevented by PKC inhibition or PKC down-regulation.Previous studies in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the M3mAChR indicated that signaling to PLD is mediated by at least two distinct pathways. Stimulation of PLD by the G protein-coupled M3 mAChR is dependent on ARF and Rho GTPases and involves a tyrosine kinase and Rho kinase, acting apparently upstream and downstream of Rho proteins, respectively, but not PKC (6Rümenapp U.

In contrast, PLD stimulation by phorbol ester-activated PKC, which is phosphorylation-dependent in HEK-293 cells, apparently involves the Ras-related Ral GTPases (11Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Wahn F. Tapp E. Grannass A. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Schmidt M. Voß M. Thiel M. Bauer B. Grannaß A. Tapp E.

As Ral proteins are activated by Ral-specific GEFs, such as Ral-GDS, Rgl, and Rlf, which are under control of Ras proteins (18Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we first wanted to know whether the PKC-induced PLD stimulation is mediated by a Ras/Ral signaling cascade. Expression of either dominant-negative Ras or RalA markedly and specifically reduced PKC-induced PLD stimulation. As dominant-negative G26A RalA, similar to dominant-negative S17N Ras, is constitutively in the GDP-bound form (18Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), its inhibitory effect on PKC-induced PLD stimulation is probably due to sequestration of endogenous Ras-activated Ral-GEFs and, thus, interruption of a Ras/Ral-GEF/Ral signaling pathway. Furthermore, it is shown that overexpression of the ubiquitously expressed Ras-GEF, Ral-GDS, specifically enhanced PKC-induced PLD stimulation. Finally, recombinant Ral-GDS potentiated PKC-induced PLD stimulation in membranes of HEK-293 cells but only in the presence of functional Ral proteins. As Ral-GDS and Ral had no effect on basal PLD activity but required the presence of activated PKC and, on the other hand, efficient PLD stimulation by activated PKC required the presence of Ral (12Schmidt M. Voß M. Thiel M. Bauer B. Grannaß A. Tapp E. Cool R.H. de Gunzburg J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7413-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it has to be concluded that for productive PKC-induced PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells both PKC itself and the Ras/Ral-GEF-activated Ral GTPases are required. In line with a cooperative action of Ral and PKC on PLD activity, Del Pesoet al. (31Del Peso L. Lucas L. Esteve P. Lacal J.C. Biochem J. 1997; 322: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) report that phorbol ester-stimulated PLD activity is highly enhanced in NIH-3T3 cells expressing oncogenic Ras, which by itself had no or only a minor effect on basal PLD activity. As PMA induced activation of endogenous RalA in HEK-293 cells, it can additionally be concluded that PMA activates Ras and, as a consequence, Ral proteins. Recently, various mechanisms of Ras activation by phorbol esters have been reported (32El-Shemerly M.Y.M. Besser D. Nagasawa M. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30599-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J.

Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Which of these activation mechanisms is induced by PMA in HEK-293 cells remains to be determined.The second major aim of this study was to identify receptors mediating PLD stimulation by the PKC- and Ras/Ral-dependent pathway. As the G protein-coupled M3 mAChR obviously did not use this pathway for PLD stimulation, PLD stimulation by RTKs for EGF, PDGF, and insulin endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells was examined. Here we demonstrate that these RTK agonists efficiently increased PLD activity and that this RTK action was completely blocked by PKC inhibition or PKC down-regulation. In line with this finding, which has also been reported for RTK-mediated PLD stimulation in various other cell types (for reviews, see Refs. 1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev.

Frohman M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 17: 182-185Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we observed that the three RTK agonists increased phospholipase C activity in HEK-293 cells and induced rather long-lasting translocation of PKC isoforms, most prominent of which is PKC-α, to membrane compartments (data not shown). Most important, similar to PKC-induced PLD stimulation, stimulation of RTK-mediated PLD activity was blocked by inactivation of Ras-related GTPases with C. difficile toxin B-1470 but not affected by inactivation of Rho GTPases with C. difficiletoxin B. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative RalA specifically reduced RTK-mediated PLD stimulation without affecting MAP kinase activation. A similar reduction in RTK-mediated PLD stimulation was observed in cells expressing dominant-negative Ras. Finally, similar to PMA, RTK agonists activated endogenous RalA in HEK-293 cells, and overexpression of the Ras-activated Ral-GEF, Ral-GDS, largely potentiated RTK-mediated PLD stimulation, reaching PLD activity levels similar to that observed in cells stimulated with PMA. Based on these data, it is proposed that RTK-mediated PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells is induced by two major signaling pathways known to be under control of such receptors (Fig. 8). First, by activation of phospholipase C-γ isoforms and, consequently, increased diacylglycerol production, PKC isoforms are activated by RTKs. Second, by activation of Ras-specific GEFs, such as SOS, via the adaptor protein Grb2, RTKs induce activation of Ras, which then in turn activates Ral-GEFs and, as a consequence, Ral proteins. Because PLD stimulation by the RTK agonists in control cells was clearly less than that induced by PMA but elevated to this level in cells overexpressing Ral-GDS, it may be concluded that activation of Ral proteins by RTKs is less efficient that than induced by PMA and, thus, is the limiting factor for RTK-mediated PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells. It remains to be determined which of the ubiquitously expressed Ral-GEFs, Ral-GDS, Rgl, and Rlf (18Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), specifically mediates RTK-induced activation of Ral proteins and PLD activity.Ras proteins can signal via several distinct effector pathways (18Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 21Voijtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and may also thereby regulate PLD activity. First, active Ras can stimulate production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate by phosphoinositide 3-kinase. This polyphosphoinositide in turn has been shown to bind to and activate ARF-specific GEFs such as GRP-1 and ARNO both in vitro and in intact cells (35Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J.

Accordingly, insulin has been reported to translocate ARNO to the plasma membrane in 3T3 L1 adipocytes in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner (37Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavaré J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin-induced PLD stimulation in rat adipocytes and Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing human insulin receptors has been shown to be mediated by ARF proteins and to involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (38Standaert M.L.

However, treatment of HEK-293 cells with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin did not alter PMA- or RTK agonist-induced PLD stimulation (data not shown), whereas M3 mAChR-mediated PLD stimulation was fully blocked. 2M.

Another Ras effector pathway, possibly involved in Ras-dependent PLD activation, is the activation of PLD-stimulating Rho GTPases. Although the details of the putative Ras/Rac/Rho signaling pathway are not yet resolved, studies performed in Swiss 3T3 and Rat-1 fibroblasts indicated that Ras-induced stress fiber formation and transformation, respectively, is dependent on activation of Rho proteins (41Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar, 42Qiu R.-G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Finally, active Ras stimulates the Raf-dependent MAP kinase pathway. In accordance, Frankel et al. (43Frankel P. Ramos M. Flom J. Bychenok S. Joseph T. Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Feig L.A. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) recently reported that in v-Raf-transformed NIH-3T3 cells PLD activity was increased. The increase in PLD activity induced by this Ras effector was blocked by coexpressing dominant-negative RalA or RhoC. Although it is presently unclear how Ral and Rho proteins are activated by v-Raf, the data suggest the existence of novel regulatory pathways involved in PLD activation. Alternatively, autocrine loops may exist and may be activated by v-Raf or Ras. However, in HEK-293 cells inactivation of Rho GTPases withC. difficile toxin B or blockade of MAP kinase activation by PD98059 did not affect PLD stimulation by PMA or RTK agonists, making it highly unlikely that these Ras effector pathways are involved in PKC- and RTK-induced PLD stimulation in these cells.The M3 mAChR expressed in HEK-293 cells mediates marked phospholipase C stimulation (10Schmidt M.

Nevertheless, PLD stimulation induced by this G protein-coupled receptor was not affected by inhibition or down-regulation of PKC or by expression of dominant-negative Ras and RalA mutants. From these data, it may be concluded that the M3 mAChR and the RTKs activate distinct PKC isoforms and/or distinct PLD enzymes. As PLD1 can interact with both Ral and PKC (15Luo J.-Q. Liu X.

On the other hand, by expressing catalytically inactive variants of PLD1 and PLD2, evidence has recently been provided that the insulin-induced PLD stimulation in Rat-1 fibroblasts, which is mediated by ARF proteins, specifically involves PLD2 (47Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

Furthermore, by overexpressing PLD1 and PLD2 together with the EGF receptor in HEK-293 cells, Slaaby et al. (30Slaaby R. Jensen T. Hansen H.S. Frohman M.A. Seedorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33722-33727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) recently reported that EGF can activate both PLD1 and PLD2 enzymes and that PLD2 associates with the EGF receptor in a ligand-independent manner and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGF receptor activation. Thus, both PLD enzymes can apparently be activated following receptor activation. Which of the PLD isoforms, PLD1 and/or PLD2, is activated by the M3 mAChR and the RTKs in HEK-293 cells is presently under investigation.In summary, our study indicates the existence of a Ras/Ral-GEF/Ral signaling cascade involved in PLD stimulation by PKC in HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, and most important, strong evidence is provided that PLD stimulation by EGF, PDGF, and insulin receptors is mediated by a concerted action of PKC and Ras/Ral-GEF-activated Ral proteins. Phospholipase D (PLD)1catalyzes formation of phosphatidic acid from the major membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), and this reaction is implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, such as vesicular trafficking and cell growth and differentiation. A large variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins in a wide range of cell types has been reported to mediate PLD stimulation in response to their specific agonists. However, the mechanisms of receptor signaling to PLD in intact cells are only poorly understood and seem to involve distinct signal transduction components, in particular different small GTPases and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (for reviews, see Refs. 1Exton J.H.

In HEK-293 cells, stably expressing the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), GTPases of distinct families, such as ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), Rho, and Ral, as well as various protein kinases, such as PKC, Rho kinase, and tyrosine kinases, apparently mediate PLD activation. Specifically, stimulation of PLD by the G protein-coupled M3 mAChR is dependent on ARF and Rho GTPases and apparently involves a tyrosine kinase and Rho kinase but not PKC. On the other hand, PLD stimulation by phorbol ester-activated PKC, which is phosphorylation-dependent in HEK-293 cells, is apparently ARF-independent and only poorly inhibited by inactivation of Rho proteins (6Rümenapp U.

Upon TCR stimulation, ZAP70 is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the cytoplasmic domains of TCR subunits; this is an essential step for ZAP70 activation and subsequent cellular signaling pathways (6Chan A.C.

All of the mutations in the ZAP70 molecule that have been reported to cause SCID in humans cluster around the kinase subdomain VIII, resulting in instability of the ZAP70 protein (3Monafo W.J.

Molecular chaperones assist in the proper folding of misfolded polypeptide and render it functional, whereas proteases eliminate such a polypeptide (14Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the counterbalance between chaperones and proteases determines the stability of mutant ZAP70 molecules. With respect to proteases, it is widely accepted that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in degradation of abnormal proteins (15Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of proteasomes to the instability of mutant ZAP70 proteins is yet to be determined. We show here that two novel mis-sense mutations in the zap70genes of a CD8-deficiency patient cause degradation of ZAP70 proteinin vivo in a temperature-sensitive (ts) manner through an ATP-dependent and proteasome-independent pathway. We also show that overexpression of Cdc37 (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.B. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S.

The HTLV-1-transformed T cell lines SN, established from a CD8 deficiency patient, and KO, derived from a healthy donor, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics, 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Hepes, 10% fetal calf serum, and IL-2 (10 units/ml). A cDNA library was constructed from mRNA of SN cells using λ-ZAP II (Stratagene) and screened with a probe comprising the KpnI/HpaI fragment of the human zap70 cDNA. DNA sequencing was performed with dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction on a PRISM 310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents prior to the experiments. Jurkat cells, a human T cell line, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with the supplements described above except for IL-2. Jurkat cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in P-buffer solution (20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was mixed with equal volume of P-buffer solution containing 2 mm ATP and 40% glycerol to obtain total lysate. Total lysate was further centrifuged at 500,000 × g for 5 h to obtain S500 (supernatant) and P500 (pellet) fractions. Immunoblotting was performed as described (19Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S.

A cDNA clone for wild-type ZAP70 tagged with the Myc-epitope (EQKLISEEDL) at its C terminus was obtained from Jurkat cells using reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). P80Q and M572L mutants were created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Quick ChangeTM, Stratagene). Dominant-negative ZAP70 (ZAP70ΔC) molecules were constructed by subcloning the SH2 domains (HindIII andHincII fragment) into the HindIII andEcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) (Invitrogen).

Transient transfection of Jurkat cells (5 × 106) was performed using SuperFectTM (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated ZAP70 was generatedin vitro using the TNT T7 rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of Transcend tRNA (Promega). GST-Cdc37 and biotinylated ZAP70 were incubated in 100 μl of P-buffer solution containing 5 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation with 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h.

After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, bound ZAP70 proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed on an BAS2000 (Fujix) image analyzer. An HTLV-1-transformed T cell line, SN, established from a CD8 deficiency patient (22Katamura K. Tai G. Tachibana T. Yamabe H. Ohmori K. Mayumi M. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Furusho K. Clin. Exp.

Molecular cloning and sequencing of zap70cDNAs from SN cells uncovered two mutations (Fig. 1 B): a C to A transition at position 448, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for proline at residue 80 (P80Q) in the N-terminal SH2 domain (numbering according to Ref. 6Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), and an A to T transition at position 1923, causing the substitution of leucine for methionine at residue 572 (M572L) in the kinase subdomain XI (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). This methionine residue is well conserved among PTKs. Genomic DNA analysis showed that the patient was heterozygous for these mutations; the C to A mutation was paternal, and the A to T mutation was maternal (Fig. 1 C). A healthy sibling of the patient carries the paternal mutation. Protein expression was not detectable in a human T cell line Jurkat transfected with Myc-tagged mutant cDNAs, whereas transfection of the wild-type (WT) cDNA resulted in expression of a Myc-tagged ZAP70 protein of the expected size (Fig. 2 A). However, these mutant ZAP70 proteins were produced at a level comparable to the WT protein in an in vitro reticulocyte translation system (see Figs. 2 C and 3 C), suggesting that the mutant proteins are unstable and degraded in vivo. In fact, pulse-chase experiments showed that whereas WT ZAP70 protein was stable with a half-life of >4 h, P80Q as well as M572L mutant proteins were rapidly degraded with a half-life of approximately 1 h (Fig. 2 B).Figure 3Functions of ZAP70 tsmutants.

An aliquot of the immunoprecipitate was also probed with a mAb against phosphotyrosine (4G10) (lower). C, WT, M572L (ML), and P80Q (PQ) mutants were in vitro translated at 30 °C in the presence of [35S]methionine (upper panel). Samples were incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) bound to the phosphorylated and biotinylated ITAM peptide (peptide +) or vehicle alone (peptide −) for 1 h at the indicated temperature and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and image analysis (lower panel). D, Jurkat cells were transfected with either ZAP70ΔC (WT) or ZAP70ΔC containing P80Q mutation (PQ) along with NFAT-Luc. To normalize the transfection efficiency, pRL-SV40 plasmid was also transfected. After 16 h, the cells were split into two cultures and incubated for an additional 24 h at the indicated temperature. The cells were then stimulated via the TCR using an anti-CD3 IgM mAb for 7 h at 30 or 37 °C and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luc assay system (Promega). The results are shown as the fold increase over the unstimulated cells and are presented as the means ± S.E. of three independent assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Specific inhibitors for proteasomes such as lactacystin and the peptide aldehyde MG132 failed to block the proteolysis of ZAP70 mutants, whereas these inhibitors blocked degradation of β-catenin, a known target of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. 2 C). When incubated with total cell lysates in an in vitro degradation assay system, both M572L and P80Q mutant proteins prepared by an in vitrotranslation system were degraded in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas WT ZAP70 protein remained stable (Fig. 2 D). The proteolytic activity was recovered from the S500 fraction (Fig.2 E, upper panel), which was devoid of proteasomes (Fig.2 E, lower panel). Other protease inhibitors, including E64 (10 μm), TPCK (100 μm), TLCK (100 μm), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (20 μg/ml), had no effect on the degradation of ZAP70 mutants (data not shown). Although tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) activity is ATP-dependent and is enhanced by lactacystin (24Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), AAF-chloromethylketone, a specific inhibitor for TPPII, failed to block degradation (data not shown). These results, collectively, indicate that the ZAP70 mutants are degraded by a novel ATP-dependent and proteasome-independent pathway that remains to be identified. Because thein vitro translation reaction was performed at 30 °C, it was possible that the mutant proteins are stable at low temperatures. Indeed, both mutants turned out to be ts. Both P80Q and M572L mutant proteins were readily detected in transfected cells at a temperature lower than 33 °C (Fig.3 A). Jurkat cells transfected with WT or mutant zap70 cDNAs were cultured at 30 °C, stimulated with pervanadate, a potent activator of intracellular PTKs, and assayed for ZAP70 kinase activities in vitro using tubulin as a substrate (25Isakov N. Wange R.L. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15753-15761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The WT and P80Q mutant ZAP70 were similarly activated by pervanadate as indicated by autophosphorylation of ZAP70 and phosphorylation of tubulin (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, the activity of the M572L mutant was partially impaired. Although pervanadate induced the same level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the WT and M572L mutant proteins in vivo (Fig. 3 B, lower panel), the level of kinase activity determined by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of tubulin was approximately 50% that of WT ZAP70 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). These results demonstrate the importance of the conserved methionine residue at the kinase subdomain XI for PTK activity as well as the stability of the ZAP70 protein. We next examined the SH2 function of the mutant ZAP70 proteins. The35S-labeled P80Q mutant ZAP70 protein produced in vitro at 30 °C bound to the phosphorylated ITAM peptide with an affinity comparable to the WT and M572L mutant in an in vitro pull-down assay (Fig. 3 C). Note that the P80Q mutant synthesized in vitro bound to the phosphorylated ITAM peptide even at 37 °C, the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that the protein is stable at 37 °C once synthesized and properly folded. To examine whether the SH2 domains of the P80Q mutant bind to ITAMs in vivo, we constructed a dominant-negative form of ZAP70 (ZAP70ΔC), consisting of two SH2 domains, that sequesters endogenous ZAP70 from phosphorylated ITAMs (26Qian D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When expressed at 30 °C, the ZAP70ΔC containing the P80Q mutation blocked the TCR-induced signaling pathway as well as the ZAP70ΔC consisting of the WT SH2 domains (Fig. 3 D). However, such a blocking effect by the P80Q mutant was not observed at 37 °C. Thus, the defect resulting from the P80Q mutation is likely due to the rapid degradation of mutant polypeptide and not to a lack of SH2 function. It has been suggested that mutant proteins, which are incompletely or improperly folded when synthesized, are degraded unless folding intermediates are compromised by their cofactor(s), namely chaperone(s) (27Morimoto R.I. Kline M.P. Bimston D.N. Cotto J.J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 17-29PubMed Google Scholar, 28Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). One such chaperone is Cdc37, which stabilizes various PTKs by interacting with their kinase domains (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.B. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Indeed, co-transfection with Cdc37 increased the expression level of the WT ZAP70 protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). In contrast, only a slight effect was observed when the ZAP70ΔC lacking the kinase domain was co-expressed with Cdc37, indicating that Cdc37 functions as a kinase domain-specific chaperone for ZAP70. Expression levels of the M572L mutant at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures were also remarkably augmented by co-transfection with Cdc37 (Fig.4 B). Although not shown, co-expression of Cdc37 did not affect the half-life of the M572L mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that Cdc37 restored the expression of M572L mutant protein by assisting its folding process and not by blocking degradation pathway(s). In contrast, Cdc37 had a marginal effect on the P80Q mutant. It is possible that the P80Q mutation leads to conformational changes, preventing interaction between the kinase domain of the ZAP70 and Cdc37. In fact, whereas both WT ZAP70 and the M572L proteins bound GST-Cdc37, interaction of the P80Q mutant with GST-Cdc37 was marginal and observed only with an excess amount of GST-Cdc37 (Fig. 4 C). Such differences in ability to bind Cdc37 would account for the preferential effect of Cdc37 on the M572L mutant. Several studies have revealed that Cdc37 acts in concert with another chaperone, HSP90 (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.B. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HSP90 function with geldanamycin reduced the expression of both the WT and the M572L mutant even in the presence of Cdc37 (Fig. 4 D). These results clearly indicate that HSP90 is required for the expression of ZAP70 protein. HSP90 is a highly abundant protein (28Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar), but yet the expression of the M572L mutant depends on Cdc37. Therefore Cdc37 is likely the rate-limiting component and contributes to the proper folding of the M572L mutant with the aid of the HSP90 function. With the exception of the ts-type I oculocutaneous albinism (29Giebel L.B. Tripathi R.K. King R.A. Spritz R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1119-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), spontaneous ts mutations have rarely been reported in the human. We provide evidence here that ts mutations of thezap70 gene are involved in human SCIDs. The fact that these mutants have kinase activities at 30 °C, the permissive temperature, raises the possibility that the T cell defects could be rescued at a lower temperature. In fact, although the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells failed to respond to stimulation via the TCR at 37 °C, CD4+ T cells with activated and/or memory phenotypes were found to accumulate in his dermis (22Katamura K. Tai G. Tachibana T. Yamabe H. Ohmori K. Mayumi M. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Furusho K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 115: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is known that Syk PTK complements the function of ZAP70 in the thymus, where the expression level of Syk is much higher than in the periphery. It is thus possible that in this patient autoreactive T cells that would have been negatively selected under normal conditions were actually positively selected. Because Syk expression is greatly reduced upon migration to the periphery, peripheral CD4+ T cells in the patient would have become unresponsive to antigenic stimulation. Because local body temperature within the skin is lower, functional ZAP70 proteins may have been expressed with the help of endogenous Cdc37 and HSP90 chaperones, subsequently inducing T cell activation. It will be of interest to examine the possibility that Cdc37 in concert with HSP90 also rescues other mis-sense mutants reported in CD8 deficiencies (3Monafo W.J. Polmar S.H. Neudorf S. Mather A.

HSP47 specifically associates with procollagen in the ER during its folding and/or modification processes and is thought to function as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone (Nagata, K. (1996) Trends Biochem. Sci. 21, 23–26). However, structural requirements for substrate recognition and regulation of the binding have not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that a typical collagen model sequence, (Pro-Pro-Gly)n, possesses sufficient structural information required for recognition by HSP47. A structure-activity relationship study using synthetic analogs of (Pro-Pro-Gly)n has revealed the requirements in both chain length and primary structure for the interaction. The substrate recognition of HSP47 has also been shown to be similar but distinct from that of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an ER resident enzyme. Further, it has shown that the interaction of HSP47 with the substrate peptides is abolished by prolyl 4-hydroxylation of the second Pro residues in Pro-Pro-Gly triplets and that the fully prolyl 4-hydroxylated peptide, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n, does not interact with HSP47. We thus have proposed a model in which HSP47 dissociates from procollagen during the process of prolyl 4-hydroxylation in the ER.

In the folding of type I collagen, for instance, three α chains (two α1(I) and one α2(I)) first associate at C-terminal propeptides, and then approximately 340 repeats of the Xaa-Yaa-Gly triplet form the 300-nm length triple helix (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Tuderman L. Guzman N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In the triple helix, three left-handed polyproline type II (PP-II) helices are supercoiled (2Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The helix-forming process is believed to be coupled with prolyl 4-hydroxylation at Yaa positions (3Wilson R. Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HSP47 transiently interacts with procollagen molecules in the ER in the process of folding and/or modification (4Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J.

Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). HSP47 is not secreted with procollagen from the cells, because it possesses the ER retention signal, Arg-Asp-Glu-Leu, at the carboxyl end (5Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J.

The expression of HSP47 is well correlated with that of various types of collagen in cultured cells, in various tissues during development, and in pathophysiological conditions (7Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Nakai A. Kudo H. Saga S. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Loones M.-T. Morange M.

Tsuji H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 967-972PubMed Google Scholar). Thus HSP47 is assumed to be a collagen-specific molecular chaperone (13Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the binding sites or motif in the procollagen molecule have not been well elucidated. The molecular basis of HSP47 function, including the regulation of the substrate association and dissociation, also remains an enigma. Here, we studied substrate recognition of HSP47 using the recombinant chaperone protein and synthetic collagen model peptides and found that a very simple collagen model peptide mimics the native substrate of HSP47. The difference in substrate recognition between HSP47 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4-H) was discussed in both primary and secondary structural aspects. We also investigated the effects of prolyl 4-hydroxylation, a characteristic post-translational modification for procollagen, on HSP47 interaction. (Pro-Pro-Gly)5, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)5, (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 were purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Minoh, Japan). Polyglycine (molecular mass = 12–13.3 kDa) and poly-l-proline (molecular mass = 5.2 kDa) were purchased from Sigma. Other peptides were synthesized on a PE Biosystems Model 433 A synthesizer using the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/tertiary butyl protecting strategy. After deprotection/cleavage, the crude products were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). All peptides were identified by ion spray mass spectrometry on a Sciex AP IIIE mass spectrometer. P4-H was obtained from 13-day-old chick embryos as described elsewhere (14Asada S. Koide T. Yasui H. Nagata K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) based on the procedures of Kedersha and Berg (15Kedersha N.L. Berg R.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1981; 1: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peptides and porcine type I collagen (Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan) were immobilized onto cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To introduce an N-terminal C-9 spacer, N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used instead of CNBr-activated beads. Overnight culture of Escherichia coli-harboring expression plasmid for mouse recombinant HSP47 (rHSP47) (16Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or GST-HSP47 fusion protein (pYL43 (14Asada S. Koide T. Yasui H. Nagata K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) in LB medium was diluted 5-fold and continued in culture for 1.5 h. Protein synthesis was induced by raising the temperature to 40.5 °C or by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for rHSP47 or GST-HSP47, respectively. The induction was terminated at 10 min. Cell lysates were prepared by treatment with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) in Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30% glycerol) followed by the addition of protease inhibitors and Nonidet P-40 (0.2%). The lysate (100 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES·Na (pH 7.5), 3.7 mm EDTA, 0.4m NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20) and a 40-μl bed of the affinity beads. The binding reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 0.4 ml of binding buffer. Proteins retained on the beads were eluted by adding 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (40 μl), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by CBB-staining or Western blotting using an anti-HSP47 antibody (SPA470, Stressgen, Victoria, Canada). For the densitometric quantification of the protein, the software application NIH-Image version 1.61 was used. To examine the binding of P4-H, purified enzyme was used instead of the E. coli lysate. A 0.1-ml bed of type I collagen- or (Pro-Pro-Gly)10-immobilized Sepharose was mixed with 100 μg of purified GST-HSP47 in binding buffer and rotated at 23 °C for 1 h. After washing the beads with binding buffer (0.5 ml × 2), the bed was divided into 10-μl aliquots. To each 10-μl bed, 60 μl of a competitor peptide dissolved in binding buffer was added and shaken at 23 °C for 1 h. The proteins eluted in the supernatant and those retained on the bed were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained by CBB. The triple helical region of collagen is composed of the characteristic repeats of Xaa-Yaa-Gly. Here, Xaa and Yaa are any amino acid residues, but Gly, Cys, and aromatic amino acid residues are unfavorable in native collagen sequences. Pro and 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues are most frequently found at the Xaa and Yaa positions, respectively. Previous studies showed that HSP47 binds to gelatin and various types of collagen without propeptides (16Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the importance of the triple helical regions for the interaction. To elucidate the structural requirements of collagen for interaction with HSP47, we first performed a solid-phase pull down assay using immobilized commercially available peptides that could mimic the collagen-like structure. Poly-l-proline, polyglycine, (Pro-Pro-Gly)5, and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 (17Sakakibara S. Kishida Y. Kikuchi Y. Sakai R. Kakiuchi K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1968; 41: 1273Crossref Google Scholar, 18Berg R.A. Olsen B.R. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5759-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used for the initial assay. The E. coli-harboring expression plasmid encoding rHSP47 was cultured, and the protein expression was induced moderately so as not to accumulate too much rHSP47 as compared with other endogenous proteins. The cell lysate was mixed with the beads on which type I collagen or the peptides were covalently coupled, and the proteins retained on the beads were assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining or Western blotting (Fig.1 A and B). Recombinant HSP47 was purified by the immobilized (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 with high specificity. No major proteins other than rHSP47 were detected on a CBB-stained gel (Fig.1 A, lane 7). On the other hand, rHSP47 did not interact with polyglycine, poly-l-proline, and (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 (Fig. 1, A and B,lanes 4-6). This result indicates that a simple collagen model peptide, (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, possesses sufficient structural information for specific binding to HSP47. HSP47 does not require amino acid residues with any charged side-chains for this specific interaction. It was also reported that the interaction of chick HSP47 with gelatin was not prevented even under high salt condition in vitro (19Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interaction is suggested as mainly contributing to the binding of HSP47 to its substrates. This result brought us some clues to the understanding of substrate recognition of HSP47. First, the minimal number of Pro-Pro-Gly triplet repeats required for the interaction is between 5 and 10. Second, substrate recognition of HSP47 is different from that of P4-H, because poly-l-proline, which is known to interact with P4-H (20Tuderman L. Kuutti E.-R. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), did not bind to HSP47. Finally, HSP47 does not require prolyl 4-hydroxylation at the Yaa positions of Xaa-Yaa-Gly repeats for the interaction. In the following experiments, we did precise analyses to clarify these issues. The minimal requirements in substrate structure for the interaction of HSP47 was next examined using synthetic tandem repeats of a Pro-Pro-Gly triplet with various lengths by similar solid-phase binding assays using the GST-HSP47 fusion protein hereafter. Significant binding of GST-HSP47 was observed for peptides with as few as seven repeats (21-mer) of the triplet, and the binding increased with increases in chain length (Fig. 2, A–C). As the collagen triple helix has a rigid rod-like shape with the increase/residue of 2.9 Å, the length of this minimal peptide was estimated to be about 60 Å (2Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). This value is comparable to the long axis length of HSP47 (approximately 65 Å as estimated by molecular modeling (21Davis J.W. El-Thaher T.S.H. Nakai A. Nagata K. Miller A.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 427-438Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). To eliminate the possible steric hindrance at the N-terminal linkage site of the peptide, we performed a similar binding assay introducing an N-terminal flexible spacer of nine carbons. In the presence of the flexible linker, we obtained similar results to that obtained in the absence of the linker. The minimal length was the same regardless of the existence of the linker (data not shown). We concluded that N-terminal steric hindrance was not a major reason for the relatively long length requirement for the substrate recognition of HSP47. Because the sequence of (Pro-Pro-Gly)n is also known to be a substrate of P4-H (22Kivirikko K.I. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the interaction of purified chick P4-H with the same set of immobilized peptides was subsequently investigated (Fig. 2, D and E). The binding of P4-H to immobilized (Pro-Pro-Gly)n peptides was observed fromn = 5 to 10. In contrast to GST-HSP47 binding, an increase in chain length had essentially an inverse effect on the interaction with P4-H. This observation indicates that HSP47 and P4-H have different conformational requirements in peptides with the same primary sequence. The former prefers longer chains, which have more tendency to form triple helices, compared with the latter. P4-H is most likely to preferentially interact with a single chain PP-II helix as reported in previous studies (23Chopra R.K. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Atreya P.L. Ananthanarayanan V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 2852-2858Google Scholar, 25Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R.M. Pihlajaniemi Y. Harding J.J. Post-translational Modification of Proteins. CRC Press, London1992: 2-51Google Scholar). The structural features of substrate peptides requisite for the interaction with HSP47 were further studied using analogues of (Pro-Pro-Gly)8 with different Pro and Gly arrangements including polyglycine, (Pro-Gly-Gly)8, (Pro-Gly)12, (Pro-Pro-Pro-Gly)6, and poly-l-proline (Fig.3 A). Among the peptides tested, only (Pro-Pro-Gly)8 interacted with GST-HSP47 (Fig.3 B, lane 7). On the other hand, P4-H bound to (Pro-Pro-Pro-Gly)6, (Pro-Pro-Gly)8, and poly-l-proline (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6–8). These P4-H-binding peptides showed a tendency to form PP-II helices in solution when analyzed by circular dichroism spectrometry (data not shown). These results demonstrated that Gly residues at every third residue are important for substrate recognition. It should be noted that the Gly residues in collagen sequences are important for stabilization of the triple-helical conformation through the formation of interchain hydrogen bridges (2Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The PP-II helix-forming tendency, which correlated with P4-H binding, is not by itself important for the interaction with HSP47. The most important post-translational modification during procollagen folding is prolyl 4-hydroxylation at the Yaa positions of Xaa-Yaa-Gly sequences catalyzed by P4-H. Most of the susceptible Pro residues are converted to Hyp residues in the final forms of various types of procollagen (26Bornstein P. Traub W. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. 4. Academic Press, London1979: 411-632Google Scholar). The effect of prolyl 4-hydroxylation of procollagen on interaction with HSP47 was investigated using immobilized synthetic peptides; the various positions of which were substituted with Hyp residues instead of Pro residues (Fig.4 A). Comparing (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, prolyl 4-hydroxylation of all susceptible Pro residues abolished the binding of GST-HSP47 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4). The effect of increasing the degree of prolyl 4-hydroxylation was also examined by comparing non-, mono-, tetra-, and fully (octa-) hydroxylated versions of the (Pro-Pro-Gly)8 sequence (lanes 5–8). Immobilized monohydroxylated peptide bound half as much GST-HSP47 as (Pro-Pro-Gly)8 beads did (lane 6). Introduction of Hyp residues at four of eight possible sites resulted in the loss of most of the binding affinity to GST-HSP47 (lane 7), and a fully hydroxylated peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)8 did not show any affinity (lane 8). The effect of prolyl hydroxylation on interaction with P4-H was also examined (Fig. 4 C). The results were parallel to that of GST-HSP47 as P4-H also prefers less hydroxylated peptides as its substrates. This result implies that both P4-H and HSP47 dissociate from the substrate during the progression of prolyl 4-hydroxylation of procollagen. We further performed competition assays using fully hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated peptides as competitors. The unhydroxylated peptide, (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, has an ability to elute GST-HSP47 from a complex of GST-HSP47 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 immobilized on beads in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A, lanes 3–5). In contrast, the corresponding fully hydroxylated peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 did not compete with the peptide immobilized on the beads (lanes 6–8). These results coincide with those obtained in a solid-phase binding assay (Fig.4 B). In addition, the unhydroxylated peptide also competed with the interaction between GST-HSP47 and immobilized type I collagen (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3–5), but the hydroxylated peptide did not (lanes 6–8). This observation confirmed that model peptides with a (Pro-Pro-Gly)n sequence act as a true substrate of HSP47 by mimicking the structure of the native substrate, procollagen. In the present paper, we demonstrated for the first time that the simplest collagen model peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)n could be used as a binding substrate for HSP47. The discovery of peptidic substrates enabled us to precisely analyze the molecular parameter required for the specific interaction. The substrate recognition of HSP47 was revealed to be different in conformation from that of P4-H though they showed overlapped substrate specificity in primary structures. In addition, we have shown that both HSP47 and P4-H predominantly interact with less prolyl 4-hydroxylated substrates or immature-type collagen sequences."

(1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14885–14890). To characterize the regulation of basal endothelial nitric-oxide synthase promoter activity and the signaling pathway through which lysophosphatidylcholine augments endothelial nitric-oxide synthase transcription, we used a casein kinase 2 inhibitor coupled with immunoprecipitation to demonstrate that basal Sp1 binding and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase promoter activity were controlled by casein kinase 2 complexed with protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A. Casein kinase 2 catalyzed protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A phosphorylation thereby inhibiting its activity. Lysophosphatidylcholine selectively activated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Purified extracellular regulated kinase 2 blocked casein kinase 2 activity and increased protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A activity, resulting in an increased Sp1 binding and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase promoter activity. These results indicate that Sp1 binding to its cognate site on the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase promoter and its transactivation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase is regulated by post-translational Sp1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation through a dynamic interaction between casein kinase 2 and protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A. We previously demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine up-regulated endothelial nitric-oxide synthase promoter activity by increasing Sp1 binding via the action of protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (Cieslik, K., Zembowicz, A., Tang, J.-L., and Wu, K.K.

Altered endothelial NO production has been implicated in several important cardiovascular diseases: hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and ischemic stroke. eNOS is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells and has features of a housekeeping gene (4Wu K.K.

Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 163-170PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism by which eNOS is induced by diverse physical and chemical factors remains unclear. We have used lysoPC as a model system to elucidate the mechanism by which eNOS gene transcription is regulated. Basal eNOS transcription requires binding of Sp1 to its cognate site (−104 to −90) at the 5′-flanking region of human eNOS gene (13Tang J.-L. Zembowicz A. Xu X.-M. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory indicated that lysoPC increases Sp1 binding activity, thereby augmenting eNOS promoter activity (15Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our work demonstrated that lysoPC-induced increase in Sp1 binding activity was blocked by okadaic acid and correlated with an elevated PP2A activity (15Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that eNOS transcription is regulated by post-translational modification of Sp1 via the actions of PP2A and a nuclear kinase, which was recently identified as casein kinase 2 (CK2) (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine how Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activities are controlled by CK2 and PP2A and to elucidate the signal pathway through which lysoPC alters this control mechanism. Our results indicate that CK2 complexes with PP2A and suppresses PP2A activity at the basal state, resulting in a low level of Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activity. LysoPC activates selectively the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-1 and ERK-2), which suppresses the CK2 activity and unleashes its inhibition of PP2A, leading to a higher Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activity.DISCUSSIONOur findings shed light on how basal and lysoPC-induced eNOS transcriptions are controlled and regulated. Previous studies have shown that basal eNOS promoter activity depends almost entirely on binding of Sp1 to a cognate site at the proximal region of eNOS promoter (13Tang J.-L. Zembowicz A. Xu X.-M. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Results from this study indicate that basal Sp1 binding activity is controlled by CK2, and lysoPC treatment of endothelial cells leads to suppression of the basal CK2 activity (Fig.4) with an increase in PP2A activity (Fig. 2). These results implied inhibition of PP2A by CK2 at the basal state. This notion was supported by two pieces of evidence from our experimental data. 1) Inhibition of CK2 activity with DRB raised the PP2A activity (Fig. 2), and 2) coincubation of PP2A with CK2 suppressed PP2A activity (Fig.8 B). LysoPC enhances Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activities by about 2-fold, while it reduces the CK2 activity in the CK2-PP2A complex to half of the basal level, consistent with the notion that reduction of CK2 activity accounts for increased eNOS promoter activity in lysoPC-treated cells. Our results further implied that lysoPC unleashes CK2's control of PP2A by an ERK1/2-mediated inhibition of CK2. This is supported by the following evidence. 1) Coincubation of ERK2 with purified CK2 or CK2 + PP2A resulted in a reduction of CK2 activity (Fig. 8 A) and an increase in PP2A activity (Fig. 8 B), and 2) lysoPC selectively activates the ERK1/2 pathway (Fig. 6, A–C) through which PP2A activity is enhanced in cells (Fig. 2). From these experimental results, a model for basal and lysoPC-induced eNOS transcription regulation is proposed as depicted in Fig. 9. According to this model, Sp1 binding to its DNA motif which has been suggested to be governed by a balance between Sp1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 22Daniel S. Zhang S. DePach-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) is controlled by CK2 interacting with PP2A. At the basal state, CK2 dominates over PP2A thereby maintaining a high level of Sp1 phosphorylation with a controlled basal Sp1 binding activity and eNOS promoter activity. Stimulation with lysoPC leads to a reduction of CK2 activity and increased PP2A activity via ERK activation, tilting the balance to favor Sp1 dephosphorylation and consequently unleashing the control accompanied by increased Sp1 binding and gene transcription.PP2A occupies a pivotal position in eNOS transcription. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation through its complex formation with CK2. This mode of PP2A regulation is in keeping with the PP2A properties. PP2A is a heterotrimer composed of a 36-kDa catalytic C subunit and a 65-kDa regulatory A subunit that form the core enzyme and a regulatory B subunit that binds to the core enzyme to form the holoenzyme (for a review, see Ref. 23Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the catalytic or regu-latory subunit has been reported to influence its catalytic activity (24Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 25Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Guo H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11193-11198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a previous report that CK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit (21Heriche J.-K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Regulation of PP2A activity is facilitated by its binding to diverse proteins including several kinases (20Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Heriche J.-K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A recent report indicates that it binds to CK2α but not CK2 holoenzyme and its activity is enhanced by complex with CK2α (21Heriche J.-K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This is contrary to our results, which show that it complexes with either CK2 holoenzyme or CK2α and its activity is suppressed by either form of CK2 in the complex. When ATP was omitted from the reaction mixture, the suppressing effect of CK2 on PP2A was abrogated. In our experimental system, CK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of PP2A is responsible for its inhibition of PP2A activity.Our experimental data support the notion that Sp1 is a substrate for CK2. 2K. Cieslik and K. K. Wu, unpublished data. Recent reports showed that Sp1 is phosphorylated by CK2 and phosphorylated Sp1 has reduced DNA binding activity during terminal differentiation of the liver (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar,30Leggett R.W. Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that Thr-579 located within the second zinc finger at the C-terminal region of Sp1 is actively phosphorylated by CK2 and mutation of this residue eliminated Sp1 phosphorylation and CK2-mediated inhibition of Sp1 binding activity (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Other serine residues in this region are also phosphorylated, but their identities and their functional roles remain unclear. Two classes of protein serine/threonine phosphatases have been implicated to catalyze the dephosphorylation of CK2-mediated Sp1 phosphorylation. In the liver differentiation study, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) was implicated based on okadaic acid inhibition of Sp1 binding activity (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, okadaic acid is a nonselective inhibitor for PP1 and PP2A (31Favre B. Jurowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13586-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Our results provide direct evidence for the involvement of PP2A in regulating Sp1 binding activity.LysoPC, a lipid mediator, is generated from phosphatidylcholine via the action of phospholipase A2 (32Parthasarathy S.

It induces transcription of a series of endothelial genes (33Kume N. Gimbrone M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 34Kume N. Cybulski M.I.

The signaling pathway through which lysoPC activates gene transcription has not been clearly defined. Several studies have shown that it activates protein kinase C (37Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M.

Our results demonstrate for the first time that ERK2 exerts a direct inhibitory effect on CK2. LysoPC induces MEK-1 and ERK1/2 activation probably by at least two upstream pathways: 1) through PKC activation, which may lead to Ras or Raf activation with subsequent MEK-1 and ERK1/2 activation, and 2) through Ras activation that results in Raf activation followed by MEK-1 and ERK activation.

Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine how Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activities are controlled by CK2 and PP2A and to elucidate the signal pathway through which lysoPC alters this control mechanism. Our results indicate that CK2 complexes with PP2A and suppresses PP2A activity at the basal state, resulting in a low level of Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activity. LysoPC activates selectively the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-1 and ERK-2), which suppresses the CK2 activity and unleashes its inhibition of PP2A, leading to a higher Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activity. DISCUSSIONOur findings shed light on how basal and lysoPC-induced eNOS transcriptions are controlled and regulated. Previous studies have shown that basal eNOS promoter activity depends almost entirely on binding of Sp1 to a cognate site at the proximal region of eNOS promoter (13Tang J.-L. Zembowicz A. Xu X.-M. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Results from this study indicate that basal Sp1 binding activity is controlled by CK2, and lysoPC treatment of endothelial cells leads to suppression of the basal CK2 activity (Fig.4) with an increase in PP2A activity (Fig. 2). These results implied inhibition of PP2A by CK2 at the basal state. This notion was supported by two pieces of evidence from our experimental data. 1) Inhibition of CK2 activity with DRB raised the PP2A activity (Fig. 2), and 2) coincubation of PP2A with CK2 suppressed PP2A activity (Fig.8 B). LysoPC enhances Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activities by about 2-fold, while it reduces the CK2 activity in the CK2-PP2A complex to half of the basal level, consistent with the notion that reduction of CK2 activity accounts for increased eNOS promoter activity in lysoPC-treated cells. Our results further implied that lysoPC unleashes CK2's control of PP2A by an ERK1/2-mediated inhibition of CK2. This is supported by the following evidence. 1) Coincubation of ERK2 with purified CK2 or CK2 + PP2A resulted in a reduction of CK2 activity (Fig. 8 A) and an increase in PP2A activity (Fig. 8 B), and 2) lysoPC selectively activates the ERK1/2 pathway (Fig. 6, A–C) through which PP2A activity is enhanced in cells (Fig. 2). From these experimental results, a model for basal and lysoPC-induced eNOS transcription regulation is proposed as depicted in Fig. 9. According to this model, Sp1 binding to its DNA motif which has been suggested to be governed by a balance between Sp1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) is controlled by CK2 interacting with PP2A. At the basal state, CK2 dominates over PP2A thereby maintaining a high level of Sp1 phosphorylation with a controlled basal Sp1 binding activity and eNOS promoter activity. Stimulation with lysoPC leads to a reduction of CK2 activity and increased PP2A activity via ERK activation, tilting the balance to favor Sp1 dephosphorylation and consequently unleashing the control accompanied by increased Sp1 binding and gene transcription.PP2A occupies a pivotal position in eNOS transcription. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation through its complex formation with CK2. This mode of PP2A regulation is in keeping with the PP2A properties. PP2A is a heterotrimer composed of a 36-kDa catalytic C subunit and a 65-kDa regulatory A subunit that form the core enzyme and a regulatory B subunit that binds to the core enzyme to form the holoenzyme (for a review, see Ref. 23Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the catalytic or regu-latory subunit has been reported to influence its catalytic activity (24Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L.

Our results are consistent with a previous report that CK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit (21Heriche J.-K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Regulation of PP2A activity is facilitated by its binding to diverse proteins including several kinases (20Westphal R.S.

A recent report indicates that it binds to CK2α but not CK2 holoenzyme and its activity is enhanced by complex with CK2α (21Heriche J.-K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This is contrary to our results, which show that it complexes with either CK2 holoenzyme or CK2α and its activity is suppressed by either form of CK2 in the complex. When ATP was omitted from the reaction mixture, the suppressing effect of CK2 on PP2A was abrogated. In our experimental system, CK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of PP2A is responsible for its inhibition of PP2A activity.Our experimental data support the notion that Sp1 is a substrate for CK2. 2K. Cieslik and K. K. Wu, unpublished data. Recent reports showed that Sp1 is phosphorylated by CK2 and phosphorylated Sp1 has reduced DNA binding activity during terminal differentiation of the liver (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W.

It was subsequently shown that Thr-579 located within the second zinc finger at the C-terminal region of Sp1 is actively phosphorylated by CK2 and mutation of this residue eliminated Sp1 phosphorylation and CK2-mediated inhibition of Sp1 binding activity (16Armstrong S.

Other serine residues in this region are also phosphorylated, but their identities and their functional roles remain unclear. Two classes of protein serine/threonine phosphatases have been implicated to catalyze the dephosphorylation of CK2-mediated Sp1 phosphorylation. In the liver differentiation study, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) was implicated based on okadaic acid inhibition of Sp1 binding activity (16Armstrong S. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol.

Our results demonstrate for the first time that ERK2 exerts a direct inhibitory effect on CK2.

They hypothesized that the ⋅OH reactivity was not restricted to the active site of CuZnSOD but that free ⋅OH was released from the active site. Fridovich (15Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar), while arguing against this free ⋅OH generation, suggested that CuZnSOD could have acted as a peroxidase toward DMPO producing DMPO-OH, which appeared as though free ⋅OH reacted with DMPO.

It was also suggested that in the presence of excess of H2O2, reversal of the second step of the superoxide dismutation pathway becomes significant resulting in the formation of O·̄2 (18Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). If O·̄2 were trapped by DMPO, the superoxide adduct DMPO-OOH may decompose into DMPO-OH. Although this controversy remains unresolved, this phenomenon has been already implicated in the gain-of-function of CuZnSOD mutants associated with the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a progressive degenerative disorder of motor neurons leading to paralysis (19Wiedau-Pazos M.

In our previous report (25Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) we clearly established that large magnitude DMPO-OH generation occurs only in the presence of HCO3− or structurally similar anions. We also presented evidence to show that HCO3− binds to the anion-binding site of the enzyme and facilitates anchoring of the neutral H2O2 at the active site that is surrounded by highly positively charged residues (25Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Otherwise, H2O2 with a pK a value of 11.9 cannot gain access into the positive charged active channel in large quantities, and it would be impossible to explain the rapid and intense generation of DMPO-OH (25Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In the present study, we characterize the CuZnSOD-mediated reaction of hydrogen peroxide with spin traps to understand which of the two mechanisms, peroxidation of DMPO or free ⋅OH generation, primarily result in the signal of DMPO-OH. Our results provide several lines of evidence for a direct reaction of DMPO with a copper-bound oxidant, most likely ⋅OH, and demonstrate that the function of SOD is similar to that of a peroxidase.RESULTSCuZnSOD (2 μm) dissolved in bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.4 gave rise to a large EPR signal when treated with H2O2 (1 mm) in the presence of DMPO (50 mm) (Fig. 1 A). The quartet signal observed with a typical intensity ratio (1:2:2:1) and hyperfine couplings (a H =a N = 14.9 G) corresponds to DMPO-OH (29Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompsun-Gorman S. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because higher concentrations of H2O2 (30 mm) were used in many prior reports, we also recorded the signals at these concentrations (Fig. 1 B). Several reports attributed the signals to free ⋅OH generation catalyzed by Cu2+ released from the enzyme because of the usage of high doses of H2O2 (15Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar, 16Sato K. Akaike T. Kohno M. Ando M. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25371-25377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Konningsberger J.C. van Asback B.S. van Faassen E. Wiegman L.J.J.M. van Hattum J. van Berge Henegouwen G.P. Marx J.J.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 230: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, we compared the signals obtained from the enzyme with that derived from an equivalent amount of free Cu2+ or Fe2+ ions. The corresponding EPR spectra (Fig. 1, C and D) indicate that signals obtained from these ions were negligible when compared with that obtained with CuZnSOD. Thus, free Cu2+released from CuZnSOD contributes very little, if any, to the large signal of DMPO-OH. In the presence of 2% ethanol, no detectable hydroxyethyl radical adduct, DMPO-Et, was observed (spectrum not shown).The magnitude of DMPO-OH signal was dependent on the concentration of H2O2, and this EPR signal was clearly detected at [H2O2] as low as 30 μm (Fig.2). At low H2O2concentrations signal generation persisted until all the H2O2 was consumed, whereas at H2O2 concentrations higher than 1 mm, there was an initial burst in the signal followed by a steep decline with time (Fig. 2). Because this could be due to damage to the enzyme, we analyzed the structural changes in the active site at high doses of H2O2. EPR spectra of the active site Cu2+ at 77 K was observed from 0.5 mm SOD with different H2O2 concentrations (Fig.3). The reaction between the two was allowed to proceed for different times before freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen. As seen from the EPR spectra, H2O2 reduces Cu2+ to diamagnetic Cu+, resulting in the reduction in the EPR intensity. In addition, H2O2 also causes changes in the Cu2+ coordination geometry from the rhombic symmetry of the native enzyme into axial symmetry resulting in an increase in the anisotropic copper hyperfine splitting, A ∥from 135 to 180 G (31Rotilio G. Morpurgo L. Calabrese L. Mondovi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 302: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Rotilio G. Morpurgo L. Giovagnoli C. Calabrese L. Mondovi B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2187-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The extent of reduction in the intensity and increase in A ∥ depends on the amount of H2O2 and reaction time. Reduction in the intensity was partially reversible over time because of reoxidation, whereas the change in A∥ was not, suggesting that millimolar quantities of H2O2 can cause irreversible damage to the enzyme resulting in altered copper coordination. This was even more marked in experiments with lower micromolar amounts of the enzyme.Figure 2Time courses of DMPO-OH generation by CuZnSOD at different H2O2 concentrations. Spectra were recorded with CuZnSOD (1.25 μm) and varying amounts of H2O2 under conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1.

Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompsun-Gorman S. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CuZnSOD, by virtue of its primary function as O·̄2 scavenger, may not leave any O·̄2 for trapping by DMPO. However, if H2O2, the main product of dismutation is available in excess amounts, it is suggested to reverse the second step in the dismutation pathway thereby forming O·̄2 (18Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we used DEPMPO, the structural analog of DMPO whose O·̄2 adduct, DEPMPO-OOH (half-life > 14 min), is 15-fold more stable than DMPO-OOH (33Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Only a signal of DEPMPO-OH was observed from CuZnSOD and H2O2 in bicarbonate buffer, and addition of 2% ethanol did not generate any detectable amounts of the hydroxyethyl adduct DEPMPO-Et (Fig. 4, Aand B), similar to the results obtained with DMPO.Figure 4Identification of the radical using DEPMPO . Spectra observed from CuZnSOD (1.25 μm), H2O2 (1 mm), and DEPMPO (20 mm) in 23.5 mm NaHCO3 buffer (pH 7.4) balanced with 5% CO2 and 95% N2containing no ethanol (A) or 2% ethanol (B, 400 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)If the signal of DMPO-OH or DEPMPO-OH arose from the trapping of free⋅OH, scavengers such as ethanol, formate, and azide would yield corresponding spin adducts derived from the scavenger molecules (30Zweier J.L.

Chem. 1980; 58: 1592-1595Crossref Google Scholar). Failure to obtain the ethanol adducts was reasoned by Yimet al. (13Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) to be due to inability of the apolar ethanol molecules to enter into the highly positively charged channel of the SOD active site, whereas DMPO can gain access inside the channel and form the DMPO-OH adduct. On the other hand, Fridovich (15Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar) proposed this inertness of alcohol as evidence against the generation of free⋅OH and reaffirmed his previous observation that alcohols did not protect the enzyme against H2O2inactivation. To distinguish between these two proposed mechanisms, we performed a series of experiments evaluating radical generation from EtOH and other ⋅OH scavengers. Our experiments were based on the premise that ethanol is not totally nonpolar when compared with DMPO and that if inaccessibility of the active site relative to DMPO was the only deficiency of ethanol, decreasing [DMPO] and increasing [EtOH] could overcome this problem. Experiments performed with 2 mm DMPO and 5% ethanol (1000 mm) yielded a small signal of DMPO-Et (hyperfine splittings,a N = 15.8 G, a H = 22.8 G) in addition to the large 1:2:2:1 quartet signal of DMPO-OH. This DMPO-Et signal further increased when the amount of ethanol was increased up to 20% (Fig.5 A). However, the increase in [DMPO-Et]/[DMPO-OH], calculated by computer simulation and quantitation of the corresponding EPR signals, was not commensurate with the large ratio of [EtOH]/[DMPO] (Fig. 5 B). Although the formation and decay kinetics of the two adducts are reported to be similar, a ratio of 1,400 was required to reach a DMPO-Et/DMPO-OH ratio of 1 (34Castelhano A.L. Perkins M.J. Griller D. Can J. Chem. 1983; 61: 298-299Crossref Google Scholar, 35Morehouse K.M. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1204-1211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lown J.W. Chen H.H. Can J. Chem. 1981; 59: 390-395Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, with a ⋅OH generating system the ratio of these adducts should be similar to the ratio of [EtOH]/[DMPO]. Experiments performed with varying ratios and amounts of DMPO and EtOH showed similar kinetics, indicating that this nonaqueous solvent change did not disrupt the catalytic function of the enzyme (Fig. 5 C). The 10-fold decrease in the overall concentration of the adducts was due to the decrease in the availability of DMPO. These results suggest that ethanol can reach the active site but that it is much less effective in scavenging the⋅OH species formed than would be expected for its spontaneous reaction with free ⋅OH.Figure 5Effect of ethanol concentration on the generation of DMPO-Et. A, spectra observed from CuZnSOD (1.25 μm), H2O2 (1 mm), and DMPO (2 mm) in 23.5 mmNaHCO3 buffer (pH 7.4) balanced with 5% CO2and 95% N2 containing 5, 10, 15, and 20% ethanol.

Formate and azide, both anions that readily access the active site of SOD, normally react with free ⋅OH to form spin adducts with characteristic EPR spectra, DMPO-COO·̄ (a N = 15.9 G anda H = 19.3), and DMPO-N3·(a N = a H = 14.7 G anda NN3 = 3.2 G), respectively (34Castelhano A.L. Perkins M.J. Griller D. Can J. Chem. 1983; 61: 298-299Crossref Google Scholar, 35Morehouse K.M. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 59: 390-395Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Formate (20 mm) and DMPO (20 mm) gave rise to a mixture of two adducts, DMPO-OH and DMPO-COO3·, the former being predominant (Fig. 6 B). Computer simulation and quantitation of the EPR signals showed that DMPO-COO·̄ constituted only about 15% of the total signal (Fig.7 B). If the DMPO-OH signals obtained in the absence of scavengers (Figs. 6 A and7 A) were from free ⋅OH, we should have obtained 50% DMPO-COO·̄ from a mixture of equimolar concentrations of DMPO and formate, because the formation and decay kinetics of the two adducts are almost identical (34Castelhano A.L. Perkins M.J. Griller D. Can J. Chem. 1983; 61: 298-299Crossref Google Scholar, 35Morehouse K.M. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

Even when 200 mm formate was used, the concentration of DMPO-COO·̄ grew only to 40% of the total spin adduct concentration (Figs. 6 C and7 C). Because the anion formate is known to readily access the catalytic site of SOD, this further indicates that most of the DMPO-OH obtained in the absence of scavengers emanate from a mechanism other than the reaction of free ⋅OH with DMPO (35Morehouse K.M. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1204-1211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lown J.W. Chen H.H. Can J. Chem. 1981; 59: 390-395Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overall spin adduct concentration was enhanced by 30–40% at 20 mm formate and by 350–400% at 200 mm formate (Fig. 7, A–C), reflecting the increase in the total concentration of substrates that can react with the bound ⋅OH. Azide has been reported to completely protect the enzyme against H2O2 mediated damage (8Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar). With equal 20 mm concentrations of azide and DMPO, which would yield equal concentrations of N3· and ⋅OH adducts if derived from free ⋅OH, in contrast, >80% of the observed adducts were azide-derived, indicating that the bound⋅OH was efficiently scavenged by azide in accordance with its known protection of the enzyme (Figs. 6 D and 7 D). It is also notable that azide caused a small reduction of the total signal, by 30–35% at 20 mm concentrations, but a large (>90%) decrease at 200 mm (Fig. 7, D andE). This is consistent with the inhibition of SOD that occurs at high azide concentrations because of its direct binding to the copper (38Fee J.A. Gaber B.P. J. Biol.

To further test whether the observed DMPO-OH formation is derived from free ⋅OH, a study of the initial rates of spin trapping was performed along the lines of these prior reports. In this kinetic approach, the initial rate of spin trapping rather than steady state adduct concentrations are measured because the latter depend not only on the rate of formation but also upon their rate of decay (34Castelhano A.L.

The significance of the Lyn-SHPTP1 interaction is supported by the demonstration that activation of Lyn contributes in part to the apoptotic response to ara-C treatment and that SHPTP1 attenuates this response. These findings support a functional interaction between Lyn and SHPTP1 in the response to DNA damage. The Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase is activated in the cellular response to DNA-damaging agents. Here we demonstrate that Lyn associates constitutively with the SHPTP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The SH3 domain of Lyn interacts directly with SHPTP1. The results show that Lyn phosphorylates SHPTP1 at the C-terminal Tyr-564 site. Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of SHPTP1 stimulates SHPTP1 tyrosine phosphatase activity. We also demonstrate that treatment of cells with 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine and other genotoxic agents induces Lyn-dependent phosphorylation and activation of SHPTP1. The significance of the Lyn-SHPTP1 interaction is supported by the demonstration that activation of Lyn contributes in part to the apoptotic response to ara-C treatment and that SHPTP1 attenuates this response. These findings support a functional interaction between Lyn and SHPTP1 in the response to DNA damage. DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK catalytic subunit ataxia telangiectasia mutated 1-β-d -arabinofuranosylcytosine glutathioneS-transferase phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The response of mammalian cells to DNA damage includes cell cycle arrest, activation of DNA repair, and induction of apoptosis. The signaling events responsible for regulation of the genotoxic stress response, however, are largely unknown. Certain insights have been derived from the finding that DNA-damaging agents activate a nuclear complex that consists in part of the c-Abl and Lyn protein-tyrosine kinases. c-Abl associates with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)1 and is activated in the response to DNA damage by a DNA-PK-dependent mechanism (1Kharbanda S.

The demonstration that c-Abl binds to p53, induces the transactivation function of p53, and activates p21 expression has supported involvement of c-Abl in regulation of the p53-dependent G1 arrest response (6Yuan Z.M.

In addition, a proapoptotic function for c-Abl in the response to DNA damage has been attributed to negative regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and induction of the stress-activated protein kinase pathway (1Kharbanda S.

These findings have supported a role for c-Abl in the growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptotic responses to genotoxic stress. The Lyn tyrosine kinase is a member of the Src family that contains SH2 and SH3 domains and an N-terminal sequence, which when myristoylated, serves as a membrane localization signal (13Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horowitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation and confocal microscopy studies have also demonstrated expression of Lyn in the nucleus (14Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z.-M. Kraeft S. Weichselbaum R. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3617-3621PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear Lyn is activated by DNA damage associated with exposure to 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), ionizing radiation, and certain alkylating agents (15Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R.

Lyn, like c-Abl, interacts with the DNA-PK complex (18Kumar S. Pandey P. Bharti A. Jin S. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25654-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The interaction between Lyn and DNA-PKcs may play a role in releasing DNA-PKcs from Ku·DNA complexes after repair to permit relocation at new sites of DNA damage (18Kumar S. Pandey P. Bharti A.

The activation of nuclear Lyn by DNA damage is also associated with binding of Lyn to Cdc2 (14Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z.-M. Kraeft S. Weichselbaum R. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3617-3621PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As activation of Cdc2 in a complex with cyclin B is required for the transition of cells from G2 to M phase (19Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), Lyn may function as an effector of G2/M regulation in response to DNA damage. Other studies have demonstrated that the arrest of cells at G1/S phase by ara-C treatment is associated with binding of activated Lyn to Cdk2 (20Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 939-946PubMed Google Scholar). These findings collectively support a role for nuclear Lyn in the response of cells to DNA damage. The present studies have addressed the involvement of other Lyn-associated signals in the DNA damage response. The results demonstrate that treatment with ara-C induces Lyn-dependent phosphorylation of the SHPTP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase (21Pei D. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmüller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We show that Lyn activates SHPTP1, and in a potential feedback mechanism, SHPTP1 down-regulates the Lyn kinase function. The results also demonstrate that SHPTP1 attenuates Lyn-dependent induction of apoptosis in the response to DNA damage. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. 293T embryonal kidney and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of ara-C (Sigma). Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a Gammacell 1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) under aerobic conditions with a137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.76 gray/min as determined by dosimetry. The Lyn(K-R) cDNA that encodes the kinase-negative mutant (the lysine residue at position 275 in the putative ATP-binding site replaced with arginine) and the SHPTP1 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Lyn wild-type and mutant cDNAs were subcloned into pSRα (23Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell.

U-937 cells were resuspended at 107/ml and transfected with empty pEF2 vector or pEF2/Lyn(K-R) by electroporation (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad; 0.25 V, 960 microfarads). HeLa cells were transfected with pSRα vector or pSRα/Lyn(K-R) by electroporation. Two days posttransfection, the cells were cultured in media containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and individual clones were selected by limiting dilution. 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSRα/Lyn, pSRα/Lyn(K-R), pcDNA3/SHPTP1, pcDNA3/SHPTP1(C-S) (25Kharbanda S.

At 48 h posttransfection, cells were harvested for preparing whole cell lysates. HeLa/neo cells or HeLa/Lyn(K-R) cells were transiently cotransfected with 5 μg of pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) and 10 μg of pcDNA3 vector, pcDNA3/SHPTP1, pcDNA3/SHPTP1(C-S), or pcDNA3/SHPTP1(Y564F) using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). At 40 h posttransfection, cells were left untreated or treated with 10 μm ara-C and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-Lyn antibody (sc-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-SHPTP1 antibody (sc-287; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h of incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The residual binding sites were blocked by incubating with 5% dry milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. The filters were incubated with anti-Lyn (mouse monoclonal antibody; Transduction Laboratory), anti-SHPTP1, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h with shaking. After washing twice with 5% dry milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, the filters were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products).

Cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of immobilized GST fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Lyn antibody. For direct binding assays, recombinant Lyn (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was incubated in lysis buffer with glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to GST-SHPTP1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or GST for 1 h at 4 °C. The adsorbed material obtained by washing three times with lysis buffer was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Lyn antibody. GST, GST-SHPTP1 (5 μg), or His-tagged SHPTP1 proteins (2 μg) were incubated in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate) with recombinant Lyn and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) for 15 min at 30 °C. Anti-Lyn immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer and resuspended in kinase buffer containing 2–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μm ATP. Kinase reactions were also performed in the presence of enolase (Sigma). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 or 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Tyrosine phosphatase assays were performed by the malachite green phosphatase assay method (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) using the phosphopeptide (RRLIEDAEpYAARG, where pY is phosphotyrosine) as a substrate. For in vivo phosphatase assays, cells were lysed with lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitor. The lysates were incubated with anti-SHPTP1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h of incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitor and once with phosphatase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and resuspended in phosphatase buffer containing the phosphopeptide. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of malachite green solution. Absorbance was measured in a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad) at 655 nm. Phosphate release was determined by comparing absorbance to that obtained with the phosphate standard. DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The numbers of cells positive for green fluorescence with sub-G1 DNA content were determined with a CELLQuest program (Becton Dickinson). The findings that c-Abl forms a nuclear complex with Lyn (27Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 1997; 1333: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar) and that c-Abl interacts with SHPTP1 (25Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R. Walsh C.T. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) prompted studies on a potential interaction between Lyn and SHPTP1. To determine whether Lyn associates with SHPTP1, U-937 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn. Immunoblot analysis of the anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates with anti-SHPTP1 demonstrated reactivity at 70 kDa (Fig.1 A). Similar findings were obtained in cells treated with ara-C (Fig. 1 A). In a reciprocal experiment, analysis of anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates with anti-Lyn confirmed a constitutive association of these proteins (Fig.1 B). Binding of Lyn and SHPTP1 was assessed by incubating U-937 cell lysates with GST fusion proteins prepared with Lyn fragments. Analysis of the adsorbates with anti-SHPTP1 demonstrated binding to Lyn (1–243), Lyn (1–131), and Lyn (30–130) but not Lyn (131–243) (Fig. 1 C). As Lyn (30–130) contains the SH3 and not the SH2 domain, these findings suggest that Lyn SH3 is responsible for binding to SHPTP1. To determine whether the interaction is direct, glutathione beads containing GST or GST-SHPTP1 were incubated with purified Lyn protein. The beads were washed, and protein was eluted by boiling in SDS. Analysis of the eluted protein by immunoblotting with anti-Lyn demonstrated a direct interaction between Lyn and SHPTP1 (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether Lyn phosphorylates SHPTP1 in vitro, purified Lyn was incubated with GST or GST-SHPTP1 and [γ-32P]ATP. These assays were performed in the presence of sodium vanadate at a concentration (0.1 mm) that completely inhibits SHPTP1 phosphatase activity (data not shown). Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated phosphorylation of SHPTP1 (Fig.2 A). SHPTP1 contains two N-terminal SH2 domains, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain and a C terminus, which includes potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr-536, Tyr-541, Tyr-564) (21Pei D. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr-536 to Phe had no apparent effect on Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of SHPTP1 (Fig.2 B). Similar results were obtained with the Y541F mutants (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, Lyn-mediated phosphorylation was abrogated with the Y564F mutant as substrate (Fig. 2 B). These findings demonstrate that Lyn phosphorylates the Tyr-564 site. To assess whether Lyn phosphorylates SHPTP1 in vivo, 293T cells were cotransfected with wild-type Lyn and a phosphatase-inactive SHPTP1, which expressed a C453S mutant (22Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmüller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Analysis of anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP1 (Fig. 2 C). Cotransfection of SHPTP1(C-S) with the empty vector or kinase-inactive Lyn(K-R) was associated with little if any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP1 (Fig. 2 C). In addition, Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of SHPTP1(C-S) was substantially abrogated when the Tyr-564 site was mutated to F (Fig. 2 C). These findings demonstrate that Lyn phosphorylates SHPTP1 in vitro and in vivo. The functional significance of the interaction between Lyn and SHPTP1 was assessed by incubation of glutathione beads containing GST-SHPTP1 with recombinant Lyn and a synthetic phosphopeptide as substrate. The results demonstrate that Lyn stimulates the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHPTP1 in a Lyn concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether Lyn activates SHPTP1 in vivo, 293T cells were cotransfected with kinase-active Lyn or Lyn(K-R) and phosphatase-active SHPTP1. Anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for tyrosine phosphatase activity. The results demonstrate that Lyn and not Lyn(K-R) stimulates SHPTP1 activity (Fig. 3 B). As a control, anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with SHPTP1(C-S) exhibited little if any phosphatase activity (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that Lyn stimulates SHPTP1 activity in vitro and in vivo. In reciprocal experiments, anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates were analyzed for Lyn kinase activity. In control cells transfected with Lyn alone, the anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates exhibited autophosphorylation of Lyn and phosphorylation of enolase (Fig. 3 C). Cotransfection of Lyn and 1 μg of SHPTP1 had little effect, whereas cotransfection of Lyn and 5 μg of SHPTP1 was associated with down-regulation of Lyn activity (Fig. 3 C). By contrast, cotransfection of Lyn and SHPTP1(C-S) had no apparent effect on Lyn and enolase phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). These findings support a model in which Lyn stimulates the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHPTP1, and in a potential feedback mechanism, SHPTP1 inhibits Lyn-mediated phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with ara-C and other DNA-damaging agents is associated with induction of Lyn activity (14Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z.-M. Kraeft S. Weichselbaum R. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3617-3621PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of Lyn is associated with SHPTP1 phosphorylation, we prepared U-937 cells that stably express a kinase-inactive Lyn(K-R) mutant. U-937 cells expressing the empty pEF2 vector (U-937/neo) or Lyn(K-R) were exposed to ara-C and harvested at 1 h. Anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates were analyzed for autophosphorylation and enolase phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated induction of Lyn activity in ara-C-treated U-937/neo cells (Fig.4 A). By contrast, ara-C-induced Lyn activity was substantially abrogated in U-937/Lyn(K-R) cells (Fig. 4 A). To assess Lyn phosphorylation of SHPTP1, lysates from ara-C-treated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SHPTP1, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). The results demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP1 after ara-C treatment of U-937/neo but not U-937/Lyn(K-R) cells (Fig. 4 B). Similar studies were performed with irradiated cells to assess the effects of other DNA-damaging agents. The results demonstrate that ionizing radiation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP1 is abrogated in the cells expressing Lyn(K-R) (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether DNA damage is associated with induction of SHPTP1 activity, the anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates from ara-C-treated cells were analyzed for dephosphorylation of the synthetic phosphopeptide. ara-C-induced increases in SHPTP1 activity were attenuated in U-937/Lyn(K-R), as compared with U-937/neo, cells (Fig. 4 C). These findings demonstrate that ara-C-induced activation of Lyn is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP1 and stimulation of SHPTP1 activity. To assess the significance of the interaction between Lyn and SHPTP1 in the cellular response to DNA damage, we prepared HeLa cells that stably express the empty neo vector or the kinase-inactive Lyn(K-R) mutant (Fig. 5 A). Treatment of HeLa/neo cells with ara-C was associated with an increase in the percentage with sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 5 B). By contrast, ara-C-induced apoptosis was abrogated in part in the HeLa/Lyn(K-R) cells (Fig. 5 B). These results support a role for Lyn in the apoptotic response to ara-C exposure. To define the role of Lyn in the context of SHPTP1, HeLa cells were transfected to express wild-type SHPTP1 or the phosphatase-inactive SHPTP1(C-S). Expression of SHPTP1, but not SHPTP1(C-S), attenuated ara-C-induced apoptosis of the HeLa/neo cells (Fig. 5 C). In addition, expression of SHPTP1 or SHPTP1(C-S) had little if any effect on induction of ara-C-treated HeLa/Lyn(K-R) cells with sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 5 C). These findings indicate that activation of Lyn contributes to the apoptotic response to DNA damage and that SHPTP1 attenuates the Lyn-mediated response. To confirm the functional interaction between Lyn and SHPTP1, we expressed the SHPTP1(Y564F) mutant in 293T cells. Analysis of anti-SHPTP1 immunoprecipitates demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHPTP1(Y564F) is comparable to that of wild-type SHPTP1 (Fig. 6 A). Cotransfection of Lyn and wild-type SHPTP1 was associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. 6 A). By contrast and in concert with the demonstration that Lyn phosphorylates SHPTP1 on Tyr-564, cotransfection of Lyn and SHPTP1(Y564F) resulted in no significant activation of the tyrosine phosphatase function (Fig.6 A). In addition, whereas expression of wild-type SHPTP1 attenuated ara-C-induced apoptosis of HeLa/neo cells, transfection of SHPTP1(Y564F) was significantly less effective in abrogating the apoptotic response to ara-C (Figs. 5 C and 6 B). As a control, ara-C treatment of HeLa/Lyn(K-R) cells expressing SHPTP1(Y564F) resulted in a percentage of apoptotic cells similar to that obtained when these cells were transfected with pcDNA3, wild-type SHPTP1, or SHPTP1(C-S) (Figs. 5 C and6 B). These findings demonstrate that the SHPTP1(Y564F) mutant is not activated by Lyn and that this mutant is less effective than wild-type SHPTP1 in attenuating Lyn-mediated apoptosis. The finding that activation of Lyn by DNA-damaging agents contributes to the down-regulation of Cdc2 has indicated that Lyn is an effector of cell cycle progression in the response to DNA damage (14Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z.-M. Kraeft S. Weichselbaum R. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3617-3621PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Moreover, the interaction between Lyn and DNA-PK has supported a function for Lyn in the regulation of DNA repair (18Kumar S. Pandey P. Bharti A. Jin S. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25654-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that Lyn phosphorylates and activates SHPTP1 in response to genotoxic stress. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that DNA damage is associated with activation of a tyrosine phosphatase. Previous work has shown that Lyn forms a nuclear complex with c-Abl (27Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 1997; 1333: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar) and that c-Abl interacts with SHPTP1 (25Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R. Walsh C.T. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). c-Abl phosphorylates SHPTP1 on the C-terminal Tyr-536 and Tyr-564 sites (25Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R. Walsh C.T. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the effects of c-Abl on SHPTP1 activity were not defined (25Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R. Walsh C.T. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), more recent studies have demonstrated that c-Abl stimulates SHPTP1 at least in vitro. 2K. Yoshida, S. Kharbanda, and D. Kufe, unpublished data. Thus, both Lyn and c-Abl are activated by DNA damage and phosphorylate SHPTP1 as a downstream effector. The present results also demonstrate that SHPTP1, in a potential feedback mechanism, down-regulates Lyn-mediated phosphorylation. The functional significance of the Lyn-SHPTP1 interaction is further supported by the findings that the activity of Lyn is responsible in part for DNA damage-induced apoptosis and that SHPTP1 attenuates the Lyn-dependent proapoptotic signals. Taken together with the previous demonstration that SHPTP1 down-regulates c-Abl-dependent activation of the stress-activated protein kinase cascade (25Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R. Walsh C.T. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the present findings support a model in which activation of SHPTP1 in the response to DNA damage functions as a negative regulator of events activated by Lyn- and c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation.

ApoB mRNA editing, which occurs in the intestine of all mammals, results in the formation of a truncated apoB protein (apoB-48) that is 48% of the size of the full-length genomically encoded apoB (apoB-100) (10Chan L.

The apoB mRNA editing complex locates the apoB pre-mRNA among tens of thousands pre-mRNAs (12Yang Y. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Four sequence elements have been identified in the apoB mRNA that specify this precision. These elements span 139 nucleotides (nt) on the apo-mRNA and are necessary for editing at physiological levels (15Nakamuta M. Tsai A. Chan L. Davidson N.O. Teng B.-B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Essential for a basal level of editing at C6666 are the 11-nucleotide (nt) “mooring sequence” (nt 6671–6681) (17Backus J.W. Smith H.C.

These two elements are located within a 22-nt editing cassette (21Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Together with the editing cassette, a 5′ efficiency element (nt 6609–6628) and a 3′ efficiency element (nt 6717–6747) are necessary to achieve editing at C6666 at physiological levels in vitro (15Nakamuta M.

Although the mechanism for this precise editing is unknown, we and others have hypothesized that the RNA secondary structure is critical (24Richardson N. Navaratnam N. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31707-31717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a phylogenetic comparison approach (25James B.D. Olsen G.J. Pace N.R. Methods Enyzmol. 1989; 180: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to infer the secondary structure of a 139-nt apoB mRNA containing both the 5′ and 3′ efficiency elements. Here we report that the mooring sequence and the 3′ efficiency element form a double-stranded stem that facilitates the editing of the apoB mRNA by the editing complex. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) from mammalian livers that were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction was performed at 42 °C for 1 h with one of the human apoB-specific lower primers (see TableI) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences, Inc., St. Petersburg, FL). DNA was extracted from tissue with the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on liver cDNA or genomic DNA with a set of human apoB upper (HBU) and lower primer using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and the following cycling parameter: 94 °C for 2 min, four cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min followed by 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. All PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels, and unless a single PCR product of the expected size was detected, a second nested PCR amplification was performed on 1 μl of the PCR product. The single-banded PCR products (337–397 nt) were either purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and eluted by Qiaex II gel extraction (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or purified over S-300 HR columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Sequence analysis was performed on both strands of the PCR products using the Big Dye d-Rhodamine dye terminator mixture on a 373 DNA Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). The sequences were aligned with the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI).Table IOligonucleotide sequenceOligonucleotideHBU6507AATTCATTCAATTGGGAGAGACAAGHBU6526GACAAGTTTCACATGCCAAGGAGAAHBU6533TTCACATGCCAAGGAGAAACTGACTGCTT7HBU6507GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAATTCATTCAATTGGGAGT7HBU6533GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATTCACATGCCAAGGAGAAACHBL6845GGATGCAGTACTACTTCCACTTTTGHBL6865ACTTAGTATCCACATTTTGAATCCAGGATGHBL6876TGATTTGGTACTTAGTATCCACATTTTGCons51ATCATAATTATCTTTAATATACTGGP51ATCATAATTATTTATAATATAATGPE6666AACTCTCTCAGTTTCAGACATAT7UAATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGT7EFFGTAGTAATTTGATCAATAATCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAAATTT7EFFSTACTTAATAGTTGAAAAATCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAAATTThe oligonucleotide orientation is 5′ to 3′.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9435-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Primers T7HBU6605 and T7HBU6533 were used to amplify the DNA templates for transcription. The small RNAs, designated EFFG and EFFscrambled, were transcribed from oligonucleotides T7EFFG (Table I) and T7EFFS after annealing to the upper oligo T7U, necessary for T7 transcription. Two-step PCR was used to incorporate mutations into the guinea pig apoB PCR products (26Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified, and the RNAs were produced as described for the apoB RNAs. The sequence of each mutated guinea pig apoB PCR template was verified by sequence analysis. For the recombinantin vitro apoB mRNA editing assay (27Driscoll D.M. Wynne J.K. Wallis S.C. Scott J.

Wynne J.K. Wallis S.C. Scott J. Cell. 1989; 58: 519-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In control experiments, the RNAs were incubated in the assay mixture lacking rabbit liver S100 extract. For the in vitro apoB mRNA editing assay with guinea pig enterocyte S100 extract (29Garcia Z.C. Poksay K.S. Boström K. Johnson D.F. Balestra M.E. Shechter I. Innerarity T.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 100 pg of synthetic RNA was incubated with 150 μg of guinea pig enterocyte S100 extract, 1 μg of E. coli tRNA, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) in buffer D containing 1 mm dithiothreitol in a reaction volume of 100 μl. All RNAs were amplified by RT-PCR, and the resulting single-band PCR products were purified over a microspin S-300 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the in vitro apoB mRNA editing assay where two RNAs were incubated, GP6641 and EFFG or EFFscrambled, the two RNAs were preincubated at 65 °C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature before they were added to thein vitro apoB mRNA editing assay. Primer extension was performed essentially as described (4Boström K. Garcia Z. Poksay K.S. Johnson D.F. Lusis A.J. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22446-22452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer Cons51 (Table I) was used for primer extension of the 29 apoB mRNAs, except for the primer extension of the guinea pig RNA where primer GP51 was used. PE6666 (Table I) was used to reanalyze editing in the guinea pig apoB mRNA and to analyze editing in GP6641. In these experiments, the coding strand instead of the noncoding strand was analyzed for editing. For these experiments, 1 mm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and 5 mm ddCTP were used for the poisonous primer extension. The extent of editing was determined with a radioanalytic imaging system (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). The percent editing is given as the mean of the number (n) of experiments. Phylogenic comparisons are the most incisive a priori approach to inferring RNA secondary structure (25James B.D. Olsen G.J. Pace N.R. Methods Enyzmol. 1989; 180: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Double-stranded helices in RNA are tested by inspecting the equivalent base paring in homologous RNAs in which the sequence varies. The method is based on the assumption that RNAs with similar function will have similar secondary structure even though there are variations in the sequence. We expected to find co-variation of paired residues in helical regions so that the pairing potential is maintained. We used a phylogenetic comparative approach to attempt to infer the secondary structure of the 139-nt sequence encompassing the apoB mRNA editing site at C6666. This sequence includes the 5′ efficiency element, the editing site, the mooring sequence, and the 3′ efficiency element. The apoB mRNA editing region from 30 eutherian mammals was amplified either by PCR from genomic DNA or by RT-PCR from liver RNA, and the sequences were aligned (Fig.1). The apoB sequences were very similar (at least 81%) and did not have sufficient co-variations necessary to predict conserved base pairing or to formulate a unique consensus secondary structure model by using genebee or m-fold software (30Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 31Zuker M. Jacobson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the analysis showed two highly conserved sequences present within the editing region. Nine nucleotides are conserved within the 5′ efficiency element (nt 6616–6624), and 22 nt are conserved within the editing cassette, which includes C6666, the spacer region, and the mooring sequence (nt 6662–6683). Only the guinea pig (nt 6616 and 6677) and the cow apoB (nt 6619 and 6681) sequences have mutations within these regions. We next determined if all 30 apoB RNA sequences are good substrates for APOBEC-1. To test the 30 amplified apoB sequences for editing, we transcribed the PCR products in vitro and analyzed the apoB mRNAs for editing in a recombinant in vitro editing assay (Fig.2). The apoB mRNAs were 337–397 nt in length. Interestingly, the apoB RNAs from 29 of the 30 species were good substrates for APOBEC-1 and were edited between 33 and 59% by the rabbit APOBEC-1. Previously, it has been shown that rat and mouse apoB mRNA are good substrates for APOBEC-1, in vitro andin vivo, respectively (2Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O.

To exclude a possible artifact caused by the guinea pig-specific primer for primer extension (GP51, TableI), we repeated the primer extension experiments on the sense strand with primer PE6666. Again, editing of the guinea pig apoB mRNA was only 3% (data not shown). To rule out species incompatibility (the previous experiment used recombinant rabbit APOBEC-1 plus auxiliary factors from rabbit liver), we repeated the experiment with guinea pig S100 extract (Fig.3). These experiments showed that the guinea pig apoB mRNA is an intrinsically poorer substrate than the apoB mRNA from other species tested.Figure 3Guinea pig apoB mRNA is edited by guinea pig intestinal enterocyte S100 extract. RNAs were incubated for 1, 2, 4, or 16 h in an in vitro editing assay using guinea pig enterocyte S100 extracts as a source for editing activity, and the editing of C6666 was determined by primer extension analysis (n = 3).

The middle band represents the unmodified cytidine (C at 6666).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This difference in editing efficiency had to be due to sequence differences between the guinea pig RNA and the consensus sequences of the other 31 apoB RNAs. There were two regions we thought were the most important for editing efficiency. One was the 5′ efficiency element, and the other was the mooring sequence. Since the guinea pig apoB sequence has a mutation both in the 5′ efficiency element and in the mooring sequence, we surmised that changing these nucleotides to the consensus sequences would result in more efficient editing. Analysis showed that the substitution of the U for a consensus C (6616) within the 5′ efficiency element of the guinea pig apoB mRNA had no influence on editing efficiency (data not shown). However, when the guinea pig mooring sequence was changed to the consensus mooring sequence, we obtained unexpected results. Instead of increasing editing activity as expected, restoring the consensus mooring sequence drastically reduced editing (GPM-MOOR, Fig.4). Because of the importance of the exact mooring sequence, these results were difficult to understand (19Shah R.R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N. Greeve J.C. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16301-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possible explanation that the guinea pig enterocyte S100 extract is species specific for the guinea pig RNA and favors a U at position 6677 was eliminated from consideration since the rabbit apoB mRNA, which has a G at this position, is edited more efficiently than guinea pig apoB mRNA by the guinea pig enterocyte extract (Fig. 3). To explain this apparent paradox, we hypothesized that, at some point in evolution, a mutation in guinea pig RNA reduced editing activity and a corresponding compensatory mutation restored editing activity, albeit at a lower level. Thus, we set out to find the other mutations that would compensate for the mooring sequence mutation. Again, assuming that the secondary structure of the apoB RNA is important and that it is maintained in the guinea pig apoB RNA, we reasoned that these experiments should help us with the secondary structure analysis. To investigate whether compensatory mutations within the guinea pig apoB mRNA could possibly restore editing efficiency, we searched for unique mutations in the guinea pig apoB mRNA. We found seven sites where the guinea pig sequence differs from the consensus sequence of the other 31 species (Fig. 5). We then prepared RNA constructs with six sets of two co-variations. In each of these, the U was changed to a consensus sequence G in the mooring sequence (GPM-MOOR), and one other base was altered. The purpose was to determine if any of these changes would rescue the decreased editing caused by the mooring sequence mutation. Three of the co-mutations increased editing efficiency (Fig. 5), GPM-MOOR-6665, GPM-MOOR-6743, and GPM-MOOR 6745). One was located directly upstream of C6666 (GPM-MOOR-6665), and the other two were located within the 3′ efficiency element (GPM-MOOR-6743, GPM-MOOR-6745). The three co-mutations that did not alter editing were located in the 5′ efficiency element or in regions that were previously shown not to be necessary for efficient editing (16Hersberger M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9435-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since the co-mutations that rescued editing efficiency in the GPM-MOOR were located directly upstream of C6666 or within two nucleotides in the 3′ efficiency element, we analyzed secondary structures of the guinea pig apoB mRNA that would bring these residues into close association, paying special attention to possible interactions between the two RNA sequence elements. The m-fold minimal energy software (30Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 31Zuker M. Jacobson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) predicted a hairpin structure for the 139-nt guinea pig apoB mRNA in which the mooring sequence and the 3′ efficiency element form a double-stranded helix (Fig.6). The predicted secondary structures for the human apoB mRNA and the 30 other apoB mRNAs are similar. However, in the human secondary structure, C6666is positioned two nucleotides upstream of the double-stranded stem, whereas in the guinea pig secondary structure, C6666 is located one base upstream of the stem. This difference in the secondary structures is due to the unique mutations in the 3′ efficiency element of the guinea pig apoB mRNA compared with the other 31-apoB mRNAs (Fig. 1). The co-mutation that increased editing efficiency of GPM-MOOR over the editing efficiency of the guinea pig apoB mRNA (GPM-MOOR-6743) is predicted to open the double-stranded region, mimicking the human secondary structure (C-6743) (Fig. 6). We next sought to test the secondary structure model of the guinea pig apoB mRNA by assaying the editing of RNAs that had all three mutations that enhanced the editing of the RNA (GPM-MOOR) (Fig. 5). One RNA had mutations at the two unique nucleotides in the 3′ efficiency element plus one additional unique nucleotide difference directly upstream (nt 6743, 6745, and 6747) and the one directly upstream of C6666 (nt 6665) (GPM-A/CUG) (Fig.7). Another RNA had the three changes in the 3′ efficiency sequence but omitted the G to A change at nucleotide 6665 (GPM-CUG) (Fig. 7). The editing efficiency of both of these altered guinea pig apoB RNAs was markedly increased (GPM-A/CUG, GPM-CUG) (Fig. 7), approaching that of rabbit apoB mRNA (Fig. 3). The predicted secondary structures of GPM-CUG and GPM-A/CUG RNAs have reduced stems similar to the secondary structure model of human apoB mRNA. Thus, these results support our model of different editing efficiencies based on secondary structure. To test more directly the negative influence of the longer stem in the guinea pig apoB mRNA secondary structure model on editing, we assayed a mutation that would reduce the stem structure (Fig.8). The U to C mutation at nucleotide 6743 in the 3′ efficiency element increased editing of the guinea pig apoB mRNA (GPM-C) to levels comparable to those of rabbit apoB mRNA. Moreover, introducing a co-mutation downstream of C6666 to restore the longer stem of the guinea pig apoB mRNA drastically decreased editing efficiency (GPM-G/C). This opening and re-closing of the stem by single nucleotide substitutions was repeated with a U to A mutation in the 3′ efficiency element (Fig.9). Again, editing efficiency increased (GPM-A) with the U to A mutation at 6743 and decreased upon a complementary A to U co-mutation of the nucleotide downstream of C6666 (GPM-U/A). The A to U substitution downstream of C6666 (GPM-A) alone did not increase editing efficiency. Previously, substitution of U for A at nt 6667 decreased editing, and became the nearest neighbor preference for editing (20Chen S.-H. Li X. Liao W.S.L. Wu J.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6811-6816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the unchanged editing efficiency of GPM-A may reflect the sum of increased editing by the opening of the stem and decreased editing by an unfavorable base substitution of U6667 next to C6666. Both sets of experiments (Figs. 8 and 9) indicate a direct interaction between A6667 and the U6743, which is located 76 nt further downstream in the guinea pig apoB mRNA. These data support the predicted secondary structure of the guinea pig apoB mRNA.Figure 9A single U to A substitution at 6743 in the 3′ efficiency element increases editing efficiency. RNAs (371 nt) were incubated for 1, 2, 4, or 16 h in an in vitroediting assay using guinea pig enterocyte S100 extracts as source for editing activity, and the editing of C6666 was determined by primer extension analysis (n = 3).

Therefore, if the model is correct the further extension of the stem until C6666 is part of the putative double helix should dramatically decrease editing of the RNA. To accomplish this, we changed two nucleotides in the 3′ efficiency element to base pairs with U6664 and C6666 (GPM-NEG) (Fig.10). Elongation of the stem drastically decreased editing in GPM-NEG, emphasizing the positioning of C6666 in a single-stranded bulge. The two substitutions introduced into GPM-NEG are located between the three substitutions in GPM-CUG (Fig. 7) that increased editing of the guinea pig apoB mRNA to levels comparable to that of rabbit apoB mRNA. To test further the validity of our RNA secondary model, we used a small guinea pig apoB mRNA, GP6641 (58 nt, 6641–6698), that lacks the 3′ efficiency element. This RNA was incubated in an in vitro editing assay with or without a small RNA encoding the 3′ efficiency element. Co-incubation of GP6641 and the 20-nt 3′ efficiency element (EFFG, 6728–6747) increased editing of GP6641 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 11). This increased editing efficiency was sequence specific for the 3′ efficiency element since a scrambled 3′ efficiency element did not increase editing of GP6641. Again, this specific enhancement by the consensus 3′ efficiency element supports the helix formation between the mooring sequence and the 3′ efficiency element. The apoB mRNA editing complex exactly edits a single cytidine (C6666) of the 43-kilobase apoB pre-mRNA. Several sequence elements have been identified on the apoB mRNA that specify this precision. The mooring sequence and two efficiency elements have been shown to cooperatively increase editing in the apoB mRNA. This in vitro study shows that the mooring sequence and the 3′ efficiency element form a double-stranded stem that facilitates the recognition of the apoB mRNA by the editing complex (Fig. 6). We have constructed a model of the secondary structure of apoB mRNA in which C6666 is located in a single-stranded region upstream of the double-stranded helix. Thirty-one mammalian apoB mRNA sequences (Fig. 1) are predicted to position C6666two nucleotides upstream of the stem (Fig. 6). These apoB mRNAs are conserved immediately 5′ of the editing site and within the 3′ half of the 3′ efficiency element (Fig. 1). All 31 apoB mRNAs that are predicted to position C6666 two nucleotides upstream of the stem were efficiently edited in vitro (Fig. 2), whereas the guinea pig apoB mRNA was edited with low efficiency (Fig. 2). Guinea pig apoB mRNA has a mutation within the 3′ efficiency element that results in a 1-base pair extension of the double-stranded stem, positioning C6666 only one nucleotide upstream of the stem (Fig. 6). The extension of the double-stranded stem in the guinea pig apoB mRNA apparently decreases editing efficiency. Restoring the 2-nucleotide distance in the guinea pig apoB mRNA between C6666 and the stem resulted in editing efficiency comparable to that of the other apoB mRNAs (Figs. 3 and Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9). Single mutations in the 3′ efficiency element (U6743) that abolished base pairing with A6667 (GPM-C and GPM-A) were sufficient to enhance editing efficiency (Figs. 8 and 9). Furthermore, this increased editing efficiency was reversible by complementary substitutions at A6667 (GPM-G/C, GPM-U/A). These co-mutations restored base pairing between A6667 and U6743 and drastically decreased editing efficiency (Figs. 8and 9), emphasizing the negative influence of the extended stem on the editing efficiency of the guinea pig apoB mRNA. The current model for the apoB mRNA editing complex proposes that APOBEC-1 is a “head to toe” dimer (35Lau P.P. Zhu H.-J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, one active site of the APOBEC-1 dimer binds to C6666 and the second site binds to a downstream U in the 3′ end of the mooring sequence (19Shah R.R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N.

Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In our model of the secondary structure of apoB mRNA, C6666 is located in a single-stranded region of the apoB mRNA, suggesting that this is the preferential structure for the efficient access and deamination of C6666 by the apoB mRNA-editing complex (Fig. 10). We can speculate that the interaction of the second active site of the APOBEC-1 with the U in the 3′ end of the mooring sequence may also prefer a single-stranded or bulged U. In our model, the secondary structures of human and guinea pig apoB mRNA have a bulged U in the stem that could be used to position the APOBEC-1 dimer (Fig. 6). When the mooring sequence of the guinea pig apoB mRNA was mutated so that the bulged U was base paired, the editing efficiency decreased (Fig. 4). Recently, another model of the secondary structure of apoB mRNA was reported. Based on a much smaller sequence of apoB mRNA lacking the efficiency elements (24Richardson N. Navaratnam N. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31707-31717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this secondary structure model predicts a double-stranded stem between the mooring sequence and sequences directly upstream of C6666. Interestingly, this model locates C6666 two nucleotides upstream of a double-helix stem in a hairpin loop, similar to the positioning of C6666in our model. Because shorter apoB mRNAs are edited less efficiently than apoB mRNAs containing the 3′ efficiency element (15Nakamuta M. Tsai A. Chan L. Davidson N.O. Teng B.-B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Hersberger M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), this hairpin loop in the short apoB mRNAs may not be as efficient for editing as the double-stranded stem between the mooring sequence and the 3′ efficiency element. Therefore, the hairpin loop structure (24Richardson N. Navaratnam N. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31707-31717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) may reflect a structure unique to small apoB mRNAs. The guinea pig editing system poses a paradox. Greeve et al.(41Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-H. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the apoB mRNA in guinea pig intestine is edited about 95%; however, in vitro guinea pig apoB mRNA is edited with lower efficiency than apoB mRNAs from the 29 other mammals (Fig. 2). Our limited studies indicated that the guinea pig enterocyte S100 extract has a higher editing activity than the rabbit S100 extract (data not shown). Furthermore, the guinea pig extract also edited rabbit apoB mRNA more efficiently than rabbit extract, suggesting that there is not a species-specific auxiliary protein and that the guinea pig enterocyte S100 extract has a higher editing activity, which compensates for the lower editing efficiency of the guinea pig apoB mRNA. In summary, our results indicate that the mooring sequence and the 3′ efficiency element form a double-stranded helical stem that facilitates the editing of the apoB mRNA. Thirty-one mammalian apoB mRNA sequences are predicted to form this stem positioning C6666two nucleotides upstream of the double strand. However, the guinea pig apoB mRNA has lower editing efficiency, apparently because mutations in the 3′ efficiency element leads to a 1-nt extension of the stem so that C6666 is only 1 nt upstream of the double-stranded stem.

The transiently expressed switch mutant receptor displayed an altered pharmacological profile. The affinity of selective α1b-adrenergic receptor antagonists for the switch mutant (D125K/K331D) was no different from the wild-type α1b-adrenergic receptor, suggesting that both receptors are maintaining similar tertiary structures in the cell membrane. However, there was a significant 4–6-fold decrease in the affinity of protonated amine receptor agonists and a 3–6-fold increase in the affinity of carboxylated catechol derivatives for the switch mutant compared with the wild-type α1b-adrenergic receptor. This pharmacology is consistent with a reversed charge at position 125 in transmembrane domain three. Interestingly, the ability of either a negatively or positively charged agonist to generate soluble inositol phosphates was similar for both types of receptors. Finally, the switch mutant (D125K/K331D) displayed similar basal signaling activity as the wild-type receptor, reversing the constitutive activity of the single point mutations (D125K and K331D). This suggests an ionic constraint has been reformed in the switch mutant analogous to the restraint previously described for the wild-type α1b-adrenergic receptor.

DeYoung M.B. Perez D.M. Graham R.M. Shepherd J. Vatner S.F. The Autonomic Nervous System: The Nervous Control of the Heart. Harwood Academic Press, Amsterdam1996: 49-77Google Scholar). Adrenergic receptor subtypes (β1, β2, β3, α2a, α2b, α2c, α1a, α1b, and α1d) are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily typified by seven transmembrane spanning domains. We have postulated that part of the activation mechanism for α1-ARs paradigm those described for a related GPCR, rhodopsin. Two amino acids in rhodopsin, Glu-113 in transmembrane domain (TMD) three and Lys-296 which forms the protonated Schiff base with 11-cis-retinal in TMD seven, create a salt-bridge constraint that holds the rhodopsin receptor in a basal conformation (2Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukavsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Light-induced isomerization of retinal to the all transform disrupts this constraint and allows rhodopsin to adopt an active conformation that can signal through the G-protein, transducin. We have characterized a salt-bridge constraint mechanism of activation for α1-ARs that is analogous to the rhodopsin receptor system (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Specifically, a salt-bridge constraint is formed between Lys-331 in TMD seven and Asp-125 in TMD three of the α1b-AR that is required to partly maintain the inactive state of the receptor. Mutations that disrupt the charges of either residue result in constitutive activity, similar to analogous mutations obtained in rhodopsin. However, unlike the covalently bound retinal in rhodopsin, docking of the adrenergic receptor agonist establishes a competition between Lys-331 and the protonated amine of ligand for neutrality with Asp-125, resulting in salt-bridge breakage. Although salt-bridge disruption does not account for full receptor activation, we believe that it is an initial step in the process of receptor activation (4Porter J.E. Edelmann S.E. Waugh D.J. Piascik M.T. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This current study lends support to our molecular model of α1-AR activation by using site-directed mutagenesis to reverse the amino acids postulated in the salt-bridge constraint. This switch mutation (D125K/K331D) reversed the constitutive activity of the single receptor mutations (D125K or K331D) but, interestingly, was also equally activated as the WT receptor by either positively or negatively charged agonists. The pharmacological profile of this switch mutant was also reversed from the WT α1b-AR, displaying higher affinity for negatively charged agonists but lower affinity for positively charged agonists. The properties of this switch mutation strongly support our hypothesis of a salt-bridge constraint and its role in agonist-dependent initiation of the α1-AR activation process. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a M13mp19 hamster α1b-AR construct utilizing the oligonucleotide-mediated double primer method (5Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.63-15.65Google Scholar) and as described previously (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). DNA was purified and sequenced by the dideoxy method to verify the mutation. The mutated α1b-AR insert was removed from the phage M13mp19 vector then subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector, pMT2′. The full-length plasmid DNA was again sequenced to verify the mutation. COS-1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the transient transfection was performed as described previously using the DEAE-dextran method (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Total soluble inositol phosphate (IP) production was determined from COS-1 cells that were pre-labeled with [3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) for 16–24 h prior to the assay. On the assay day, these cultured cells were prepared as described previously (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In separate and more sensitive studies, basal measurements for phospholipase C-dependent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production were determined by a [3H]IP3 radioreceptor assay (DuPont) using the same pre-assay condition as described previously (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Receptor density was determined on separate but parallel plates from the same transfection experiment. Transfected COS-1 cell membranes were prepared as described previously (6Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacological profile of expressed α1b-ARs was determined by saturation and/or competition binding experiments using the selective α1-AR antagonist (±)-β-([125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyltetralone (125I-HEAT) as the radiolabel.

Ransnas L.A. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the method of Bradford (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). For each individual experiment, the fitted iterative non-linear regression curve that best represented the data was determined using a partial f-test (p < 0.05). Significance between groups was tested using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test (p < 0.05). All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. of N experiments, each performed in duplicate.

Recent studies have described a salt bridge constraint mechanism of activation for the rhodopsin receptor system involving amino acids Glu-113 and Lys-296 in TMDs three and seven of the receptor (2Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukavsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Constitutively active rhodopsin receptors generated by site-directed mutagenic disruption of the electrostatic interaction between these two amino acids were used to support this activation model. In further experiments, these amino acids were switched in a double mutation (E113K/K296E) of the rhodopsin receptor to substantiate this ionic constraint hypothesis. Results of these experiments were inconclusive. Regeneration of the ionic pair in the switch mutant reversed the constitutive activity of the single mutant K296E. However, functionality of the double and E113K mutations could not be verified because they could not reconstitute with the chromophore. This is because of the strict structural requirements for 11-cisretinal to covalently attach with Lys-296 suggesting that these mutants were misfolded or just incapable of attaching retinal (2Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukavsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To validate our α1b-AR salt-bridge constraint hypothesis, we used sight-directed mutagenesis to generate a double mutation of the wild type (WT) receptor. This mutant α1b-D125K/K331D-AR switches the amino acids that constitute the previously described receptor salt-bridge constraint (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, unlike the rhodopsin receptor system, there is no requirement for the adrenergic ligand to become covalently bound to form a functional α1-AR. This switch α1b-AR mutation could be transiently expressed on α1-AR negative COS-1 cell membranes at a level of 22 ± 4 fmol/mg of protein (data not shown). In addition, there were no differences in binding affinity of the competitive receptor antagonists 125I-HEAT, prazosin, or phentolamine for the switch mutation (110 ± 31 pm, 299 ± 99 pm, and 29 ± 20 nm, respectively; TableI) when compared with the WT α1b-AR (83 ± 10 pm, 243 ± 30 pm, and 36 ± 10 nm; Table I). A negative charge at position 125 on TMD three is thought to be important for agonist as well as antagonist affinity at β- and α2-ARs (9Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Competitive α1-AR antagonists are larger molecules when compared with epinephrine, although they may have common binding contacts with receptor agonists in the ligand binding pocket. Therefore, the Asp-125 binding contact may contribute less to the overall binding affinity of competitive α1-AR antagonists than for agonists. Alternately, Asp-125 may not participate in antagonist binding to the α1-ARs. For example, an α1b-D125A-AR mutant does not have a significantly different antagonist affinity value when compared with the WT receptor (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also characterized amino acid residues on the extracellular loop as α1-AR binding contacts for competitive receptor antagonists (10Zhao M.-M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular modeling suggests that competitive receptor antagonists may contact the α1-AR above or near the surface of the agonist binding pocket involving amino acid residues near the top of the TMD. Nevertheless, similarities in antagonist binding between WT and the switch mutant suggest that the overall tertiary structure of these two receptors is comparable.Table IEquilibrium dissociation binding constants for the WT and switch mutant α1b ARsWild-typeD125K/K331DAntagonists 125I-HEAT83 ± 10 pm110 ± 31 pm Prazosin243 ± 30 pm299 ± 99 pm Phentolamine36 ± 10 nm29 ± 20 nmAgonists Epinephrine1.4 ± 0.3 μm6.2 ± 0.7 μm* Phenylephrine12.9 ± 0.6 μm77.6 ± 1.5 μm* Oxymetazoline0.9 ± 0.2 μm5.0 ± 1.0 μm* 3-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)proprionic acid2.9 ± 0.9 mm0.5 ± 0.4 mm* 3-Methoxyphenyl acetic acid5.7 ± 1.4 mm1.9 ± 0.4 mm*K i values for the radiolabel, selective AR ligands and carboxylated catechol derivatives are calculated from binding curves generated from saturation or competition binding experiments.

An asterisk indicates significance (p < 0.05) from the WT α1b-AR. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. forN = 3–6 experiments performed in duplicate. In contrast, AR agonists such as epinephrine, phenylephrine, and oxymetazoline, which all contain a protonated amine (Fig.1), significantly (p < 0.05) displayed 4–6-fold decreases in affinity for the switch mutation (6.2 ± 0.7 μm, 77.6 ± 1.5 μm,and 5.0 ± 1.0 μm respectively; Table I) compared with WT α1b-AR (1.4 ± 0.3 μm, 12.9 ± 0.6 μm, and 0.9 ± 0.2 μm; Table I). Conversely, carboxylated catechol derivatives such as 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl) proprionic acid and 3-methoxyphenyl acetic acid (Fig. 1), which replace the protonated amine with an acid group, displayed a significant (p < 0.05) 3–6-fold higher binding affinity for the switch receptor mutation (0.5 ± 0.4 mm and 1.9 ± 0.4 mm, respectively; Table I) when compared with WT α1b-AR (2.9 ± 0.9 mm and 5.7 ± 1.4 mm; Table I). Although the carboxylated derivatives display poor overall binding affinity, they are not the exact cogners of epinephrine. Both derivatives have altered distances of the charged head group to the aromatic ring, a crucial feature of agonist binding affinity. However, regardless of the low affinity, the switched binding profile of the double mutant is consistent with a positively charged amino acid now substituted at position 125 in TMD three of the receptor. The degree of decreased affinity of protonated amine agonists (4–6-fold) for the switch mutant is consistent with agonist affinity losses (3–17-fold) for the D125A α1b-AR mutation (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We also examined the ability of these agonists to activate transiently expressed WT or switch mutant α1b-ARs. Demonstrating that the switch mutation is not signaling defective, both WT and switch mutant displayed a similar ability to invoke release of soluble IPs in a concentration-response to phenylephrine (Fig.2). While the maximum IP response of the switch mutant was not significantly different from the WT α1b-AR, the EC50 of phenylephrine for the switch mutation was significantly 10-fold lower (2.0 ± 0.8versus 0.2 ± 0.1 μm, p< 0.05) than the WT receptor. This lowered potency is consistent with the 6-fold decrease in affinity of phenylephrine for the switch mutation when compared with the WT α1b-AR. Low expression levels and the poor affinity of the carboxylated catechol derivatives for the switch α1b-AR mutation did not allow for the accurate generation of concentration-response curves in the presence of these ligands. However, when expression levels of WT α1b-AR were titrated to equivalent receptor densities as the switch mutation, a single ligand concentration that occupied at least 50% or greater of these transiently expressed receptors was used to increase soluble IPs in COS-1 cells (Fig.3). Interestingly, either charged agonist was able to significantly increase soluble IPs over basal. Furthermore, the extent of activation was comparable for both the WT and switch mutant receptor. These responses are specific because a blocking concentration of the selective α1-AR antagonist prazosin was able to inhibit the increase of soluble IPs for all ligands used in this study (Fig. 3). Although the binding affinity differences are no greater than 6-fold between the WT and switch α1b-AR mutation for these ligands, their ability to bind and activate both receptors suggests a plasticity of the agonist binding pocket. In consideration of a salt-bridge activation mechanism, these results are consistent in that either type of charge introduced by the ligand should break an ionic interaction in the receptor agonist binding pocket.Figure 3Agonist-dependent production of IP for the switch mutant and WT α1b AR . COS-1 cells (106 cells) transiently expressing the switch mutation or WT α1b-AR were stimulated with 5 mm 3-methoxyphenyl acetic acid (A), 5 mm 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)proprionic acid (P), or 5 mm phenylephrine (PE) in the absence or presence of 1 μm prazosin (Pz) to generate soluble IPs. Receptor expression levels were 54 ± 10 fmol/mg of membrane protein for the WT α1b-AR and 22 ± 4 fmol/mg of membrane protein for the D125K/K331D receptor mutation. For all conditions in the absence of prazosin, the amount of soluble IP generated was significantly greater than the basal response. Values are presented as the mean ± S.E. for n = 3 experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also investigated the basal signaling properties for the switch mutation, the WT α1b-AR and the individual mutations (D125K or K331D) that make up the double mutant. We have previously described the constitutive properties of the α1b-D125K-AR and an analogous K331E mutation (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The amount of agonist-independent production of IP3 was significantly greater (p < 0.05) for the D125K mutant (52.2 ± 3.0 pmol/fmol of receptor; Fig. 4) when compared with the WT α1b-AR (18.8 ± 1.8 pmol/fmol of receptor; Fig. 4). A similar 3-fold increase in basal IP3 production over the WT receptor was calculated for the newly characterized α1b-K331D-AR (55.2 ± 3.6 pmol/fmol; Fig. 4). Finally, when both single mutations were generated in the same receptor (switch mutation), the amount of agonist-independent IP3 produced (19.3 ± 2.1 pmol/fmol of receptor) is not significantly different (p > 0.05) from the WT α1b-AR (Fig. 4). Thus, the switch mutant reversed the constitutive activity of the single mutations. This data strongly suggests an interhelical electrostatic interaction has reformed between Lys-125 and Asp-331 that holds the switch mutant in a basal conformation similar to what has been previously described for the WT α1b-AR (3Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This manuscript characterizes a switch mutation of the α1b-AR in which the amino acids of a postulated ionic constraint for the WT receptor have been reversed. This switch mutant receptor has comparable characteristics to the WT α1b-AR (i.e. affinity for receptor antagonists, basal production of IP3, and agonist-induced activation), suggesting that the overall tertiary structure and function of these receptors in the membrane bilayer is similar. However, there are distinct differences in the pharmacological properties of the agonist binding pocket between the switch mutant and the WT receptor. Interestingly, both WT and the switch receptor mutation are bound to and activated by either catecholamines or carboxylated catechol derivatives, suggesting some flexibility in the docking of agonists in α1-AR binding pocket. This is in contrast to the more stringent structural requirements of the opsin receptor ligand binding pocket for reacting with 11-cis-retinal to generate rhodopsin although alterations in the chromophores length and ability to form a Schiff's base has been shown to generate viable rhodopsin receptors with limited ability to activate transducin (11Zhukavsky E.A. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Science. 1991; 251: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Daemen F.J.M. Nature. 1978; 276: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability to activate the switch mutant or WT α1b-AR should be dependent on the effectiveness of a ligand to compete for the appropriate counterion that forms the ionic constraint of the receptor. Therefore, it is not unexpected to observe activation of the WT or switch mutant α1b-AR by phenylephrine or carboxylated catechol ligands, even though the orientation of the charged ligand to the salt-bridge constraint on the receptor may not be optimal in some combinations. This is evident in the reduced potency of phenylephrine to generate soluble IPs mediated by the switch α1b-AR mutation. If we were able to accurately generate a concentration-response curve for the carboxylated catechol derivatives, predicted changes in potency that correlated to binding affinity differences would likely have become apparent. Although Asp-125 is a highly conserved amino acid in biogenic amine receptors, evidence for the conservation of this mechanism to other family members is still unresolved. Previous mutation of Asp-113 in the β2-AR resulted in a dramatic loss of agonist and antagonist affinity (13Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Hill W.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10267-10271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor was still capable of signaling although at reduced potency. The constitutive behavior of this mutation was not explored at that time because of the field's lack of knowledge for active state receptors. Analysis is also complicated because of the poor expression of these mutations and the endogenous expression of β-ARs in most cell types. Mutations of Asp-113 in the α2a-AR also resulted in a similar phenotype to the β2-AR (14Wang C-D. Buck M.A. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 168-179PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent β2-AR work in which a histidine replaced Asp-113 in TMD three and a cysteine replaced Asn-312 in TMD seven, followed by chelation with zinc, resulted in a constitutive phenotype (15Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Hoist B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The altered distance between these two helices introduced by the zinc is thought to be responsible for the active state stabilization of this mutant β2-AR. This suggests that these two helices and/or residues are linked in the WT β2-AR activation process. Analogous amino acids in the δ opioid receptor have also generated constitutively active receptors with mutations at Asp-128 in TMD three and Tyr-308 in TMD seven (16Befort K. Zilliox C. Filliol D. Yue S. Kieffer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18574-18581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these two residues participate in hydrogen bonding forming a constraint similar to our salt-bridge hypothesis for the α1b-AR. This suggests that similar constraining paradigms may be part of a universal activation mechanism among GPCRs. To summarize, disruption of this ionic constraint has been suggested to be an initial but partial event that is required for full activation of the WT α1-AR (4Porter J.E. Edelmann S.E. Waugh D.J. Piascik M.T. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, pH-dependent binding studies resulting in pK a shifts for the WT and Lys-331 mutations have implied that Asp-125 and Lys-331 are in close proximity to each other in the unbound WT α1b-AR. 2J. E. Porter and D. M. Perez (1999)J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., in press. Finally, reversing the constitutive properties of D125K and K331D by combining these mutations in a single receptor and activation of this switch mutant by either type of charged agonist strongly supports our original hypothesis for a salt-bridge constraint holding the WT α1b-AR in a basal conformation (3Porter J.E.

PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 and IκB, resulting in a global inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of NFκB, respectively (5Samuel C.E. J. Biol.

Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The cellular machinery for recognition of dsRNA has come under increasingly close scrutiny. Structured viral RNAs, such as the adenovirus virus-associated (VA) RNAII, are recognized by cellular dsRNA-binding proteins such as RNA helicase A, the NF90·NF45 dimer, and other less well defined factors (8Liao H.J. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The components of the dsRNA recognition apparatus and their functions are poorly characterized, although some of them carry one or more copies of a conserved dsRNA-binding motif (9St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the NF90 protein carries two copies of this motif, it also binds to a DNA element found in the interleukin-2 promoter (10Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J.

Sera from patients or mice with systemic autoimmune diseases have been instrumental in defining the function of the proteins associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (12Lerner M.R.

In the present study autoantibodies specific for a family of dsRNA-binding factors, including those implicated in VA RNAII binding, were identified. Interactions between these factors were characterized along with their nucleic acid binding properties. Four-week-old female SJL/J, A.SW, B10.S, C57BL/10 (B10), BALB/c ByJ, BALB.B, BALB.K, C57BL/6J (B6), and B6H2k mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed conventionally. Additional B6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). At 10 weeks of age, 5–20 mice/strain were injected with 0.5 ml of pristane intraperitoneal or with an equal volume of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control. Sera were collected from the tail vein before injection, at 2 and 4 weeks afterward and at 1-month intervals thereafter. Sera from DBA/1 mice 6 months after pristane treatment were a gift of Dr. Paul H. Wooley (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). Autoantibodies to cellular proteins in murine and human sera were analyzed by immunoprecipitation of 35S-radiolabeled K562 cell extract using 3 μl of murine serum/sample as described (14Satoh M. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Specificity was confirmed using human anti-nRNP/Sm, Su, and ribosomal P reference sera. IgG from 10 μl of human serum YM was cross-linked to 50 μl (v/v) of protein A-Sepharose beads with dimethyl pimelimidate as described (15Satoh M. Langdon J.J. Hamilton K.J. Richards H.B. Panka D. Eisenberg R.A. Reeves W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). K562 cells were sonicated in NET/Nonidet P-40 (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at a concentration of 4 × 107/ml and cleared by centrifugation. Cell extract from 108 cells was incubated with patient YM IgG-protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The p130, p110, p90, and p45 antigens were affinity-purified, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Strips were probed with sera from pristane or PBS-treated mice, human autoimmune sera, or normal human serum (1:2000 dilution). They then were incubated with 1:3000 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-human IgG (γ-chain-specific, Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) and developed using the Western-Star chemiluminescent system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). To verify the identities of the antigens, proteins immunoprecipitated by human sera YM and EB were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with serum from a pristane-treated B6 mouse containing antibodies to p110, p90, and p45 or with PBS-treated mouse serum. In addition, strips were probed with serial B6 or B10.S sera obtained 1–6 months after pristane treatment to examine the onset of autoantibody production. The p130, p110, p90, and p45 proteins were affinity-purified from K562 cell extract using human autoimmune serum, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter as above. After Ponceau red staining, the p130, p110, p90, and p45 bands and unrelated areas were cut from the filter. Strips were incubated with 2 ml of 1:1000 B6 or B10.S sera for 1 h at 22 °C and washed with TBS-Tween 20 (20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Bound antibodies were eluted twice with 300 μl of 50 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.9. After adjusting the pH to 7.5 with 0.2m Na2HPO4, affinity-purified antibodies were used to reprobe strips with bound p130, p110, p90, and p45. The p130, p110, p90, and p45 proteins from K562 cell extract were affinity-purified with human serum bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (see above), fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 40% methanol and destained with 50% methanol, and the proteins were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing using a Perkin-Elmer/ABI Procise model 492 protein/peptide sequencer (University of North Carolina/Program in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Micro Protein Chemistry Facility). Proteins exhibiting homology with the N-terminal sequences were identified using the NCBI advanced BLAST algorithm for the GenBankTM Data Base. Full-length recombinant NF45 and NF90 with N-terminal 6-histidine tags were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel chelate affinity column as described (10Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G.

The wells of microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Naperville, IL) were coated with 50 μl of 2 μg/ml of purified recombinant NF45 or NF90 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed with NET/Nonidet P-40 and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in NET/Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 22 °C followed by incubation with 100 μl of 1:500 mouse serum in blocking buffer for 2 h. Wells were washed with NET/Nonidet P-40, incubated with 100 μl of 1:1000 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 2 h, and developed. 120 μl (50% v/v) of poly(IC)-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), ssDNA cellulose, or dsDNA cellulose (Sigma) in TBS-Tween 20 plus 3 mmMgCl2 was washed three times with starting buffer. The matrix was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with cell extract from 107 [35S]methionine-labeled K562 cells in starting buffer plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin and then washed six times with 1 ml TBS-Tween 20 + 3 mmMgCl2. Proteins were eluted with 600 μl of 1.5m NaCl NET/Nonidet P-40 for 20 min at 4 °C. The eluate was spun three times in a microcentrifuge for 5 s, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and adjusted to a final concentration 0.75 m NaCl. The eluate was immunoprecipitated (30 min at 4 °C) with 5 μl of human autoimmune serum YM containing anti-NF45·NF90, anti-Ku + nRNP/Sm, or normal human serum, washed three times with 0.5 m NaCl NET/Nonidet P-40, and washed once with NET before analyzing by SDS-PAGE. A microtiter plate was coated with 50 μl of 0.5 μg/ml recombinant NF90 or NF45 at 4 °C for 14 h. Wells were washed twice with TBS-Tween 20 plus 3 mmMgCl2 and blocked for 1 h with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in the same buffer. Wells coated with NF90 or NF45 were incubated for 3 h at 22 °C with single-stranded (ss) DNA (from calf thymus, Sigma) or poly(IC) (Sigma) at a concentration of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 μg/ml in PBS + 3 mmMgCl2 or with buffer alone. Wells were washed three times with TBS-Tween 20 + 3 mm MgCl2, incubated with murine or human autoimmune sera (1:500–1:10,000) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin TBS-Tween 20, 3 mm MgCl2, and washed three times with TBS-Tween 20. Wells were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (γ-chain-specific, 1:1000) and developed using Sigma 104 substrate. Inhibition was calculated as follows: [(A 405 of wells incubated with buffer alone − A 405 of wells incubated with ssDNA or poly(IC)) ÷ A 405 of wells incubated with buffer alone] × 100. Sera from mice treated with pristane contain autoantibodies against antigens recognized by human systemic lupus erythematosus sera (14Satoh M. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Satoh M. Hamilton K.J. Ajmani A.K. Dong X. Wang J. Kanwar Y.S. Reeves W.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3200-3206PubMed Google Scholar). Some are RNA-associated proteins, such as the components of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. In the present study, we investigated a novel set of proteins recognized by sera from pristane-treated mice and certain human autoimmune sera. These proteins included some of the major proteins bound by VA RNAII, indicating that dsRNA-binding proteins are a novel group of autoantigens. When sera from various strains of pristane-treated mice were tested at 6 months, some B6 (Fig. 1, lanes 4–7) and B10.S (lanes 8 and 9) mouse sera immunoprecipitated a set of 130-, 110-, 90-, 80-, and 45-kDa proteins. Normal mouse serum (lane 10) did not. Out of 31 B6 mice treated with pristane, nine (29%) had this specificity. Among these, four also had anti-nRNP/Sm, two had anti-ribosomal P, and one had anti-Su antibodies. Two of six pristane-treated B10.S mice had this specificity, both with co-existing anti-ribosomal P and anti-Su antibodies. These proteins were not immunoprecipitated by sera from A.SW, BALB/c ByJ, or SJL/J mice, despite the high frequencies of anti-nRNP/Sm, Su, or ribosomal P antibodies reported previously in these strains (14Satoh M. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Satoh M. Hamilton K.J. Ajmani A.K. Dong X. Wang J. Kanwar Y.S. Reeves W.H. J.

Two human autoimmune sera immunoprecipitated a similar set of proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2), whereas normal human serum (lane 3) did not. The serum used in lane 1was from EB, an Afro-Caribbean patient with systemic lupus erythematosus-rheumatoid arthritis overlap syndrome, and the serum inlane 2 was from YM, a Japanese patient with scleroderma. All sera with this specificity immunoprecipitated proteins of ∼130, 110, 90, 80, and 45 kDa with the exception of EB (lane 1), which did not immunoprecipitate the 130- or 80-kDa polypeptides clearly. The relative intensities of p110, p90, and p45 immunoprecipitated by all sera except EB were comparable. The stronger p90 signal using EB serum was found to be due to the immunoprecipitation of two proteins migrating at ∼90 kDa. Using different gel conditions, the two ∼90-kDa bands immunoprecipitated by EB serum could be resolved (not shown). The relationship of the proteins immunoprecipitated by sera from patients EB and YM to those recognized by sera from B6 or B10.S mice was investigated by Western blotting. The p130, p110, p90, and p45 proteins were affinity-purified using patient YM IgG-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Fig.2 A). Blots were probed with sera from pristane-treated B6 (lanes a–i) or B10.S (lanes j and k) mice or with sera from PBS-treated B6 mice (lanes l and m). Additional strips were probed with EB and YM sera (lanes 1 and2, respectively), or normal human serum (lane 3). All sera from pristane-treated mice that immunoprecipitated p130, p110, p90, p80, and p45 recognized p110 and p90 by Western blot (lanes a–i). Many sera also reacted weakly with p130 and some recognized p80 (lanes a and h) or p45 as well (lanes a and k). In contrast, the human sera were poorly reactive on immunoblotting. EB serum (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) did not recognize any of the proteins in Western blot, whereas YM serum reacted weakly with p45. However, unlike the murine sera, it did not react with p110 or p90 (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Thus, human autoantibodies recognized mainly native conformational epitopes. The identity of the antigens recognized by the human and murine sera was further verified by immunoprecipitating K562 extract with patient EB or YM serum (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and2, respectively) or with normal human serum (lane 3) followed by immunoblotting. Blots were probed with sera from a B6 mouse with anti-p110 and p90 (Fig. 2 B, panel a), from a B10.S mouse with anti-p110, p90, and p45 (panel b), or from a PBS-treated B6 mouse (panel c). Mouse sera with antibodies to p110, p90, and/or p45 recognized proteins of the same size that were immunoprecipitated by human autoimmune sera EB and YM, confirming that the proteins recognized by the human and murine autoimmune sera were the same. To identify the proteins recognized by the human and murine autoimmune sera, N-terminal sequences were obtained from p110 and p90 affinity-purified on patient YM IgG-protein A-Sepharose. The p110 and p90 proteins had identical N-terminal amino acid sequences: PMRIFVND. A homology search identified two proteins with the same N-terminal sequence: M phase phosphoprotein 4 (MPP4) and nuclear factor (NF) 90 (Fig.3). A homologue of MPP4,Xenopus double-stranded (ds) RNA-binding protein, matched the N-terminal sequence of p110 and p90 at 7 of 8 positions. The p90 protein was identified as NF90 on the basis of several criteria: 1) the sizes were similar, 2) N-terminal amino acid sequences were identical, 3) sera from rabbits immunized with NF90 recognized p90 on Western blots (not shown), and 4) autoimmune sera with anti-p90 recognized recombinant NF90 (see Fig. 6).Figure 6Autoantibodies to p110 and p90 are cross-reactive. The p130, p110, p90, and p45 proteins were affinity-purified, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. After staining with Ponceau red, bands at 130, 110, 90, and 45 kDa and an unrelated area of the blot were cut out of the membrane. The individual protein bands were incubated with autoimmune serum, and bound antibodies were affinity-purified and used to reprobe strips of the original blot. Affinity-purified antibodies to p110 (lanes 3) and p90 (lanes 4) bound to both p110 and p90, suggesting that these antibodies are cross-reactive.Panel a, serum from a pristane-treated B6 mouse. Panel b, serum from a B10.S mouse treated with pristane. Individual lanes were probed with the following: lane 1, starting serum (without affinity purification); lane 2, antibodies affinity-purified from p130; lane 3, antibodies affinity-purified from p110; lane 4, antibodies affinity-purified from p90; lane 5, antibodies affinity-purified from p45; lane 6, antibodies affinity-purified from irrelevant region of the blot; lane 7, serum from a PBS-treated mouse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the N-terminal sequence could not be obtained, possibly because of a blocked N terminus, p45 was identified as NF45 on the basis of similar sizes and its physical association with NF90. NF90 and p45 co-migrated on sucrose gradients, suggesting that they are physically associated, and NF90 could be co-immunoprecipitated by affinity-purified anti-p45 antibodies (not shown). Finally, serum from a rabbit immunized with NF45 recognized p45 on immunoblots and the murine autoimmune sera containing anti-p45 antibodies were reactive with recombinant NF45 on Western blots (see Fig. 6). On the basis of the biochemical and immunological data, we conclude that p90 and p45 are NF90 and NF45, respectively. The identity of the 110-kDa protein is less certain. Autoantibodies affinity purified from p90 cross-reacted with p110, and serum from a rabbit immunized with NF90 recognized the 90- and 110-kDa proteins immunoprecipitated by the human and murine autoimmune sera (not shown). The 110-kDa protein could be MPP4 (17Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which was found to share an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence with NF90 by aligning the sequences using the BLAST programs. The reported partial sequences of MPP4 are nearly identical with NF90. MPP4 is recognized by monoclonal antibodies specific for the phosphorylated sites of proteins (17Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and is a nuclear protein phosphorylated in M phase thought to be a human homologue of XenopusdsRNA-binding protein. Alternatively, p110 could be an extended form or precursor of NF90 (see “Discussion”). The p130 and p80 polypeptides co-purified with NF45·NF90 on a poly(IC)-agarose column and may be related to NF45·NF90 (see Fig. 7). It is possible that p80 is a degradation product of p130, p110, or NF90. However, p130 and p80 are unlikely to form a stable complex with NF45·NF90 because patient EB serum did not co-immunoprecipitate p130 or p80 (Fig. 1). The data shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 suggested that the production of autoantibodies to p130, p110, p90 (NF90), and p45 (NF45) was tightly linked. For this reason, we investigated the time course of autoantibody production by Western blot in sera obtained sequentially from pristane-treated mice (Fig. 4). Affinity-purified antigens were probed with sera obtained 1–6 months after pristane treatment of B6 (panels A–D) or B10.S mice (panels E and F). Antibodies to p110 and NF90 always developed simultaneously between 2–5 months. Some sera also recognized NF45 (panels A and F) or p130 (panel E). In the B6 mouse illustrated in panel A, antibodies to NF90 and p110 were detected at 3 months, whereas antibodies to NF45 did not appear until 5 months after pristane treatment. The time course also was investigated by immunoprecipitation using serial sera from these mice. NF90, NF45, and p110 usually appeared in the immunoprecipitates at the same time. However, occasionally p110 and NF45 were immunoprecipitated before immunoprecipitation of NF90 was apparent (Fig. 5 A). Sera from this B10.S mouse immunoprecipitated p110 plus NF45 at 3 months, followed by an increased amount of NF45 plus NF90 at 4 months. At 5 months, the mouse developed autoantibodies against p130. This suggested that NF45 bound both p110 and NF90, a possibility that was investigated further by using rabbit antiserum against NF45. As shown in Fig.5 B, anti-NF45 antiserum (lane R45) co-immunoprecipitated both NF90 and p110, further suggesting that NF90·NF45 and p110·NF45 dimers may exist. In contrast, p130 was not co-immunoprecipitated by anti-NF45, suggesting that it did not form a stable complex with NF45. This interpretation also was supported by the fact that p130 could be eluted from poly(IC)-agarose by 0.5m NaCl, whereas NF90, NF45, and p110 were eluted only at higher salt concentrations (not shown). Because the results of the co-immunoprecipitation studies could be compatible with immunological cross-reactivity between NF45 and other proteins, the specificities of anti-NF45, NF90, and p110 autoantibodies also were examined by Western blot. Sera from a pristane-treated B6 mouse (Fig. 6,panel a, lane 1) or from a B10.S mouse (panel b, lane 1) recognized both p110 and NF90 in Western blot assays. Affinity-purified anti-p110 and anti-NF90 from the sera bound to both p110 and NF90 (lanes 3 and4, respectively), suggesting that these autoantibodies were cross-reactive. The signal from affinity-purified anti-NF45 (panel b, lane 5) was weak under these conditions but apparently specific for NF45. Thus, immunological cross-reactivity is likely to explain the simultaneous onset of anti-NF90 and anti-p110 autoantibodies in many sera. These data also lend further support to the idea that NF45 forms a complex with NF90 and with p110. NF45·NF90 complexes bind to dsRNA as well as DNA. NF90 has two copies of a dsRNA-binding motif, binds dsRNA strongly, and interacts selectively with the adenoviral VA RNAII, suggesting that it could play a role in regulating the activity of certain highly structured RNAs along with its proposed role as a DNA-binding protein (10Kao P.N.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The nucleic acid binding properties of proteins recognized by the human and murine autoimmune sera were examined. Proteins from K562 cell extract were absorbed to dsRNA (poly(IC)-agarose), ssDNA, or dsDNA cellulose, eluted with salt, and immunoprecipitated with autoimmune sera. Immunoprecipitation with human serum YM (anti-NF45·NF90) is shown in lane 1 of each panel. Lanes 2 and3 show immunoprecipitations with human anti-Ku plus anti-nRNP/Sm serum or normal human serum, respectively. NF45·NF90 complexes were detected in eluates from poly(IC)-agarose as reported previously (8Liao H.J. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as well as in eluates from ssDNA and dsDNA cellulose (Fig. 7, lanes 1). The Ku (p70·p80) complex, which binds to ends of dsDNA or single to double strand transitions, but not RNA, was used as a specificity control (lanes 2). Consistent with previous observations (reviewed in Ref. 19Reeves W.H. Wang J. Ajmani A.K. Stojanov L. Satoh M. Zanetti M. Capra J.D. The Antibodies. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1997: 33-84Google Scholar), Ku antigen was detected in eluates from ssDNA and dsDNA cellulose. However, it was not present in the eluates from poly(IC)-agarose. Another control antigen, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, could be detected readily in the unfractionated extract (left panel, see U1-A protein) but was not present in eluates from any of the three affinity matrices. Thus, binding of the NF45·NF90 complex to dsRNA as well as ssDNA and dsDNA was confirmed. The p130 and p80 proteins also were eluted from poly(IC)-agarose. Although there was evidence that p130 interacts with ssDNA and dsDNA, we cannot be certain whether this protein binds DNA or dsRNA independently or because of an interaction with NF45·NF90. The nucleic acid-binding site of Ku antigen is a target of autoantibodies (20Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because the NF45·NF90 dimer binds to dsRNA as well as DNA, we examined whether nucleic acid binding could block autoantibody recognition. The binding of antibodies to NF90 in two B6 mouse sera (Fig. 8, A andB) was inhibited by poly(IC) in a dose-dependent manner, but only weakly by ssDNA. The binding of other sera to NF90 was inhibited by both poly(IC) and ssDNA or by ssDNA alone (Figs. 8,C and D). Neither ssDNA nor poly(IC) inhibited binding to NF45, suggesting that NF45 does not bind nucleic acids by itself or that the nucleic acid-binding site is not recognized by autoantibodies. Of the 11 anti-NF90·NF45 positive sera from pristane-treated mice tested, the binding of four to NF90 was inhibited >10% by ssDNA (Fig. 8 C, left). In contrast, the binding of these sera to NF45 was not inhibited by ssDNA (Fig.8 C, right). Poly(IC) inhibited the binding of 7/11 sera by >10%. Although both ssDNA and poly(IC) inhibited the binding of many sera, in some cases only one of the two nucleic acids inhibited (Fig. 8 D). In the case of human autoimmune serum YM, only poly(IC) inhibited binding to NF90. These data suggest that the DNA and dsRNA-binding sites of NF90 are not identical. Moreover, anti-NF90 autoantibodies recognized epitope(s) near the DNA- and dsRNA-binding sites, consistent with the idea that autoantibodies often recognize functional sites (21Chan E.K. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1627-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNA is a signature of viral infection, and host cells have evolved defense mechanisms for detecting and responding to it. Several dsRNA-binding proteins, some sharing a conserved dsRNA-binding motif, have been identified (9St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that prominent dsRNA-binding proteins of 130, 110, 90 (NF90), 80, and 45 (NF45) kDa are recognized by human and murine autoantibodies. Biochemical studies suggest that at least some these proteins are phy"

We previously cloned the cDNA sequence to murine mitochondrial GPAT (Yet, S-F., Lee, S., Hahm, Y. T., and Sul, H.S. (1993) <i>Biochemistry</i> 32, 9486–9491). We expressed the protein in insect cells which was targeted to mitochondria, purified, and reconstituted mitochondrial GPAT activity using phospholipids (Yet, S.-F., Moon, Y., and Sul, H. S. (1995) <i>Biochemistry</i> 34, 7303–7310). Deletion of the seven amino acids from mitochondrial GPAT,<sup>312</sup>IFLEGTR<sup>318</sup>, which is highly conserved among acyltransferases in glycerolipid biosynthesis, drastically reduced mitochondrial GPAT activity. Treatment of mitochondrial GPAT with arginine-modifying agents, phenylglyoxal and cyclohexanedione, inactivated the enzyme. Two highly conserved arginine residues, Arg-318, in the seven amino stretch, and Arg-278, were identified. Substitution of Arg-318 with either alanine, histidine, or lysine reduced the mitochondrial GPAT activity by over 90%. On the other hand, although substitution of Arg-278 with alanine and histidine decreased mitochondrial GPAT activity by 90%, replacement with lysine reduced activity by only 25%. A substitution of the nonconserved Arg-279 with either alanine, histidine, or lysine did not alter mitochondrial GPAT activity. Moreover, R278K mitochondrial GPAT still showed sensitivity to arginine-modifying agents, as in the case of wild-type mitochondrial GPAT. These results suggest that Arg-318 may be critical for mitochondrial GPAT activity, whereas Arg-278 can be replaced by a basic amino acid. Examination of the other conserved residues in the seven amino acid stretch revealed that Phe-313 and Glu-315 are also important, but conservative substitutions can partially maintain activity; substitution with alanine reduced activity by 83 and 72%, respectively, whereas substituting Phe-313 with tyrosine and Glu-315 with glutamine had even lesser effect. In addition, there was no change in fatty acyl-CoA selectivity. Kinetic analysis of the R318K and R318A mitochondrial GPAT showed an 89 and 95%, respectively, decrease in catalytic efficiency but no major change in substrate binding as indicated by the <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub>values for palmitoyl-CoA and glycerol 3-phosphate. These studies indicate importance of the conserved seven amino acid stretch for mitochondrial GPAT activity and the significance of Arg-318 for catalysis."

A similar growth inhibition is seen when protein kinase C is activated through addition of phorbol myristate acetate. This inhibition is due to an arrest of cell cycle progression in G1 combined with an induction of apoptosis. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which these stimuli induce inhibition of proliferation in Jurkat and H9 leukemic T cell lines. We show that expression of cyclin D3 is reduced by each of these stimuli, resulting in a concomitant reduction in cyclin D-associated kinase activity. This reduction in cyclin D3-expression is crucial to the observed G1 arrest, since ectopic expression of cyclin D3 can abrogate the G1 arrest seen with each of these stimuli. Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D3 also prevents the induction of programmed cell death by phorbol myristate acetate and T-cell receptor activation, leading us to conclude that cyclin D3 not only plays a crucial role in progression through the G1 phase, but is also involved in regulating apoptosis of T cells.

The combination of these stimuli enables the resting lymphocytes to exit G0 and proliferate. Remarkably, stimulation of the same TCR in T cells that are actively proliferating results in cessation of proliferation and subsequent apoptosis (2Smith C.A. Williams G.I. Kingston R. Jenkinson E.J.

This indicates that the signals from the activated TCR complex can affect cell proliferation very differently, depending on the proliferative state of the T cell. Cell cycle progression from G0 to S phase in normal T cells requires the induction of the D-type cyclins (9Ando K. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9571-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These cyclins are not expressed in resting T cells, but are induced upon activation of the TCR complex (10Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three D-type cyclins have been identified, of which cyclins D2 and D3 are predominantly expressed in T cells (11Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell.

Cyclin D2 and D3 can form an active kinase complex with the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4 or cdk6, and the resulting kinase complexes are involved in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (11Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 13Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J-Y. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of pRb results in its functional inactivation and allows progression of the cell through the late G1 restriction point and subsequent entry into S phase (reviewed in Ref. 14Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). However, cyclin D-cdk complexes are able to phosphorylate pRb only partially and complete phosphorylation and functional inactivation of pRb requires additional phosphorylation by cyclin E-cdk2 complexes (15Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Although cyclin D- and cyclin E-cdk complexes seem to phosphorylate overlapping sites in pRb, it has been demonstrated that some sites, such as Ser780, are only phosphorylated by cyclin D-cdk complexes (16Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H-K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J-Y. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Induction of cyclin D expression alone is not sufficient to drive resting T cells into S phase. This is due to the fact that resting T cells express abundant amounts of the cdk inhibitor p27kip1, that associates to the formed cyclin D-cdk complexes and inhibits their kinase activity (17Firpo E.J. Koff A. Solomon M.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Expression of p27kip1 is down-regulated as T cells progress through G1, but this process requires the presence of a co-stimulatory signal supplied by IL-2 (17Firpo E.J. Koff A. Solomon M.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M-H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Thus, only the combination of TCR activation and costimulation with IL-2 allows for the formation of active cyclin D-cdk complexes and initiation of DNA replication. Down-regulation of p27kip1 in normal T cells can be prevented by immunosuppressive agents such as rapamycin and cyclosporin, but also by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels (18Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M-H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 19Kato J.M. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). As such these agents can prevent the appearance of active cyclin D-cdk complexes and suppress the proliferation of immunoreactive T cells. As mentioned above, the effect of TCR activation in actively proliferating T cells is dramatically different from that observed in resting T cells. In proliferating T cells, including leukemic T cells, engagement of the TCR complex results in a cell cycle arrest in G1 and TCR antigen-induced cell death (AID) (2Smith C.A. Williams G.I. Kingston R. Jenkinson E.J. Owen J.J.T. Nature. 1989; 337: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 3Jones L.A. Chin L.T. Longo D.L. Kruisbeek A.M.

Maecker H.T. Levy R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such T cell activation can be mimicked by directly activating one of the downstream signaling pathways of the TCR complex. For example, activation of protein kinase C by adding PMA, either alone or in combination with calcium ionophores can cause growth inhibition and apoptosis in Jurkat T cells (2Smith C.A. Williams G.I. Kingston R. Jenkinson E.J. Owen J.J.T. Nature. 1989; 337: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 20Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J.

AID was recently shown to occur from a late G1 checkpoint in a Rb-dependent fashion (22Lissy N.A. Van Dyk L.F. Becker-Hapak M. Vocero-Akbani A. Mendler J.H. Dowdy S.F. Immunity. 1998; 8: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion is the finding that cyclin D3 is down-regulated by activation of the TCR in a T cell hybridoma (23Miyatake S. Nakano H. Park S.Y. Yamazaki T. Takase K. Matsushime H. Kato A. Saito T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which leukemic T cell lines arrest in G1 has not been elucidated. Therefore, we set out to investigate the effect of TCR activation on the expression and activity of a variety of cell cycle regulatory proteins known to be involved in progression through G1. In this report we show that TCR activation in Jurkat or H9 leukemic T cells results in a G1 arrest, associated with hypophosphorylated pRb. We show that expression of cyclin D3 is down-regulated in these cells, resulting in loss of phosphorylation of the Ser780residue on pRb. Very similar effects are seen upon stimulation with PMA. More importantly, ectopic expression of cyclin D3 cannot only overcome the growth inhibition induced by these stimuli, but also prevents the induction of apoptosis in response to these stimuli. This indicates that down-regulation of cyclin D3 is crucial to both the proliferative arrest as well as the induction of apoptosis seen with these stimulatory agents. Jurkat (E6.1, ATCC) and H9 (a kind gift of Dr. J.P. Medema, Leiden University) leukemic T cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), l-glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 and anti-CD4 mAb OKT4 (isotype control) were purified from hybridoma culture supernatant using protein A-Sepharose columns, anti-CD3 mAb UCHT-1 and anti-pRb (G3–245) were obtained from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany), anti-p27kip1 (clone 57) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), anti-cyclin D3 (Ab-2) from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), anti-cdk2 (M2) and anti-cyclin E (HE-12 for immunoblotting, HE-111 for immunoprecipitation and in vitrokinase activity) were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Ser780 was a kind gift of Dr. M. Kitagawa (16Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H-K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J-Y. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and anti-cyclin D2 (DCS-5) (24Lukas J. Bartkova J. Welcker M. Petersen O.W. Peters G. Strauss M. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2125-2134PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. J. Lukas (Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark). Propidium iodide was purchased from Sigma and protein A/G-Sepharose beads from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For treatment with anti-CD3 mAbs or anti-CD4 mAb, tissue culture plates (96- or 12-well) were coated overnight at room temperature with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 (OKT3 or UCHT-1) or 10 μg/ml anti-CD4 (OKT4), respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Control plates were treated overnight with PBS without any added mAbs. The coating solution was aspirated the next day and plates were washed three times with PBS. Plates were then immediately used for cell stimulation. For stimulation with PMA, cells were plated in the presence of 50 nm PMA. All cells were cultured in flasks in fresh medium at a density of 2 × 105cells/ml at 24 h prior to cell stimulation, to ensure that they were exponentially growing at the time of stimulation. Cells were then counted the next day and replated in the presence or absence of the different stimuli at 2 × 105 cells/ml. For analysis of cell cycle distribution, anti-CD3- or PMA-stimulated cells were collected at the indicated time points and washed with ice-cold PBS, after which they were fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were stained with propidium iodide as described (25Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A.J. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cell cycle profiles were determined using a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using Cell Quest software. To determine [3H]thymidine incorporation, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well plates and cultured for the indicated times in the presence of the indicated stimuli. 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was then added to each well, and cells were cultured for another 2 h. Cells were harvested and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in a scintillation counter. Cell viability after stimulation was determined by staining whole cells with propidium iodide, followed by flow cytometric analysis on a FACScalibur using Cell Quest software. Jurkat T cells were transfected by electroporation with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 260 V, 960 microfarads. For analysis of cell cycle profiles cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV.EGFP-spectrin (a kind gift of Dr. T. Shenk and Dr. A. J. Beavis) (26Kaletja R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in combination with 20 μg of an expression vector for human cyclin D3 (pRcCMV-cyclin D3, a kind gift of Dr. P. Hinds, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). One day after transfection, viable cells were isolated by standard gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cell suspension was then brought to a concentration of 2 × 105 viable cells/ml and used for stimulation in 12-well tissue culture plates. 24 h after stimulation cells were prepared for, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described (27Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 91: 6289-6293Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To obtain Jurkat T cells stably expressing cyclin D3 the pRcCMV-cyclin D3 construct was introduced in Jurkat cells by electroporation and 2 days later the medium was changed to RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mg/ml G418. Clonal lines were obtained by limiting dilution resulting in the isolation of JD3-I and JD3-II. After stimulation, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in ELB lysis buffer (25Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A.J. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined and equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-cyclin E or anti-cdk2 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then used for in vitro kinase assays as described previously (25Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A.J. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). After proper stimulation, cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were then lysed in ELB buffer. Lysates were centrifuged, supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples were then separated on appropriate SDS-PAGE gels and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were then detected by ECL using standard protocols and appropriate antibodies. Activation of the TCR causes inhibition of proliferation of a variety of leukemic T cell lines, as well as different T cell hybridomas (2Smith C.A. Williams G.I. Kingston R. Jenkinson E.J. Owen J.J.T. Nature. 1989; 337: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 3Jones L.A. Chin L.T. Longo D.L. Kruisbeek A.M.

Maecker H.T. Levy R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We set out to study the mechanism by which this growth inhibition occurs in leukemic T cell lines. To this end, Jurkat and H9 leukemic T cell lines were stimulated by engaging the TCR complex with immobilized anti-CD3 mAbs. Treatment of both cell lines with the anti-CD3 mAb UCHT-1 for 24 h resulted in marked inhibition of proliferation, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1 A). Growth inhibition was also observed with immobilized OKT3, another anti-CD3 mAb or phytohemagglutinin both known to efficiently stimulate signaling by the TCR complex (Fig. 1 A). Stimulation with an immobilized, isotype-matched anti-CD4 mAb or immobilized anti-CD28 mAb had no effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 1 A). Activation of protein kinase C, by the addition PMA, also resulted in efficient inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 1 A). Engagement of the TCR complex in leukemic T cells can result in apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis is also observed when the downstream signaling molecules protein kinase C and Ca2+-dependent calcineurin are directly activated through addition of phorbol esters and calcium ionophores. To determine the contribution of increased cell death to the growth inhibition observed in the Jurkat and H9 cells, we determined cell viability after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb or PMA. We found an increase in the percentage of dead cells after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb UCHT-1, from 3% in the unstimulated population to 13% after 24 h of stimulation and 22% after 48 h (Fig.1 B). When PMA was used as the stimulatory agent, we observed a similar increase in cell death, up to 29% after 24 h and a similar percentage after 48 h (Fig. 1 B). This would suggest that Jurkat and H9 cells do execute a program of AID in response T cell activation, which could explain the observed growth inhibition. However, the extent of cell death is not sufficient to fully explain the observed growth inhibition, since [3H]thymidine incorporation was inhibited by >50% after 24 h of stimulation with UCHT-1, whereas the amount of cell death was less than 15%. Addition of an anti-Fas mAb (Fas18) to these cells, triggered a rapid and dramatic cell death (>70% after 24 h) in these cell lines (data not shown), indicating that the relatively low levels of cell death observed after stimulation with anti-CD3 or PMA are not the result of a resistance of these cells to Fas-induced cell death. We decided to study the proliferative arrest in more detail by analysis of the DNA profiles using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2, in the untreated Jurkat cells ∼41% of the cells are in the G1 phase, ∼31% S phase, and ∼27% G2/M phase. However, as early as 16 h after plating on immobilized anti-CD3 mAbs, the percentage of cells in the G1 phase rises to ∼50%. After 24 h the percentage of cells in the G1 phase is more than 60% and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase is observed. Similar effects were seen in the H9 cell line (data not shown). Apoptotic cells undergo DNA fragmentation and therefore display a sub-G1 (<2N) DNA content. As can been seen in Fig. 2, the fraction of cells with a <2N DNA content is around 14% after 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 2). This indicates that the increased cell death observed after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAbs is at least partly due to induction of apoptosis, consistent with previous reports (8Takahashi S. Maecker H.T. Levy R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Zhu L. Anasetti C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 192-200PubMed Google Scholar). After stimulation with PMA, a similar increase in the percentage of cells in G1 is observed, up to 58% G1 cells after 48 h. Also, there was a clear increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells (<2N), from 1% in the unstimulated cells to 20% in the cells stimulated for 24 h with PMA. As mentioned above, a critical event during passage through G1 is the phosphorylation of pRb. To investigate whether the G1arrest occurred early, or late in G1, we examined the phosphorylation state of pRb after treatment of cells with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb or PMA for different time periods. In untreated asynchronous cultures, pRb is mostly present in its slower migrating hyperphosphorylated form (Fig.3 A). After 24 h of stimulation with the anti-CD3 mAb UCHT-1 or PMA we observed a clear mobility shift in the pRb protein from the hyperphosphorylated to the hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 3 A). We also measured the kinase activity of cyclin E-cdk2 complexes that are normally induced late in G1 and are involved in phosphorylation of pRb. After 24 h with anti-CD3 mAbs or PMA, cyclin E-associated kinase activity was inhibited by 22 or 38%, respectively (Fig. 3 B), indicating that these cells still contain a considerable amount of cyclin E-associated kinase activity after stimulation. Thus, it seems unlikely that the moderate inhibition of cyclin E-associated kinase activity is responsible for the observed growth inhibition. Similar reductions in kinase activity were observed using immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-cdk2 in in vitrokinase reactions (Fig. 3 C). Activation of G1 cyclin-cdk complexes in normal T cells involves down-regulation of the cdk-inhibitor p27kip1(17Firpo E.J. Koff A. Solomon M.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M-H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Stimulation of expression of p27kip1 by TCR activation in leukemic T cells could result in inhibition of the kinase activity of cyclin E-cdk2 complexes. Therefore, we examined if TCR activation can induce expression of p27kip1 in Jurkat T cells. Whole cell lysates were prepared from control cells and from cells stimulated for 24 h with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb UCHT-1 or PMA. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of p27kip1 did not change significantly upon activation of the T cells with anti-CD3 mAb or PMA, indicating that another mechanism must be responsible for the observed inhibition of cyclin/cdk activity in these leukemic cells. We next decided to analyze the effect of TCR activation on expression of the G1 cyclins. In T cells the major D-type cyclins are D2 and D3, whereas D1 is not expressed (11Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 12Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Shay J.W. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2663-2674PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore we examined expression of cyclins D2, D3, and cyclin E. Cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb or PMA for 24 h, since pRb was efficiently dephosphorylated at this time point (Fig.3 A). Expression of cyclin D3 was dramatically reduced after 24 h in the presence of PMA or immobilized anti-CD3 mAb in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that a reduction in cyclin D3 expression could be responsible for the observed G1 arrest. Cyclin D2 could not be detected in lysates from Jurkat (Fig.4 C) or H9 cells (not shown), in contrast to a control lysate from U2OS osteosarcoma cells shown previously to express cyclin D2 (24Lukas J. Bartkova J. Welcker M. Petersen O.W. Peters G. Strauss M. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2125-2134PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that cyclin D3 is the major D-type cyclin expressed in these leukemic T cell lines. Expression of cyclin E or its kinase partner cdk2 was unaltered upon stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb or PMA (Fig. 4, D and E), demonstrating that regulation of cyclin E or cdk2 expression is not involved in the inhibition of cyclin E/cdk2 kinase activity. In order to determine the timing of cyclin D3 down-regulation, we performed a time course experiment and total lysates were prepared for analysis of cyclin D3 expression levels. The timing of cyclin D3 down-regulation appears to be similar after stimulation with PMA or immobilized anti-CD3 mAbs. The reduction in cyclin D3 expression is first visible after 8 h of stimulation and continues to decline up to 24 h (Fig. 5 A). We next wanted to show that the reduction in cyclin D3 expression results in loss of cyclin D-associated kinase activity from the cell. Recently, it was shown that the Ser780 residue in pRb is phosphorylated by cyclin D-cdk complexes, but not by cyclin E- or cyclin A-cdk2 complexes (16Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H-K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J-Y. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser780 is therefore a good measure of cyclin D-cdk kinase activity without interference of the activity of other G1 cyclin-cdk complexes. Thus, we decided to study the phosphorylation state of the Ser780 residue of pRb after stimulation with PMA or anti-CD3 mAbs. For this purpose we made use of an antibody recognizing only pRb phosphorylated on Ser780(anti-phospho-Ser780) (16Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H-K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J-Y. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, treatment of Jurkat cells with PMA or immobilized UCHT-1 for 24 h resulted in loss of phosphorylation of pRb-Ser780. This clearly demonstrates that the reduction in cyclin D3 expression results in loss of cyclin D-associated kinase activity from the cell. Moreover, Ser780 phosphorylation was reduced as early as 12 h after stimulation with UCHT-1, indicating that the reduction in cyclin D3-associated kinase activity closely follows the decrease in cyclin D3 expression (Fig. 5 C). To determine if down-regulation of cyclin D3 is crucial to the proliferative arrest seen in response to PMA and anti-CD3 mAbs, we analyzed the effect of ectopic expression of cyclin D3 in Jurkat T cells. For this purpose, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector for cyclin D3. To allow analysis of the transfected population we co-transfected a plasmid encoding a modified version of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (26Kaletja R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Using bivariate flow cytometry we could then analyze the cell cycle distribution of the GFP-positive population (26Kaletja R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transfection of an empty vector control did not affect the growth arrest induced by anti-CD3 mAbs or PMA, as can be seen from the increase in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase after treatment with these agents (Fig. 6 A). However, transfection of the cyclin D3 expression plasmid resulted in an efficient rescue of the cell cycle arrest that normally occurs in response to treatment with anti-CD3 mAbs or PMA (Fig. 6 A), indicating that down-regulation of cyclin D3 is instrumental to the observed growth inhibition. To further corroborate these data, we established cell lines of Jurkat T cells stably overexpressing cyclin D3. We isolated two independent clones, JD3.I and JD3.II, and these lines were tested for growth inhibition by anti-CD3 mAbs and PMA. As can be seen in Fig.6 B, growth inhibition of JD3.I cells by UCHT-1 was reduced approximately 2-fold, and the response to PMA was almost completely abolished. The effect of cyclin D3 overexpression was even more pronounced in the JD3.II clone which expressed slightly higher levels of cyclin D3 (not shown). JD3.II cells were hardly inhibited in their growth by TCR activation or PMA treatment. To confirm that cyclin D3 was indeed constitutively expressed in these cell lines, we analyzed cyclin D3 expression on Western blots. Whereas cyclin D3 is efficiently down-regulated in the parental Jurkat cell line, no effect on cyclin D3 expression by anti-CD3 mAbs or PMA is seen in JD3.I (data not shown) or JD3.II (Fig. 6 C). Thus cyclin D3 can no longer be down-regulated in these cell lines by TCR activation and as a consequence no growth inhibition is observed. We then wanted to know if this rescue from growth inhibition had any influence on the apoptotic program induced by these stimuli. Interestingly, cell viability was no longer decreased in these cell lines after treatment with anti-CD3 mAbs or PMA (Fig. 6 D). We confirmed this by analysis of DNA profiles of the JD3.I and JD3.II cell lines after stimulation with UCHT-1 or PMA. Only a very small increase (∼6%) in the G1 percentage was seen in these cells after stimulation with UCHT-1 (Fig. 7), compared with an increase of 21% seen in normal Jurkat (see Fig. 2). The effect of PMA appeared to be completely abolished in JD3.I as well as JD3.II (Fig.7). Moreover, very little (1%) apoptotic cells were detected, confirming the data on cell viability obtained with these same cell lines. These data indicate that in addition to the growth arrest, AID also requires the down-regulation of cyclin D3. In this report we have addressed the mechanism by which TCR activation induces a G1 arrest in leukemic T cells. T cell activation was performed by stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 mAbs. Under our experimental conditions, treatment with anti-CD3 mAbs resulted in a G1 arrest, and a reduction in cell viability. In parallel, cells were stimulated with the phorbol ester PMA, providing a somewhat more efficient stimulus. Activation of the same leukemic T cell lines with PMA induced a similar arrest in G1 and a similar reduction in cell viability. The G1 arrest induced by anti-CD3 mAbs and PMA was associated with the appearance of dephosphorylated pRb, indicating an arrest at, or prior to, the G1 restriction point. In agreement with this notion was the finding that the kinase activity of cyclin E and cdk2 complexes was reduced after TCR activation. In order to address the mechanism by which the reduction in kinase activity of these complexes occurs, we analyzed expression of the various G1 cyclins. Expression of cyclin E is usually induced somewhere late in G1 as a function of cell cycle progression. No reduction in the expression level of cyclin E could be detected after treatment with anti-CD3 mAbs, indicating that the inhibition of cyclin E-associated kinase occurs through active repression of the cyclin-cdk complex. Further analysis of expression of G1 cyclins showed that cyclin D2 is not expressed in Jurkat or H9 cells and that the expression of cyclin D3 was reduced significantly after treatment with anti-CD3 mAbs or PMA. At present we do not know whether the reduction in cyclin D3 expression occurs through active transcriptional repression or by a post-translational mechanism affecting protein stability of cyclin D3. The decrease in cyclin D3 expression resulted in a drop in the kinase activity of cyclin D-cdk complexes, as evidenced by the reduction in Ser780 phosphorylation of pRb seen after stimulation with PMA or anti-CD3 mAbs. Since p27kip1 was associated to some of those complexes the reduction in cyclin D3 levels will cause a rise in the amount of p27kip1 available to associate with cyclin E-cdk complexes. Therefore, the decrease in cyclin D3 expression might be indirectly responsible for the inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2 complexes. To investigate the importance of cyclin D3 down-regulation to the observed growth inhibition, we studied the effects of ectopic expression of cyclin D3. We show that overexpression of cyclin D3, both transiently as well as in stable cell lines, is sufficient to override the cell cycle arrest induced by TCR activation, indicating that the growth inhibition requires down-regulation of cyclin D3. In addition, ectopic expression of cyclin D3 prevents the apoptosis induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 mAbs or PMA. These data implicate that the down-regulation of cyclin D3 is not only crucial to the growth arrest, but also for apoptosis induced by TCR activation. This would suggest that cyclin D3 integrates signals that regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of T cells. Since D-type cyclins are required for inactivation of pRb and it is known that cells lacking functional pRb no longer require cyclin D-associated kinase activity (23Miyatake S. Nakano H. Park S.Y.

Nature. 1995; 375: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), one would expect that T cells that lack functional pRb are not inhibited in their growth by TCR activation. Indeed, Lissyet al. (22Lissy N.A. Van Dyk L.F. Becker-Hapak M. Vocero-Akbani A. Mendler J.H. Dowdy S.F. Immunity. 1998; 8: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) recently reported that Jurkat T cells can be rescued from AID when pRb is functionally inactivated through introduction of the HPV E7 protein. They showed that AID occurs from a late G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint. Our data provide further insight into the underlying mechanism and suggest that this checkpoint is activated through down-regulation of cyclin D3. Expression of the D-type cyclins is low in cells in G0, such as resting T cells (10Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of G0 cells with the proper mitogens, expression of cyclin D is induced, and this remains high as long as the mitogens are present (9Ando K. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9571-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In normal peripheral T cells, induction of cyclin D3 expression requires TCR activation and this is further stimulated after addition of IL-2 (31Boonen G.J.J.C. van Dijk A.M.C. Verdonck L.F. van Lier R.A.W. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 789-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, leukemic cells, such as the Jurkat cells used in this study, no longer depend on TCR activation or IL-2 for their proliferation and express constitutively high levels of cyclin D3. Remarkably, our data show that TCR activation has the opposite effect on cyclin D3 expression from that observed in normal peripheral T cells. Future experiments are called for to elucidate the mechanism by which TCR activation can cause the reduction in cyclin D3 levels. It will be of significant interest to learn why this mechanism only exists in actively proliferating T cells and how the effect of TCR activation on cyclin D3 expression can be so radically different in resting T cells. This could help us understand how control of cellular proliferation in leukemic T cells is different form normal T cells and lead to more insight into potential treatments of such malignancies.

In the present study, to further investigate the molecular mechanism of human ANG transcriptional regulation, we generated transgenic mice carrying the fusion gene composed of the 1.3-kilobase promoter of the human ANG gene, its downstream enhancer, and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. Because expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was observed strongly in the liver and weakly in the kidney, we suspected that hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4 with a tissue expression pattern similar to that of the reporter gene would regulate ANG transcription. In vitro assays indicated that HNF4 bound to the promoter elements and strongly activated the ANG transcription, but that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), a transcriptional repressor, dramatically repressed human ANG transcription through the promoter elements and the downstream enhancer core elements. Furthermore, COUP-TF dramatically decreased the human ANG transcription in the mouse liver by the Helios Gene Gun system in vivo.

The renin-angiotensin system plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis as well as being a growth regulator of cardiac myocytes. The reaction between renin and angiotensinogen (ANG)1 is the initial and rate-limiting step of this enzymatic cascade that generates the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is further processed to the functional octapeptide angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (1Reid I.A.

Because plasma ANG concentration is close to the K mof the renin reaction, variation of ANG transcription is thought to influence blood pressure (4Gould A.B. Green B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1971; 5: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by elevation of blood pressure in transgenic animals that overexpress the ANG gene (5Kimura S. Mullins J. J.

In particular, we reported that naturally occurring molecular variants of AGCE1 (ANGcore promoter element 1), located between the TATA box and transcription initiation site, alter the binding affinity of ubiquitous transcriptional mediator, AGCF1 (AGCE-binding factor 1), and affect human ANG transcriptional activity (8Yanai K.

Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) indicated that a genetic variant in AGCE1 is directly associated with increased risk of hypertension. Therefore, it is considered to be etiologically important to understand the molecular mechanisms of human ANG transcriptional regulation. A variety of cis-acting transcription elements andtrans-acting nuclear factors responsible for the preferential expression of various genes in the liver have been identified (12Johndon P.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 427-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14De Simone V.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1063-1102Google Scholar). Of these liver preference factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that interacts with an element containing the AGGTCA motif (16Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2352-2365Crossref Scopus (861) Google Scholar). HNF4 was originally identified as an orphan member of the superfamily, but fatty acyl-CoA thioesters, which modulated the onset and progression of various disease including insulin resistances and hypertension, have recently been demonstrated as ligands of HNF4 (17Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Binding sites for HNF4 have often been found in the regulatory regions of many liver-enriched genes encoding apolipoproteins, coagulation factors, serum proteins, and cytochrome P450s and those involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids, and glucose (18Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Specific Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar). Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, was initially characterized as a transcriptional stimulator of the chicken ovalbumin promoter (19Sagami I. Tsai S.Y. Wang H. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), yet has recently been recognized to play a suppressive role in the transcriptional control of the expression of several genes (20Cooney A.J.

Most of the binding sites initially found to bind HNF4 are also recognized by COUP-TF, and overexpression of COUP-TF generally antagonizes HNF4-mediated transcriptional activation (24Cairns W.

Therefore, it is accepted that this antagonistic effect finely tunes HNF4-dependent gene expression by an intracellular balance of these positive and negative regulators. Because ANG is mainly synthesized in the liver, we have studied the mechanisms of hepatic human ANG transcription using human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) as a model and identified various regulatory elements and factors that regulate the human ANG gene transcription including the upstream elements (29Shimada S.

Commun. 1994; 205: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, to further investigate the mechanisms of human ANG transcription, we generated transgenic mice carrying the reporter gene which include all components of previously identified regulatory elements of the human ANG gene. Expression patterns of the reporter gene in two independent transgenic lines brought us the notion that HNF4 participated in the regulation of human ANG transcription. In vitro transfection analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that HNF4 regulated human ANG transcription. Furthermore, COUP-TF acted as a strong repressor of the human ANG transcription through multiple mechanismsin vitro and in vivo. The human ANG promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) chimeric constructs were made as follows: 13cat, DM4cat, DM7cat, DM7.8cat, DM8cat, DM8.5cat, DM9cat, DM10cat, DM12cat contained 1266-bp (−1222 to +44), 791-bp (−747 to +44), 560-bp (−516 to +44), 388-bp (−344 to +44), 356-bp (−312 to +44), 340-bp (−296 to +44), 287-bp (−243 to +44), 150-bp (−106 to +44), and 76-bp (−32 to +44) fragments, respectively, and these DNA fragments were subcloned into theBglII/HindIII sites of SV0cat. DM12C/EBPcat was constructed by inserting eight copies of C/EBP-binding sequence (5′-AATTGGGCAATCAG-3′) at the upstream of the human ANG core promoter. C-SVPLuc and J-SVPLuc were constructed by inserting six copies of C and J fragments at the upstream of the SV40 promoter of SVPLuc (Wako, Osaka, Japan), respectively. 13B2cat, DM12B2cat, DM12B2–5′cat, DM12GMcat, DM12MEcat, DM12EBcat, DM12ΔB2–1cat, DM12E3cat, DM12d61–2cat, and SV3cat were constructed as described previously (32Nibu Y.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for HNF4 (pEF-BOS/HNF4) and for COUP-TF (pEF-BOS/COUP) were constructed as described previously (26Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11125-11133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3.8-kb fragment containing human ANG 1.3-kb promoter, its downstream enhancer, and CAT reporter gene was isolated (Fig. 1 A). The DNA was used directly for microinjection in a concentration of 4 μg/ml and about 1,000 copies/embryo. One-cell zygotes fertilized in vitro were obtained from C57BL/6 mice, and outbred ICR females were used as the pseudopregnant recipients. The transgenic procedure used was essentially as described (34Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Heterozygous transgenic progeny were obtained by breeding the two founders to C57BL/6 wild type mice, and the obtained littermates were used for the current studies. The animals were killed by cervical dislocation. Tissues were isolated by rapid dissection and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissues were homogenized in 250 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 2 mmMgCl2), and the suspension was freeze-thawed three times and centrifuged. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Extracts containing equal amounts of 5 or 50 μg of protein were used in CAT assays (35Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The extent of conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated form was measured with a bio-imaging analyzer (model BAS2000; Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids. The cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and transfected 24 h later by calcium phosphate co-precipitation with reporter plasmids (3 μg) and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMV-βgal (1 μg) to normalize transfection efficiency. In the co-transfection assay, 2 μg of reporter plasmids were transfected with 10–1000 ng of modulator plasmids and 1 μg of pCMV-βgal. Total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 4 μg by pEF-BOS. After 48 h of culture, β-galactosidase activities were measured and cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase activity were used for CAT assay (35Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In the case of luciferase assays, the cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/24-well dish and transfected 16 h later by FuGENETM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with reporter plasmids (50 ng), pCMV-βgal (25 ng), and EF-BOS/HNF4 (10 to 100 ng). Total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 275 ng by pEF-BOS. After 24 h of culture, β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells and the liver of C57BL/6 mice were prepared using the protocols of Dignam et al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and Gorski et al. (37Gorski K. Karneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), respectively. Nuclear extracts of COS7 cells transfected with pEF-BOS/HNF4 were prepared by the mini-scale detergent treatment procedure (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The maltose-binding protein fusion and purification system from New England Biolabs was used to prepare the recombinant COUP-TF protein. Double-stranded DNA probes were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Ten micrograms of nuclear extracts or bacterially expressed proteins were incubated with 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and end-labeled oligonucleotide (0.5 ng, approximately 15,000 cpm) at 20 °C for 15 min in the presence or absence of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. The binding reaction was carried out in a solution containing 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. In the supershift experiments, 2 μl of HNF4-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixtures were directly loaded onto a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 4% glycerol made in 1 × TBE (90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C, the gels were dried and analyzed with a bio-imaging analyzer. The Helios Gene Gun system (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) was used essentially as described (39Yoshida Y. Kobayashi E. Endo H. Hamamoto T. Yamanaka T. Fujimura A. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fifty milligrams of Au particles (radius 1.0 μm, Bio-Rad) were washed with 70% ethanol, and 100 μl of 0.05m spermidine (Sigma) were added to the washed Au particles. Then, 50 μg of reporter plasmid (13B2cat) and 200 μg of effector plasmid (pEF-BOS/COUP) or empty vector (pEF-BOS) were added to the mixture. This suspension was mixed with 100 μl of 1 mCaCl2and vortexed. The suspension was centrifuged after 10 min, and the resulting DNA-coated Au particles were washed with 70% ethanol and suspended in 200 μl of PVP solution (polyvinyl pyrrolidone (molecular weight 360,000), 0.02 mg/ml 99.5% ethanol). The suspension was used to prepare the cartridge as described in the manual. ICR mice (12 weeks old) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. The abdomen was shaved, and the liver surface was exposed by a transverse skin incision. The one lobe of liver was bombarded three times with a Helios Gene Gun at 180 p.s.i., and the abdomen was closed by a running suture. Control experiments using pCMV-βgal and empty vector showed that about 10% of the surface of the liver were positive for the β-galactosidase staining (data not shown). The liver extracts were prepared from the bombarded lobe 6 days after bombardment, and the extracts containing equal amounts of 100 μg of protein were used in CAT assays. To investigate the mechanisms of hepatic human ANG transcriptional regulation, we generated transgenic mice carrying the fusion gene that comprises the human ANG 1.3-kb promoter, its downstream enhancer, and the CAT reporter gene (Fig.1 A). The extracts from major tissues of the two independent transgenic lines were analyzed by CAT assays. Expression of the reporter gene construct was observed strongly in the liver and weakly in the kidney, although the other tissues exhibited no activity (Fig. 1 B). These results indicated that the reconstituted gene construct composed of the human ANG 1.3-kb promoter and its downstream enhancer are sufficient for the liver-preferential expression in vivo. The results from transgenic mice brought us the notion that HNF4 with a tissue expression pattern similar to that of the reporter gene would participate in the regulation of human ANG transcription. Indeed, HNF4 activated the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 A). The region affected by HNF4 located within the promoter, because HNF4 activated CAT activity of 13B2cat and 13cat, but could not do that of DM12B2cat (Fig. 2 B). To localize HNF4-responsive elements within the promoter, we examined the 5′-deletion mutants fused to the reporter gene (Fig. 3). Deletion of the sequences from −1222 bp to −516 bp did not essentially influence the HNF4-responsive activity, but there was a significant reduction in CAT activity when the upstream sequence was eliminated up to −344 bp. Further deletion of the sequences to −296 bp did not essentially affect it; however, HNF4 hardly activated CAT activity when the region between −296 bp and −243 bp was removed. These results suggest that the regions from −516 bp to −344 bp and from −296 to −243 bp are important for the HNF4-dependent human ANG transcriptional activation.Figure 3Deletion analysis of HNF4-activating elements. Left, 5′-deletion constructs of the human ANG promoter-CAT hybrid genes. Thick horizontal lines andopen boxes marked by CAT represent the promoter and CAT vector sequences, respectively. Names of constructs used are listed to the right. Right, HepG2 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the CAT reporter plasmids, 0.5 μg of pEF-BOS or pEF-BOS/HNF4, and 1 μg of pCMV-βgal. Transfection experiments and CAT assays were performed as described in Fig. 2 A. CAT activities of the reporter genes in the presence of pEF-BOS/HNF4 are expressed as -fold activation relative to the activity obtained with each reporter plasmid in the presence of the pEF-BOS vector. Each value of CAT activity represents the mean ± S.E. for at least four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We tried to identify HNF4-binding elements by EMSA using the dissected DNA fragments that covered with the HNF4-responsive elements (A–J; Fig. 4 A). Incubation of the well known HNF4-binding element, C3P, located at −90 to −66 upstream from the apolipoprotein CIII gene transcriptional start site (28Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), with the mouse liver nuclear extracts produced retarded complexes (Fig.4 B, lane 2), but no shifted band was observed without the nuclear extract (Fig. 4 B,lane 1). The complexes represented a sequence-specific interaction between C3P fragment and a nuclear factor, since the formation of this complex was specifically reduced with molar excess of unlabeled competitors (Fig. 4, lane 3). Supershift experiments using an anti-HNF4 antibody showed that this factor was HNF4 (data not shown). The DNA-protein complex formed by HNF4 binding to C3P was inhibited by molar excess of non-labeled C and J fragments, although the other fragments could not compete for this binding (Fig. 4, lanes 4–13). Although incubation of C3P, C, and J fragments with COS7 nuclear extracts produced no retarded complexes (Fig.5, lanes 1,5, and 7), nuclear extracts of COS7 cells transfected with the HNF4 expression plasmid produced the complexes between HNF-4 and C3P, C, or J fragments (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 3, 4, 6, and8). To further characterize C and J region binding activities, mouse liver nuclear extracts were incubated with C and J fragments as a probe (Fig. 6). The complexes formed by mouse nuclear extracts with C or J fragments had biochemical properties similar to the ones by the nuclear extracts with C3P, since the formation of this complex was specifically reduced with molar excess of unlabeled C3P competitor (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 10). Furthermore, supershift experiments using anti-HNF4 antibody showed that these sequence-specific binding factors were HNF4 (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and12). To confirm the role of C and J regions as HNF4-responsive elements, we inserted these fragments in front of the heterologous SV40 promoter (Fig.7 A). C-SVPLuc and J-SVPLuc were activated by HNF4 as a dose-dependent manner, although SVPLuc was little affected (Fig. 7 B). These results suggested that HNF4 binds to C region (−429 to −386) and J region (−281 to 252) of the human ANG gene and activates its transcription through these elements.Figure 5C and J fragments as binding sites for HNF4 .

As expected, COUP-TF dramatically repressed the reporter gene, 13B2cat, in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells (Fig.8 A). Next, we examined whether COUP-TF-responsive region localized in the promoter including HNF4-binding sites (Fig. 8 B). Interestingly, COUP-TF repressed CAT activities of not only 13cat but also DM12B2cat, which does not contain HNF4-responsive elements, although COUP-TF did not significantly affect SV3cat and DM12C/EBPcat including the eight copies of C/EBP-binding site fused in front of the human ANG core promoter. These results suggest that COUP-TF influences human ANG transcriptional activity by other mechanisms than by antagonizing the function of HNF4. To localize COUP-TF-responsive elements within the promoter, we examined the 5′-deletion mutants linked to the reporter gene (Fig.9 A). Deletion of the sequences from −1222 bp to −516 bp did not essentially affect the COUP-TF-responsive activity, but there was a significant reduction in repression activity when C element was eliminated (Fig. 9 A,DM7.8cat).

Compared with the NAD-dependent MDHs, the amino acid sequences of the chloroplastic MDHs exhibit specific extensions at their N and C termini (3Crétin C. Luchetta P. Joly C. Decottignies P.

Both disulfides are located in the extensions: the Cys24–Cys29 disulfide at the N terminus and the Cys365–Cys377 disulfide at the C terminus. Recently, the structure of the inactive, oxidized chloroplastic NADP-MDH was solved and provided a structural basis for the regulatory role of the Cys365–Cys377disulfide (8Johansson K. Ramaswamy S.

Ollis D.L. Structure ( Lond. ). 1999; 7: 461-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The C-terminal disulfide was shown to constrain the C-terminal peptide to fold into the active site, thereby obstructing substrate access. Biochemical data emphasized the role of the negative charge of the side chain of the penultimate glutamate in locking the extension inside the active site (10Ruelland E. Johansson K. Decottignies P. Djukic N. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33482-33488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the C-terminal inhibitory peptide would be released upon reduction, making the active site accessible (8Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Saarinen M. Lemaire-Chamley M. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To better help understand the conformational rearrangements occurring during reduction, the structure of an active reduced enzyme would be most valuable. However, the need to use reduced thioredoxin to activate the enzyme makes crystallization of the active form difficult. As a first step toward a comprehensive structural representation of the activation process, NMR spectra of oxidized and reduced forms of NADP-MDH were recorded. For this purpose, we have used an engineered MDH truncated in 33 residues at the N terminus. This truncated form is a monomer of 38 kDa (ΔN-MDH) still functional and redox-regulated, even though its activation by reduced thioredoxin is very fast compared with the wild-type enzyme. NMR measurements clearly show that a C-terminal peptide of 15 amino acids is released from the active site upon reduction and acquires an increased flexibility yielding locally narrow NMR line widths despite the relatively high molecular weight of the recombinant enzyme. Interactions between the C-terminal extension residues and the core structure of the protein in the oxidized form as inferred from the crystal structure are discussed together with the NMR data obtained for the reduced form in order to explain the efficient reversible activation/inactivation redox control of the chloroplast MDH.

Bacteria were grown at 37 °C on Luria broth medium; ampicillin at 50 μg/ml was added when the bacteria carried plasmids conferring drug resistance. MDH cDNA encoding a protein deleted in 33 amino acids at the N terminus (ΔN-MDH) was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (5Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P.

The purity of the preparations was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activation kinetics of the MDH mutants were measured by preincubating the enzymes with 10 mm (±)-dithiothreitol and 20 μmrecombinant thioredoxin (either from E. coli or fromChlamydomonas reinhardtii) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9. Samples were taken out at regular time intervals and injected into a spectrophotometer cuvette containing the reaction medium composed of 140 μm NADPH, 780 μmoxaloacetate in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9. The activity was recorded as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH. Oxidized ΔN-MDH NMR samples (550 μl) were prepared at 0.25–0.75 mm concentrations (10–30 mg/ml) in a 20 mm phosphate buffer, 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 6.2. The proteins were reduced in the NMR cell under argon by addition of 10 μl of a 1 mm solution of thioredoxin h from C. reinhardtii (2.5–5 mol %, catalytic amount) (13Mittard V. Blackledge M.J.

All the NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance DRX 500 (1H = 500 MHz) spectrometer using a 5-mm (1H, 13C,15N) triple-resonance probe head, equipped with a supplementary self-shielded z gradient coil. Data were processed using the Bruker XwinNMR or GIFA V.4.22 (14Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.-A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) softwares. All homonuclear two-dimensional experiments were recorded with 512 (t 1) × 1024 (t 2) complex data points (32 scans per t 1increments).

The solvent signal was suppressed with the WATERGATE sequence using a 3-9-19 pulse sequence with z gradients (20Piotto M. Saudek V. Skleńar V. J. Biomol.

For DQF-COSY an additional very low power presaturation of the water resonance during the relaxation delay to minimize the radiation damping effect. The quadrature detection in the t 1dimension was achieved using the States-TPPI method (22Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). The spectral width of all experiments was 10 ppm (5000 Hz) with a carrier frequency on-resonance with the water resonance. For TOCSY experiments, a MLEV pulse sequence was used for the isotropic mixing, arranged according to the clean-TOCSY method (23Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) to minimize the signals arising from the rotating frame Overhauser effect. In the NOESY experiment, a water flip back pulse was used and gradients were added duringt 1 to minimize the radiation damping effect (24Lippens G. Dhalluin C. Wieruszeski J.-M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The total mixing times were 40 ms for TOCSY spectra and 75 and 150 ms for NOESY spectra. The chloroplastic NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase is a homodimeric enzyme activated by the reduction of two disulfide bridges located at the N and C termini of each monomer. Its activation rate is slow, with a distinct lag phase. The truncated ΔN-MDH is a monomer devoid of the N-terminal disulfide but still totally inactive in the oxidized form. After activation, its catalytic properties are identical to those of the WT enzyme (5Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J.-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21577-21583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It constitutes a simplified system where the effect of the C-terminal extension can be studied independently from the interaction with the N-terminal extension. In addition, the 38kDa molecular mass of the monomeric ΔN-MDH makes it potentially accessible to high resolution NMR in solution (25Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), allowing more detailed future structural studies. It has been shown previously that this mutant exhibits fast activation kinetics, suggesting that the reduction of the N-terminal disulfide was the rate-limiting step of the activation. This N-terminal extension is also necessary for the dimerization (6Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J.-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the WT dimeric enzyme, site-directed mutagenesis and crystallographic studies clearly demonstrated that the C-terminal extension was bound inside the active site, acting as an internal inhibitor in the oxidized enzyme (Fig. 2) (8Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Saarinen M. Lemaire-Chamley M. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Ruelland E. Johansson K. Decottignies P. Djukic N. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33482-33488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It could be expected that upon reduction by thioredoxin, the C-terminal inhibitory extension should be released from the active site. The fast activation rate of the mutants missing the N-terminal disulfide bridge suggested that a local shift of the C-terminal extension could be sufficient to unblock the active site without complex conformational changes. Recent experiments have shown that in the presence of thiol oxidants the ΔN-MDH could form dimers through an intersubunit disulfide bridge linking the Cys207 of both subunits (12Goyer A. Decottignies P. Lemaire S. Ruelland E. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Jacquot J.-P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, a C207A mutant of ΔN-MDH, unable to form covalent dimers, was also studied, in order to avoid potential dimerization problems. This mutant is a good alternative to the use of the ΔN-MDH, having similar activation properties and catalytic parameters (data not shown). From the crystallographic structure of the oxidized MDH (Fig. 2), it was proposed that the reduction of the C-terminal Cys365–Cys377 disulfide bridge would release the last two C-terminal residues Glu388 and Val389 from the active site, making it accessible to the substrate. This unblocking of the MDH active site could be the consequence of an increased mobility of the C-terminal extension upon reduction of the Cys365–Cys377 disulfide bridge by thioredoxin. Such a mobility difference could be characterized by the comparison of both redox states of the chloroplast MDH by solution NMR which is sensitive to molecular motions. The NMR spectra of the oxidized form of the ΔN-MDH and the ΔN-MDH C207A mutant indicate no COSY cross-peaks and only a few peaks in the TOCSY and NOESY experiments of which no sequence-specific assignment was possible (Fig. 1). This result is not surprising due to the molecular weight of the proteins that induces fast transverse relaxation rates and broad NMR lines, making ineffective the transfer of magnetization. For the reduced MDH forms, several narrower NMR signals could be easily discerned from the rest of the broad amide proton resonances in the region 7.6–8.6 ppm of the one-dimensional spectra (data not shown). These narrower signals gave rise to a number of cross-peaks in the different two-dimensional spectra in the same 7.6–8.6-ppm region as shown in Fig. 1. Thirteen spin systems were detected in the TOCSY spectra of the reduced ΔN-MDH and ΔN-MDH C207A mutant, with magnetization transfer from HN to Hβ side chains proton resonances. The COSY and TOCSY correlations in the aliphatic-aliphatic part of the spectra allowed the recognition of specific amino acid spin systems. Eleven of the thirteen HN to Hα TOCSY cross-peaks were also detected in the DQF-COSY spectrum, as illustrated with boxes in Fig. 1. The NOEs observed (Fig. 1) indicated that the 13 amino acids are sequentially linked in both proteins. Two valine spin systems, one alanine, one threonine, one leucine, one glycine, one proline together with four AMX spin systems could be unambiguously be identified. The three remaining spin systems were attributed to either a glutamic acid, a glutamine, or a methionine spin system. Moreover, one of the AMX spin systems indicated strong NOESY connectivities with aromatic resonances characteristic of a tyrosine residue and was therefore tentatively assigned to this amino acid. In the NOESY spectra, only sequential (i, i + 1) NOEs were detected. NOE d βN correlations were observed in some cases, together with very weakd NN NOE correlations. Four amino acid sequences could be identified as indicated in TableI. The possibilities to find the peptide sequences in the protein from residues 1 to 364 or in the C-terminal extension of the protein (residues 365–389) were examined. The results indicate that the peptide exhibiting the assigned TOCSY and NOESY cross peaks in the reduced form of the enzyme can be found only in C-terminal peptide Ala375–Val389, the last 15 residues of the protein (Tables I and II and Fig.2). Therefore, it is clear that the C-terminal peptide of the enzyme is no longer bound to the core structure of the protein when the C-terminal Cys365–Cys377 disulfide is reduced. The relative intensities of the sequential d αN andd NN NOEs and the absence of any (i,i + 2) or longer distance NOEs, correlate with a random-coil conformation for the C-terminal peptide of the enzyme.

The assignment of the mobile peptide provides information about the structural rearrangements occurring upon reduction. The first part of the C-terminal peptide from Cys365 to Asn374 remains bound to the core structure as the corresponding residues keep a correlation time similar to that of the rest of the protein. The peptide is mobile from Ala375, i.e. only two residues before the second cysteine of the regulatory C-terminal disulfide Cys365–Cys377. This is probably a favorable feature to maintain the Cys377 not too far away from Cys365, and the rest of the inhibitory C-terminal peptide not too far away from the whole protein. By this means, the inhibitory C-terminal peptide will easily find its way back to the active site when the photosynthetic electron transfer is stopped in the dark. This will allow MDH to readily reoxidize and consequently self-inactivate. The conformational analysis of the C-terminal extension in the inactive, oxidized crystalline form of the enzyme (8Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Saarinen M. Lemaire-Chamley M. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) supports the assumption that the structure of the Cys365–Asn374 part is not strongly modified in the reduced active form in solution. Residues 365 and 366 are part of the last helix of the protein. The other amino acids from positions 367 to 374 do not form a regular secondary structure but are stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds (O-366 with N-369 and N-370, O-367 with N-371 and N-372, O-364 with N-376, side chain of Thr370 and N-372, O-369 with side chain of Asn364 and side chain of His368 with side chain of Asp145). This indicates that residues 371–374 are more tightly bound to the protein than the rest of the C-terminal peptide. A number of interactions constrain the rest of the C-terminal extension to fold near the core structure of the protein in addition to the covalent interaction due to the disulfide bridge. In particular, Val379, Met384, and Leu385 make hydrophobic interactions with residues of the rest of the protein and a number of hydrogen bonds are found between the peptide and the protein. We should assume that these interactions are not sufficient to hold the C terminus in the active site in the reduced form. However, these interactions undoubtedly stabilize the binding to the core structure when the C-terminal disulfide is oxidized. Our work provides the first direct experimental observation of thein vitro thioredoxin-mediated activation of a thiol-regulated plant MDH. It shows that the activation is the result of the unobstruction of the active site by the acquisition of an additional mobility of the most C-terminal 15-residue stretch. We are very grateful to Dr. Hans Eklund and Kenth Johansson for helpful discussions and for providing the coordinates of the MDH structure before they became available in the Protein Data Bank. We thank Dr. Stephane Lemaire for the gift of recombinant thioredoxin h from C. reinhardtii and Dr. Michael Hodges for linguistic improvement of the manuscript."

Neurons and endocrine cells store bioactive peptides in a specialized organelle, the large dense core vesicle. Very little is known about the targeting signals governing membrane proteins that function in large dense core vesicles. The peptide amidating enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), functions in the regulated secretory pathway and has been used to study trafficking to large dense core vesicles. For roughly half of all bioactive peptides, COOH-terminal amidation is the final step of activation following endoproteolytic digestion from inactive precursors (19Mains R.E. Dickerson I.M. May V.

PAM is a Type I integral membrane protein with routing determinants within its cytosolic COOH-terminal domain (CD). Membrane forms of PAM are localized primarily in a post-Golgi tubuloreticular compartment overlapping but not identical with the TGN38-containing compartment; PAM that reaches the plasma membrane recycles to the TGN region (21Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Truncation of the CD of PAM results in cell surface localization with little internalization (22Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fusion of the transmembrane domain/CD of PAM to the lumenal domain of a plasma membrane protein or to a soluble secretory granule constituent results in TGN localization of both chimerae (21Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Milgram S.L. Chang E.Y. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 837-846PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the CD of PAM contains routing signals which mediate the localization of membrane forms of PAM within the regulated secretory pathway. We recently reported the use of the yeast two-hybrid system to identify PAM COOH-terminal interactor proteins (P-CIPs) (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28340-28636Google Scholar). Three cDNAs were identified; one encoded a putative serine/threonine protein kinase followed by a RNA binding motif (P-CIP2) and another encoded Kalirin (formerly P-CIP10), a novel member of the Dbl family of GDP/GTP exchange factors that interacts with Rac1, a small GTP-binding protein of the Rho subfamily (25Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12667-12675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both P-CIP2 and Kalirin were shown to interact directly with membrane PAM in vitro using GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria. P-CIP2 was also identified independently as an interactor of stathmin, a cytosolic protein involved in microtubule destabilization (26Maucuer A. Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Stathmin is homologous to the neuronal protein SCG10, which also destabilizes microtubules (27DiPaolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study we set out to characterize P-CIP2 more fully and to determine whether P-CIP2 is a functional kinase capable of phosphorylating PAM. For the interaction of P-CIP2 and PAM to be of functional significance, the two proteins must be expressed in the same cell; we used in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that the sites of P-CIP2 and PAM expression overlapped extensively in the brain. Evidence of a functionally significant interaction of P-CIP2 with PAM was shown by the ability of endogenous P-CIP2 to bind to PAM expressed in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells and in test tube assays. In vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that mutant PAM proteins that are misrouted in AtT-20 cells do not interact well with P-CIP2. The site of PAM-CD phosphorylation by P-CIP2 was identified, and the specificity of P-CIP2 for various other substrates was investigated. The results indicate that P-CIP2 phosphorylates a specific region of the cytosolic domain of PAM which contains routing determinants essential for the correct localization of membrane PAM, but phosphorylates few other potential substrates. The 1.4-kb cDNA insert isolated from the original yeast two-hybrid screen (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28340-28636Google Scholar) was32P-labeled by random priming (Prime It II, Stratagene) and used to screen a rat hippocampal random primed λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene). Seven positive overlapping clones were isolated and purified from 6 × 105 plaque forming units. The seven library cDNAs were rescued, the 5′ ends were sequenced, and the start codon was identified by its Kozak sequence which matches 7 of 9 bases in an optimal translation initiation site (5′-GCCCGCACCATGG-3′, mismatch is underlined) (28Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). The full sequence has been deposited with GenBank (accession number U70372). The 1.4-kb P-CIP2 partial cDNA fragment (I-2) encoding P-CIP2 residues 28–419 (ΔNP-CIP2) (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28340-28636Google Scholar) was ligated into pGEX5X2 to generate pGEX5X2/ΔNP-CIP2 for the expression of GST/ΔNP-CIP2 fusion protein to be used as an antigen. To construct a full-length P-CIP2 fusion protein expression vector, pGEX5X2/P-CIP2, the cDNA encoding P-CIP2 was modified to generate a SalI site in place of the start codon, and the 1.4-kb fragment was inserted into pGEX5X2 digested withSalI/NotI, yielding pGEX5X2/P-CIP2. Expression of the GST fusion protein with full-length P-CIP2 from pGEX5X2/P-CIP2 was carried out in BL21(DE3) cells (see below). For mammalian expression, an optimal ribosomal binding site was engineered to precede the initiation codon of P-CIP2 in pBS.KrP-CIP2 (28Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 29Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two mammalian expression vectors were used to express P-CIP2 and P-CIP2(1–383) (P-CIP2cc) with the Myc epitope and a His6-tag at their COOH terminus (pcDNA3.1/mycHis; Invitrogen) or at the amino terminus (created by combining the epitope tag regions of pEAK10-His and pEAK10-Myc from Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). Plasmid pBS.KrP-CIP2 was digested withXhoI/EcoRV and inserted into pcDNA3.1/mycHis digested with KpnI (blunted) and XhoI. For expression of P-CIP2cc, pBS.KrP-CIP2 was digested withXhoI/BsaBI and ligated. The full coding sequence of P-CIP2 was excised from pBluescript withNcoI-NotI and inserted into the pEAK10 vectors cut with BspLU11I-NotI. The Stratagene Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to create pcDNA.KrP-CIP2cc/K54A using the sense primer 5′-GGCGCCCTCGCGCAGTTCCTGCCTCCGCC-3′. All PCR products and ligations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pcDNA3.1/β-galactosidase-mycHis (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH) were used as transfection controls. Northern blots were performed as described previously (30Bloomquist B.T. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Mol.

The SalI/NotI 1.4-kb fragment isolated in the original two-hybrid screen was random primed using the Prime-it II kit (Stratagene) with [α-32P]dCTP. A glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein with ΔNP-CIP2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C.

After completion of the in situ washes, sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 10% normal goat serum (30 min) and treated with 3% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. PAM antibodies (Ab JH1761 directed to the amino-terminal third of PAM or Ab 471 directed toward the middle third of PAM) were used at 1:1000 dilutions on sections and coverslipped with Parafilm. For P-CIP2 immunocytochemical staining, Ab JH1998 was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunocytochemistry was performed using an avidin-biotin kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and visualized with horseradish peroxidase substrate. Sections were then dipped in photographic emulsion as described previously (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Adult rat brain was separated into soluble and crude particulate fractions or subjected to differential centrifugation. Equal volumes of soluble and particulate fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis with Ab JH2004. For preparation of soluble and crude particulate fractions, tissues were homogenized in a 10-fold volume excess of 0.25 m sucrose in 20 mm TES, pH 7.0, containing 0.3 mg/ml PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (29Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the pellet discarded; the supernatant was centrifuged at 372,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was re-suspended in a volume equal to the supernatant (soluble fraction). Differential centrifugation of parietal cortex was carried out according to Huttner et al. (32Huttner W.B.

Tissue was homogenized in 10 volumes of SHEEP buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.3 mg/ml PMSF). The homogenate was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min; the pellet was washed by re-suspension in the same volume of SHEEP buffer yielding the crude nuclear pellet (P1) and pooled supernatants (S1) that were centrifuged at 9200 ×g for 10 min. The crude synaptosomal pellet was washed and resuspended in SHEEP buffer (P2). The pooled supernatants (S2) were centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 15 min; the microsomal pellet was washed as before and resuspended in SHEEP buffer (P3). The final pooled supernatant (S3) is the cytosolic fraction. Immunoprecipitations were carried out according to the method of Ratovitski et al. (34Ratovitski E.A. Alam M.R. Quick R.A. McMillan A.

Briefly, the culture medium was removed from a confluent 100-mm dish and the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline.

Cells were scraped from the dish, and debris was removed by high-speed centrifugation. Extracts (300 μl) were diluted with 300 μl of extraction buffer, 1 μl of PMSF (30 mg/ml), 5 μl of inhibitor mixture, and 10 μl of P-CIP2 antibody (JH2004 or JH1998) or 10 μl of P-CIP2 antibody pre-blocked for 1 h on ice by incubation with 50 μg of P-CIP2 peptide (PKENPGRGQVFVEYANAGD, underlined in Fig. 1) for JH2004 or 50 μg of GST/P-CIP2 for JH1998. Antibody-extract mixtures were incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by addition of Protein A-agarose (Sigma) and agitation on ice for 1 h. Protein A-agarose beads were washed and boiled into loading buffer for separation by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel). Western blots used antibodies to PAM (Ab 629, 1:2000 dilution, or monoclonal antibody 6E6, 1:20 dilution of medium (35Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and were visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For mammalian expression of P-CIP2 or its mutants, AtT-20, COS, hEK-293, and pEAK-Rapid (Edge Biosystems) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% NuSerum (omitted for pEAK-Rapid cells) (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) and 10% fetal clone serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and plated in 75-cm2 flasks 1–2 days prior to transfection. Stable cell lines were created as described previously (21Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and selected by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting with myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (36Borjigin J. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 169: 14715-14722Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated on glass slides and immunostained as described (21Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial cell lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with glutathione, which was removed by dialysis. Mammalian cells stably transfected with vectors encoding P-CIP2mH, P-CIP2ccmH, or β-galactosidase-mH were scraped from culture dishes and extracted with 20 mmNa-TES/10 mm mannitol, pH 7.4, containing PMSF (30 mg/ml) and inhibitor mixture, followed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Extracts from mammalian cell pellets were diluted with an equal volume of 2× metal chelate resin binding buffer (1× is 10 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4). The diluted extracts were applied batchwise to His-bind metal affinity resin (Novagen) charged with Ni2+, or to Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen). Samples were incubated with resin for 30–60 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing, washed three times with 40 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and twice with 5 mmMgCl2 in Na-HEPES, pH 7.4. P-CIP2 was eluted with 1m imidazole and required at least a 10-fold dilution before it was assayed. pEAK-Rapid cells transiently transfected with the pEAK10 vector were extracted into isotonic sucrose buffer containing 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors, centrifuged at 430,000 × g for 15 min and the pellet was re-extracted with 50 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5, containing 1% Thesit and protease inhibitors. Most of the exogenous P-CIP2 was recovered in the pellet fraction following transient expression. P-CIP2 was purified from pEAK-Rapid extracts (≤100 μg of protein/μg of resin) using the His-bind resin, Talon resin (CLONTECH), or the Ni-NTA resin according to the manufacturers' instructions, and eluates were desalted into 50 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Thesit using NICK columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enzyme was added to the reaction mixture (40 or 50 μl) containing recombinant substrate (5 or 10 μg; PAM-CD, GST-PAM-CD, other GST fusion proteins); kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, 0.1% Thesit) containing 1 or 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each sample. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min. Positive control reactions utilized protein kinase C purified from rat brain (kindly provided by Carol Doherty and Dr. Richard Huganir, Howard Hughes Medical Institutes/Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine), bovine heart protein kinase A (Sigma), or recombinant human casein kinase II (Calbiochem). Reaction supernatants from stable transfections were precipitated with 20 μg of bovine serum albumin and 15% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, boiled into Laemmli loading buffer, loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and visualized by autoradiography. For transient expression in pEAK-Rapid cells, the reaction mixtures were loaded directly onto SDS-PAGE peptide gels (37Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transferred to nylon membranes, and visualized by autoradiography, direct staining, or Western analyses. Gels were stopped before the dye ran off and a 3-cm region behind the dye was cut off before transfer, to remove the free [γ-32P]ATP (38Ferrari S. Thomas G. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation. Academic Press, Boston1998: 371-381Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated products was performed as described (39Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using sequential pH 1.9 and pH 3.5 thin layer electrophoresis. P-CIP2 and commercial kinases were combined with 5 μg of synthetic peptide and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in Hepes-Mg-Thesit for 30 min at 37 oC, followed by addition of 5 μg of Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin. PAM peptides were synthesized by Dr. Henry Keutmann, Massachusetts General Hospital (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Samples were left on ice for 30 min, centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatant spotted onto P81 ion exchange paper (Whatman) prewetted with 1% phosphoric acid. One-eighth of each reaction was analyzed; samples were analyzed in duplicate. Samples were washed repeatedly in 1% phosphoric acid, finally rinsed in acetone, air dried, and submitted to Cerenkov counting (38Ferrari S. Thomas G. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation. Academic Press, Boston1998: 371-381Google Scholar, 40Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation. Academic Press, Boston1998: 36-63Google Scholar). Data are reported as mean ± S.E. We previously used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the COOH-terminal domain (CD) of PAM-1 (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28340-28636Google Scholar). One of these PAM-COOH-terminalinteractor proteins (P-CIPs) contained an almost complete putative protein kinase domain followed by a putative RNA binding motif and a stop codon. Comparison of the predicted molecular mass (44 kDa) with the band observed in Western blots of endogenous P-CIP2 in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cell extracts (47 kDa) indicated that the complete cDNA would encode additional residues at the amino terminus. Subsequent screening of a random primed rat hippocampal cDNA library identified an additional 27 amino acids preceding the known P-CIP2 sequence. Thus, the full-length P-CIP2 cDNA encodes a 419-residue protein with a predicted mass of 46.5 kDa. Consistent with this, in vitro translation of full-length clones of P-CIP2 yielded a 46.5-kDa product (data not shown) and the protein observed in AtT-20 cell extracts by Western blot analysis has an apparent molecular mass (M r) of 47 kDa (24Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28340-28636Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the amino acid sequence of P-CIP2 with the most homologous protein kinases according to BLASTP analysis. The kinases shown, most of which are Ser/Thr protein kinases, share 22–30% identity with P-CIP2 within the catalytic core of 250 residues. The greatest sequence variation among these kinases occurs in subdomains X and XI and following subdomain XI. While the sequence Asp158-Leu-Lys-Pro-Arg-Asn in subdomain VI suggests that P-CIP2 belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase family, P-CIP2 also shares moderate homology with the dual specificity (Ser/Thr and Tyr) kinase PYT and has some residues normally considered diagnostic for Tyr kinases (40Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation. Academic Press, Boston1998: 36-63Google Scholar). The non-conserved residues presumably affect the substrate specificity of P-CIP2, which is remarkable (see below). BLASTP comparison of P-CIP2 versus the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genome Data base showed that the most homologous yeast protein kinases are members of the MAP/ERK kinase family including SMK1, HOG1 (shown in Fig. 1), SLT2, KSS1, and FUS3; the most similar yeast kinase, HOG1, shows 14% identity and 30% similarity within the catalytic core. These yeast MAP kinases are"

The active site manganese ion is complexed by histidine and aspartic amino acid side chains forming a trigonal pyramidal coordination polyhedron (Fig.1). Studies on the closely related FeSODs suggest that this arrangement of protein ligands is independent of the presence of the metal ion, being nearly identical for holo- and apo-enzymes (21Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Yamakura F. Suzuki K. Ohmori D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 218: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).

To investigate the structural determinants underlying thermophily and other thermally activated protein processes, we have cloned a semisynthetic gene for T. thermophilus MnSOD (TTSOD) and succeeded in expressing the recombinant protein at high levels inE. coli. The heterologous TTSOD is isolated primarily as the apo-protein, a surprising contrast to the homologous E. colienzyme, whose apo-protein readily binds manganese or other metals present in solution at ambient temperature (24Privalle C.T. Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Beyer W.F. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abundant supply of purified apo-enzyme from the recombinant expression system provides a unique opportunity to explore the metallation of a thermophilic MnSOD in vitro. T. thermophilus HB8 (ATCC 27634) was grown in culture medium containing 8 g/liter polypeptone, 4 g/liter yeast extract, and 3 g/liter NaCl adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH (20Sato S. Nakazawa K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2 mg/liter of MnSO4·H2O. Fermentation cultures of T. thermophilus for protein biomass preparation were grown at 65 °C in a New Brunswick Scientific BioFlo 3000 Bioreactor wrapped in a quilted insulating jacket to reduce heat loss. E. coli sodA mutant strain QC781 (26Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center of Yale University. Competent E. coli QC781 sodA cells were prepared according to standard procedures. Manganese superoxide dismutase was purified from T. thermophilus as described previously (20Sato S. Nakazawa K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by optical absorption measurements, using the previously reported extinction coefficients ( E2801%= 15.8 (20Sato S. Nakazawa K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). T. thermophilus HB8 grown overnight in 100 ml of polypeptone medium in stationary culture at 65 °C. The centrifuged cell pellet was subjected to Qiagen genomic Midiprep procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for amplification of the MnSOD structural gene from T. thermophilus HB8 genomic DNA were designed by backtranslation of the reported amino acid sequence (27Sato S. Nakada Y. Nakazawa-Tomizawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using standard Thermus codon usage (28Delphin M.E. Stockwell P.A. Tate W.P. Brown C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 293-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The forward primer, a 34-mer oligonucleotide, was 5′-CCAGCGCATATGCCGTACCCGTTCAAGCTACCCG-3′. The reverse primer, a 2-fold degenerate 44-mer oligonucleotide, was 5′-GCTGGACGGATCCATTAGGCCTTGAAGAACTCCTCGGCSACG 3′ (S = G + C). Genomic DNA isolated as described above was probed with the TTSOD primer set using the proofreadingPfu polymerase (Stratagene) to amplify the MnSOD structural gene. A single major product band was extracted from 1% agarose gel electrophoresis of the reaction mixture and recovered by blunt end ligation to the pBluescript cloning vector (Stratagene) to produce pTTSDPCR vector for transformation into a chemically competent blue/white detection strain of E. coli (Epicurian Coli XL-1, Stratagene). Positive transformants were isolated as single colonies and screened by restriction digestion of miniprep DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the pTTSDPCR insert was determined by DNA sequence analysis (Molecular Biology Core Facility, Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, Beaverton, OR). The pGB1 expression vector containing the oxygen-inducible PSodA promoter (29Gao B. Flores S.C. Bose S.K. McCord J.M. Gene ( Amst .). 1996; 176: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Joe McCord (Webb-Waring Institute for Biomedical Research, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). To facilitate subcloning the semisynthetic TTSOD gene for expression, the pGB1 vector was subjected to three rounds of in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuickChangeTM procedure to eliminate BamHI restriction sites in the flanking regions of the vector and to replace the original NsiI/SacI cloning site with an NdeI/BamHI/EcoRI cassette to produce the derivative pQGB1. The expression vector pQGBTTSD was constructed by NdeI/BamHI double digestion of both pQGB1 and pTTSDPCR followed by vectorial ligation of the gel-purified products. Ligation products were transformed into Stratagene Epicurian Coli XL-1 ultracompetent cells and screened for inserts, and the miniprep DNA from a positive clone was used to transform competent E. coli QC781 sodA cells for protein expression. E. colicultures for protein biomass were grown in 2× LB medium supplemented with 1% glucose with or without addition of manganese salt up to 2 mm and 125 μg/ml ampicillin (30Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22188-22193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further additions of ampicillin (150 mg/liter) were made hourly after the optical density reached 0.3 at 600 nm, and a second addition of 1% glucose was made at midlog phase. Fermentations were routinely performed in a 10-liter New Brunswick Scientific BioFlo 3000 Bioreactor. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with vigorous agitation and O2 purging. Superoxide dismutase was purified as described previously (30Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22188-22193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with an additional Chromatofocussing chromatography step using PBE-94 polybuffer exchanger and Polybuffer-74 ampholyte but without heat treatment or CM-52 ion exchange chromatography. The enzyme was detected in chromatographic elution profiles by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For time course experiments, 50-μl samples prepared by combining purified apo-enzyme (0.5 mmactive sites in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) with 10 mmMnCl2 ·4H2O in 500-μl thin walled polypropylene tubes were heated in a thermal minicycler (MJ Research) and stored at 4 °C. Temperature dependence studies were performed using 10 mm MnCl2·4H2O for 30 min at various temperatures followed by rapid quenching at 4 °C. For preparative metal reconstitution, purified apo-enzyme (0.5 mm active sites in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) was combined with 10 mm metal salts and heated at 65 °C for 2 h. Manganese reconstitution was performed with MnCl2·4H2O under air and unbound metal was removed by dialysis followed by concentration and gel filtration (Bio-Gel P-30, 1 × 45 cm). Iron reconstitution was performed anaerobically using Fe(NH4)2 (SO4)2·6H2O and 2 mmascorbate to reduce the amount of adventitiously bound Fe(III). Excess metal was removed by anaerobic dialysis against two changes of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm ascorbate and gel filtration. Vanadium reconstitution was performed using sodium metavanadate (NaVO3) under air followed by dialysis and gel filtration. Molecular mass determination was made by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200-HR column (1.5 × 99 cm) developed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was calibrated by chromatographing molecular mass standards (blue dextran, 200 kDa; native Thermus MnSOD, 92.6 kDa; E. coli MnSOD, 46 kDa; horse heart cytochromec, 12.4 kDa) (1.5–2 mg in each sample), and the relative molecular mass of the eluted fractions for recombinantThermus MnSOD were estimated by evaluating the effective distribution coefficient K av = (V e −V 0)/(V t −V 0), where V 0 is the elution volume for blue dextran, V e is the elution volume for the protein sample, and V t is the total column volume. SOD activity was measured using the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c inhibition assay (6McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at room temperature. Bromoperoxidase activity was measured by following the bromination of monochlorodimedone at 290 nm (31Yamada H. Itoh N. Murakami S. Izumi Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 2961-2967Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Optical absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Instruments Cary 5 UV-visible near infrared absorption spectrometer interfaced with a microcomputer for data acquisition. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Varian E-109 X-Band EPR spectrometer equipped with an Air Products helium flow cryostat. First derivative powder EPR spectra were simulated using the program sim15 (Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange QCPE265). Samples of Mn(II)SOD for EPR spectroscopy were prepared by addition the equivalent amount of dithionite under argon. Vanadium-substituted enzyme was prepared for EPR spectroscopy by addition of dithionite (to 25 mm) and incubation under argon at room temperature for 30 min. Metal ion analyses were performed using a Varian Instruments SpectrAA atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with a GTA 96 graphite furnace for high sensitivity metal determinations. Amplification of the SodA structural gene for T. thermophilus HB8 MnSOD was achieved using primers back-translated from the N-terminal and C-terminal protein sequence data (27Sato S. Nakada Y. Nakazawa-Tomizawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using the established pattern of Thermus codon usage (28Delphin M.E. Stockwell P.A. Tate W.P. Brown C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 293-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 3′-primer includes an efficient tetranucleotide termination sequence (TAAT) suitable for high level expression of recombinant protein inE. coli (32Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This primer set allowed selective amplification of the SodA structural gene from purifiedT. thermophilus HB8 genomic DNA as the starting point for vector construction. Because both 5′ and 3′ end sequences are determined by synthetic oligonucleotide primers based on protein rather than nucleotide sequence data specifically designed to facilitate subcloning and expression, we describe the product as a semisynthetic gene. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified product is identical to that reported for T. thermophilus HB27 (GenBankTM accession number 3062846) and preserves 93% identity with the SodA gene from Thermus aquaticus YT-1 (GenBankTM accession number 217183), implying identity and near-identity of the corresponding conceptual protein sequences. For expression in E. coli, the semisynthetic gene was transferred into a vector (pQGB1) derived from the oxygen-regulated expression vector pGB1 (29Gao B. Flores S.C. Bose S.K. McCord J.M. Gene ( Amst .). 1996; 176: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by elimination of superfluous restriction sites and modification of the linker sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. The alteration allows insertion of any gene flanked by either NdeI/BamHI orNdeI/EcoRI restriction sites under the oxygen-sensitive PSodA promoter. In the E. coli sodA background, expression of TTSOD from this vector exceeds 1200 mg/230 g wet cells under forced oxygen conditions. Recombinant TTSOD is purified as a soluble, tetrameric protein with a relative molecular mass (100,700 Da) (Fig.2) slightly larger that of the native TTSOD (calculated tetrameric mass 92,600 Da based on amino acid sequence (27Sato S. Nakada Y. Nakazawa-Tomizawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). However, the majority of the heterologous protein produced by E. coli is isolated as metal-free apo-protein, even when the culture medium is supplemented with up to 2 mm MnSO4. In contrast, the native enzyme isolated from Thermus contains 0.5 g atom manganese/active site (20Sato S. Nakazawa K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Table I). The recombinant enzyme contains less than 0.1 g atom manganese/active site and lacks significant amounts of either iron or zinc. The apo-protein elutes as a broad trailing band on both ion exchange and chomatofocussing chromatography columns, allowing it to be purified from the minority manganese-containing fraction.Table IMetal content of native, recombinant, and reconstituted Thermus MnSODSamples (source)Metal contentManganeseIronVanadateZincg atom/mol active site1Native TTSOD (Thermus)0.502rTTSOD (E. coli)0.030.0232, after manganese reconstitution0.6042, after iron reconstitution0.030.805rTTSOD (E. coli)0.270.065, after iron reconstitution0.250.657rTTSOD (E. coli)0.00.0187, after iron reconstitution0.8097, after vanadate reconstitution0.60 Open table in a new tab The apo-protein lacks dismutase activity, and incubation with Mn(II) salts at ambient temperature does not lead to activation. However, the full activity of the enzyme can be restored by incubating the protein in the presence of Mn(II) at elevated temperature (65 °C). The time course of reactivation, shown in Fig. 3(top panel) follows a simple exponential progress curve, yielding an estimate of the effective first order rate constant for the reaction (k Mn = 4 m−1min−1). The linear [manganese] dependence of the activation process (Fig. 3, bottom panel) indicates that the reaction is first order in Mn(II) ion, with no evidence of saturation up to 15 mm. Reactivation requires Mn(II) to be present during the heating step, because initial heat annealing followed by incubation with Mn(II) at ambient temperature did not lead to reactivation (Fig. 3, top panel). The temperature dependence of this process is shown in Fig. 4. Virtually no reactivation is observed for incubation of apoTTSOD with Mn(II) at temperatures below approximately 45 °C, yet above that temperature there is an abrupt increase in the reactivation rate, tracing out a sigmoidal activation profile spanning a 20° C transition range with an effective midpoint temperature of 62 °C (335 K).Figure 4Temperature dependence of reactivation of recombinant Thermus MnSOD with MnCl2.The experimental conditions were 0.5 mm apo-protein, 10 mm MnCl2 in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, heated at the indicated temperature for 30 min. Aliquots of these reactions were assayed for SOD activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The reconstituted Mn(II) enzyme spontaneously autooxidizes in air to form a purple Mn(III) complex that exhibits an optical absorption spectrum nearly indistinguishable from that of the native TTSOD (ε478 = 520 m−1cm−1) (Fig. 5, top panel). The EPR spectrum of the reduced reconstituted Mn(II) complex reproduces that recorded for the native enzyme (Fig. 5,bottom panel), both spectra being dominated by intense absorption near g = 6 exhibiting well resolved55Mn hyperfine splittings, reflecting nearly identical environments for the metal ions in the two proteins. Incubation of the TTSOD apo-protein with Fe(II) under the same conditions results in uptake of iron, which spontaneously oxidizes in air to an Fe(III) complex. The iron content of iron-substituted, reconstituted TTSOD is relatively high, with approximately 80% of the sites occupied (Table I, samples 4 and 7). The manganese content of a fraction of rTTSOD containing relatively high Mn (Table I, sample 5) is unchanged during reconstitution with iron and the extent of conversion to the iron complex is proportionally lower for that sample (Table I, sample 6), indicating that iron does not displace manganese already bound to the protein and that the two metal ions compete for the same binding site. The optical spectrum of the iron-substituted TTSOD at low pH (Fig. 6, spectrum 1) exhibits an intense nearly UV absorption (ε350 = 1500m−1 cm−1), which is sensitive to pH, bleaching as the pH of the solution is raised above 6 (Fig. 6,spectra 1–9), with an effective pK a = 6.8 (Fig. 6, inset). Azide binds to the Fe(III) enzyme (K d = 0.1 mm) producing a complex with optical spectra (data not shown) similar to those observed for the corresponding derivative of iron-substituted E. coli MnSOD (ε390 = 1300 m−1cm−1) (33Yamakura F. Matsumoto T. Kobayashi K. Asada K. Yoshikawa T. Frontiers of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 115-118Google Scholar, 34Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8923-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of the Fe(III) complex at low pH (Fig. 7 A) and high pH (Fig. 7 B) are also distinct, reflecting a change toward more axial electronic symmetry at higher pH (from rhombicityE/D = 0.22, pH 5.0, toE/D = 0.1, pH 8.0). Aside from a minority signal near g = 4.3 associated with adventitiously bound Fe(III), the spectra are clean, reflecting a unique coordination environment for the metal ion. Azide binding results in a complex exhibiting nearly maximal rhombicity (E/D = 0.28) (Fig. 7 C).Figure 7EPR spectra of iron-substituted recombinantThermus MnSOD . Iron-reconstituted TTSOD (0.5 mm active sites, in 50 mmKH2PO4 buffer) at pH 5.0 (A), 8.0 (B), or 5.0 (C) in the presence of 10 mm NaN3 is shown. The instrumental parameters were: temperature, 10 K; microwave frequency, 9.34 GHz; microwave power, 2 mW; modulation amplitude, 10 G; gain, 1 × 104 (A), 5 × 104(B), and 1.25 × 103 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The apo-protein will also bind vanadate present in solution during the heat treatment, with approximately the same occupancy as observed for manganese reconstitution (0.6 g atom vanadate/active site) (Table I, sample 9). The vanadium-substituted enzyme is colorless, lacking visible absorption and EPR spectra. However, following treatment with 25 mm dithionite, a V(IV) EPR spectrum is observed (Fig.8, top spectrum). Integration of the signal for a sample incubated with dithionite for 30 min yielded spin quantitation, indicating that about 50% of the vanadium in the protein was EPR active. Simulation of the spectrum (Fig. 8,bottom spectrum) yields estimates of the ground state parameters: g ∥ = 1.947,g ⊥ =1.980, a ∥ = 183 G, a ⊥ = 63 G, with orientation-dependent line width ΓFWHM,∥ = 14 G, ΓFWHM, ⊥ = 16 G. The vanadate complex has no detectable haloperoxidase activity. As observed for the reaction of the apoprotein with Mn(II), there was no significant incorporation of metals following incubation of the apoenzyme with either Fe(II) or vanadate salts at room temperature. The superoxide dismutase activity of TTSOD reconstituted with either iron or vanadium was less than 30 units/mg. The recent rapid expansion of biotechnological applications of thermostable enzymes has stimulated widespread interest in the biochemistry and molecular biology of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms (35Adams M.W.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, the extreme conditions required for growth and maintenance of these organisms presents a problem for large scale isolation of proteins from their native sources (36Adams M.W.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although cloning may permit high level expression of the recombinant thermophilic protein in a mesophilic host, the protein is sometimes inactive at ambient temperatures, regaining activity on heating to near the physiological growth temperature of the source organism (35Adams M.W.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 36Adams M.W.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. BioTechnology. 1995; 13: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The requirement for a degree of thermal excitation for biological function implies a dynamical dimension to the architecture of thermophilic proteins that is only beginning to be explored. This type of temperature-dependent behavior can be modeled as a progressive melting of protein structure as the temperature is raised. A local melting model has been applied to understanding a surprising temperature dependence of active site ligand interactions in both mesophilic and thermophilic MnSODs (37Whittaker J.W. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 674-677Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and a thermophilic shift in enzyme properties (23Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 667-671Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have cloned the MnSOD from T. thermophilus to investigate the molecular origins of these effects through recombinant expression and mutagenesis studies. Although the primary structure of the T. thermophilus HB8 MnSOD has been known for more than a decade (27Sato S. Nakada Y. Nakazawa-Tomizawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme has been solved (15Ludwig M.L. Metzger A.L. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. J. Mol.

Using the published protein sequence, we have isolated the coding sequence from genomic DNA and constructed a vector for high level expression in E. coli.

To understand how primer length and sequence affect generation and utilization of the PPT, we employed short hybrid substrates containing or lacking the PPT to evaluate cleavage, extension, and binding by reverse transcriptase. Substrates containing RNAs with the correct 3′ end for initiation of plus-strand synthesis were extended equally well by reverse transcriptase, but primer length affected susceptibility to RNase H cleavage. RNA substrates with 3′ ends extending beyond the plus-strand initiation site were extended poorly but were specifically cleaved to generate the correct 3′ end for initiation of plus-strand synthesis. Substrates containing RNAs lacking the PPT were cleaved nonspecifically and extended inefficiently. Specific cleavages to generate the plus-strand primer and 5′-end-directed cleavages were kinetically favored over cleavages that destroyed the PPT primer or degraded other short RNA fragments. The PPT was not intrinsically resistant to cleavage by the isolated RNase H domain, and the isolated polymerase domain extended RNA primers containing the PPT sequence irrespective of the primer 3′ end.

Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase the RNase H-deficient version of reverse transcriptase containing point mutations that eliminate RNase H activity a version of reverse transcriptase that completely lacks the RNase H domain a version of reverse transcriptase that completely lacks the polymerase domain polypurine tract human immunodeficiency virus nucleotide(s) dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin long terminal repeats Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV)1 converts its single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome into a double-stranded DNA molecule through the replicative process termed reverse transcription (reviewed in Ref. 1Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Cold Spring Harbor Monogr. Ser. 1993; 23Google Scholar). Minus-strand DNA synthesis initiates from a host cell-derived tRNA primer and extends through a unique sequence (U5) and a terminal repeat sequence (R) at the 5′ end of the genome before carrying out the first template jump to a second R sequence found at the 3′ end of the viral genome. As minus-sense DNA synthesis progresses, a purine-rich sequence in the RNA genome termed the polypurine tract (PPT) that lies immediately adjacent to a downstream unique sequence (U3) is copied and subsequently cleaved to generate the PPT primer. This primer is used to initiate plus-strand DNA synthesis, which extends through U3-R-U5 and continues after a second jump to the 5′ end of the DNA template. Displacement synthesis is required to complete duplex DNA synthesis and formation of the redundant DNA ends called long terminal repeats (LTRs) (2Whiting S.H. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4747-4758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multifunctional enzyme that carries out this replicative process is the virally encoded reverse transcriptase (1Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Cold Spring Harbor Monogr. Ser. 1993; 23Google Scholar). For M-MuLV, reverse transcriptase is a 75-kDa polypeptide that contains an amino-terminal RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and a carboxyl-terminal RNase H activity that cleaves the RNA portion of an RNA/DNA hybrid. The RNase H and polymerase activities of reverse transcriptase are separable (3Tanese N. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cold Spring Harbor Monogr. Ser. 1993; 23Google Scholar). A truncated form of reverse transcriptase that is missing the RNase H domain results in a functional polymerase with decreased processivity (6Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An NH2-terminal deletion of reverse transcriptase lacking the polymerase domain retains an enzymatically active form of RNase H, but this domain has lost much of the specificity associated with the intact enzyme (8Schultz S.J.

The polymerase-dependent activity of RNase H is spatially and temporally coordinated by association of the polymerase domain with a 3′ DNA primer terminus in association with an RNA template. Biochemical and structural studies have suggested that the spatial locations of DNA polymerase and RNase H active sites are approximately 15–20 bases apart on an RNA/DNA hybrid (10Furfine E.S.

A series of RNAs containing all, some, or none of the PPT sequence were annealed to longer DNAs to generate model hybrid substrates representing various primer-template possibilities that might occur at or near the beginning of plus-strand DNA synthesis. When these substrates were used to assay the polymerase-independent activity of RNase H, the sequence and length of the RNA dictated the cleavage pattern. When used as primers for extension, reverse transcriptase extended best those primers that contained the correct 3′ PPT primer terminus used for plus-strand DNA synthesis. These studies offer insights into how reverse transcriptase associates with sequences containing or lacking the PPT and extend our understanding of the initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis. Recombinant wild type M-MuLV reverse transcriptase, Sequenase version 2.0, and calf alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Superscript (RTΔH), Superscript II (H−RT), and BamHI were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from both New England Biolabs and Life Technologies, Inc. The separate RNase H domain of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (RTΔPol) was obtained as described previously (8Schultz S.J. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8630-8638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage site generating the PPT primer for plus-strand synthesis of M-MuLV is located between positions 7815 and 7816 on the plus-sense viral genome (33Shinnick T.M. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1981; 293: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and these two residues are designated positions −1 and +1, respectively, for the purposes of naming the oligonucleotides used in this study. Thus the name of a given oligonucleotide begins with an R or D designation for oligoribonucleotide or oligodeoxyribonucleotide, respectively, followed by the 5′ end position, a backslash, and the 3′ end position relative to the PPT cleavage site. Four 38-mer long oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used as the template strands as follows: D+39/+2 (5′-TAAGCTAGCTTGCCAAACCTACAGGTGGGGTCTTTCAT-3′); D−36/−73 (5′-TTTTATCTATGGCTCGTACTCTATAGGCTTCAGCTGGT-3′); D+10/−28 (5′-GTCTTTCATTCCCCCCTTTTTCTGGAGACTAAATAAAA-3′); and D+26/−12 (5′-CAAACCTACAGGTGGGGTCTTTCATTCCCCCCTTTTTC-3′). The sequences and relative positions of the primer oligonucleotides are shown in Fig.1. Construction of bacteriophage M13LTR1 was similar to that of M13LTR2 (34Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9976-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and will be described in detail elsewhere. 2C. D. Kelleher and J. J. Champoux, submitted for publication. The long DNA strand was generated by isolating the single-stranded insert from M13LTR1 as described previously for ssLTR2i (34Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9976-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) except that restriction enzyme digestion was with BamHI and the resulting 5′ overhang was filled in with Sequenase to yield a blunt-end product. The resulting 807-nt fragment is single-stranded DNA (except for 16 nucleotides at either end that remain duplex) and contains a single M-MuLV LTR and surrounding sequences (minus-strand nucleotides 7756–8330 joined to nucleotides 69–231 (33Shinnick T.M. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1981; 293: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)).BamHI-linearized plasmid DNA (pGEMLTR1)2 was transcribed using the RiboMAX kit (Promega) to produce a 753-nt RNA corresponding to M-MuLV plus-strand positions 7756–8330 joined to positions 69–231 plus 10 nucleotides of vector sequence at the 5′ end. This RNA is completely complementary to the long DNA strand above and anneals 46 nucleotides downstream of the DNA 3′ end. The first 20 nucleotides of this RNA begin with the sequence 5′-GGGCGAAUUCUAGAGUACGA … -3′. The RNA was gel-isolated by electroelution from a denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3m urea (Sequagel; National Diagnostics). The 5′-triphosphate was removed by calf alkaline phosphatase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C, and the RNA was purified on QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen). Oligonucleotides and the 753-nt RNA were 5′-end-labeled in a 20-μl reaction containing 70 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmDTT, 20–30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 6–10 pmol of oligonucleotide or RNA, and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 60 min and stopped with 10 mm EDTA. R−20/−1, R−18/−1, R−17/−1, R−16/−1, R−15/−1, R−14/−1, R−13/−1,d−13/−1, R−13/+3, and R−13/+7 were annealed to template D+10/−28. R−58/−46 was annealed to template D−36/−73; R+4/+16 and D+4/+16 were annealed to template D+26/−12, and R+17/+29 was annealed to template D+39/+2. A 50-μl reaction containing 5 pmol of 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide and 10 pmol of template DNA in 0.2 m NaCl and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was heated at 90 °C for 3 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. The reactions was heated at 37 °C for 15 min, precipitated with 2 μg of glycogen, and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Despite using excess template in all cases, the efficiency of annealing different RNA primers varied, most likely from primer secondary structure and especially in PPT-containing oligonucleotides. To compensate for such variations, hybrids were quantitated by analysis in non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels, and equal amounts of hybrids were used in the experiments. 0.1 pmol (5 nm final concentration) of a hybrid oligonucleotide substrate was treated with 1 pmol of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase or 60 pmol of RTΔPol (an amount corresponding to the same RNase H activity as 1 pmol of reverse transcriptase) in a 20-μl reaction containing RNase H cleavage buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 100 μg per ml of BSA) at 37 °C. After 15 min, a 10-μl sample was added to 20 μl of formamide stop mix (80% deionized formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 0.2% xylene cyanol), and samples were analyzed in a 20% sequencing gel. Hybrid oligonucleotide substrates (ranging in concentration from 0.625 to 225 nm) were incubated with 0.002 pmol (0.1 nm final concentration) of reverse transcriptase or RTΔPol in a 20-μl reaction containing RNase H cleavage buffer at 37 °C. At 1, 4, and 16 min, a 2.5-μl aliquot was removed from each reaction and added to 5 μl of formamide stop mix. Samples were fractionated in a 20% sequencing gel and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. Individual gel lanes were quantified as rectangular objects using the area integration function of the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) to determine the amount of cleavage products in femtomoles for each sample. To ensure that the substrate concentration remained essentially constant over the concentration range of the analysis, the amount of product was determined at the 1-min time point for substrates R−13/+7 and R−13/+3 and at the 60-min time point for substrate R−20/−1 in the reactions with reverse transcriptase. For RTΔPol, the amount of product was determined at the 16-min time point for all substrates. The velocity of the reaction, V 0, was expressed as femtomoles of product per min. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/[S] versus1/V 0 was used to calculate theV max and K m for each product analyzed. Representative V max andK m values were corroborated by plotting representative data using the direct linear plot of Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden (35Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Each analysis was carried out two to three times. The long hybrid substrate was prepared by annealing 6.4 pmol of 5′-end-labeled 753-nt RNA with 7.6 pmol of long DNA in 200 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA for 45 min at 67 °C. Cleavage assays were carried out in 16-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT with hybrid substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 40 nm. Reactions were preincubated for 1 min at 37 °C, initiated by the addition of 1.6 fmol of reverse transcriptase (0.1 nm final concentration), incubated for 1 min at 37 °C, and terminated by adding formamide and EDTA to a final concentration of 73.5% and 7.5 mm, respectively. Products were analyzed in a 20% sequencing gel and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Using data from two experiments, K m andV max values were determined using a Lineweaver-Burk plot as described above. Substrates were incubated with the same number of polymerase activity units (15.2) of RTΔH or H−RT, or with 8 units of Sequenase in a 20-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 200 μm dNTPs at 37 °C for 15 min. 5-μl aliquots were removed, added to 10 μl of formamide stop mix, and analyzed in a 20% sequencing gel. 2 fmol of duplex oligonucleotide substrates (0.1 nm) were incubated with 0.2 to 64 nm of H−RT or reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 9 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm DTT, and 150 μg per ml of BSA at 37 °C. After 15 min, 4 μl of 50% glycerol was added, and 10 μl of each sample was loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide, 0.13% bisacrylamide gel containing 1× high ionic strength gel buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3–8.5, 162 mm glycine) that was pre-chilled at 4 °C (6Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Gels were electrophoresed at 4 °C in 1× high ionic strength gel buffer at 100 V for 60 min, dried on Whatman 3MM paper, and exposed to autoradiography film or a PhosphorImager screen. Individual gel lanes were quantified using ImageQuant Software as described above to determine the amount of free duplex substrate. The dissociation constant, K d, is defined as the concentration of enzyme at which 50% of the substrate remains unbound (36Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and was determined by plotting the amount of free substrate as a function of enzyme concentration. Each experiment was performed two to eight times. To create the PPT primer used for plus-strand DNA synthesis, the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase cleaves the viral RNA hybridized to minus-strand DNA within the highly conserved PPT sequence between a G nucleotide and an A nucleotide (which we have designated as the −1 and +1 positions on the viral genome, respectively) (Fig. 1) (1Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Cold Spring Harbor Monogr. Ser. 1993; 23Google Scholar). Some studies have shown that a short RNA fragment annealed to a longer DNA is recognized by reverse transcriptase as a substrate for degradation and not as a primer for DNA synthesis (28DeStefano J.J.

To understand better how reverse transcriptase might generate a PPT primer that escapes further RNase H degradation and facilitates plus-strand DNA synthesis, we initially tested whether length affected the recognition of PPT-containing RNA fragments as substrates for the RNase H activity of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase. 5′-End-labeled oligoribonucleotides containing the PPT sequence and ranging in length from 13 to 20 nt were each annealed to the 38-mer template D+10/−28 to generate partially duplex oligonucleotide substrates (Fig. 1). These substrates were incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of reverse transcriptase, and the resulting products were resolved in a 20% sequencing gel to assess qualitatively the extent of RNase H cleavages (Fig. 2). In all cases, control incubations showed no substrate degradation (Fig. 2, odd numbered lanes) when compared with the original 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides (data not shown). Substrate R−18/−1 contained detectable amounts of smaller fragments ranging from 7 to 12 nt in size, but these fragments did not affect interpretation of the results (Fig. 2 A, lanes 15 and 16). The two substrates that span the plus-strand initiation site, R−13/+7 and R−13/+3, were both cleaved to generate a primary product 13 nt in length with a 3′ end at position −1, corresponding to the PPT primer terminus (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 4, arrow). Minor cleavage products of higher molecular weight corresponding to a 15- and a 14-mer for substrate R−13/+7 and a 14-mer for substrate R−13/+3 were also apparent. Another set of RNA oligonucleotides had 3′ termini at position −1 but differed in the positions of their 5′ ends, extending from 13 nt (primer R−13/−1) to 20 nt (primer R−20/−1) upstream of the plus-strand initiation site (Fig. 1). When these RNAs were annealed to template D+10/−28, the resulting hybrid substrates exhibited a gradation of increasing cleavage as the RNA primer length increased (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and18). Substrates with shorter RNAs such as R−13/−1 and R−14/−1 appeared more resistant to RNase H cleavages, whereas substrate R−20/−1 was cleaved the most extensively (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6, 8 and 18, respectively). A paucity of fragments smaller than 6 or 7 nt in length (data not shown) suggested that very little cleavage occurred toward the 5′ end of the primer. Most cleavages in the longer RNAs (R−17/−1, R−18/−1, R−20/−1) occurred in the stretch of G nucleotides found in the PPT just upstream of the plus-strand initiation site (see Fig. 1) and likely result from an RNA 5′-end-directed cleavage mechanism (28DeStefano J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). We next addressed whether PPT-containing substrate R−13/−1 was more resistant to RNase H cleavage because of its short length or because it exclusively contained the PPT sequence. The ability of RNase H to cleave this substrate was compared with 13-mer oligoribonucleotides of different, non-PPT sequence that were positioned equivalently on appropriate 38-mer length template DNAs (see Fig. 1). As before, substrate R−13/−1 remained relatively resistant to the RNase H activity, but the other 13-mer duplex substrates that lacked PPT sequences were cleaved into fragments ranging from 7 to 11 nt in length (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–8). Previously we reported that a form of reverse transcriptase that lacks the polymerase domain, termed RTΔPol in this study, contains an enzymatically active RNase H domain (8Schultz S.J. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8630-8638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether the polymerase domain contributes to the specificity of reverse transcriptase for RNA primers derived from the PPT, we evaluated the ability of RTΔPol to cleave the duplex oligonucleotide substrates that contained PPT sequences. Under identical conditions to those described above for reverse transcriptase, RTΔPol did not selectively produce the PPT primer from substrates R−13/+7 or R−13/+3 but instead cleaved at multiple sites upstream and downstream of the plus-strand initiation site as well (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–4). The absence of the polymerase domain in RTΔPol also rendered substrates with shorter primers susceptible to RNase H degradation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–12). Notably, products ranging in size from 1 to 13 nt were apparent, indicating that cleavage could occur at every possible position throughout the PPT. RTΔPol also cleaved the 13-mer duplex substrates lacking PPT sequences more extensively than reverse transcriptase (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–8). In the preceding experiments, we observed specific RNase H cleavages that generated the PPT primer as well as those that occurred within the PPT or in short 13-mers that lacked PPT sequences. We next asked if the specific cleavages required to generate the PPT primer were k"

Molecular cloning efforts over the past decade, however, have demonstrated the Ca2+ channel family to exhibit a degree of heterogeneity greatly exceeding expectations based on functional criteria. For example, genes for class A and class B Ca2+ channel α1 subunits give rise to more than 10 alternatively spliced products that exhibit only very subtle differences in biophysical assays (1Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All of these variants are likely to be tightly coupled to the exocytotic apparatus in neural tissue, and multiple types are co-expressed in individual nerve terminals. Providing a physiological rationale for such apparent redundancy is an important challenge in the Ca2+ channel field. Given that the functions of Ca2+ channel types are differentially controlled by the integration of multiple regulators (e.g.membrane potential, Ca2+ channel accessory subunits, intracellular Ca2+, G proteins, and kinases), identifying the structural elements underlying each type of regulation and the mechanisms by which they interact may provide tools necessary to link the structural heterogeneity to functional consequences. Molecular cloning of Ca2+ channel cDNAs is making such structure-function studies possible, and the identification of channels with distinct functional and pharmacological fingerprints are particularly useful in this effort. Ca2+ currents in embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG)1 neurons differ in significant ways from those in other species. Although the Ca2+ currents are entirely blocked by ω-conotoxin GVIA (defining them as N-type, see Ref. 2Cox D.H. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 906-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of inhibition is approximately 10-fold slower than that for N channels in rat DRG neurons. In addition, they are inactivated, in part, by a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (3Cox D.H. Dunlap K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 311-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), similar to inactivation ofl-type channels (4Yue D.T. Backx P.H. Imredy J.P. Science. 1990; 250: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); the inactivation of other N channels, however, is thought to be exclusively voltage-dependent (5Jones S.W. Marks T.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,6Jones L.P. DeMaria C.D. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2530-2552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Differences in the predominant mechanisms underlying G protein-mediated modulation of chick and other N channels are also well known (7Dunlap K. Ikeda S.R. Semin. Neurosci. 1998; 9: 198-208Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All of these differences lead one to question whether the chick channel is a member of the class B Ca2+ channel subfamily (as is the case for other N-type channels). If so, identifying its primary structure may be particularly useful in attempts to identify the structural basis of variations in N channel function. Experiments reported in this article have evaluated the molecular identities of the N-type Ca2+ channels expressed in chick DRG neurons. We have cloned cDNAs for the dominant Ca2+channels expressed in the cells using a combination of library screening and polymerase chain reaction; their closest homologues are other members of the class B Ca2+ channel family. We have identified three variable regions among the chick Ca2+channel α1B subunits, assembled four full-length clones, explored their expression in chick tissues, and demonstrated that they form functional channels with properties consistent with those of native N channels in chick DRG cells. These clones should help future efforts to identify structural domains underlying the functional heterogeneity of the class B Ca2+ channels and, in the long term, may provide information for unraveling the physiological consequences of Ca2+ channel heterogeneity. Dorsal root ganglion neurons were dissected from 11- or 12 day-old chick (Gallus gallus) embryos (Spafas, Norwalk, CT) as described (8Holz IV, G.G. Kream R.M. Spiegel A. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 1988; 9: 657-666Crossref Google Scholar), and total RNA was prepared with a phenol/guanidinium thiocyanate method (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified with the use of the poly(A) tract mRNA purification system (Promega Co., Madison, WI). Approximately 20 μg of mRNA was obtained from 1.5 mg of total RNA prepared from ∼150 chick embryos. The cDNA library (in λZAP II vector constructed by Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) contained 1.7 × 106 primary inserts, with an average length of 1.55 kb, size-selected at 600 bp. For each round of screening of the amplified library (titer: 6.1 × 109 pfu/ml), about 1 × 106 phages were plated and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in duplicate. Phage DNA was denatured (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5m NaCl) and neutralized (0.5 m Tris-HCl, 1.5m NaCl, pH 8.0). DNA probes (either RT-PCR products or DNA fragments obtained by restriction enzyme digestion) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and added to a hybridization solution of 50% deionized formamide, 0.8 m NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization overnight at 42 °C, membranes were washed twice at 55 °C for 30 min in wash buffer (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS). Plaques that screened positive on both of the duplicate membranes were isolated, amplified, and subjected to a second round of screening. Individually picked phages from the second screen were subjected toin vivo excision (9Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 15: 7583-7600Crossref Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), using the Exassist/SOLR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each phage gave rise to a phagemid (pBluescript) containing an individual cDNA clone. The insertion of cDNA in the phagemid was confirmed by restriction digestion followed by sequence analysis. Total RNA (0.5–1 μg) was used as template; a 1:1 mix of random-hexamer and oligo(dT) was used as primer, and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Perkin-Elmer) was used at 42 °C for 15 min for the first-strand synthesis. Subsequently, polymerase chain reactions were performed using Taq DNA polymerase with a standard cycling protocol as follows (unless otherwise noted): 95 °C for 1 min (1 time), 95 °C for 45 s, 53 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min (30 times), and 72 °C for 6 min (1 time). To generate a probe for the initial screening of the chick cDNA library, DRG-derived total RNA was used as template, and a pair of degenerate primers (B7, encoding part of the pore region of the mammalian α1B in repeat I, and B10, encoding part of the pore region of repeat II) was used to amplify the chick-specific sequence in the I–II linker domain of the α1BCa2+ channel subunit, at an annealing temperature of 50 °C (see Fig. 1 B for locations of primer binding sites). For assessing variations in the I–II linker region, RT templates included total RNA from DRG, brain, and heart from chick, in addition to that from rat brain and human brain. Primers 71 (nt 1210–1229 in cdB1) and 74 (nt 1589–1572) were used to amplify the RT products from chick, and primers containing rat homologue (rat-71 and rat-74) and human homologue (human-71 and human-74) were used to amplify the respective cDNA products. For characterizing the variants at the carboxyl terminus, two pairs of chick-specific primers were used independently in order to reduce the possibility of a PCR error. The first pair was 51 (nt 6227–6244) and 58 (nt 6892–6875); the second pair was 63 (nt 6485–6501) and 66 (nt 7052–7036). Products from several independent rounds of PCR amplification were sequenced and compared. In addition, the overlapping regions of PCR products 5158 (from primers 51 and 58) and 6366 (from primers 63 and 66) were compared to identify variable sequences in the carboxyl terminus. The sequences of primers used are noted below, with even and odd-numbered primers representing sense and antisense sequences, respectively, and bases in parentheses representing degenerate positions. The sequences are as follows: B7, 5′-CAGTGC(T)ATCACCATGGA-3′; B10, 5′-ATTCCAG(A)TCCTCC(T)CCG(G)GTCAG-3′; 51, 5′-AGTTACCTAGCACCCATC-3′; 58, 5′-GTCCCCACGCAGCAGTGC-3′; 63, 5′-CAAGAGCGTGGACGGTC-3′; 66, 5′-CGTAAGAAGTCCTGGAG-3′; 71, 5′-CCTGAAACTCCGTAGGCAAC-3′; 74, 5′-AGAAGCGGAACATTTTCTC-3′; rat-71, CCTGAAGCTGCGCCGGCAGC-3′; rat-74, 5′-AGAACCGGAACATCTTCTC-3′; human-71, 5′-CCTGAAGCTGCGCCGGCAGC-3′; and human-74, 5′-AAAACCGGAACATCTTCTC-3′. Using the Marathon RACE kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), ∼20 ng of mRNA was employed as the template for first strand (avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase) and second strand (T4 DNA polymerase) syntheses. The double-stranded RT product was then ligated to a double-stranded DNA adapter containing a 5′-overhang (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′). Using the ligated cDNA as the template, PCR was performed by Taq DNA polymerase with the above adapter primer and a gene-specific primer (5′-CCCTCCATGGTGATGCACTGGAAGAC-3′) corresponding to the antisense strand, nt 1038–1013 in cdB1. The thermal cycles were as follows: 95 °C for 1 min (1 time), 95 °C for 0.5 min, 68 °C for 4 min (30 times), with a hot start. PCR products were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and products of expected sizes (based on published mammalian sequences) were purified from the gel and sequenced. Clones derived from the cDNA library were sequenced on both strands, and 5′-RACE and RT-PCR products were obtained through multiple rounds of independent PCR amplifications and sequenced. Four variant clones (cdB1-cdB4) were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) between NheI and KpnI sites, as follows. The 5′-RACE product (rc-9) was directly subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). An NheI site was introduced at the 5′ end by PCR mutagenesis (using primers m13-reverse and 5′-TACTCACGCTAGCGCTCGAGCGG-3′ with the NheI site shown in bold type). This PCR product then served as the sense primer (with antisense primer 70, 5′-GAAAATCCTCAGCAGCCG-3′, nt 1926–1910, 31 bp downstream from the KpnI site) to amplify W-10. This PCR product includes upstream sequence from the 5′-untranslated region to the KpnI site in the coding region; it was digested withNheI and KpnI, gel-purified, and ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Downstream sequence was obtained by KpnI digestion of clone W-10 in the phagemid pBluescriptSK(+). This vector contains a KpnI site located in its multiple cloning site, 3′ to the insertion point. Thus, the downstream sequence includes 848 bp of 3′-untranslated region and 48 bp of the pBluescriptSK(+) sequence. To create cdB1, gel-purified KpnI fragment of W-10-pBluescriptSK(+) was ligated to KpnI-linearized pcDNA3.1(+) containing upstream channel sequence (described above). The carboxyl-terminal truncation clone, cdB2-pcDNA3.1(+), was assembled by cutting the RT-PCR product rt-5158 with SgrAI and HpaI and ligating it to cdB1-pcDNA3.1(+) cut with the same two enzymes. To assemble clone cdB3 (containing the longer carboxyl terminus but lacking inserts A and B in the I–II linker), cdB1-pcDNA3.1(+) was cut with XbaI (70 bp downstream ofKpnI on the vector) and HindIII (21 bp upstream to the end of 3′-untranslated region), followed by treatment of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and self-ligation. This eliminated the KpnI site at the 3′ end of the insert. Then, cdB3-pcDNA3.1(+) was created by replacing the Sbf-KpnI fragment in this self-ligated construct with the equivalent fragment digested from clone L-14. Similarly, cdB4-pcDNA3.1(+), lacking both A and B inserts and containing the shorter carboxyl terminus, was assembled using the same strategy but starting with cdB2-pcDNA3.1(+). Therefore, cdB3 and cdB4 in pcDNA3.1(+) each contains 827-bp 3′-untranslated region and no sequence from pBluescript. Tissues from 12-day-old chicken embryos were dissected, and RNA samples prepared from them using the methods described above. Poly(A)+ RNA samples (1.5 μg) from each tissue were loaded into separate lanes of an agarose gel (0.7% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0); following electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred downward to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) through alkaline transfer methods, 8 mm NaOH, 3 m NaCl, 1.5 h (10Chomcznski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A PCR product amplified from cdB1 (nt 1910–2963) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific activity of the probe was greater than 109 dpm/μg, and 5.0 × 106 dpm/ml of probe was added to the hybridization solution (0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA). The blot was hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the hybridization solution and then washed twice (30 min at 55 °C) in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. After drying, membranes were analyzed by autoradiography. Chick dorsal root ganglion neurons were dissociated from 11- to 12-day-old chicken embryos and N-type Ca2+ currents measured under whole cell voltage clamp using methods previously described (11Park D. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Internal recording solution contained (in mm) CsCl 150, HEPES 10 (pH 7.2), 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid 5, MgATP 5. The external recording solution contained NaCl 93, tetraethylammonium chloride 50, CaCl2 2, HEPES 25, NaOH 12.5, d-glucose 5, and tetrodotoxin 3 × 10−4. Rat SCG neurons were enzymatically dissociated from adult Wistar rats, and the neurons were cultured using methods identical to those described by Ikeda (12Ikeda S.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1991; 439: 181-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). N-type Ca2+currents were recorded using the same conditions as those described above for chick DRG neurons. Chick Ca2+ channel α1B clones cdB1 and cdB2 in pcDNA3.1(+) were linearized with AvrII, and m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-capped cRNA (13Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Similarly capped mRNA encoding rat α1B(rnα1B-b) was provided by Dr. D. Lipscombe of Brown University. Stage V Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and incubated in ND-96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH7.6). Approximately 23 ng of chick α1B and rat β1b subunit cRNAs were co-injected into each oocyte. After 4 days of incubation at 16 °C in ND-96, the injected oocytes were subjected to two-electrode voltage clamp, and currents were recorded with an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hampton, NJ) under the control of a PC running pClamp 6 (Axon Instruments, Mountain View, CA). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Leak currents were subtracted via a standard P/4 voltage protocol. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and showed resistances of less than 1.0 megohm. Only oocytes with resting membrane potentials more hyperpolarized than −30 mV were used. The holding potential was −80 mV. The oocyte bath contained 5 mm BaCl2, 96 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. A stock solution of 10 mm ω-conotoxin GVIA (Sigma) was prepared in deionized, distilled H2O with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and stored at −20 °C. Working solutions were made by diluting the stock into the bath solution immediately prior to the experiment. Exchange of the bath solution was performed with a manual switch, and the exchange of solution in the recording chamber was complete within seconds. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. One day before transfection, confluent cells were split 1:10 into 90-mm dishes, each containing several glass coverslips (Fisher). The cells achieved ∼70% confluence overnight and were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (14Dhallan R.S. Yau K.W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA mixture included 10 μg of one of the cdB clones along with several additional cloned cDNAs, included to help boost channel expression levels: 10 μg of rat β1b (provided by Dr. S. R. Ikeda), 8 μg of rat α2δ (provided by Dr. H. Chin), and 2 μg of large T antigen (provided by Dr. D. T. Yue), all driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. After 2–3 days in culture, currents were recorded using conventional tight seal, whole-cell voltage clamp (15Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). For these recordings, patch pipettes with standard internal solution (135 mmCs-methanesulfonate, 5 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) had resistances of 1.5–3 megohms. Cells attached to a coverslip were transferred to the recording chamber containing standard external solution (2 mmCaCl2, 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine aspartate, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm 4-aminopyridine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Current was recorded with a LIST EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (Medical Systems, Greenvale, NY), filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and saved on a Macintosh computer running Pulse software (HEKA Electronik, Germany). Capacitive transients and series resistances were compensated with the EPC-9 circuitry, and the leak current was subtracted with a standard P/4 protocol. Uncompensated errors were always less than 5% of applied voltage at peak current. All recordings were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). Data were analyzed with IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) or Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA); all averages are reported as means ± S.E. Toxin was stored and diluted as described above but delivered through a pressurized, linear array of polymer-coated quartz tubes (140 μm inner diameter) positioned in the vicinity of the recorded cell. The pore regions among voltage-dependent channels are highly conserved (16MacKinnon R. Yellen G. Science. 1990; 250: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 17Hartmann H.A. Kirsch G.E.

Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Thus, we were able to use a degenerate RT-PCR approach to isolate a chick-specific DNA fragment that could be employed as a probe for homologous cloning of Ca2+ channel cDNAs. Primers corresponding to the pore-region consensus sequences of the homologous repeats I and II of the chick α1B subunit were used to amplify reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from chick DRGs. The cDNA product (∼1.7 kb, designated probe 17 in Fig. 1 B) was used to screen the cDNA library. We identified ∼100 confirmed positive α1B clones from a total of ∼3 × 107 phage plaques screened from the amplified library. The longest clone was 5.6 kb (clone W-10 in Fig.1 B). Some of the clones were duplicates, as determined by restriction digestion and sequence analysis, and none of them contained the consensus translation initiation site of α1B. To obtain additional 5′ sequence information, we used 5′-RACE and produced a 1.2 kb clone (rc-9 in Fig. 1 B) that contained a translational initiation site homologous to that in other α1B clones and ∼120 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones from the library revealed variations in the I–II intracellular linker region of α1B. Some clones (such as W-10) contained two inserts, 75 (A) and 33 (B) nucleotides in length and separated by 60 nucleotides (Fig. 1, A and C). The A and B inserts were both absent in other clones (such as L-14). To explore the extent of variability in the I–II linker among the α1B mRNAs expressed in chick DRG neurons, RT-PCR was performed using primers bearing sequences specific to flanking regions. The sense primer 71 corresponds to a region 127 bp upstream of insert A and the antisense primer 74 is complementary to a region 87 bp downstream of insert B. Using these primers, mRNA lacking both A and B (ΔAΔB), containing both A and B (+A+B), or containing either A or B (+AΔB or ΔA+B) would yield RT-PCR products of 273, 381, 348, or 306 bp, respectively. RT-PCR of mRNA derived from chick DRG and brain yielded four cDNA products corresponding to the ΔAΔB, ΔA+B, +AΔB, and +A+B variants (Fig. 1 D). All products were gel-purified, subcloned, and sequenced to confirm their identities. In contrast, no products were amplified from mRNA from chick heart (nor in control reactions lacking reverse transcriptase). This indicates that variations can occur independently at both sites (A and B), since all possible combinations are expressed in neural tissues from chick. Comparison of the chick I–II linker sequences with those published for mammalian α1B subunit cDNAs suggests that the 25-amino acid residue insert (A) is novel, whereas the 11-amino acid insert (B) appears in every α1B clone reported thus far. To determine whether an A insert is present or the B insert absent in any mammalian α1B channels (and, thus, if the four-channel variants established for chick are also present in mammals), we used primer sets homologous to chick 71/74 and performed RT-PCR on mRNA isolated from rat and human brain. As seen in Fig.1 D, both rat and human brain tissues appear to express only class B channels containing insert B and lacking A. The 3′ end of the chick coding sequence was also found to contain variant sizes. Compared with mammalian α1B, clone W-10 from the chick DRG library contains a unique 5-bp deletion (ggcag) that leads to a frameshift and a premature stop codon (TAA in Fig. 1 C). This gives rise to a truncated α1Bprotein product that is more than 100 amino acids shorter than products from other reported α1B clones (19Hui A. Ellinor P.T. Krizanova O. Wang J.J. Diebold R.J. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1991; 7: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T.

To investigate the prevalence of this transcript in chick DRG neurons, RT-PCR was performed with chick-specific primers. To avoid possible sequence errors introduced during PCR, we used two independent sets of primers, flanking the region containing the 5-bp deletion. Due to the small size of the deletion, size could not be used to distinguish PCR products that contained or lacked the bases. Products were, therefore, subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subsequently sequenced. For RT-PCR runs with primers 51 and 58, 5/6 clones lacked the 5-bp insert (identical to that of W-10), whereas 1/6 contained the 5-bp insert (“ggcag” in clone rt-5158, Fig. 1 B). Similarly, among the RT-PCR subclones produced with primers 63 and 66, this same 5 bases appeared in two out of eight clones (as exemplified by rt-6366, Fig. 1 B). With the exception of this 5-bp stretch, no other variations were observed in this region. These results suggest that Ca2+ channels with shorter carboxyl termini predominate in DRG neurons. Among seven clones sequenced from the chick DRG cDNA library, we found that the A and B inserts in the I–II linker domain co-segregated, suggesting that clones containing only one of the two are less well represented in the library. Thus, four full-length clones, cdB1 through cdB4 (TableI), were constructed using the clones identified through library screening, 5′-RACE, and RT-PCR; these differ from one another in the variable I–II linker and/or the carboxyl terminus. Clones cdB1 and cdB2 both included the long I–II linker (+A+B), whereas only cdB1 contained the 5-bp carboxyl-terminal insert, thus encoding the longer carboxyl terminus. Similarly, both cdB3 and cdB4 had the shortest I–II linker (ΔAΔB), but only cdB3 encoded the long carboxyl terminus.Table ISelective assembly of chick α1B clonesα1B cloneI–II linkerCarboxyl terminusLengthPredicted massaakDacdB1+A+B+C2357267cdB2+A+BΔC2182248cdB3ΔAΔB+C2321263cdB4ΔAΔBΔC2146245A and B represent the 25 and 11 amino acid (aa) residues, respectively, in the I–II linker area as shown in Fig. 1.

Clone cdB1 was 78.2% identical and over 90% homologous to the human α1B at the amino acid level (Fig.2). As expected, the two subunits have highly similar structural domains, with four homologous repeats, six putative transmembrane domains in each repeat, and conserved pore regions. In addition, they share many subdomains or residues of putative functional importance, including the α subunit interaction domain (AID) in the I–II linker (24Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T.

LTA4 hydrolase has a wide tissue distribution and has been purified from several mammalian sources as a soluble monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of about 69 kDa. During catalysis, LTA4 hydrolase is suicide inactivated through covalent binding of LTA4 to the active site residue Tyr-378, a process that may be of importance for the overall regulation of LTB4 biosynthesis (3Evans J.F.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In fact, formation of LTB4 has never been convincingly demonstrated in any lower animal species, bacteria, or plants. Thus, an aminopeptidase-1 was recently cloned and characterized from Caenorhabditis elegans, that was 45% identical (63% similar) at the amino acid level to mammalian LTA4hydrolase (17Baset H.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. O'Neill G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27978-27987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and exhibited an arginyl aminopeptidase activity (Fig.1). Despite this high level of sequence identity, the C. elegans enzyme failed to hydrolyze LTA4 into LTB4, and no other functional link to LTA4hydrolase was reported. Apparently, very little is known about the evolution of LTA4 hydrolase and the phylogenetic relationship between its two catalytic activities. In the course of sequencing the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an open reading frame was identified as an LTA4 hydrolase homologue, with 42% identity (53% similarity) to human LTA4 hydrolase (18Nasr F. Bécam A.-M. Herbert C.J. Yeast. 1996; 12: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have cloned, expressed, and characterized the corresponding gene product (Fig. 1). We show that it is a bifunctional enzyme possessing an anion-activated leucyl aminopeptidase activity as well as an epoxide hydrolase activity toward LTA4. Moreover, the aminopeptidase activity is strongly stimulated by LTA4 in a fashion suggesting the presence of a lipid binding pocket located at the active center of the enzyme and presumably overlapping with the catalytic site(s). Hence, the homologue in S. cerevisiaeappears to be an early ancestral gene to the vertebrate forms of LTA4 hydrolase. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and T7 sequencing kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ((2S,3R)-3-Amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl)-l-leucine (bestatin), Ala-, Arg-, Glu-, Gly-, Leu-, Met-, Pro-, and Val-p-nitroanilide (p-NA) were from Sigma. Esterified LTA4 was saponified in tetrahydrofuran with 1m LiOH (6%, v/v) for 48 h at 4 °C. The LTA4 hydrolase inhibitors 3-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)-2-(R)-amino-1-propanethiol (thioamine) andN-hydroxy-N-(2-(S)-amino-3-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)propyl)-5-carboxypentanamide (hydroxamic acid) were synthesized as described (19Yuan W.

Samuelsson B. Wong C.-H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells from S. cerevisiae were grown in 10 ml of yeast medium (0.1 g of yeast extract, 0.1 g Bacto-peptone, 0.2 g of glucose, and 0.2 mg of adenine) at 30 °C to mid-exponential phase (A 600 = 1), pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 1,500 × g at 4 °C, and resuspended in ice-cold water followed by a short centrifugation at 14,000 ×g. Total RNA was isolated according to the hot acid phenol method (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 13.12. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1996: 1-2Google Scholar). The RNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in RNase-free water, and stored at −80 °C until use. Reverse transcription of total yeast RNA (2 μg/20 μl of reaction mix) was performed using the Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp® RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit, using oligo(dT)16as primer. From the genomic sequence (AC X94547) of the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase, two PCR primers were designed containing SalI and SphI restriction enzyme sites: FK22, covering the start codon (5′GTG TTC GTC GAC ATG TTC TTG CTT CCA TTT GTC, SalI site underlined) and FK21 over the stop codon (5′ GTT ACG ACG CAT GCC TTT TCA AAG ACC TAA ATC, SphI site underlined). Using the cDNA as template and FK21 and FK22 (30 pmol) as primers, a PCR was performed to amplify the S. cerevisiae LTA4hydrolase gene using the ExpandTM high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A 30-μl reaction contained 1 × reaction buffer, 200 μm dNTP, 1 unit of Taqand Pwo DNA polymerase mix, and 2 μl cDNA. The sample was first denatured for 2 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles composed of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 50 °C, and elongation for 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR was terminated by an elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product, representing the entire coding sequence of the S. cerevisiaeLTA4 hydrolase, was digested with SalI andSphI, purified by low melting agarose (0.7%) electrophoresis, and cloned into an expression vector. For expression in E. coli, the plasmid pT3–12LO was used (22Watanabe T. Medina J.F. Haeggström J.Z. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The 12-lipoxygenase insert was removed by cleavage with SalI and SphI, and the opened vector was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR product was ligated into the plasmid to produce pT3-yLTAh, which was transformed into competent E. coli (JM101) cells. Expression and preparation of crude protein extracts was performed as described previously (23Medina J.F. Rådmark O. Funk C.D. Haeggström J.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The proteins were precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate and stored at 4 °C until further purification. Expression of theS. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase gene was performed using the Bac-to-Bac® baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was removed from pT3-yLTAh by cleavage with SalI and SphI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into the recombinant donor plasmid pFastBac1 opened with SalI and SphI. This plasmid, carrying the S. cerevisiae LTA4hydrolase gene, was in turn transformed into competent E. coli cells (JM101). Correctly ligated plasmids, selected by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage, were purified using the Wizard® Plus minipreps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) and transformed into competent DH10Bac cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing the bacmid DNA. The preparation of the bacmid DNA, transfection of Sf9 cells, and harvesting of baculovirus were performed as described in the instruction manual of the Bac-to-Bac® baculovirus expression system. The S. cerevisiaeLTA4 hydrolase cDNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method to verify that no changes in the nucleotide sequence had occurred during the cloning procedure (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52930) Google Scholar). For protein expression, the Sf9 cells were grown to a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/ml in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected with baculovirus containing the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase. The infected cells were grown for approximately 72 h, pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40). The cells were disrupted by sonication (3 × 10 s) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove membranes and subjected to streptomycin sulfate precipitation. The proteins were precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate and stored at 4 °C until purification. The following protocol was used for purification of recombinant enzymes from both E. coli and Sf9 cells. For anion-exchange chromatography on fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), a Mono-Q HR10/10 column, or a column packed with Q Sepharose Fast Flow, was equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was desalted by gel filtration (PD10 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and applied to the column. Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0–500 mm), and the enzyme activity was recovered at approximately 150 mm. For hydrophobic interaction chromatography, active fractions were supplemented with 20% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and applied to a Phenyl Superose HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 1.5 m ammonium sulfate. A linear gradient of decreasing ammonium sulfate (1.5–0m) was applied and the enzyme activity was eluted at approximately 660 mm salt. For hydroxyapatite chromatography, a TSKgel HA-1000 column (Tosohaas) was equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, supplemented with 0.2 mm CaCl2. Pooled active fractions from the previous step were applied in the column equilibration buffer. A linear gradient of increasing phosphate (10–400 mm) was developed and active fractions were eluted at approximately 220 mm. For chromatofocusing, we used a Mono-P HR 5/20 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with 25 mm Bis Tris, pH adjusted to 7.0 with iminodiacetic acid. Active fractions from the hydroxyapatite chromatography in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, were applied to the column. Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a pH gradient (7.0–4.5) by changing the buffer to Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), diluted 10 times in water, and pH adjusted to 4.5 with iminodiacetic acid. The pH was measured in collected fractions (500 μl), and 20 μl of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, was added to restore an alkaline pH. Protein activity was recovered in fractions between pH 5.4 and 5.9. A final step of anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column as described above and the purified enzyme eluted at 180 mm KCl. Purification of recombinant human LTA4 hydrolase was carried out essentially as described (25Wetterholm A. Medina J.F. Rådmark O. Shapiro R. Haeggström J.Z. Vallee B.L. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The peptidase activity was determined with a spectrophotometric assay in the wells of a microtiterplate, essentially as described (25Wetterholm A. Medina J.F. Rådmark O. Shapiro R. Haeggström J.Z. Vallee B.L. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme (0.7–1 μg) was incubated with p-nitroanilide derivatives of Ala, Arg, Glu, Gly, Leu, Met, Pro, and Val at a concentration of 1 mm in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl. Formation of the product (p-nitroaniline) was measured at room temperature as the increase in A 405 using a multiscan spectrophotometer, MCC/340 (Labsystems). For determination of the epoxide hydrolase activity, incubations were performed with enzyme (2–10 μg) in 100 μl of 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, with 30 μm LTA4 for 60 s at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 1–2 volumes of MeOH, and 400–700 pmol of prostaglandin B1 was added as an internal standard. The samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction (Chromabond C18 EC, Macherey Nagel) and finally analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The column (Nova-Pak C18, 4 μm Radial-Pak cartridge, 5 × 100 mm, Waters) was eluted with a mixture of acetonitrile/methanol/water/acetic acid (30:35:35:0.01, by volume) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 270 nm. The products were identified by their chromatographic mobility relative standard compounds, as well as by UV spectrophotometry. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford, using the Bio-Rad protein-assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed on a Phast system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 10–15% gradient gels. Bands of protein were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out with an Applied Biosystems 477A instrument. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were analyzed with on-line HPLC systems (Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska Institutet). The LTA4 hydrolase homologue was cloned by PCR from reverse transcribed total RNA isolated from S. cerevisiae (w303–1b), using two primers raised against the genomic sequence. The cDNA (2016 bp) was initially expressed in E. coli (JM101) and purified to apparent homogeneity in five chromatographic steps by fast protein liquid chromatography, using anion exchange, hydroxyapatite, hydrophobic interaction, and chromatofocusing resins. The level of expression was very low, and from 6 liters of medium, only 50 μg of protein was recovered. However, the identity of the isolated protein could be established by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, which also showed that the recombinant protein lacked the initial 40 amino acids (cf. Fig. 1). To increase the yield of recombinant protein, the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase was also expressed in Sf9 cells, using the baculovirus system, and was recovered in the cell pellet rather than in the medium. The protein was purified to homogeneity using the same procedure as described above, and the molecular mass was determined to 72 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). Typically, from 450 ml of infected Sf9 cell culture, 500 μg of purified enzyme was recovered, and unless otherwise stated, this preparation was used for the enzyme characterization. During the chromatofocusing step, four active peaks were eluted at pH 5.9, 5.7, 5.6 and 5.4. The material under the three large peaks (I, III, and IV) were collected separately and either treated as different variants of the protein or pooled together. The molecular mass of the four variants did not differ, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on the two major components (peaks I and IV), which revealed that they were indeed the expected protein but with different N termini. Thus, the first detected residue in variant I was Ile-32, whereas the other protein (variant IV) started at Met-40 (Fig. 1). The aminopeptidase activity of theS. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase was assayed usingp-NA derivatives of different amino acids. For all variants tested (I, III and IV), the highest specific activity (190, 140, and 210 nmol/mg/min, respectively), under standard assay conditions, was obtained with Leu-p-NA. For I and III, Met-p-NA was the second best substrate (100 and 82 nmol/mg/min) followed by Ala- (58 and 52 nmol/mg/min), and Val-p-NA (19 and 16 nmol/mg/min). For variant IV, however, the second best substrate was Pro-p-NA (200 nmol/mg/min), followed by Met- (114 nmol/mg/min) and Ala-p-NA (110 nmol/mg/min). Arg-, Glu-, and Gly-p-NA were very poor substrates for all three variants of the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase. The protein obtained from E. coli displayed an almost identical substrate specificity with Leu-p-NA as the preferred substrate, followed by Met-p-NA and Ala-p-NA. Apparent kinetic constants were determined using Leu-, Met-, and Ala-p-NA as substrate in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mmKCl and did not differ significantly between the three variants of the protein. Using Leu-p-NA as the substrate, the mean value ofV max for all three variants was calculated to 520 ± 110 nmol/mg/min (mean ±S.D.; n = 6), and the value for K m was determined to 1.5 ± 0.4 mm (n = 6) (TableI). The values ofV max, using Met- and Ala-p-NA as substrates, were calculated to 360 ± 110 (n = 3) and 240 ± 170 nmol/mg/min (n = 3), respectively, whereas the corresponding values of K m were determined to be 1.8 ± 0.45 (n = 3) and 2.0 ± 1.0 mm (n = 3), respectively. As judged by values of k cat/K m, Leu-p-NA was the best substrate (420 ± 100 s−1m−1; n = 6) followed by Met-pNA (230 ± 10 s−1m−1, n = 3) and Ala-p-NA (130 ± 30 s−1m−1; n = 3). In all subsequent experiments, Leu-p-NA was used as the standard substrate. To allow a direct comparison, recombinant human LTA4 hydrolase (0.7 μg) was assayed in a parallel experiment with Leu-p-NA, and the kinetic constantsV max and K m were calculated to 310 nmol/mg/min and 0.15 mm, respectively (Table I).Table IComparison of apparent kinetic constants for the aminopeptidase activity of S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase, S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase stimulated with LTA4, and human LTA4 hydrolaseK mV maxk catk cat/K mmmnmol/mg/mins−1s−1m−1S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase1.55200.63430S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase stimulated with LTA42.144005.22400Human LTA4hydrolase0.153100.352400The enzymes (0.7 μg) were incubated with 0.125–8 mmLeu-p-NA in 250 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl. For LTA4 activation, the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase was pretreated with LTA4 (70 μm) for 20 min before adding the substrate. Incubations with recombinant human LTA4 hydrolase were performed in parallel. Data are mean values of 2–6 samples. Open table in a new tab The enzymes (0.7 μg) were incubated with 0.125–8 mmLeu-p-NA in 250 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl. For LTA4 activation, the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase was pretreated with LTA4 (70 μm) for 20 min before adding the substrate. Incubations with recombinant human LTA4 hydrolase were performed in parallel. Data are mean values of 2–6 samples. The pH optimum for the aminopeptidase activity of the S. cerevisiaeLTA4 hydrolase (1 μg of enzyme, 1 mmLeu-p-NA) in both Tris-Cl and phosphate buffer containing 100 mm KCl, was determined to 7.3 (data not shown). Furthermore, the enzyme was dose-dependently stimulated by monovalent anions. As described previously for LTA4hydrolase, thiocyanate was a very potent activator of all three protein variants. The effect peaked at approximately 100 mm, corresponding to >100-fold stimulation. At higher concentrations (>100 mm), this anion had an inhibitory effect on the aminopeptidase activity. For chloride ions, the pattern of stimulation seemed to obey saturation kinetics. At 100 mm, a 40-fold activation was observed, and a plateau was reached at approximately 600 mm salt. From Eadie-Hofstee plots of the kinetic data, an apparent affinity constant (K A) for chloride was calculated to 120 mm. Similarly, the apparent affinity constant for thiocyanate (in the range 25–100 mm) was calculated to 28 mm. Three competitive inhibitors of LTA4 hydrolase, i.e. the general aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin and two specific LTA4 hydrolase inhibitors, a thioamine and a hydroxamic acid, were tested for their inhibitory effect on the S. cerevisiae LTA4hydrolase. The inhibitors were tested at concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 100 μm, using Leu-p-NA as substrate. For all three variants of the protein, the thioamine was shown to be the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.06 ± 0.01 μm (mean ± S.D.; n = 4). The hydroxamic acid was the second best inhibitor, with an IC50of 0.24 ± 0.09 μm (n = 4), whereas bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of this protein, with an IC50 of 3.2 ± 0.6 μm (n= 3). Parallel experiments were performed with recombinant human LTA4 hydrolase, using Leu-p-NA as substrate, which showed a similar pattern of inhibition with IC50values for the three inhibitors of 0.02, 0.03, and 0.5 μmfor the thioamine, the hydroxamic acid, and bestatin, respectively. The mode of inhibition for bestatin and the thioamine was determined from Eadie-Hofstee plots of kinetic data obtained with untreated and inhibited enzyme. For both compounds, a mixed type of inhibition was observed, suggesting that the inhibitors bind at the active site but can not be fully displaced by the substrate (Fig.3). The S. cerevisiaeLTA4 hydrolase was assayed for its ability to convert LTA4 into LTB4. Aliquots of a pool of all three protein variants (2–10 μg) were incubated in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, with 30 μm LTA4for 60 s at room temperature. Under these experimental conditions, production of LTB4 could not be detected in any of the incubations with the S. cerevisiae protein. Similar incubations were performed with the purified recombinant protein fromE. coli, as well as crude yeast cell extracts, none of which generated detectable amounts of LTB4. Further analysis of the product profile revealed that the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase converted LTA4into a less polar compound eluting late in the reverse phase HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 4). Comparison with synthetic standards showed that this peak coeluted with 5S,6S-dihydroxy-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5S,6S-DHETE). Furthermore, the material under this peak exhibited a UV spectrum typical of a conjugated triene moiety, with λmax at 274 nm, in agreement with previously published data for 5S,6S-DHETE (26Blomster Andberg M. Hamberg M. Haeggström J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23057-23063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By peak area measurements, the specific activity of this activity was calculated to 20 ± 2.1 nmol/mg/min (mean ± S.D.; n = 6) using prostaglandin B1 as the internal standard. Heating the S. cerevisiae LTA4 hydrolase at 90 °C for 5 min completely abolished the formation of 5S,6S-DHETE demonstrating the enzymatic nature of its formation. Moreover, preincubation of the enzyme with the competitive inhibitor thioamine (30 μm) also abolished this enzyme activity (Fig. 4), suggesting that epoxide hydrolysis occurs at a site close to or identical to the aminopeptidase active site. To test whether the peptidase activity was inactivated by LTA4, as is the case with all LTA4 hydrolases described thus far (27Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the S. cerevisiae protein (0.7 μg) was incubated with LTA4 added three times at 10- or 20-min intervals, to a final concentration of 80 μm. Subsequent measurement of the enzyme activity, using 1 mm Leu-p-NA as substrate, revealed that LTA4 stimulated the specific peptidase activity from 150 to 1800 nmol/mg/min, corresponding to an 11-fold stimulation. When Ala-, Arg-, Pro-, and Met-p-NA were tested, Ala-p-NA was the only other substrate that was hydrolyzed with increased efficiency. Thus, the specific activity was increased from 120 to 500 nmol/mg/min, corresponding to a 4-fold stimulation. The stimulatory effect was not reversible, and 70% of the initial effect was still present in a sample stored for a month"
https://openalex.org/W2026304699,"Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a serpin whose thrombin inhibition activity is accelerated by glycosaminoglycans. We describe the novel properties of a carboxyl-terminal histidine-tagged recombinant HCII (rHCII-CHis6). Thrombin inhibition by rHCII-CHis6 was increased >2-fold at ∼5 μg/ml heparin compared with wild-type recombinant HCII (wt-rHCII) at 50–100 μg/ml heparin. Enhanced activity of rHCII-CHis6 was reversed by treatment with carboxypeptidase A. We assessed the role of the HCII acidic domain by constructing amino-terminal deletion mutants (Δ1–52, Δ1–68, and Δ1–75) in wt-rHCII and rHCII-CHis6. Without glycosaminoglycan, unlike wt-rHCII deletion mutants, the rHCII-CHis6 deletion mutants were less active compared with full-length rHCII-CHis6. With glycosaminoglycans, Δ1–68 and Δ1–75 rHCIIs were all less active. We assessed the character of the tag by comparing rHCII-CHis6, rHCII-CAla6, and rHCII-CLys6 to wt-rHCII. Only rHCII-CHis6 had increased activity with heparin, whereas all three mutants have increased heparin binding. We generated a carboxyl-terminal histidine-tagged recombinant antithrombin III to study the tag on another serpin. Interestingly, this mutant antithrombin III had reduced heparin cofactor activity compared with wild-type protein. In a plasma-based assay, the glycosaminoglycan-dependent inhibition of thrombin by rHCII-CHis6 was significantly greater compared with wt-rHCII.

Glycosaminoglycans bound by these serpins include heparin, chondroitin sulfates, dermatan sulfate, and proteoglycans with these molecules as side chains.Serpins inhibit their target proteases by acting as suicide substrates (1Huber R.

The target protease will recognize this reactive site bond and attack it as a substrate. Once attacked, the serpin and protease are caught in a 1:1 covalent complex in which the protease is rendered inactive (5Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N.

Heparin cofactor II contains a unique amino-terminal region that is highly acidic and thus referred to as the “acidic domain.” In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, the acidic domain is believed to interact with the D-helix region, which is highly basic. The D-helix region is involved in glycosaminoglycan binding. When glycosaminoglycan is present, it has been suggested that the acidic domain is displaced. The displaced acidic domain is then able to interact with the anion-binding exosite-1 of thrombin.Standard procedures to purify HCII involve binding protein to heparin-Sepharose (26Tollefsen D.M. Majerus D.W. Blank M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2162-2169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Church F.C. J. Biol.

However, a further investigation of the HCII mechanism of action by mutagenesis of its glycosaminoglycan-binding region would disrupt purification of protein by heparin affinity. Therefore, we began to derive alternative purification protocols to avert this problem. Many researchers have used a sequence consisting of six histidine residues as an affinity ligand (28Peters D.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By attaching this sequence to a protein, either the amino or carboxyl terminus, protein can be purified with a specialized Ni2+ matrix (31Hochuli E. Dobeli H. Schacher A. J.

This method had been used successfully as an affinity purification ligand (28Peters D. Frank R. Hengstenberg W. Eur. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the histidine tag is a benign addition to proteins to which it was attached (28Peters D. Frank R. Hengstenberg W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Robeva A.S. Woodard R. Luthin D.R. Taylor H.E. Linden J. Biochem.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).In this report we show the following: (a) carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine-tagged recombinant HCII (rHCII-CHis6) has enhanced progressive antithrombin and heparin cofactor activities and increased heparin-Sepharose binding compared with wild-type recombinant HCII (wt-rHCII); (b) a region within the amino terminus of HCII may interact with the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine of rHCII-CHis6; (c) carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine-tagged recombinant antithrombin III (rATIII-CHis6) does not have these enhanced activities compared with wild-type recombinant ATIII (wt-rATIII); and (d) the enhanced heparin effect of rHCII-CHis6is maintained in a plasma-based thrombin inhibition assay. Collectively, these data suggest that rHCII-CHis6 could be a novel anticoagulant therapy.DISCUSSIONWe have “serpendipitously” constructed an HCII mutant that is a significantly better inhibitor of thrombin than the wild-type molecule. This mutant, rHCII-CHis6, is a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine-tagged heparin cofactor II. In the absence of glycosaminoglycan we see a small increase in rates of thrombin inhibition. In the presence of heparin, rHCII-CHis6 has antithrombotic activity that reaches rates comparable to those of the physiologic thrombin inhibitor ATIII. Addition of the hexahistidine tag to HCII also increases the affinity of this molecule for heparin. In contrast, the enhanced activity of rHCII-CHis6 is not seen with other sulfated polysaccharides like dermatan sulfate, desmin, or fucoidan. Our results demonstrate that the activity is solely a result of the addition of the carboxyl-terminal histidine tag and that rHCII-CHis6 functions to inhibit thrombin through the same mechanism as wt-rHCII, which is highly dependent on ABE-1 of thrombin. Augmentation of heparin cofactor activity in rHCII-CHis6 is reversible by CPA proteolysis. We also presented another mutant, rHCII-CHis5Pro, which retains the enhanced activity but is resistant to CPA. We also showed that the addition of a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag to ATIII actually interferes with the ability of ATIII to inhibit two of its target serine proteases, thrombin and Factor Xa, and has no influence on the heparin binding of the molecule. This contrast in activity between HCII and ATIII with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag is especially notable since their reactive site loops are very similar in sequence and in length (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 27Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2218-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in antithrombin activity is not a general phenomenon for glycosaminoglycan-binding serpins.Previous work has indicated that when the hexahistidine tag is left attached, it rarely affects the properties of the native protein (28Peters D. Frank R. Hengstenberg W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Robeva A.S. Woodard R. Luthin D.R. Taylor H.E. Linden J. Biochem.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, we have not found any examples of heparin-binding proteins being hexahistidine-tagged anywhere in the literature. This was the point at which we made our serendipitous finding.As described in the Introduction, HCII is believed to inhibit thrombin through an unusual mechanism in the presence of glycosaminoglycan (2Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M. Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology. 1997; Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Rogers S.J. Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Ciaccia A.V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31203-31208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since the enhanced activity of the hexahistidine tag was only seen with the glycosaminoglycan-binding serpin HCII but not ATIII, the data presented support the concept that the D-helix region-acidic domain interaction is altered. The increase in antithrombin activity of rHCII-CHis6 suggests that the acidic domain may be in an altered conformation to more easily encounter thrombin ABE-1. Data presented describing inhibition in the presence of hirugen, a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of hirudin, indicate that ABE-1 of thrombin is still very important in the mechanism of thrombin inhibition by rHCII-CHis6. This is further supported by inhibition of γT-thrombin, a proteolyzed form of thrombin defective at ABE-1. However, the slight residual increased activity of rHCII-CHis6 toward γT-thrombin might imply that other residues of ABE-1 not perturbed by proteolysis (or blocked by hirugen in α-thrombin) might be involved in this inhibition reaction. The increased binding of rHCII-CHis6 to heparin-Sepharose compared with wt-rHCII also lends support to the notion that part of the d-helix region is more accessible to heparin interaction. The reduced heparin concentration needed for peak activity for rHCII-CHis6 is related to heparin-Sepharose affinity and is consistent with that seen previously for heparin binding characteristics and activity for heparin-binding serpins (3Pratt C.W. Church F.C. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in heparin but not dermatan sulfate binding of rHCII-CHis6 further implies that the glycosaminoglycan-binding site of HCII has both distinct and overlapping structural elements for heparin and dermatan sulfate interactions and agrees with previous variants/mutants of HCII altered in the D-helix region (23Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Ciaccia A.V. Church F.C. Protein Pept. Lett. 1997; 4: 215-224Google Scholar). The comparable inhibition rates of wt-rHCII and rHCII-CHis6 with chymotrypsin (which does not use either the acidic domain of HCII or glycosaminoglycans for inhibition) indicate that the reactive site loop has not been altered to an “activated” conformation, further implicating an alteration between the D-helix/acidic domain regions in the increased activity of rHCII-CHis6.It is also possible that these results could be due to the addition/exposure of a secondary heparin-binding site or some other effect of the hexahistidine on the conformation of HCII. Morgan and co-workers (43Borza D.-B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 44Borza D.-B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 45Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have published extensively on the function of histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein as a heparin-binding molecule. This protein is notable for its tandem histidine-rich repeats that bind heparin either in the presence of divalent cations or at sub-physiologic pH values. All of our experiments were carried out at physiologic pH and in the absence of added divalent cations. Trace metal contamination is an unlikely source of our results since the control CPA-digested proteins are treated with EDTA and still maintain enhanced activity and heparin binding. The lack of effect on the heparin binding ability of ATIII also argues against the addition of a new heparin-binding site in either ATIII or HCII due to the hexahistidine tag itself. To address further the mechanism of hexahistidine and HCII, we then focused our work both on the composition of the tag and the influence of the amino-terminal acidic domain region of HCII.We explored the contribution of the amino-terminal acidic domain of HCII to the enhanced activity of rHCII-CHis6 by sequentially deleting the first 52, 68, or 75 amino acids from either wt-rHCII or rHCII-CHis6. In 1991, van Deerlin and Tollefsen (22van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described similar amino-terminal deletion mutants of HCII. Our data for deletions of wt-rHCII are in agreement with their results. No function has been assigned to the first 52 amino acids. However, within residues 53 and 75 there are 13 acidic amino acids (Asp, Glu, and sulfated-Tyr). These residues are grouped in two distinct clusters called “acidic region 1” and “acidic region 2” (AR-1 and AR-2). When glycosaminoglycans bind the D-helix of HCII it is believed that AR-2 is displaced, which allows AR-1 to be more accessible to bind ABE-1 of thrombin (22van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The removal of amino acids 1–52 should be relatively benign based on this model of HCII. However, the removal of amino acids 1–68 or 1–75 should influence the interaction of HCII with thrombin, especially in the presence of glycosaminoglycans.In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, the deletion mutants of wt-rHCII had no major loss of protease inhibition activity. Based on the results, the amino-terminal region of wt-HCII is not significantly involved in the inhibition of chymotrypsin or thrombin. In contrast, all three deletions in rHCII-CHis6 lead to significant losses of both thrombin and chymotrypsin inhibition. The losses found in inhibition must be due to the presence of the hexahistidine tag in rHCII-CHis6. Most likely the tag in the deletion mutants causes a change in the reactive site loop region of HCII since inhibition is dependent on this structure. These results suggest that either the amino-terminal acidic domain shields the reactive site loop from the hexahistidine tag or it interacts with the hexahistidine tag to then keep the tag from perturbing the reactive site loop.In the presence of glycosaminoglycan, the thrombin inhibition rates are only slightly affected by deletion of the first 52 amino acids of wt-rHCII. In the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate, the loss of residues 1–68 or 1–75 leads to decreased antithrombotic activity, in agreement with the accepted model of HCII. However, the rates of thrombin inhibition by the rHCII-CHis6 deletions are somewhat different. The enhanced heparin cofactor activity of rHCII-CHis6 is lost with the deletion of the first 52 amino acids. As expected, the 1–68 and 1–75 deletions caused a large loss of activity with both heparin and dermatan sulfate. The progressive loss of activity indicates that the protective effect the amino-terminal region of HCII imparts on the hexahistidine tag is partially mediated between residues 52 and 75. We believe these data provide evidence for the importance and specificity of an HCII carboxyl terminus (hexahistidine tag) and amino-terminal acidic domain interaction. Since there is no crystal structure of HCII, the data imply that the amino terminus may be in close proximity to the carboxyl terminus.We compared rHCII-CHis6, rHCII-CAla6, and rHCII-CLys6 to provide information about the character of the carboxyl-terminal hexapeptide tag. We hypothesized that if the enhanced activity of rHCII-CHis6 was a result either of the extra length or of partial positive charge on the tag, then a hexa-alanine or a hexalysine tag could be used to probe this phenomenon further. We found that only the hexahistidine or hexa-alanine tag increased the rate of thrombin inhibition in the absence of glycosaminoglycan. The inhibition of another serine protease, chymotrypsin, is not affected by the addition of each tag. These experiments provide evidence that the rate increases seen with the hexahistidine tag are not fully a result of charge on the tag, but changes in thrombin inhibition do further suggest that the acidic domain-D-helix interaction is perturbed.In the presence of heparin we see a large increase in the rate of thrombin inhibition by rHCII-CHis6 and a shift to a lower heparin requirement. In contrast, with rHCII-CAla6 and rHCII-CLys6, we see either a loss or no change in activity. In the presence of dermatan sulfate we do not observe increased rates of thrombin inhibition when comparing rHCII-CHis6 to wt-rHCII. The hexa-alanine and hexalysine tags actually are detrimental to the inhibition of thrombin in the presence of dermatan sulfate. The increase in both dermatan sulfate and heparin binding by rHCII-CLys6 implies that this protein may have less specific glycosaminoglycan binding abilities than the altered binding properties of rHCII-CHis6. These data indicate that neither the positive charge nor the addition of six amino acids to the carboxyl terminus of HCII is solely responsible for increased heparin binding. However, these results do suggest that the increase in rates of rHCII inhibition with heparin seems to be specific to the hexahistidine tag.Current antithrombotic therapies include heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and other heparinoids, oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, synthetic molecules such as Argatroban, and naturally occurring peptides isolated from hematophagous parasites, most notably hirudin (46Mueller R.L.

In the presence of heparin, the activity of rHCII-CHis6 is comparable to that of the physiologic inhibitor ATIII. The histidine-tagged HCII functions optimally at a significantly lower heparin concentration than does wild-type HCII. In a plasma-based assay, we also see increased antithrombotic activity of rHCII-CHis6 with both heparin and dermatan sulfate.

A series of derivatives of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) inhibited a preparation of adenylyl cyclase derived from rat brain with IC50values that ranged from 66 μm (PMEA) to 175 nm for its diphosphate derivative (PMEApp) and mimics of it. PMEApp mimics included PMEAp(NH)p, PMEAp(CH2)p, PMEAp(CX 2)p (X = fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), PMEAp(CHX)pp, and PMEAp(C(OH)CH3pp. The data suggest that inhibition of adenylyl cyclases may contribute to the therapeutic action of some of these or similar compounds or constitute part of their side effects in therapeutic settings.

The putative membrane topology of adenylyl cyclases conforms to a repeated sequence of a six-membrane spanning region followed by a cytosolic domain (1Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J.

Moreover, aspects of the catalytic mechanisms of adenylyl cyclases and enzymes involved in polymerization of oligonucleotides are similar as well. Each involves nucleoside triphosphate as substrate and divalent cation-dependent catalysis that includes attack involving the substrate 3′-OH group, to catalyze either chain elongation of a primer oligonucleotide or formation of the 3′:5′-cyclic phosphate, with pyrophosphate as a leaving group. Adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates are among the most potent inhibitors of adenylyl cyclases (8Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol.

[α-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine and the 3′-polyphosphates of 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine and of 2′-deoxyadenosine were synthesized by methods previously reported (9Désaubry L.

Lubrol-PX, used in experiments with the rat brain enzyme, was filtered through alumina (Neutral, AG7, from Bio-Rad) to remove peroxides. The adenylyl cyclase extracted from rat brain has served as a basis for comparison of the effects of numerous adenine nucleosides and nucleoside phosphates (8Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D.

Whereas this was notably higher than the previously reported inhibition by 3′-AMP or 2′-d-3′-AMP (IC50 ∼8.9 and 1.2 μm, respectively), it was below that for 5′-AMP or 2′-d-5′-AMP (IC50 ∼150 and >300 μm, respectively) (8Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar), reflecting an intermediate capacity of this acyclic phosphonate to interact with this adenylyl cyclase. Because adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates exhibited progressively lower IC50 values as 3′-phosphate groups were added (Table I) (9Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol.

PMEApp and the corresponding imidodiphosphate derivative, PMEAp(NH)p, exhibited comparable potencies (IC50 ∼170 and ∼180 nm, respectively). Although PMEApp and PMEAp(NH)p were not as potent as 2′-d-3′-ATP or 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP (cf. Table I), they fall within ranges seen with this class of inhibitors of this enzyme family and suggest that they interact with the enzyme catalytic cleft in a similar orientation.Table IIC50 values for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by adenine nucleotide analogsAcyclic derivativesIC50Established nucleoside inhibitorsIC501-aFrom Johnson et al.

Open table in a new tab Adenylyl cyclase activities were determined under the conditions described for Fig. 2 and as described under “Experimental Procedures”. IC50 values were determined graphically from logistic regressions of plots similar to those shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Adenylyl cyclases catalyze formation of cAMP from 5′-ATP and also from 5′-APP(NH)P and 5′-APP(CH2)P but with reduced catalytic efficiency (24Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presumption has been that because of their changed electronic structures the imidodiphosphate and methylenediphosphate moieties do not form as good a leaving group as does inorganic pyrophosphate. Consequently, it was not surprising that the βγ-methylene diphosphate derivative PMEAp(CH2)p (IC50 ∼5 μm) exhibited a reduced inhibitory potency compared with the unmodified PMEApp (Fig.2 and Table I). Halogen substitutions within the βγ-methylene diphosphate caused noticeable but modest improvements in potency (Fig. 3) as did the substitution of the –CH2– group with –C(CH3OH)– (Table I). The most potent of these was PMEAp(CF2)p (IC50 ∼1.5 μm; Fig.3 and Table I). The effects on the cyclase of these substitutions were as expected from the altered size and electronic character of the pyrophosphate leaving group in these PMEApp mimics.Figure 3Inhibition by PMEApp mimics.

These similarities in catalytic mechanism and structure among distinctly different enzyme families suggest that agents acting within the catalytic cleft of one may interact also with the other. This has been borne out in earlier studies with these enzyme families with some ligands and was extended here with the inhibition of adenylyl cyclases by a class of 9-substituted adenine acyclic phosphonate derivatives (Table I). PMEA, its diphosphate derivative, PMEApp, and mimics of PMEApp inhibited adenylyl cyclase with potencies (IC50 <200 nm) that were reminiscent of those of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP (IC50∼40 nm) (9Désaubry L.

These latter two nucleotides are the most potent nucleoside triphosphate inhibitors of this enzyme, but inhibit by different mechanisms. Inhibition by 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP is of the post-transition state of the enzyme through a noncompetitive, dead-end mechanism (9Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol.

This implies that the catalytically competent and the 3′-nucleotide-inhibited configurations of the enzyme differ. In addition to adenylyl cyclases, PMEApp inhibits viral reverse transcriptases (13De Clercq E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Naesens L.

It is presumably this mechanism through which the oral prodrug derivative of PMEA (adefovir dipivoxil) effects the therapeutic and potent inhibition of retroviruses and hepatitis B virus (19Hatse S.

Given the central role that adenylyl cyclases play in the regulation of cell metabolism, function, and development, drugs that affect this enzyme family could be expected to elicit a variety of effects on cells. A pertinent example is the acceleration in differentiation in preadipocytes that was noted with adenine nucleoside inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase (34Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N. Maghareie H. Golia M. Shoshani I. Désaubry L. Johnson R.A. Am J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C487-C496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, because there are at least nine adenylyl cyclase isozymes that are differentially expressed in cells and tissues, the effects of such drugs may also elicit tissue and cell-dependent effects. Although this cross-reactivity of inhibitors likely extends to many of the enzymes for which nucleoside triphosphates are substrates and pyrophosphate is leaving group (3Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K.

First, the similarity in catalytic mechanism and homologous structure among guanylyl and adenylyl cyclases (1Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C.

Second, if inhibition of adenylyl cyclase contributes to the side effects of the antiviral drugs, it can be readily designed around simply by use of some other base or by almost any modification of the adenine moiety,e.g. 3-deaza-, or 7-deaza-adenine (8Johnson R.A.

These changes would yield agents that do not affect adenylyl cyclase but which may yet inhibit oligonucleotide polymerases. Third, if therapeutic effects of adenine acyclic phosphonate derivatives are in fact brought about by inhibition of adenylyl cyclases or if inhibition of adenylyl cyclase yields the appropriate pharmacologic or therapeutic action, e.g. differentiation (34Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N. Maghareie H. Golia M. Shoshani I. Désaubry L. Johnson R.A. Am J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C487-C496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), more specific inhibitors could be developed that take advantage of our knowledge of the structures of this enzyme and its inhibitors. Some of the known potent inhibitors of this enzyme may be used or form the basis for the development of more selective ligands. The most effective agents might well be transition-state inhibitors, and adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates are the closest to these of the known inhibitors of this enzyme family. Their usefulness for such purposes should be enhanced substantially by the use of transient protecting groups that will allow these compounds to enter cells and find application in intact cell systems. Other enzymes with nucleoside triphosphate as substrate and pyrophosphate as leaving group may be similarly and more specifically targeted."

The minimal protein region necessary to catalyze this cleavage includes most of NS2 and the N-terminal one-third of NS3. Autocleavage reactions using NS2/3 protein translated in vitro are used here to investigate the inhibitory potential of peptides likely to affect the reaction.

Both results are consistent with prior suggestions that the NS2/3 cleavage is an intramolecular reaction. Surprisingly, peptides containing the 12-amino acid region of NS4A responsible for binding to NS3 inhibit the NS2/3 reaction with K i values as low as 3 μm. Unrelated peptide sequences of similar composition are not inhibitory, and neither are peptides containing incomplete segments of the NS4A region that binds to NS3.

The proteolytic release of mature NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B is catalyzed by the chymotrypsin-like serine protease contained within the N-terminal domain of NS3 (termed “NS3 protease”), whereas host cell proteases release C, E1, E2, and p7, creating the N terminus of NS2 at amino acid 810 (10Mizushima H.

The protein region essential for NS2/3 cleavage activity has been approximately mapped to amino acids 898–1207 of the HCV open reading frame (4Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of NS2/3 cleavage is unknown but speculated to be either a metalloprotease (18Wu Z. Yao N. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 92-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or cysteine protease (19Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1996; 6: 64-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cleavage activity of in vitrotranslated NS2/3 is inhibited by EDTA, and activity is restored with metal ion re-addition (13Hijikata M.

Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are no reported sequence homologies of the NS2 protein with proteins of known structure, and its N terminus is believed to be a transmembrane polypeptide (14Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NS3 protease domain structure is known in its mature form, however. The NS3 N terminus formed by NS2/3 cleavage is markedly affected by association with the cofactor peptide, NS4A. The x-ray crystallographic structure of NS3 bound to a peptide containing NS4A amino acids 21–34 (amino acids 1672–1685 of the HCV polyprotein) reveals that NS3 N-terminal residues 2–9 interact directly with NS4A to compose one of eight strands in an antiparallel β-sheet extending through the NS3 protease (20Kim J.L.

Considering the paucity of data regarding the biochemistry of the NS2/3 reaction, it is of interest to probe the effects of peptides that represent natural ligands of NS2/3 upon the NS2/3 reaction rate. These peptides include sequences containing the NS3 binding region of NS4A as well as sequences containing the NS2/3 cleavage site. Because the detailed investigation of the NS2/3 reaction has been hampered by the lack of assays using defined components, we have employed here the demonstrated technique of in vitro translation to produce active NS2/3. The unexpected result of this study is that NS4A is a potent inhibitor, whereas the reaction is unaffected by potentially competing cleavage-site peptides. Two DNA constructs were made for the synthesis of the HCV NS2/3 J strain RNA and its subsequent translation to proteins, which lack the N-terminal membrane binding region of NS2 but contain HCV residues 849–1240, referred to as 849–1240J and Mal849–1240J. Codons 849–1240 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pT7 (a generous gift from Dr. Nicola La Monica (14Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). For 849–1240J the HCV sequence was cloned into pET3c (Novagen), and for Mal849–1240J the DNA was inserted into pETMalcH (a generous gift of Dr. B. Leiting (23Pryor K.D. Leiting B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)), to produce an open reading frame encoding the fusion protein Mal849–1240, which includes Escherichia colimaltose-binding protein His6 tag-HCV residues 849–1240 (23Pryor K.D. Leiting B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). DNA for pCITE 810–1615BK was a generous gift from Dr. Nicola La Monica. Upon transcription and translation, pCITE 810–1615BK produces HCV residues 810–1615 of the BK strain, all of NS2, and most of NS3 (810–1615BK). The translation of this protein has been described previously (16Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expected masses for the proteins produced from these constructs are: 849–1240J, 42 kDa (cleavage products NS2, 19.6 kDa and NS3, 22.4 kDa); Mal849–1240J, 84.5 kDa (cleavage products Mal-NS2, 62.1 kDa and NS3, 22.4 kDa); 810–1615, 91 kDa (cleavage products NS2, 24 kDa and NS3, 67 kDa). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene Quick Change method to generate nonprocessing mutants H952A and C993A in the expression constructs described above. Peptides were obtained by custom synthesis from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, IN) and were greater than 95% pure as judged from reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Effective molecular weights were obtained by quantitative amino acid analysis. All peptides were dissolved and diluted in Me2SO, so that the final concentration of Me2SO in every reaction was 5%. Circular DNA plasmids were linearized with BLP1 (Bpu 1102) and purified with a Qiagen QiaEX II kit before transcription. RNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion Megascript kit), phenol/CHCl3-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. Translations were with Promega or Ambion in vitro rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation kits at 30 °C for 30–40 min using [35S]methionine as a label (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Translation was then inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide (250 μm final concentration), and samples were immediately frozen on dry ice. Translated NS2/3 was thawed on ice and cleavage was initiated by incubation at 20 °C, either in the original translation mixture or following a 10-fold dilution into a 10,000 molecular weight filtrate of reticulocyte lysate produced with Amicon Microcon-10 filters. Samples taken at the times indicated were combined with SDS-gel sample buffer and frozen on dry ice. NS2/3 cleavage reactions with the 810–1615BK were performed with 1% Triton X-100 present, as described previously (16Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the completion of an experiment, frozen samples were placed in boiling water for 5 min, and radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (14%). Prestained Novex molecular weight standards were used in estimation of molecular weights of the products. For peptide inhibition measurements, incubations were initiated by the addition of diluted lysate to a Me2SO solution of peptide in a tube held at 20 °C. The distribution of 35S-labeled proteins on dried gels was determined with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Product bands were quantified and expressed as a proportion of total signal in the gel lane so that variations in gel lane loading were normalized. The product NS2 from 810–1615BK was used to generate data shown for screening of peptides and IC50 calculations because of its migration on gels in a region with less background than the higher molecular weight products and its ability to initiate the 810–1615BK reaction with Triton X-100 (14Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IC50 values were determined by first expressing the product level found as a fraction of the no-inhibitor control product level and then fitting the following equation, fractional activity = a + [b/(1 + (x/c)d), to the data, where ais the minimal level of fractional activity (tending to 0),a + b is the maximal level (tending to 1),x is the concentration of inhibitor, c is the IC50, and d is a slope coefficient. Typical NS2/3 processing reactions are shown in Fig. 1. The reaction occurred on a time scale of minutes, with the rate and final extent of reaction varying somewhat with the sequence expressed. NS2/3 810–1615BK was cleaved to as much as 60% with a 3-h incubation, and the maltose-binding protein fusion, Mal849–1240J, to nearly 100%. In all constructs, the mutations H952A or C993A prevented the appearance of products, as reported previously (4Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 13Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Mal849–1240J and 810–1615BK were used in subsequent characterization of the NS2/3 reaction and inhibition. NS2/3 from 810–1615BK was produced as a single 90-kDa band that cleaved itself to products of 65 (NS3) and 25 kDa (NS2), close to the expected molecular weights (Fig.1 A). In addition, 810–1615BK did not begin cleavage until the addition to Triton X-100, as has been reported (16Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby allowing reactions to be initiated at will without background cleavage products generated during the translation phase of the experiment. The translation products of Mal849–1240J had the expected precursor molecular weight of 80 kDa, but also a smaller protein of 67 kDa (data not shown), possibly because of internal initiation, thus complicating the use of this version of NS2/3 for quantification of processing rates and inhibitor potencies. Dilution of the NS2/3 precursor 10-fold into water completely prevented the processing reaction (data not shown). Dilution into a 10,000 molecular weight filtrate of rabbit reticulocyte lysate supported the reaction at a rate similar to that observed in undiluted lysate. Greater dilution of precursor (up to 40-fold) did not further change the rate of processing. The necessity of low molecular weight cellular component(s) for NS2/3 reactions was previously noted (16Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, for all subsequent measurements, a 10-fold dilution of in vitrosynthesized NS2/3 into lysate filtrate was used. The accumulation of products for 810–1615BK occurred at a rate of 0.04 min−1, a rate comparable to the qualitative results previously published using different extensions of the NS2/3 polypeptide (4Grakoui A.

Peptides containing the cleavage site sequence of NS2/3, RLL*API (where * denotes the scissile bond), were tested for their effect upon NS2/3 processing in reactions of 60 min. No significant effect was observed with a variety of substrate or product-like peptides at a concentration of 500 μm, as shown in Fig. 1 A and TableI. NS4A peptides were inhibitory, as shown for peptide 33 in Fig. 1 A. The inhibition appeared to occur immediately, since no pre-incubation of NS2/3 with peptide was performed before initiation of the reaction.

The inhibition by NS4A peptides could be titrated; typical results are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Potencies of 5.7 and 3.4 μm were obtained for peptides 33 and 37, respectively. Peptides that represent only a portion of the region known to bind to NS3, such as peptides 66 and 67, did not inhibit (Table I). A peptide with the same amino acid composition as peptide 33 but with a randomized sequence (4ApepB) inhibited with an IC50 nearly 25-fold greater than peptide 33 (Table I). The inhibition patterns shown in Table I were observed with both 810–1615BK and Mal849–1240J. Peptide HCV 33 also inhibits processing of the NS2/3 protein, 849–1240J; therefore, the effect is not construct- or strain-specific (data not shown). Peptides unrelated to NS4A or the NS2/3 cleavage site were not inhibitory (Table I). Despite numerous reports of NS2/3 processing reactions in cells and in vitro translation systems, a defined assay system containing purified NS2/3 protein is yet to be described. Existing techniques with in vitro translated NS2/3 have been exploited here to study the effects of potential peptide ligands of NS2/3. In the experiments described, the NS2/3 concentration is extremely low, possibly as low as 1 nm based upon an estimated specific activity of the radiolabeled protein produced (data not shown). The finding that dilution has no effect on the proportion of NS2/3 cleaved within a given time is consistent with an intramolecular mechanism. In addition, the lack of significant inhibition by potentially competing substrates, that is, peptides representing the cleavage site, is also consistent with an intramolecular cleavage. 2A “bimolecular” cleavage has been reported (27Reed K.E. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4127-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) wherein a wild-type, processed NS2 was found to complement a C993A mutant of NS2/3. NS4A is identified here as an inhibitor of NS2/3 processing. In judging the potency of the inhibition, it is most reasonable to consider the case of a mechanism of NS2/3 cleavage as depicted in Scheme 1, where the rate constantk determines the rate of product accumulation, and a simple association reaction of NS2/3 with inhibitor (I) is governed by an equilibrium constant, K i. NS2/3+IKi⥮NS2/3:I→kNS2+NS3Scheme 1 The rate of product (P) formation is given bydP/dt = k·[NS2/3]n, where n is the order of the reaction with respect to concentration. We have determined with initialdP/dt measurements as a function of NS2/3 concentration that n = 1. Additionally, according to Scheme 1, K i = [I][NS2/3]/[NS2/3:I]. Thus, inhibitor binding that reduces the value of [NS2/3]1 anddP/dt by 50% (the IC50) is theK i. It is of interest, therefore, to compare theK i values found here, 3.4 and 5.7 μmfor peptides 33 and 37, respectively, with the K dvalues determined for a NS3:NS4A complex. It has been reported that with a NS4A peptide (KKKGSVVIVGRIILSGR-NH2) at 1 mm, the association with NS3 protease is not observable in the absence of glycerol (24Bianchi E. Urbani A. Biasiol G. Brunetti M. Pessi A. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7890-7897Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Only with 50% glycerol is the reportedK d (5.3 μm) as low as theK i found here in the absence of glycerol. The longer NS2/3 may be more predisposed to avid NS4A association. 3It has been reported that NS4A also inhibits NS3 helicase through its association with the NS3 protease domain (17Gallinari P. Brennan D. Nardi C. Bruneti M. Tomei L. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6758-6769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gallinari P. Paolini C. Brennan D. Nardi C. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5620-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We find that NS4A peptides bind strongly to polynucleotides, complicating the analysis of NS4A peptide effects upon helicase activity. The x-ray crystallographic structures of NS3 protease alone and in an NS4A-bound form allow an explanation for the NS4A inhibition of NS2/3 processing. As depicted schematically in Fig.2, NS4A binding brings the N terminus of NS3 into a stable β-sheet structure that is an integral part of the NS3 domain. The overall structure of NS2/3 may be affected similarly by NS4A binding, with residues critical for cleavage not positioned for the reaction in the NS4-bound state. Specifically, the cleavage site may be rendered inaccessible by NS4A binding, as depicted in Fig.2. The NS2/3 cleavage site sequence and the residues essential for cleavage are absolutely conserved in sequences of isolated strains of HCV, so that NS2/3 is presumed to be essential for viral replication. It may seem odd, therefore, that an essential cofactor for NS3 protease activity, the NS4A, would inhibit another essential process. The available data can be reconciled by the hypothesis that NS2/3 cleavage normally precedes NS4A release and NS3 protease processing of the rest of the NS region. In the absence of methods for replication of HCV in cell culture, the definition of the temporal sequence of HCV proteolysis events has not been possible. Our data presented here suggest that NS4A must not be released prematurely, or the NS2/3 cleavage would be inhibited. Although this idea appears inconsistent with in vitro translation studies showing that NS3/NS4A cleavage can occur in polyproteins wherein NS2/3 cleavage has not occurred (25Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6215-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the rates of NS4A release have not been determined in those studies. The possibility remains that the normal sequence of proteolytic events in HCV replication includes NS2/3 cleavage as preceding NS3 protease action. The proper timing of proteolytic events has been demonstrated to be essential for viral replication in other systems such as HIV (26Krausslich H.-G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that premature occupancy of the NS4A binding site is now a conceivable avenue for therapeutic intervention in the hepatitis C virus life cycle.

In the present study, we analyzed mechanisms by which FK506 induces IκBα degradation. We found that FK506 induces the degradation of both IκBα and IκBβ and that the time courses of the FK506-induced degradation are quite different from degradation induced by interleukin 1 (IL-1). Despite this difference, FK506-induced IκBα degradation was dependent on the N-terminal Ser-32 and Ser-36 phosphorylation sites and was mediated by proteasomes, as is the case for IL-1-induced IκBα degradation. We further showed that FK506 induces weak and slow phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32. However, unlike IL-1-induced degradation, IKK-1 and IKK-2 were not activated significantly nor was FK506-induced IκBα degradation dependent on the N-terminal ubiquitination sites (Lys-21 and Lys-22).

It is a heterodimer mainly composed of the p50 and RelA proteins, but there might be a considerable heterogeneity in its composition in various cell types, because of the presence of p50/RelA-related proteins (p52, c-Rel, and RelB), which share extensive homology in their N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization regions. These proteins are now known as the NF-κB/Rel/Dorsal transcription factor family, as they are also related to the Drosophila maternal morphogen gene, dorsal. An unusual feature of this family is that they exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive form complexed with a family of inhibitor proteins termed IκB (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε). A variety of stimuli, including virus infection, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, double-stranded RNA, phorbol esters, UV radiation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activate NF-κB through the proteolytic degradation of IκB and the subsequent translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where it activates target genes (1Verma I.M.

This phosphorylation triggers the ligation of multiple ubiquitin molecules to nearby lysine residues (Lys-21 and Lys-22), leading to the subsequent degradation of the protein by proteasomes (6DiDonato J.

The signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα is therefore a critical step in NF-κB activation and has been investigated intensively. Recently, two closely related IκB kinases (IKKs), termed IKK-1 and IKK-2, have been identified and cloned. Both kinases directly phosphorylate Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα and their activities are stimulated by IL-1 and TNF-α treatment (10DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and a kinase related to IKK-1 and IKK-2 (termed IKK-3) (16Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have also been shown to phosphorylate Ser-32 and Ser-36. Thus, it remains to be established how these various IκB kinases are specifically activated in response to diverse NF-κB activators.FK506 is a powerful immunosuppressive drug that is currently in clinical use. It exerts its major immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting transcriptional events, including the activation of several cytokine genes, particularly the interleukin-2 gene, that lead to T-cell activation (17Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). We previously showed that FK506 induces IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation in nonlymphoid cells such as renal mesangial cells and fibroblasts. We further showed that, as a result of NF-κB activation by FK506, interleukin-6 production is induced in the kidney, suggesting the possibility of a causal relationship between the FK506-induced NF-κB activation/IL-6 production and some FK506-induced renal abnormalities (18Muraoka K. Fujimoto K. Sun X. Yoshioka K. Shimizu K. Yagi M. Bose Jr., H. Miyazaki I. Yamamoto K. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2433-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how FK506 induces IκBα degradation in nonlymphoid cells. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanisms by which FK506 induce IκBα degradation. We found that, as in the case of IL-1-induced IκBα degradation, FK506-induced IκBα degradation is dependent on the N-terminal serine phosphorylation sites and is mediated by proteasomes. However, the N-terminal ubiquitination sites were not essential for FK506-induced IκBα degradation, and FK506 induced weak and slow phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32, in the absence of significant IKK activation. Thus, these results suggest that FK506 and IL-1 induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα through similar but distinct mechanisms.DISCUSSIONFK506 inhibits the activation of several transcription factors involved in cytokine gene expression in T cells, including NF-κB. We previously showed that FK506 activates NF-κB through IκBα degradation in nonlymphoid cells, and this FK506-induced NF-κB activation results in the efficient induction of IL-6 productionin vitro and in vivo (18Muraoka K.

However, little is known about how FK506 induces NF-κB activation through IκBα degradation in nonlymphoid cells. In the present study, we found that FK506 induced the degradation of both IκBα and IκBβ and that the time courses of their degradation were completely different from those of the degradation mediated by IL-1 (Fig. 1). However, as in the case of IκBα degradation induced by IL-1 (4Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U.

We further demonstrated that FK506 induced the weak and slow phosphorylation of Ser-32 (Fig. 4). These results therefore indicate that, whereas the time course of the FK506-mediated IκBα degradation is quite different from that induced by IL-1, FK506 and IL-1 utilize similar mechanisms for inducing IκBα degradation and hence NF-κB activation.Inducing the phosphorylation of the N-terminal serines is a key step in IκB degradation and the subsequent NF-κB activation, induced by various NF-κB activators, including IL-1. Because FK506-mediated IκBα degradation is also dependent on N-terminal phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2) and FK506 induces Ser-32 phosphorylation (Fig. 4), it is of interest to study what IκB kinases are activated by FK506 and how FK506 activates them. A protein kinase complex whose activity is stimulated by IL-1 and TNF-α and which mediates IκBα phosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36 was recently purified, and two of the subunits of this complex (IKK-1 and IKK-2) have now been cloned and sequenced (9–14 and 29). The results of recent mouse knockout studies indicate that whereas IKK-2 is essential for IκBα phosphorylation induced by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α, IKK-1 is dispensable for IL-1/TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and is involved in limb and skin morphogenesis (31Takeda K.

Yamamoto, unpublished data. or IKK-2 (Fig. 5) activation with FK506. These results suggest that other recently described IκB kinases such as pp90rsk (15Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and IKK-3 (16Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or unidentified IκB kinases are involved in the FK506-mediated IκBα phosphorylation. However, whereas FK506 is very effective in JNK activation (Fig. 5), it did not induce a significant activation of Erk,2 which lies immediately upstream of pp90rsk in the phorbol ester and growth factor signaling pathway (34Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 35Stugill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L.

Therefore, the involvement of pp90rsk in IκBα phosphorylation mediated by FK506 is unlikely, although a possible direct pp90rsk activation by FK506 cannot be excluded.Another important and unresolved question is how FK506 activates the putative IκB kinase. Because we found that a nonimmunosuppressive FK506 analog (36Dumon F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.J. Siekierka J.J. Lin C.S. Harrison R. Sewell T. Kindt V.M. Beattie T.R. Wyvratt M. Sigal N.H. J. Exp.

However, it is unlikely that the inhibition of FKBP peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by FK506 (17Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar) results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, thus leading to NF-κB activation (37Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), because this FK506 analog is effective in inhibiting FKBP peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (36Dumon F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.J. Siekierka J.J. Lin C.S. Harrison R. Sewell T. Kindt V.M. Beattie T.R. Wyvratt M. Sigal N.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is more likely that an FK506-FKBP complex interacts with kinases or phosphatases involved in an IκB kinase activation pathway and that this interaction results in IκB kinase activation and subsequent IκBα degradation. In this context, it is interesting to note that an FK506-FKBP complex interacts with various cellular signaling factors such as calcineurin (17Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar), ryanodine receptors (38Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondrisova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 512-523Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and type-I receptors for TGF-β (39Wang T. Li B. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and can modulate the functions of these factors.It is now clear that the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 results in a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the IκB ubiquitin ligase, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκBα by proteasomes (40Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that both IL-1 and FK506 induce the phosphorylation of IκBα, at least at Ser-32 (Fig. 4), and these N-terminal serine residues are essential for both IL-1 and FK506-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 2). However, whereas the N-terminal ubiquitination sites (Lys-21 and Lys-22) are essential for IL-1-induced IκBα degradation, these ubiquitination sites are dispensable for FK506-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 6). In agreement with these results, the K21R/K22R IκBα mutant was less effective in inhibiting FK506-induced NF-κB activation than was the S32A/S36A IκBα mutant (Fig. 7). Although the possibility that IκBα is ubiquitinated at other lysine residues in FK506-treated cells has not been completely ruled out, these results raise the possibility that IκBα is degraded by proteasomes in an ubiquitin-independent manner in FK506-treated cells. Several examples exist of proteins, including c-Jun and IκBα, being degraded in a ubiquitin-independent, proteasome-mediated manner (41Murakami Y. Mastufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 42Jariel-Encontre I. Pariat M. Martin F. Carillo S. Salvat C. Piechaczyk M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Jun and IκBα appear to be degradable by proteasomes in both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent manners. Interestingly, it was recently reported that a 450-kDa complex, whose subunits show sequence homology to those of a proteasome regulatory complex, phosphorylates c-Jun as well as IκBα (20Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 470: 469-478Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that this regulatory complex not only phosphorylates but also presents IκBα for degradation by proteasomes in a ubiquitin-independent manner. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)1 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in inducing the expression of diverse cellular genes, such as for various cytokines, cell surface receptors, and acute-phase proteins. It is a heterodimer mainly composed of the p50 and RelA proteins, but there might be a considerable heterogeneity in its composition in various cell types, because of the presence of p50/RelA-related proteins (p52, c-Rel, and RelB), which share extensive homology in their N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization regions. These proteins are now known as the NF-κB/Rel/Dorsal transcription factor family, as they are also related to the Drosophila maternal morphogen gene, dorsal. An unusual feature of this family is that they exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive form complexed with a family of inhibitor proteins termed IκB (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε). A variety of stimuli, including virus infection, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, double-stranded RNA, phorbol esters, UV radiation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activate NF-κB through the proteolytic degradation of IκB and the subsequent translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where it activates target genes (1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2733-2735Crossref Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

The prototypic and best-studied of the IκBs is IκBα, which is phosphorylated at its N-terminal two serine residues (Ser-32 and Ser-36) prior to degradation, when cells are exposed to appropriate NF-κB activators (4Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 5Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee Y.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation triggers the ligation of multiple ubiquitin molecules to nearby lysine residues (Lys-21 and Lys-22), leading to the subsequent degradation of the protein by proteasomes (6DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rossete C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D.C.

The signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα is therefore a critical step in NF-κB activation and has been investigated intensively. Recently, two closely related IκB kinases (IKKs), termed IKK-1 and IKK-2, have been identified and cloned. Both kinases directly phosphorylate Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα and their activities are stimulated by IL-1 and TNF-α treatment (10DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

In addition, pp90rsk kinase (15Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and a kinase related to IKK-1 and IKK-2 (termed IKK-3) (16Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have also been shown to phosphorylate Ser-32 and Ser-36. Thus, it remains to be established how these various IκB kinases are specifically activated in response to diverse NF-κB activators. FK506 is a powerful immunosuppressive drug that is currently in clinical use. It exerts its major immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting transcriptional events, including the activation of several cytokine genes, particularly the interleukin-2 gene, that lead to T-cell activation (17Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). We previously showed that FK506 induces IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation in nonlymphoid cells such as renal mesangial cells and fibroblasts. We further showed that, as a result of NF-κB activation by FK506, interleukin-6 production is induced in the kidney, suggesting the possibility of a causal relationship between the FK506-induced NF-κB activation/IL-6 production and some FK506-induced renal abnormalities (18Muraoka K. Fujimoto K. Sun X. Yoshioka K. Shimizu K. Yagi M. Bose Jr., H. Miyazaki I. Yamamoto K. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2433-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how FK506 induces IκBα degradation in nonlymphoid cells. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanisms by which FK506 induce IκBα degradation. We found that, as in the case of IL-1-induced IκBα degradation, FK506-induced IκBα degradation is dependent on the N-terminal serine phosphorylation sites and is mediated by proteasomes. However, the N-terminal ubiquitination sites were not essential for FK506-induced IκBα degradation, and FK506 induced weak and slow phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32, in the absence of significant IKK activation. Thus, these results suggest that FK506 and IL-1 induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα through similar but distinct mechanisms. DISCUSSIONFK506 inhibits the activation of several transcription factors involved in cytokine gene expression in T cells, including NF-κB. We previously showed that FK506 activates NF-κB through IκBα degradation in nonlymphoid cells, and this FK506-induced NF-κB activation results in the efficient induction of IL-6 productionin vitro and in vivo (18Muraoka K.

However, little is known about how FK506 induces NF-κB activation through IκBα degradation in nonlymphoid cells. In the present study, we found that FK506 induced the degradation of both IκBα and IκBβ and that the time courses of their degradation were completely different from those of the degradation mediated by IL-1 (Fig. 1). However, as in the case of IκBα degradation induced by IL-1 (4Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 5Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar), FK506-induced IκBα degradation was also dependent on the N-terminal Ser-32 and Ser-36 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2) and was mediated by proteasomes (Fig. 3). We further demonstrated that FK506 induced the weak and slow phosphorylation of Ser-32 (Fig. 4). These results therefore indicate that, whereas the time course of the FK506-mediated IκBα degradation is quite different from that induced by IL-1, FK506 and IL-1 utilize similar mechanisms for inducing IκBα degradation and hence NF-κB activation.Inducing the phosphorylation of the N-terminal serines is a key step in IκB degradation and the subsequent NF-κB activation, induced by various NF-κB activators, including IL-1. Because FK506-mediated IκBα degradation is also dependent on N-terminal phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2) and FK506 induces Ser-32 phosphorylation (Fig. 4), it is of interest to study what IκB kinases are activated by FK506 and how FK506 activates them. A protein kinase complex whose activity is stimulated by IL-1 and TNF-α and which mediates IκBα phosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36 was recently purified, and two of the subunits of this complex (IKK-1 and IKK-2) have now been cloned and sequenced (9–14 and 29). The results of recent mouse knockout studies indicate that whereas IKK-2 is essential for IκBα phosphorylation induced by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α, IKK-1 is dispensable for IL-1/TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and is involved in limb and skin morphogenesis (31Takeda K.

Although we detected IL-1-induced IKK-2 (Fig. 5), in agreement with the results of previous studies (9–14 and 22), we have not so far detected significant IKK-1 2Y.-k. Zhang and K.-i. Yamamoto, unpublished data. or IKK-2 (Fig. 5) activation with FK506. These results suggest that other recently described IκB kinases such as pp90rsk (15Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and IKK-3 (16Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or unidentified IκB kinases are involved in the FK506-mediated IκBα phosphorylation. However, whereas FK506 is very effective in JNK activation (Fig. 5), it did not induce a significant activation of Erk,2 which lies immediately upstream of pp90rsk in the phorbol ester and growth factor signaling pathway (34Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 35Stugill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L.

Although we detected IL-1-induced IKK-2 (Fig. 5), in agreement with the results of previous studies (9–14 and 22), we have not so far detected significant IKK-1 2Y.-k. Zhang and K.-i. Yamamoto, unpublished data. or IKK-2 (Fig. 5) activation with FK506. These results suggest that other recently described IκB kinases such as pp90rsk (15Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and IKK-3 (16Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or unidentified IκB kinases are involved in the FK506-mediated IκBα phosphorylation. However, whereas FK506 is very effective in JNK activation (Fig. 5), it did not induce a significant activation of Erk,2 which lies immediately upstream of pp90rsk in the phorbol ester and growth factor signaling pathway (34Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 35Stugill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Therefore, the involvement of pp90rsk in IκBα phosphorylation mediated by FK506 is unlikely, although a possible direct pp90rsk activation by FK506 cannot be excluded. Another important and unresolved question is how FK506 activates the putative IκB kinase. Because we found that a nonimmunosuppressive FK506 analog (36Dumon F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.J. Siekierka J.J. Lin C.S. Harrison R. Sewell T. Kindt V.M. Beattie T.R. Wyvratt M. Sigal N.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) is inactive in NF-κB activation and competitively inhibits FK506-mediated NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation,2 it appears that cytosolic FK506-binding proteins (termed FKBP) are involved in FK506-mediated NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation. However, it is unlikely that the inhibition of FKBP peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by FK506 (17Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar) results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, thus leading to NF-κB activation (37Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), because this FK506 analog is effective in inhibiting FKBP peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (36Dumon F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.J. Siekierka J.J. Lin C.S. Harrison R. Sewell T. Kindt V.M. Beattie T.R. Wyvratt M. Sigal N.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is more likely that an FK506-FKBP complex interacts with kinases or phosphatases involved in an IκB kinase activation pathway and that this interaction results in IκB kinase activation and subsequent IκBα degradation. In this context, it is interesting to note that an FK506-FKBP complex interacts with various cellular signaling factors such as calcineurin (17Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar), ryanodine receptors (38Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondrisova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 512-523Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and type-I receptors for TGF-β (39Wang T. Li B. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.L. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and can modulate the functions of these factors. It is now clear that the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 results in a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the IκB ubiquitin ligase, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκBα by proteasomes (40Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that both IL-1 and FK506 induce the phosphorylation of IκBα, at least at Ser-32 (Fig. 4), and these N-terminal serine residues are essential for both IL-1 and FK506-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 2). However, whereas the N-terminal ubiquitination sites (Lys-21 and Lys-22) are essential for IL-1-induced IκBα degradation, these ubiquitination sites are dispensable for FK506-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 6). In agreement with these results, the K21R/K22R IκBα mutant was less effective in inhibiting FK506-induced NF-κB activation than was the S32A/S36A IκBα mutant (Fig. 7). Although the possibility that IκBα is ubiquitinated at other lysine residues in FK506-treated cells has not been completely ruled out, these results raise the possibility that IκBα is degraded by proteasomes in an ubiquitin-independent manner in FK506-treated cells. Several examples exist of proteins, including c-Jun and IκBα, being degraded in a ubiquitin-independent, proteasome-mediated manner (41Murakami Y. Mastufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 42Jariel-Encontre I. Pariat M. Martin F. Carillo S. Salvat C. Piechaczyk M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Jun and IκBα appear to be degradable by proteasomes in both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent manners. Interestingly, it was recently reported that a 450-kDa complex, whose subunits show sequence homology to those of a proteasome regulatory complex, phosphorylates c-Jun as well as IκBα (20Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 470: 469-478Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that this regulatory complex not only phosphorylates but also presents IκBα for degradation by proteasomes in a ubiquitin-independent manner. We thank K. Tanaka and J. Katou for valuable discussions, J. H. Maeda for the human IκBα cDNA, and K. Take for technical assistance."

The attraction of these enantiomers for work with adenylyl cyclases is that the 3′-OH is on the opposite side of the ribose relative to the normal substrate and should place it too distant for the cyclizing reaction yielding cAMP to occur.

The preparation of β-l-adenosine-5′-triphosphate (5) was accomplished according to the Ludwig's method (22Ludwig J. Acta Biochem. Biophys. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1981; 16: 131-133PubMed Google Scholar) (Scheme FS2). β-l-Adenosine (1) was reacted with phosphorus oxychloride in trimethylphosphate to afford the phosphorodichloridate intermediate. This compound was treated with a freshly prepared solution of bis-tri-n-butylammonium pyrophosphate (23Moffatt J.G. Can. J. Chem. 1964; 42: 599-604Crossref Google Scholar) to give a cyclic trimetaphosphate derivative, which was hydrolyzed by addition of TEA·HCO3. Purification of β-l-5′-ATP (5) was performed as described above for β-l-5′-AMP (2) and β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP (4). Following a previously described procedure (23Moffatt J.G. Can. J. Chem. 1964; 42: 599-604Crossref Google Scholar), a solution of tetrasodium pyrophosphate decahydrate (Sigma S-9515) (446 mg, 1.0 mmol) in water was passed through Dowex 50W-X2 (20 ml; pyridine form). The collected fractions were concentrated to dryness and diluted with pyridine (30 ml) and tri-n-butylamine (1.0 ml). The homogeneous solution was evaporated to a syrup and co-evaporated with pyridine and toluene. The material was dissolved intoN,N-dimethylformamide (2.0 ml) and tributylamine (0.20 ml) to give the anhydrous pyrophosphate solution, which was used later. A cooled (0 °C) solution of β-l-5′-adenosine(1Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar) (53 mg, 0.20 mmol) in trimethylphosphate (0.5 ml) was treated with phosphorus oxychloride (27 μl, 0.26 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1.5 h, then the pyrophosphate solution was quickly added under vigorous stirring. 1 min later, the trimetaphosphate was hydrolyzed by adding 20 ml of cold TEA·HCO3 (1 m, pH 7.2), and the mixture was concentrated to dryness. The crude material was enriched by anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephadex A-25; equilibrated in 1 mm TEA·HCO3), which was developed with a linear gradient of TEA·HCO3 (1 mm to 1m). A subsequent enrichment by preparative TLC (isopropanol/aqueous ammonia solution 20%/water, 11/7/2, v/v/v) was performed, followed by filtration through a Millex unity HV-4 (0.45 μm, Millipore) to afford a solid material, which was again subjected to anion exchange chromatography as above. The appropriate fractions were combined, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature, and the residue was lyophilized several times from water. The triphosphate derivative was converted to its sodium salt by passing an aqueous solution through a column of Dowex 50W-X2 (Na+ form). Lyophilization afforded β-l-5′-ATP (5, 45 mg) as a white powder. 31P NMR (D2O) δ −8.56 (d, 1P, Pγ), −10.60 (d, 1P, Pα), −22.10 (br s, 1P, Pβ); 1H NMR (D2O) δ 4.1–4.3 (m, 2H, 5′-H and 5”-H), 4.5 (br s, 1H, 4′-H), 4.6 (br s, 1H, 3′-H), 4.8 (br s, 1H, 2′-H), 6.02 (d, 1H, 1′-H,J 1′,2′ = 4.9 Hz), 8.13 and 8.42 (2 s, 2H, 2-H and 8-H), MS (FAB > 0, GT) m/e 136 (BH2)+, 530 (M−3Na+4H)+, 552 (M−2Na + 3H)+, 574 (M−Na + 2H)+, 596 (M+H)+; MS (FAB < 0, GT) 134 (B)−, 528 (M−3Na+2H)−, 550 (M−2Na+H)−, 572 (M−Na)−, 594 (M− H)−; [α]D20 = + 21 (c = 1.10, H2O) ([α]D20 = −19 (c = 0.98, H2O) for a commercial sample of β-d-5′-ATP); UV (H2O) λmin 227 nm, λmax 259 nm. Unlabeled β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP was prepared from β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP (4Désaubry L. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24972-24977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by incubation with myokinase, creatine kinase, and creatine phosphate, with a less than stoichiometric concentration of 5′-ATP. 4The phosphorylation of β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP to the corresponding 5′-triphosphate was also catalyzed by myokinase (100 μg/ml), phosphoenolpyruvate (5 mm), and pyruvate kinase (100 μg/ml). This 5′-ATP is used by myokinase in the primary phosphorylation of β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP but is then regained from creatine phosphate by the action of creatine kinase. Although concentrations of 5′-ATP >100 μm will allow the total conversion of β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP to β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP to occur more rapidly, separation of substrates and products becomes more difficult. The typical phosphorylation of 1 mmβ-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP was achieved with a reaction mixture containing 100 μm 5′-ATP, 100 μg of myokinase/ml, 100 μg of creatine kinase/ml, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mmtriethanolamine·HCl in 4.4 ml overnight at 30 °C; effective reaction times were determined in other experiments. The resulting β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP was separated from the starting 5′-monophosphate and 5′-ATP by reverse phase HPLC (see Fig.1, described below). The column (Beckman Ultrasphere; 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) was developed with a linear gradient from a buffer containing 100 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, to a buffer containing 0.9 mtriethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 and 10% methanol. 5It is important that the triethylammonium bicarbonate be made fresh for the day of use. Over time, oxidation products of triethylamine will form and the loss of CO2, causing an increase in pH, and methanol will result in substantial shifts in retention times. The appropriate fractions were pooled, triethylammonium bicarbonate was removed by repetitive roto-evaporation from HPLC grade methanol, the dried product was resuspended in water, and then stored at −80 °C. Under these reaction conditions there is a quantitative conversion of β-l-2′, 3′-dd-5′-AMP to the corresponding 5′-triphosphate and the only losses incurred are those associated with purification of product. Labeled ligand was prepared similarly, but with a two-step incubation, first with myokinase and [γ-32P]5′-ATP and then with creatine phosphate and creatine kinase. Because of the enzymes and [γ-32P]5′-ATP used for this preparation, the β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP becomes labeled in the β-phosphate. In a typical reaction 10 mCi of [γ-32P]5′-ATP was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 300 μmβ-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP, 1 mg myokinase/ml, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm triethanolamine·HCl overnight at 30 °C in a volume of 680 μl. To inactivate the myokinase, the sample was placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. It was then cooled on ice for 5 min and creatine phosphate and creatine kinase were added to final concentrations of 10 mm and 1 mg/ml, respectively, to a final volume of 800 μl. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 30 °C. Substrate and product nucleotides were purified by reverse phase HPLC as used before for the unlabeled ligand above. 32P from [γ-32P]5′-ATP (Fig. 1, top panel) was effectively transferred to β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP to yield β-l-2′,3′-dd-[β-32P]5′-ADP (Fig. 1,middle panel). A small amount of an unknown labeled material eluted later than the 5′-diphosphate, suggesting that some 5′-triphosphate was also formed. Because this was not seen in other reactions in which the myokinase concentrations was one-tenth of that used here, it was likely due to contamination of the myokinase with an appropriate phosphotransferase activity. The phosphorylation to β-l-2′,3′-dd-[β-32P]5′-ATP was essentially quantitative under these conditions (Fig. 1, bottom panel). The 32P-labeled product was collected, concentrated, and stored as was done for the unlabeled nucleotide above. Unlabeled and labeled β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP co-migrated upon both anion exchange and reverse phase HPLC (not shown). Taking into account losses due to purification and isotope decay, the overall yield was ∼6 mCi of purified β-l-2′,3′-dd-[β-32P]5′-ATP from 10 mCi [γ-32P]5′-ATP. An advantage of β-l-2′,3′-dd-[β-32P]5′-ATP as ligand is that any β-l-2′,3′-dd-[β-32P]5′-ADP formed during incubations with crude enzyme preparations can be rephosphorylated by an ATP-regenerating system comprising creatine phosphate and creatine kinase with no effect on the isotope-specific activity of the nucleotide. Unlabeled nucleotides were quantified after HPLC as areas under peaks determined with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector and the accompanying Millennium software (v.2.10). Radioactivity of HPLC column eluates was quantified with a Flow-Count Detector from Bioscan (Washington, D.C.) with the accompanying Laura software (GC Ram version 1.4a) from LabLogic (Sheffield, UK). Adenylyl cyclase was prepared as a detergent-dispersed extract from rat brain as described previously (1Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar, 24Johnson R.A. Alvarez R. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Activity was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 100 μm forskolin, 0.1 mm[α-32P]5′-ATP (2 × 105 to 106 cpm), in a volume of 100 μl, for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of [α-32P]5′ATP and was ended by the addition of zinc acetate and sodium carbonate (24Johnson R.A. Alvarez R. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). [32P]cAMP was purified by sequential chromatography on Dowex 50 and alumina and was quantified in a scintillation spectrometer by Cherenkov radiation. Inhibition kinetics were evaluated as described previously (25Garbers D.L. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8449-8456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with variable concentrations of substrate Mn2+·5′-ATP and free cation held fixed in excess of the 5′-ATP concentration. Product formation from the normal substrate, β-d-5′-ATP, was effectively blocked by itsl-isomer, but notably at a concentration significantly lower than that of the substrate (Fig.2); β-l-5′-ATP exhibited an IC50 ∼3 μm in the presence of 100 μm substrate. This suggested that the β-l-configuration of the nucleotide interacted particularly well with the enzyme nucleotide binding site. By comparison β-l-5′-AMP exhibited an inhibitory potency comparable to that of the naturally occurring β-d-5′-AMP (Fig. 2 and Table I), implying that the addition of phosphate groups may influence the orientation of the ribose moiety in the binding site. The observation that β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-AMP was more potent than β-l-5′-AMP, however, suggested that this unnatural orientation of the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of β-l-5′-AMP impaired its interaction with the enzyme and that their removal from β-l-5′-ATP would be expected also to increase inhibitory potency. This was borne out for both β-d- and β-l-isomers of 2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP (Fig. 2 and Table I). Consistent with the apparent affinity of β-l-5′-ATP being greater than that of the naturally occurring d-isomer, β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP was >30-fold more potent than β-d-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP. With an IC50 value of ∼24 nm, β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP exhibited an inhibitory potency comparable to that of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP (IC50 ∼40 nm), although it was not as potent as the corresponding 3′-tetraphosphate (Fig. 2 and Table I) (4Désaubry L. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24972-24977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With such low IC50 values, enzyme concentration becomes an important consideration. Although the exact concentration of adenylyl cyclase used in experiments with the rat brain preparation was not known, it was estimated to be approximately 0.9 nm, with the assumptions of a mass of 116 kDa and a specific activity of 7 μmol/(min·mg of protein) for the purified type I adenylyl cyclase (26Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest that the IC50 values are probably good approximations.Table IIC50 values for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by several adenine nucleotidesNucleotideInhibition patternIC50values rat brainμmβ-l-5′-ATPC3.25′-AP(CH2)PPC30β-d-5′-AMPND1501-aFrom Johnson et al.

Enzyme activity was used to assess formation and dissolution of VC1·IIC2.

When the C1domain of the type V isozyme (VC1) and the C2domain of the type II isozyme (IIC2) are expressed separately in Escherichia coli and then recombined, a functional adenylyl cyclase is formed upon their association in solution (2Whisnant R.E.

Available evidence suggests that both catalysis and inhibition by P-site ligands occur at a common site within a cleft formed at the interface of the two cytosolic domains (6Zhang G. Liu Y.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is viewed as occurring via a post-transition state dead-end mechanism (5Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), although it is unclear how this is effected, especially in view of the competitive inhibition observed with comparably potent substrate analogs that act at the same locus but apparently on the pretransition state of the enzyme (9Johnson R.A.

The difference in inhibitory mechanisms induced by the ATP isomers suggested oscillation of adenylyl cyclase between two conformational states but only one of which could bind P-site ligands. In earlier studies we demonstrated through direct photo cross-linking of VC1 and IIC2 cytosolic domains with 5′-[α-32P]ATP and 2′-d-3′-[32P]AMP that each cytosolic domain was capable of binding both substrate and P-site inhibitor (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The data suggested that the individual cytosolic domains exhibit distinct conformational states and that these are not in rapid equilibrium, thereby allowing independent binding of substrate and inhibitor with the individual domains (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the possibility that the binding of P-site ligands to C1 and/or C2 may substantially alter the interaction between the domains. Inasmuch as one of the most potent ligands, 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP2(IC50 ∼40 nm; (12Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol.

To circumvent the poor quantum efficiency of direct photo cross-linking of labeled adenosine derivatives, which we noted in the earlier studies (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol.

The synthesis of γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP (Fig.1) followed the procedure previously reported for nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (17Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Abdukaiumov M.N.

The 3′-γ-phosphate of the nucleotide was activated by addition of 10 μmol ofN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 0.5 μmol of pyridine·HCl. After a 45-min incubation period at room temperature,N,N′-dicyclohexylurea was removed by centrifugation, and 10 μl of 12.6 m 1-methylimidazole was added to the reaction mixture. This mixture was incubated for an additional 45 min and γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP was precipitated by 500 μl of cold acetone containing 2% NaClO4. The precipitate was washed twice with 500 μl of cold acetone, dried in a SpeedVac, dissolved in water, and used in this form for covalent labeling of adenylyl cyclase cytosolic domains. Syntheses of unlabeled and γ-32P-labeled γ-azidoanilido-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP (Fig. 1) were similar to those for γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP above. After activation of the γ-phosphate of unlabeled (0.1 μmol) or γ-32P-labeled 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP (200–400 cpm/pmol, by Cherenkov radiation) by 10 μmol N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as above, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.5 m p-azidoaniline hydrochloride titrated by triethylammonium (1/1, mol/mol). After 2 h at 22 °C the product and unreacted 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP were precipitated as described above. Product γ-azidoanilido-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP was isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography anion exchange chromatography (TosoHaas, 10 μm DEAE-5PW, 7.5 × 75 mm) developed with a 50-ml gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate (50–500 mm, pH 8.5). Appropriate fractions were collected and triethylammonium bicarbonate was removed by repetitive evaporation from methanol. Recombinant VC1 and IIC2 were expressed in E. coli cells and purified as described (2Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Isolated proteins were electrophoretically homogeneous with apparent molecular masses of 30 and 26 kDa for VC1 and IIC2, respectively. Adenylyl cyclase assays followed previously described procedures (19Johnson R.A. Alvarez R. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reactions were in a medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 100 μm forskolin, 0.5 mm[α-32P]5′-ATP (10–60 cpm/pmol, by Cherenkov radiation), 1 μm VC1 and 1 μmIIC2, in a volume of 30 μl for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were started by the addition of VC1·IIC2 complex and were terminated by the addition of zinc acetate and sodium carbonate. [32P]cAMP was purified by sequential chromatography on Dowex 50 and Al2O3 and was quantified by Cherenkov radiation in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Adenylyl cyclase activity was used as a measure of the formation of the active VC1·IIC2 complex. Association of the VC1·IIC2 complex was achieved in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm forskolin, 2 μm VC1, and 2 μmIIC2, in a volume of 30 μl for 2 min at 22 °C. VC1·IIC2 complex formation was evaluated in the absence or presence of 10 μm 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP, 1 mm 5′-ATP, or in the absence of nucleotides and then after sequential treatment either with 10 μm 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP followed by 1 mm 5′-ATP, or with 1 mm 5′-ATP followed by 10 μm 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP, for 2 min at 22 °C per each ligand. Dissociation of the VC1·IIC2complex was initiated by dilution of the enzyme-reaction mixture 20-fold with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, and 100 μm forskolin. At various times after dilution of the enzyme-reaction mixture, 30 μl portions were added to 3 μl of 10 mm [α-32P]5′-ATP (10–20 cpm/pmol, by Cherenkov radiation). To estimate adenylyl cyclase activity before dilution, portions of the enzyme were taken directly from the complex formation mixture and were added to an adenylyl cyclase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 μm forskolin, and 0.9 mm [α-32P]5′-ATP (10–20 cpm/pmol, by Cherenkov radiation). Adenylyl cyclase activity was then determined as above. Labeling of adenylyl cyclase cytosolic domains with γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP was performed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 μm forskolin, 10 μm γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP (200–400 cpm/pmol, by Cherenkov radiation), 5 μmVC1 and 5 μm IIC2 in a volume of 30 μl at 30 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP to a solution of either VC1, IIC2, or the VC1·IIC2 complex previously formed for 2 min at 22 °C. When ligands were tested for their ability to protect against covalent labeling, they were added before γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP for 2 min at 22 °C. The covalent labeling was stopped by the addition of 0.1% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol and then placed in a water bath at 65–70 °C for 3 min. Proteins and unreacted nucleotides were separated on an 11% polyacrylamide SDS gel. Labeled protein bands were quantified after a 3–5-h exposure on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and use of the accompanying ImageQuant software. Alternatively, bands corresponding to VC1 or IIC2 were cut from gels and quantified by Cherenkov radiation in a scintillation spectrometer. The association of C1 and C2 cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase yields the catalytically competent VC1·IIC2complex in a reversible process with an apparent K d∼1 μm (2Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the individual VC1 and IIC2 domains do not exhibit meaningful catalytic activity (2Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), adenylyl cyclase activity could be used to estimate the amount of the functionally active VC1·IIC2complex. This is demonstrated in the readily reversible nature of the active complex upon 20-fold dilution of the preformed VC1·IIC2 complex (Fig.2, control plot). The dilution was from 2 μm enzyme to a concentration of each cytosolic domain that was an order of magnitude below the K dand resulted in a dissociation that occurred rapidly with >50% inactivation occurring by the time of the earliest sampling at 15 s. When VC1 and IIC2 were added separately to a solution already containing 10 μm 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP (plot 2) the resulting adenylyl cyclase activity was low and remained low after dilution. This suggested that the preassociation of inhibitor with enzyme prevented the formation of a functionally active VC1·IIC2 complex. However, when 10 μm 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP was added to a preformed VC1·IIC2 complex just before dilution (Fig.2, plot 3), initially measured activity was reduced to approximately 15% of the value seen without the inhibitor (compare values at 0 min for control and plot 3). Upon dilution there may have been a small increase in activity in the 15 s sample, conceivably due to dissociation of weakly bound inhibitor, but thereafter the decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity occurred at a significantly lower rate than was seen withcontrol enzyme in the absence of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP. Even after 60 min the activity of the enzyme exposed to inhibitor remained higher than that of the control enzyme (Fig. 2, plot 3). A similar behavior was observed if, just before dilution, the preformed VC1·IIC2 complex was treated sequentially with 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP and then 5′-ATP (Fig. 2, plot 4), suggesting that even 1 mm 5′-ATP did not accelerate dissociation of the inhibitor. Thus, treatment of the VC1·IIC2 complex with 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP followed by 5′-ATP neither activated the enzyme nor affected the rate of subunit dissociation, when compared with enzyme treated with 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP alone (Fig. 2, plots 3 and4). These data suggest that the control plot reflects the rapid dissociation of the VC1·IIC2 complex, whereas the slow rate of activity loss observed in plot 3 might well reflect the slow rate of dissociation of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP from the VC1·IIC2 enzyme complex, because activity was higher than that seen when the VC1·IIC2complex was formed in the presence of inhibitor (plot 2). Alternatively, both inhibitor and substrate may stabilize the enzyme, and the shallow slopes of plots 3 and 4 may reflect enzyme inactivation due to other factors, e.g.thermal inactivation. The data (Fig. 2, plot 2) imply that binding of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP to the individual VC1 and IIC2 domains prevents the formation of a functionally active VC1·IIC2 complex. That is, the binding of inhibitor keeps the enzyme domains apart or in an inappropriately associated complex. The behavior of the VC1·IIC2 complex when treated with 5′-ATP (Fig. 3) was different from that above. The dissociation data of control VC1·IIC2 enzyme formed in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 3, control plot) are the same as shown in Fig. 2, control plot. If the enzyme was treated with 5′-ATP just before dilution, though, there was a notable 2.5-fold greater initial activity (compare initial values in plots 1 and3) and the half-time of complex dissociation was about 10 min (Fig. 3, plot 1). The apparent increase in enzyme activity was not due to an effect of carryover 5′-ATP into the assay mixture because this would represent at maximum an 11% increase in the 900 μm substrate concentration used in these assays and the K m for 5′-ATP for this chimeric construct has been reported to be in the range of 72–220 μm in assays with Mn2+ as cation (4Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is more likely that substrate and/or products formed during the 2-min pretreatment period stabilized the VC1·IIC2 enzyme complex or facilitated its formation. Under these reaction conditions 50% of the substrate was converted into cAMP and PPi during the treatment of the VC1·IIC2 complex with 5′-ATP for 2 min at 22 °C (not shown). This implies that the exchange of 5′-ATP, cAMP, and PPi between adenylyl cyclase and solution is a rapid process. Otherwise, saturation of the active site with nonradioactive substrate and products would have effectively restricted the formation of [32P]cAMP from 32P-labeled substrate in the subsequent adenylyl cyclase assay. Because these reactions were conducted with 2 μm for each VC1 and IIC2 and the K d ∼1 μm, approximately half the concentration of each cytosolic domain will be bound in the VC1·IIC2 complex. The high substrate concentration should facilitate association of VC1 and IIC2 yielding a larger percentage of the enzyme in the catalytically active complex and result in greater measured activity. Comparison of these effects of 5′-ATP and 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP would suggest that binding of the inhibitor is much stronger than of substrate. This is fully consistent with the observation that IC50 values for inhibition by 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP is three orders of magnitude lower than the K m value for metal-5′-ATP substrate, seen with native as well as recombinant adenylyl cyclase (12Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14028-14034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The data show further that 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP and 5′-ATP do not compete for the same enzyme configuration, consistent with the noncompetitive inhibition typical of P-site ligands. To verify that 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP could, in fact, bind to VC1 and IIC2 domains independently, and thereby alter their association to the catalytically competent VC1·IIC2 form, cross-linking ligands were synthesized and used. Substitution of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP at the γ-phosphate with an azidoanilido group did not meaningfully affect the potency of the 3′-nucleotide to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (Fig.4). Although irradiation of VC1, IIC2, or VC1·IIC2 with UV light at 300 nm in presence of γ-azidoanilodo-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP resulted in covalent modification of both subunits (not shown), the level of labeling was less than 1%. This was measurably better incorporation of label than we noted in the earlier use of direct UV irradiation in the presence of acetone as a sensitizer (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Because a more reactive reagent would be preferable, γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP was synthesized in both unlabeled and γ-32P-labeled forms (cf. see “Experimental Procedures”). However, due to the high rate of hydrolysis in aqueous solutions of γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP to the unsubstituted 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP, a meaningful comparison of its inhibitory potency with either 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP or the azidoanilido derivative was not possible. The fact that the azidoanilido group did not impair inhibitory potency, an observation that was consistent with the established tolerance of adenylyl cyclase to large substitutions at the 3′-ribosyl position (21Johnson R.A. Yeung S.M. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that the comparably sized (Fig.1) but more reactive γ-methylimidazole derivative may also be useful for covalent labeling of the enzyme. Incubation of VC1, IIC2, or VC1·IIC2 with γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP resulted in covalent labeling of both cytosolic domains (Figs.Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7).32P-Incorporation increased with time and approximately 20% of IIC2 became labeled after a 60-min exposure to this ligand (Fig. 5). VC1 was labeled with a comparable time course (not shown) and efficacy (Figs. 6 and 7, cf.lanes 1 and 4), as calculated from PhosphorImager data. Formation of a functional VC1·IIC2complex resulted in reduced 32P-incorporation into VC1 and enhanced 32P-incorporation into IIC2 (Figs. 6 and 7, lane 7). Quantitatively, in the VC1·IIC2 complex32P-incorporation into VC1 decreased approximately 50% from that of VC1, labeling of IIC2 effectively doubled, and resulted in32P-incorporation into VC1 being only 25% that into IIC2. As expected, 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP completely blocked32P-incorporation into VC1 and IIC2, whether alone or in the VC1·IIC2 complex (Figs. 6 and 7, lanes 3, 6, and 9), whereas there was marginal protection afforded by either 5′-ATP (Fig. 6) or 5′-AP(CH2)PP (Fig.7). The concentrations of 5′-ATP or 5′-AP(CH2)PP used were 100-fold greater than that of γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP, but afforded protection of VC1 and IIC2 only 10–30% (TableI). Protection afforded by 5′-AP(CH2)PP was less effective with IIC2(∼10%) than with VC1 (∼30%), regardless of VC1·IIC2 complex formation. In contrast, the protective effect of 5′-ATP depended on subdomain association. 5′-ATP caused ∼30% reduction in labeling of the individual VC1and IIC2 proteins, whereas formation of the VC1·IIC2 complex resulted in enhanced protection of VC1 protection (∼33% with VC1to ∼75% for VC1 in the VC1·IIC2 complex) and of IIC2(∼27% with IIC2 to ∼60% in the VC1·IIC2 complex). Considering that 50% of the 5′-ATP was converted to cAMP and PPi during incubation with the enzyme, it is possible that the protection afforded by 5′-ATP was actually due to the products of the enzyme reaction.Figure 6Effects of 5′-ATP and 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP on labeling of adenylyl cyclase cytosolic domains by γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP.VC1 (5 μm), IIC2 (5 μm), or preformed VC1·IIC2 (5 μm of each) were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and for Fig. 3. Proteins were pretreated for 2 min at room temperature with 100 μm 5′-ATP or 100 μm 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP before the addition of 10 μm γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP. The reaction was in a volume of 30 μl for 45 min at 30 °C. Under these conditions approximately 50% of the 5′-ATP was converted to 3′:5′-cAMP during the 2-min preincubation and any protection observed will represent the response to a mixture of 5′-ATP, 3′:5′-cAMP, and PPi. The reaction was terminated as for Fig. 5 by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (20 μl of a 3×-concentrated buffer containing SDS, Tris·HCl, bromphenol blue, glycerol, and 10 μl of 1.2 mdithiothreitol). Samples were denatured by heating for 3 min and then the entire sample was subjected to electrophoresis on 11% polyacrylamide gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Time course for labeling of IIC 2 with γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ- 32 P]3′-ATP.Labeling was performed in reaction mixture containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmforskolin, 5 μm IIC2, and 10 μmγ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP.

The labeling data are in agreement with those obtained by direct photo cross-linking of VC1 and IIC2 with [32P]2′-d-3′-AMP (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and corroborate the conclusion that P-site ligands can covalently cross-link with the cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase, whether alone or in complex. However, the asymmetric labeling of the subunits noted here (Figs. 6 and 7) was not observed in the earlier studies (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This difference likely lies in the fact that the earlier experiments used the nucleoside 3′-monophosphate, whereas these used the nucleoside 3′-triphosphate. First, the polyphosphate moiety may measurably influence protein-protein interactions between VC1 and IIC2; second, the site at which VC1 is labeled in the vicinity of the ligand γ-phosphate may be restricted or reconfigured by formation of the VC1·IIC2 complex, whereas the site at which IIC2 is labeled becomes more accessible. In contrast, the adenine moiety, through which direct photo cross-linking occurs, would contact both VC1 and IIC2. Moreover, it is within a domain that is shared by P-site ligand and substrate and is not significantly altered by formation of the VC1·IIC2 complex (7Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that the interaction of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP with the adenylyl cyclase formed from the association of the VC1 and IIC2 cytosolic domains is a process that is not in rapid equilibrium. This would explain the lack of competition between 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP and substrate under steady state kinetic conditions. Moreover, it suggests that binding of this ligand is a pseudo-irreversible process and the noncompetitive inhibition observed with it (12Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) likely occurs by a somewhat different mechanism than does the post-transition state, dead-end inhibition previously observed with 2′-d-3′-AMP, which requires bound metal-PPi for inhibition (5Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The lack of competition between substrate and 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP was clearly evident both in the experiments on association-dissociation of VC1and IIC2 (Figs. 2 and 3) and in the experiments involving cross-linking and labeling with γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Also evident was the importance of the order of addition of substrate or protecting ligand and the nucleoside 3′-triphosphate. Rates of dissociation of the preformed VC1·IIC2complex differed depending on the nucleotides present and the order of their addition (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, no protection against covalent labeling of VC1 or IIC2 by γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP was afforded by 5′-ATP, 5′-AP(CH2)PP, or 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP when the proteins were added to a mixture of the covalent affinity ligand and protecting ligand. This suggested either that γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP binds with the adenylyl cyclase subdomains faster than the other nucleotides or that it cross-links with a different site. The latter possibility was excluded by the complete protection observed when the VC1, IIC2, or the VC1·IIC2 complex were pretreated with 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP before addition of the covalent affinity ligand (Figs. 6 and 7). The observation that the protective effect of 5′-ATP was substantially better with VC1·IIC2 than with VC1 or IIC2 individually could be due either to the presence of products (cAMP and PPi) or to an effect on the assembly of the VC1·IIC2 complex. This latter process may be promoted by substrate binding and result in stabilization of a “closed” configuration in which IIC2 effectively blocks polyphosphate binding to VC1, as contrasted with an “open” configuration in which VC1 is more accessible to γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-[γ-32P]3′-ATP. In general, these observations corroborate those we made earlier (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) by direct photo cross-linking of [32P]2′-d-3′-AMP with VC1, IIC2, and the VC1·IIC2 complex. Each cytosolic domain was observed to react individually with [32P]2′-d-3′-AMP, but complex formation also affected the interaction of each domain with it (11Doronin S. Dessauer C. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32416-32420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This was consistent with the enzyme being distributed between two conformational states that are not in rapid equilibrium, one binding 5′-ATP and the other binding 2′-d-3′-AMP and PPi. No structural data are available for adenylyl cyclases in complex with any adenine nucleoside 3′-triphosphate. The data presented here show that both VC1 and IIC2 domains interact with 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP. This interaction affects the association of the major cytosolic domains and the resulting conformation of the enzyme; the formation of a functionally active VC1·IIC2complex is prevented. From comparisons with structural data obtained with 2′-d-3′-AMP and PPi (7Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and with analogs of 5′-ATP (22Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), it would be expected that the polyphosphate group of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP would interact with both VC1 and IIC2 domains. The terminal β-and γ-phosphates should interact with the C1 domain through divalent cation and with the C2 domain through Arg-1029 and/or Lys-1065 (7Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar,22Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), amino acids susceptible to covalent interaction with γ-MetIm-2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP. Labeling of VC1 and IIC2 domains by the 32P-labeled derivative occurred with similar efficiency, but after stimulation by Mn2+ and forskolin and the formation of VC1·IIC2, the IIC2 domain was labeled preferentially. Furthermore, treatment of VC1 with 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP prevented formation of catalytically competent VC1·IIC2. If one assumes that the dissociated open state of VC1 and IIC2 accurately models the inactive state of native holoenzyme, binding of 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP would prevent the conformational changes promoted by enzyme interactions with activated Gsα and/or forskolin. The 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP would hold the enzyme in an inactive configuration. This is conceptually different from conclusions drawn from earlier experiments with 2′-d-3′-AMP and 2′,5′-dd-adenosine, inhibition by either of which relies on product PPi being in the catalytic site. That is, inhibition was preferentially of stimulated enzyme. The requirement of enzyme activity to generate the pyrophosphate necessary for inhibition is obviated by 2′-d-3′-ATP or 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP, because these ligands by their nature already contain the PPi group and can inhibit basal as well as stimulated forms of the enzyme."
