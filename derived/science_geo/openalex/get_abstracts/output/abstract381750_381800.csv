Upstream snow and ice reserves of these basins, important in sustaining seasonal water availability, are likely to be affected substantially by climate change, but to what extent is yet unclear. Here, we show that meltwater is extremely important in the Indus basin and important for the Brahmaputra basin, but plays only a modest role for the Ganges, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. A huge difference also exists between basins in the extent to which climate change is predicted to affect water availability and food security. The Brahmaputra and Indus basins are most susceptible to reductions of flow, threatening the food security of an estimated 60 million people."
https://openalex.org/W2122682494,"Oxytocin and Intergroup Conflict Human society is organized into groups, such as those based on nationality or religion, which can lead to intergroup conflicts, with sometimes devastating consequences. Intergroup conflict engages a human behavior termed parochial altruism: For example, a soldier who fights against the enemy at risk to themselves to protect their country is a parochial altruist. De Dreu et al. (p. 1408 ; see the cover; see the News story by Miller ) have discovered a role for oxytocin, a neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus, in regulating parochial altruism during human intergroup competition and conflict. Oxytocin is already known to play a role in trusting behavior, and naturally occurring genetic variants of the oxytocin receptor exist within the human population. Administration of oxytocin modulated defense-related aggression toward competing groups, but did not affect unprovoked, hateful behavior. Thus, there may be a neurobiological basis for intergroup conflict in humans."

Through images obtained with the Very Large Telescope, an array of four telescopes located in Chile, Lagrange et al. (p. 57 , published online 10 June) now confirm the presence of a young, giant planet, β Pictoris b, orbiting within the dusty disk that surrounds the star. β Pictoris b orbits closer to its star than Uranus and Neptune do to the Sun in our solar system. This orbital separation is consistent with the in situ formation of the planet via a core accretion mechanism. Thus, giant planets can form within a stellar dust disk in only a few million years."

For flexible electronics, it can be advantageous to avoid this architectural constraint. Graphene oxide, formed by chemical exfoliation of graphite, can be reduced to a more conductive form using chemical reductants. Wei et al. (p. 1373 ) now show that layers of graphene oxide can also be reduced using a hot atomic force microscope tip to create materials comparable to those of organic conductors. This process can create patterned regions (down to 12 nanometers in width) that differ in conductivity by up to four orders of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W2048643841,"Maintaining the Supercurrent When a superconductor is placed in contact with a ferromagnet, the antiparallel spin pairs that form the supercurrent are expected to be broken almost immediately upon entering the ferromagnet, which tends to orient spins parallel to each other. If the supercurrent survives for more than a few nanometers, it is assumed that a change of pairing symmetry has taken place, with the spin-singlet pairs having been converted into spin-triplets. Magnetic inhomogeneity at the superconductor-ferromagnet interface is thought to account for this change. Robinson et al. (p. 59 , published online 10 June) have now been able to observe long-ranged supercurrents in a symmetric junction consisting of a superconductor, a conical magnet, and a ferromagnet. The conical magnet layer provided the required inhomogeneity, and varying its thickness enabled control over the magnitude of the current."

These metals can efficiently shuttle between oxidation states, easing the transfer of hydrogen and oxygen atoms between hydrocarbons and oxidants. Uyanik et al. (p. 1376 ; see the Perspective by French ) now show that iodine can take the place of the metal to catalytically activate peroxide during the formation of benzofuran derivatives. Pairing iodide anions with chiral ammonium cations allowed the generation of stereoselectivity at levels similar to those seen with metal complexes bearing chiral ligands."

Parks et al. (p. 1370 ; see the Perspective by Jarillo-Herrero ) placed cobalt complexes in a break-junction contact and then applied a mechanical force to slowly open the contact. Low-temperature measurement of differential conductance revealed a splitting of the Kondo peak at zero-applied voltage into two features, which occurred by breaking the degeneracy of S = 1 triplet states. This assignment of the spin state was confirmed by the evolution of splitting with magnetic field and by comparison to theory for a case where the conduction electrons only partially screen the spin states."
https://openalex.org/W2010957709,"One Two T T cells develop in the thymus, where they proceed through several developmental stages, losing alternative lineage potential as they progress. The molecular regulation of this developmental process, however, is not fully understood (see the Perspective by Di Santo ). P. Li et al. (p. 85 , published online 10 June), L. Li et al. (p. 89 ), and Ikawa et al. (p. 93 ) now identify expression of the zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b as the earliest checkpoint in T cell development in mice. Genetic deletion of Bcl11b in developing T cells inhibited commitment to the T cell lineage. Under conditions that should have stimulated T lineage differentiation, Bcl11b -deficient T cell progenitors failed to up-regulate genes associated with lineage-committed T cells and maintained stem cell– and progenitor cell–associated gene expression. In both developing and committed T cells, loss of Bcl11b resulted in the generation of cells that resembled natural killer (NK) cells in both phenotype and function. These NK-like cells could be expanded easily in vitro and possessed antitumor cytotoxicity, but they did not exhibit cytotoxicity against normal cells and were not tumorigenic. Because T cells are much easier to obtain from human patients than NK cells, deletion of Bcl11b in T cells may thus provide a source of easy-to-grow NK cells for cell-based antitumor therapies."

At some level, all these organisms are capable of interacting with each other. We found that successful establishment of the chronically infecting parasitic nematode Trichuris muris in the large intestine of mice is dependent on microflora and coincident with modulation of the host immune response. By reducing the number of bacteria in the host animal, we significantly reduced the number of hatched T. muris eggs. Critical interactions between bacteria (microflora) and parasites (macrofauna) introduced a new dynamic to the intestinal niche, which has fundamental implications for our current concepts of intestinal homeostasis and regulation of immunity."

https://openalex.org/W1994971983,"The H(+)-ATP synthase is a reversible engine of mitochondria that synthesizes or hydrolyzes ATP upon changes in cell physiology. ATP synthase dysfunction is involved in the onset and progression of diverse human pathologies. During ischemia, the ATP hydrolytic activity of the enzyme is inhibited by the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1). The expression of IF1 in human tissues and its participation in the development of human pathology are unknown. Here, we have developed monoclonal antibodies against human IF1 and determined its expression in paired normal and tumor biopsies of human carcinomas. We show that the relative mitochondrial content of IF1 increases significantly in carcinomas, suggesting the participation of IF1 in oncogenesis. The expression of IF1 varies significantly in cancer cell lines. To investigate the functional activity of IF1 in cancer, we have manipulated its cellular content. Overexpression of IF1 or of its pH-insensitive H49K mutant in cells that express low levels of IF1 triggers the up-regulation of aerobic glycolysis and the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation with concurrent mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Treatment of the cells with the H(+)-ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin mimicked the effects of IF1 overexpression. Conversely, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of IF1 in cells that express high levels of IF1 promotes the down-regulation of aerobic glycolysis and the increase in oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, these findings support that the mitochondrial content of IF1 controls the activity of oxidative phosphorylation mediating the shift of cancer cells to an enhanced aerobic glycolysis, thus supporting an oncogenic role for the de-regulated expression of IF1 in cancer."

In this study, we observed that curcumin inhibits Panc28 and L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cell and tumor growth in nude mice bearing L3.6pL cells as xenografts. In addition, curcumin decreased expression of p50 and p65 proteins and NFkappaB-dependent transactivation and also decreased Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 transcription factors that are overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells. Because both Sp transcription factors and NFkappaB regulate several common genes such as cyclin D1, survivin, and vascular endothelial growth factor that contribute to the cancer phenotype, we also investigated interactions between Sp and NFkappaB transcription factors. Results of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 knockdown by RNA interference demonstrate that both p50 and p65 are Sp-regulated genes and that inhibition of constitutive or tumor necrosis factor-induced NFkappaB by curcumin is dependent on down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins by this compound. Curcumin also decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and induced reactive oxygen species in pancreatic cancer cells, and this pathway is required for down-regulation of Sp proteins in these cells, demonstrating that the mitochondriotoxic effects of curcumin are important for its anticancer activities."

The patients were tested on a range of complex neuropsychological instruments, including virtual reality, during the ischemic attack.

IntroductionInnate immunity and induction of adaptive immune responses are based on the recognition of conserved signatures of microbes and “danger signals” released from infected host cells. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PAMPpathogen-associated molecular patternDAMPdanger-associated molecular patternLRRleucine-rich repeatsCARDcaspase activation and recruitment domainPYDpyrin domainDDdeath domainSeVSendai virusNLRnucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containingMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseIFNinterferonsiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayRANTESregulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted. and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized by so-called pattern recognition receptors in the host and trigger inflammatory responses (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8551) Google Scholar). Different types of pattern recognition receptors show distinct subcellular localization, allowing the host to react to extracellular, vesicular, and cytosolic presented PAMPs and DAMPs. One class of pattern recognition receptors, the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein family, gained much attention because it was shown that members of this family are critically involved in mounting immune responses to bacterial peptidoglycan fragments and in controlling release of the key inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (2Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 3Kufer T.A. Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Over 20 NLRs are encoded in the human genome. As a hallmark they share a tripartite molecular architecture with a centrally located ATPase domain, a NACHT domain (domain present in NAIP, CIITA, HET-E, TP-1) that mediates oligomerization and activation of these proteins, followed by a leucine-rich repeat region (LRR) at the C terminus. With the only exceptions of NLRX1 and NAIP, the N-terminal part of the NLRs consists of a domain that adopts a death domain fold. Most NLR members thereby have either a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) or a pyrin domain (PYD), connecting the respective NLR to different downstream signaling events (2Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Well studied examples of CARD domain-containing NLRs are NOD1 and NOD2, which react to peptidoglycan fragments and lead to NF-κB, MAPK, and caspase activation (3Kufer T.A. Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Examples of PYD containing NLRs comprise NLRP1 and NLRP3, which form high molecular weight platforms, so-called inflammasomes that lead to activation of caspase-1 and subsequent interleukin-1β release upon encounter of DAMPs and certain PAMPs (4Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar).NLRC5 (alternatively named NOD27 or CLR16.1) is an interesting exception in the NLR family. It has a typical NLR architecture but contains an effector domain, predicted to adopt a death domain (DD) fold without obvious homology to the CARD and PYD domains found in other NLRs. Furthermore, it possesses the longest LRR domain of all human NLR members. Alignment of the LRR domains shows that within the NLR family NLRC5 is most closely related to NOD1, NOD2, and NLRC3 (5Istomin A.Y. Godzik A. BMC Immunol. 2009; 10: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is further confirmed by sequence comparison of the NACHT domains, which puts NLRC5 in evolutionary vicinity to NOD1, NOD2, and NLRC3 (6Hughes A.L. Immunogenetics. 2006; 58: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Proell M. Riedl S.J. Fritz J.H. Rojas A.M. Schwarzenbacher R. PLoS One. 2008; 3e2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). NOD1 and NOD2 are well characterized NLRs with a critical function in controlling immune responses toward bacterial challenge and likely also viral challenge (2Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 8Sabbah A. Chang T.H. Harnack R. Frohlich V. Tominaga K. Dube P.H. Xiang Y. Bose S. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Moreover, NLRC3 was proposed to function as a negative regulator in T cells (9Conti B.J. Davis B.K. Zhang J. O'connor Jr., W. Williams K.L. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18375-18385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggested that NLRC5 might also be involved in innate immune responses in humans. Interestingly, all of the mentioned NLRs are localized on the same chromosomal region. However, the biological relevance of this fact remains elusive (10Ting J.P. Davis B.K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 387-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the present study we characterize human NLRC5, revealing a function in anti-viral innate immune responses in human cells.DISCUSSIONHere we report on the characterization of human NLRC5. Alignment of its LRR and NACHT domains shows that NLRC5 is related to the NLRs NOD1, NOD2, and NLRC3 (5Istomin A.Y. Godzik A. BMC Immunol. 2009; 10: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Hughes A.L. Immunogenetics. 2006; 58: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Proell M. Riedl S.J. Fritz J.H. Rojas A.M. Schwarzenbacher R. PLoS One. 2008; 3e2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), which are involved in the regulation of innate immune responses. NLRC5 is an interesting exception in the NLR family because it (i) contains an effector domain that adopts a DD fold but lacks recognizable homology to the CARD and PYD domains found in other NLRs and (ii) has an unusually long LRR domain. Modeling of this LRR domain of NLRC5 suggested that it forms a large helical conformation (Fig. 1A). However, because this interpretation is purely based on modeling, it is also possible that it adopts a torroid-like structure or connected circles as recently proposed by others (5Istomin A.Y. Godzik A. BMC Immunol. 2009; 10: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The LRR domains of the human NLR proteins are essential for sensing of their cognate PAMPs and DAMPs (2Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence for changes of the LRR composition of innate immune receptors exists. One intriguing example is given by the ancient VLR proteins in agnathes, which can generate diverse sensing variety by changing the composition of their LRR domains (27Pancer Z. Amemiya C.T. Ehrhardt G.R. Ceitlin J. Gartland G.L. Cooper M.D. Nature. 2004; 430: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The unusual structure of the NLRC5 LRR domain might thus be indicative for NLRC5 to respond to quite different stimuli than other NLRs. Accordingly, the isoforms of NLRC5 described here that encoded for changed LRR structures might give rise to changed elicitor sensing spectra of the corresponding proteins. Although the detailed biological function of these NLRC5 isoforms awaits establishment in vivo, we found tissue-specific expression of at least two splice variants of NLRC5 lacking the LRRs or parts thereof. High expression of a variant lacking the whole LRR region (isoform 3) in T cells might be indicative of a regulatory role of the encoded protein in these cells. Future studies shall address in detail the function of this isoform.NLRC5 mRNA was found to be expressed in hematopoietic cells including monocytes, T cells, and B cells. Of note, this basal expression pattern in primary tissue mimics that of NLRC3, a NLR suggested to be involved in negative regulation of T cells (9Conti B.J. Davis B.K. Zhang J. O'connor Jr., W. Williams K.L. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18375-18385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), making it tempting to speculate that these two NLRs might be functionally linked. NLRC5 mRNA and protein levels were induced by the TLR3 ligand poly(I·C) and Sendai virus infection in nonhematopoietic cells such as HeLa. Thus, NLRC5 is up-regulated by both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA viruses and/or viral signatures. Notably, in THP-1 cells we only observed a marginal induction of NLRC5 levels after poly(I·C) and Sendai virus challenge, respectively (Fig. 3). In line with the observed high basal NLRC5 expression in THP-1 cells and its low expression in HeLa cells, this suggests that NLRC5 expression is differentially regulated in various cell types; although myeloid cells have already high basal expression levels of NLRC5, assuring sufficient response to the cognate stimulus, nonhematopoietic cells might be required to gain NLRC5 competence by induction of NLRC5 expression upon exposure to inflammatory milieu. Such a positive feedback loop is known for other NLRs. Although our data, in particular direct targeting of the TLR3 pathway, suggested that NLRC5 expression is under direct control of the type I interferon pathway, we cannot exclude that the induction is due to release of secondary effectors upon interferon activation by an autocrine loop.To elucidate the molecular connection of NLRC5 to innate immune pathways, we further aimed to identify interaction partners and signaling pathways linked to the NLRC5 effector domain. Kuenzel et al. (28Kuenzel S. Till A. Winkler M. Häsler R. Lipinski S. Jung S. Grötzinger J. Fickenscher H. Schreiber S. Rosenstiel P. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) recently reported activation of a ISRE and GAS reporter induced by overexpression of a GFP-tagged version of NLRC5 and forced dimerization of the NLRC5 death domain in HeLaS3 cells. We, however, could not observe activation of an ISRE reporter also with an N-terminal GFP-tagged version of NLRC5 in HEK293T (data not shown), suggesting that HEK293T cells might lack an essential adaptor for NLRC5 signaling. In line, overexpression of NLRC5 did not yield activation of other canonical inflammatory pathways in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4), including p38 MAPK (data not shown). We thereby can exclude that a putative negative regulation by the LRR domain as a form of NLRC5 lacking the LRR domain (isoform 3) led to the same results. In contrast, overexpression of NLRC5 significantly impaired type I interferon reporter activation in HEK293T cells without affecting NF-κB responses, supporting a role for NLRC5 in type I interferon responses (supplemental Fig. S3). This effect was likely due to titration of a factor involved in the type I interferon pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using educated guesses, including TBK1, SINTBAD, TANK1, NAP1, IKK∈, and IRF3, 7, and 5, as well as unbiased yeast two-hybrid screening of NLRC5 and its DD, were conducted to address this observation in more detail (data not shown). Unfortunately, the results did not allow us to link NLRC5 to any known component of the type I interferon pathway yet. Of note, recent studies also failed to reveal robust interactions between NLRC5 and known NLR adaptor proteins such as RIP2K and ASC (29Dowds T.A. Masumoto J. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Inohara N. Núñez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Wagner R.N. Proell M. Kufer T.A. Schwarzenbacher R. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).However, clear physiological evidence for a role of NLRC5 in anti-viral responses could be obtained by controlled siRNA studies in the myeloid-like THP-1 cell line. Knockdown of endogenous NLRC5 in these cells robustly impaired the type I interferon response as shown by reduced IFN-β release and lower IFN-β and IP-10 mRNA induction upon SeV infection (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S1). We expanded these findings by analyzing other SeV-induced cytokines (supplemental Fig. S1). This revealed that among others the induction and release of the important early phase chemokine RANTES (CCL5) was also negatively affected upon NLRC5 knockdown (Fig. 5). RANTES is known to be released upon SeV infection also from primary human cells (25Hua J. Liao M.J. Rashidbaigi A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Matikainen S. Pirhonen J. Miettinen M. Lehtonen A. Govenius-Vintola C. Sareneva T. Julkunen I. Virology. 2000; 276: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, we could substantiate the observation made in THP-1 cells in primary human dermal fibroblast from different donors (Fig. 6) where knockdown of NLRC5 by two different siRNA duplexes led again to a robust reduction of both SeV- and poly(I·C)-induced type I interferon and RANTES release in these cells. Importantly, IP-10, IFN-β, and RANTES induction is directly dependent on activation of IRF3 by the interferon pathway (31Andersen J. VanScoy S. Cheng T.F. Gomez D. Reich N.C. Genes Immun. 2008; 9: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), suggesting that NLRC5 has an impact on this pathway. In conclusion, our data show that NLRC5 is involved in regulating the type I interferon pathway.Taken together, our data support a role for NLRC5 in viral innate immune responses and put it on the list of NLR proteins with proposed functions in viral recognition such as NLRP3 (33Delaloye J.

Of note, all of these NLRs respond to RNA signatures.We furthermore attempted to decipher the cognate PAMP(s) for NLRC5 by testing known PAMPs. However, lipopolysaccharide, single-stranded RNA, E. coli RNA, poly(I·C), as well as TLR5 and TLR6 ligands failed to activate robust NLRC5-mediated interferon or NF-κB responses in HEK293T cells (data not shown).Because the molecular function of NLRC5 still remains somewhat elusive, we currently can only speculate on its precise mode of function. One tempting assumption is that NLRC5 might act in conjunction with other NLRs. Evidence for the existence of such NLR networks exists (38Damiano J.S. Oliveira V. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NOD2 and NLRP10 have been recently identified as factors involved in mounting interferon responses toward influenza virus infection (36Shapira S.D. Gat-Viks I. Shum B.O. Dricot A. de Grace M.M. Wu L. Gupta P.B. Hao T. Silver S.J. Root D.E. Hill D.E. Regev A. Hacohen N. Cell. 2009; 139: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and NOD2 might even be able to directly detect single-stranded RNA (8Sabbah A. Chang T.H. Harnack R. Frohlich V. Tominaga K. Dube P.H. Xiang Y. Bose S. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). It therefore is noteworthy that we observed a physical interaction of NLRC5 with both NOD2 and NLRP10 in a NACHT-dependent manner using overexpressed proteins. 3A. Neerincx, K. Lautz, M. Menning, R. Schwarzenbacher, and T. A. Kufer, unpublished results. Although the biological relevance of these findings remains elusive for endogenous proteins, one could envision a scenario where NLRC5 might not only induce responses to viral infections but at the same time might impact on NOD2-mediated responses.Further studies are needed to understand the function of this interesting new NLR protein in innate immune responses to viral pathogens and its interplay with other NLR members in more detail. Based on our results, however, we assume that a lack of NLRC5 or hypomorphs negatively affects the fitness of the host upon viral challenge.During the preparation of this manuscript, NLRC5 was found independently to have a role also in cytomegalovirus-induced immune responses (28Kuenzel S. Till A. Winkler M. Häsler R. Lipinski S. Jung S. Grötzinger J. Fickenscher H. Schreiber S. Rosenstiel P. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This further supports our findings and suggests that NLRC5 might be involved in anti-viral responses more in general because cytomegalovirus contains a double-stranded DNA genome. IntroductionInnate immunity and induction of adaptive immune responses are based on the recognition of conserved signatures of microbes and “danger signals” released from infected host cells. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PAMPpathogen-associated molecular patternDAMPdanger-associated molecular patternLRRleucine-rich repeatsCARDcaspase activation and recruitment domainPYDpyrin domainDDdeath domainSeVSendai virusNLRnucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containingMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseIFNinterferonsiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayRANTESregulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted. and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized by so-called pattern recognition receptors in the host and trigger inflammatory responses (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8551) Google Scholar). Different types of pattern recognition receptors show distinct subcellular localization, allowing the host to react to extracellular, vesicular, and cytosolic presented PAMPs and DAMPs. One class of pattern recognition receptors, the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein family, gained much attention because it was shown that members of this family are critically involved in mounting immune responses to bacterial peptidoglycan fragments and in controlling release of the key inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (2Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 3Kufer T.A. Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Over 20 NLRs are encoded in the human genome. As a hallmark they share a tripartite molecular architecture with a centrally located ATPase domain, a NACHT domain (domain present in NAIP, CIITA, HET-E, TP-1) that mediates oligomerization and activation of these proteins, followed by a leucine-rich repeat region (LRR) at the C terminus. With the only exceptions of NLRX1 and NAIP, the N-terminal part of the NLRs consists of a domain that adopts a death domain fold. Most NLR members thereby have either a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) or a pyrin domain (PYD), connecting the respective NLR to different downstream signaling events (2Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Well studied examples of CARD domain-containing NLRs are NOD1 and NOD2, which react to peptidoglycan fragments and lead to NF-κB, MAPK, and caspase activation (3Kufer T.A. Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Examples of PYD containing NLRs comprise NLRP1 and NLRP3, which form high molecular weight platforms, so-called inflammasomes that lead to activation of caspase-1 and subsequent interleukin-1β release upon encounter of DAMPs and certain PAMPs (4Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar).NLRC5 (alternatively named NOD27 or CLR16.1) is an interesting exception in the NLR family. It has a typical NLR architecture but contains an effector domain, predicted to adopt a death domain (DD) fold without obvious homology to the CARD and PYD domains found in other NLRs. Furthermore, it possesses the longest LRR domain of all human NLR members. Alignment of the LRR domains shows that within the NLR family NLRC5 is most closely related to NOD1, NOD2, and NLRC3 (5Istomin A.Y. Godzik A. BMC Immunol. 2009; 10: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is further confirmed by sequence comparison of the NACHT domains, which puts NLRC5 in evolutionary vicinity to NOD1, NOD2, and NLRC3 (6Hughes A.L. Immunogenetics. 2006; 58: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Proell M. Riedl S.J. Fritz J.H. Rojas A.M. Schwarzenbacher R. PLoS One. 2008; 3e2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). NOD1 and NOD2 are well characterized NLRs with a critical function in controlling immune responses toward bacterial challenge and likely also viral challenge (2Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 8Sabbah A. Chang T.H. Harnack R. Frohlich V. Tominaga K. Dube P.H. Xiang Y. Bose S. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Moreover, NLRC3 was proposed to function as a negative regulator in T cells (9Conti B.J. Davis B.K. Zhang J. O'connor Jr., W. Williams K.L. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18375-18385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggested that NLRC5 might also be involved in innate immune responses in humans. Interestingly, all of the mentioned NLRs are localized on the same chromosomal region. However, the biological relevance of this fact remains elusive (10Ting J.P. Davis B.K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 387-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the present study we characterize human NLRC5, revealing a function in anti-viral innate immune responses in human cells."

These bodies are thought to be remnants from the formation of the solar system. But did they all form in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, or could they have been generated in the protoplanetary disks of other stars in the cluster where the Sun probably formed? Levison et al. (p. 187 , published online 10 June) used detailed numerical simulations to investigate what fraction of comets might transfer from the outer reaches of one stellar system to another. The simulations suggest that a substantial number of comets can be captured through this mechanism, which may explain why the number of bodies in the Oort cloud is larger than models predict."

Because MHC class I can only present intracellular antigens, antigen cross-presentation is important for responses to viruses that do not directly infect APCs. Antigen cross-presentation occurs when APCs acquire antigens by phagocytosis of dying virally infected cells and present them to CD8 + T cells. After internalization, antigens must enter the cytosol for processing by the proteasome. Singh and Cresswell (p. 1394 ) now show that GILT (gamma-interferon–inducible lysosomal thiolreductase) is required for cross-presentation in mice of disulfide-containing viral antigens. In mice lacking GILT, the CD8 + T cell response to antigens derived from disulfide-rich proteins was substantially impaired after influenza A or herpes simplex virus 1 infection. Thus, cross-presentation of some antigens requires an early processing step prior to proteasomal degradation in the cytosol and subsequent MHC class I loading."

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor-tyrosine kinase that is associated with cancer progression, and the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib/tarceva and tyrphostin/AG-1478 are potent anti-cancer therapeutics. Pgrmc1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is a cytochrome b(5)-related protein that is up-regulated in tumors and promotes cancer growth. Pgrmc1 and its homologues have been implicated in cell signaling, and we show here that Pgrmc1 increases susceptibility to AG-1478 and erlotinib, increases plasma membrane EGFR levels, and co-precipitates with EGFR. Pgrmc1 co-localizes with EGFR in cytoplasmic vesicles and co-fractionates with EGFR in high density microsomes. The findings have therapeutic potential because a Pgrmc1 small molecule ligand, which inhibits growth in a variety of cancer cell types, de-stabilized EGFR in multiple tumor cell lines. EGFR is one of the most potent receptor-tyrosine kinases driving tumorigenesis, and our data support a role for Pgrmc1 in promoting several cancer phenotypes at least in part by binding EGFR and stabilizing plasma membrane pools of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2093476689,"Approximately 90% of cases of Lafora disease, a fatal teenage-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy, are caused by mutations in either the EPM2A or the EPM2B genes that encode, respectively, a glycogen phosphatase called laforin and an E3 ubiquitin ligase called malin. Lafora disease is characterized by the formation of Lafora bodies, insoluble deposits containing poorly branched glycogen or polyglucosan, in many tissues including skeletal muscle, liver, and brain. Disruption of the Epm2b gene in mice resulted in viable animals that, by 3 months of age, accumulated Lafora bodies in the brain and to a lesser extent in heart and skeletal muscle. Analysis of muscle and brain of the Epm2b−/− mice by Western blotting indicated no effect on the levels of glycogen synthase, PTG (type 1 phosphatase-targeting subunit), or debranching enzyme, making it unlikely that these proteins are targeted for destruction by malin, as has been proposed. Total laforin protein was increased in the brain of Epm2b−/− mice and, most notably, was redistributed from the soluble, low speed supernatant to the insoluble low speed pellet, which now contained 90% of the total laforin. This result correlated with elevated insolubility of glycogen and glycogen synthase. Because up-regulation of laforin cannot explain Lafora body formation, we conclude that malin functions to maintain laforin associated with soluble glycogen and that its absence causes sequestration of laforin to an insoluble polysaccharide fraction where it is functionally inert. Approximately 90% of cases of Lafora disease, a fatal teenage-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy, are caused by mutations in either the EPM2A or the EPM2B genes that encode, respectively, a glycogen phosphatase called laforin and an E3 ubiquitin ligase called malin.

Lafora disease (EPM2; OMIM254780) is an autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy with onset in adolescence followed by gradual decline and death usually within 10 years (1Delgado-Escueta A.V. Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2007; 7: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Gentry M.S. Dixon J.E. Worby C.A. Trends Biochem.

A characteristic of Lafora disease is the accumulation of Lafora bodies, insoluble periodic acid-Schiff-positive deposits that contain polyglucosan, a poorly branched form of glycogen. In the disease, Lafora bodies develop in many tissues, including muscle, liver, and neurons, but it is generally believed that Lafora body accumulation ultimately leads to neuronal cell death and the neurological sequelae (4Ramachandran N. Girard J.M. Turnbull J. Minassian B.A. Epilepsia. 2009; 50: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Lafora disease would then be a non-classical type of glycogenosis. Glycogen is a branched storage polymer of glucose, present in many tissues including muscle, liver, and brain. Glycogen synthesis is mediated by the actions of glycogen synthase, which catalyzes the elongation of the polyglucose chains, and branching enzyme, which introduces the branch points (5Roach P.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6Graham T.E. Appl. Physiol. Nutr. Metab. 2009; 34: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase is negatively regulated by phosphorylation, which renders the enzyme dependent on the allosteric activator glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) 4The abbreviations used are: G6Pglucose-6-phosphateGSglycogen synthasePhglycogen phosphorylaseeIF2αeukaryotic initiation factor αAGLamylo-1,6-glucosidase,4-α-glucanotransferasePTGprotein targeting to glycogenRGLstriated muscle-specific protein phosphatase 1 glycogen-targeting subunitGSK-3glycogen synthase kinase-3AMPKadenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinaseLSSlow speed supernatantLSPlow speed pelletHSShigh speed supernatantHSPhigh speed pelletWTwild type. for activity (5Roach P.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The −/+ G6P activity ratio is thus used as a kinetic index of the activation state of the enzyme (7Roach R.J. Larner J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1977; 15: 179-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Degradation of glycogen in the cytosol is mediated by glycogen phosphorylase and the debranching enzyme (AGL). One mechanism for the formation of polyglucosan is an imbalance between elongating and branching activities, as occurs in adult polyglucosan disease, in which branching enzyme is mutated (8Moses S.W. Parvari R. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), or Tarui disease, in which mutation of phosphofructokinase is thought to cause a buildup of glycolytic intermediates and inappropriate activation of glycogen synthase by G6P (9Nakajima H.

Recently, there has been substantial progress in understanding the genetics of Lafora disease. About 90% of Lafora cases can now be attributed to loss of function mutations in two genes, EPM2A (epilepsy progressive myoclonus type 2A) (10Minassian B.A. Lee J.R. Herbrick J.A. Huizenga J.

Genet. 2003; 35: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). EPM2A encodes laforin, a protein with a C-terminal dual specificity protein phosphatase domain and an N-terminal CBM20 carbohydrate-binding domain. EPM2B encodes malin, a protein composed of an N-terminal E3 ubiquitin ligase domain and a C-terminal series of NHL repeats (11Chan E.M. Young E.J. Ianzano L. Munteanu I. Zhao X. Christopoulos C.C.

Genet. 2003; 35: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Most recent Lafora research has focused on understanding the functions of laforin and malin and their relationship to the development of the disease. The search for protein substrates of laforin led to a proposal that it dephosphorylated the inhibitory N-terminal phosphorylation site of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (12Lohi H. Ianzano L. Zhao X.C. Chan E.M. Turnbull J. Scherer S.W. Ackerley C.A. Minassian B.A. Hum. Mol.

Med. 2002; 2: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). If EPM2A mutation increased the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3, the end result would be activation of glycogen synthase and an enzymic imbalance favoring polyglucosan formation. However, several studies argue against GSK-3 being a laforin substrate (13Worby C.A. Gentry M.S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Measurements of glycogen synthase and branching enzyme activities in these mice also argued against the “branching imbalance” hypothesis. Much stronger evidence supports the proposal that laforin is actually a glycogen phosphatase, removing the small amount of covalent phosphate known to be present in glycogen (14Tagliabracci V.S. Turnbull J. Wang W. Girard J.M. Zhao X. Skurat A.V. Delgado-Escueta A.V. Minassian B.A. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and that a laforin-malin complex is required for normal function (18Vilchez D. Ros S. Cifuentes D. Pujadas L. Vallès J.

Several proteins have been proposed to be subject to malin-mediated ubiquitylation, which would then lead to their degradation. These targets include glycogen synthase (18Vilchez D. Ros S.

We have shown that in Epm2a−/− mice, there are no differences in the levels of debranching enzyme or PTG, arguing against the hypothesis that an obligate malin-laforin complex directs degradation of these proteins (16Tagliabracci V.S. Girard J.M. Segvich D. Meyer C. Turnbull J. Zhao X. Minassian B.A. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

One group has also suggested that laforin is phosphorylated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thereby regulating its interaction with malin and hence malin function (21Solaz-Fuster M.C. Gimeno-Alcañiz J.V. Ros S. Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Garcia-Fojeda B. Criado Garcia O. Vilchez D. Dominguez J. Garcia-Rocha M. Sanchez-Piris M. Aguado C. Knecht E. Serratosa J. Guinovart J.J. Sanz P.

However, most of these interesting conclusions derive from studies of cultured cell models and protein overexpression systems. We report here the generation of Epm2b knock-out mice. From analysis of 3-month-old animals, we show that the absence malin leads to a redistribution of brain laforin from the soluble, low speed supernatant to the insoluble, low speed pellet, where we propose that it is functionally ineffective.

Other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma, Bio-Rad, Invitrogen, or New England Biolabs. Epm2b disrupted ES C57BL/6N (10571D-E2) cells were purchased from the Knockout Mouse Project Repository (KOMP), University of California, Davis, CA. The strategy for the disruption was to replace the complete Epm2b coding region plus 391 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated region with a cassette containing the LacZ and the neo genes. The LacZ gene was fused in-frame at the Epm2b ATG (see Fig. 1A). After expansion and confirmation of targeting by PCR analyses (see Fig. 1B), the cells were injected into C57Bl/6J blastocysts, and the injected blastocysts were implanted in the uterus of pseudo-pregnant C57Bl/6J females for generation of chimeric mice. PCR genotyping of the chimeric mice showed that one male was positive for the disruption and was mated with C57Bl/6J females to test for germline transmission. Heterozygous F1 mice were intercrossed to generate the animals used in this study. Wild type (WT), heterozygous (+/−) and homozygous null (−/−) mice were identified by PCR genotyping using oligonucleotide primers that straddle both the 5′-end and the 3′-end of the Epm2b disrupted region (see Fig. 1B). Further confirmation of the disruption was obtained by quantitative Real Time-PCR of Epm2b mRNA (see Fig. 1C) and by analyzing expression of β-galactosidase (see Fig. 1D). The Epm2b mice were generated at the Indiana University Transgenic and Knockout Core Facility. All mice were maintained in temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle, fed a standard chow (Harlan Teklad global diet 2018SX), and allowed food and water ad libitum. All studies utilized 3-month-old males, were conducted in accordance with federal guidelines, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of Indiana University. RNA was isolated from 50 mg of tissue with TRIzol reagent. Four μg of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit. Primers and probes for mouse Epm2a and Epm2b were designed using the Universal probe library tool from Roche Applied Science. Information on the amplicons used is available on request. The real-time PCR reactions were performed using the LightCycler 480 probes master reagent (Roche Applied Science). The -fold change in the target mRNA contents with respect to baseline and normalized by the reference gene (18 S) was calculated as described (23Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24581) Google Scholar) using a relative standard curve. Sections were prepared from 3-month-old mouse tissues fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Slices of 5 μm were deparaffinized, treated with 0.1% diastase in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0) to degrade glycogen, or treated with buffer, for 1 h at 40 °C. Sections were oxidized with 0.5% periodic acid for 5 min, stained with Schiff reagent for 15 min, and counterstained in hematoxylin and eosin for 15 min. Tissue sectioning and staining was performed by the Histology Core in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine. Exercise to exhaustion was performed on 3-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice using a treadmill (Exer6M, Columbus Instruments) following the procedure described previously (24Irimia J.M. Meyer C.M. Peper C.L. Zhai L. Bock C.B. Previs S.F. McGuinness O.P. DePaoli-Roach A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12851-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Immediately after exhaustion, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and tissues were immediately collected in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Random fed male mice 3 months of age were sacrificed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The heads were immediately dropped in liquid nitrogen, and skeletal muscle was dissected and immersed in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Homogenates were centrifuged at 6,500 × g for 10 min, the supernatant (LSS) was removed, and the low speed pellet (LSP) was resuspended in the initial volume of buffer. Glycogen synthase (GS) and phosphorylase (Ph) activities were determined in the LSS and LSP by measuring the incorporation of [14C]glucose from UDP-[U-14C]glucose into glycogen as described by Thomas et al. (25Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 7.2 mm G6P and by measuring the incorporation of [14C]glucose from [14C]glucose-1-phosphate into glycogen in the absence or presence of 2 mm AMP (26Gilboe D.P. Larson K.L. Nuttall F.Q. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), respectively. Activity ratios represent the activity measured in the absence divided by that in the presence of the allosteric effectors G6P for glycogen synthase or AMP for phosphorylase and provide an index of the activation state, and hence, phosphorylation of the enzymes. Glycogen synthase activity is expressed as nmol/min/mg, and phosphorylase activity is expressed as μmol/min/mg. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. More details are in the supplemental material. Glycogen content in skeletal muscle and brain was measured as described previously by Suzuki et al. (28Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C.B. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of frozen tissues (30–50 mg) or LSS and LSP were hydrolyzed in 30% (w/v) KOH in a boiling water bath for 60 min. After repeated ethanol precipitations, the glycogen was digested with amyloglucosidase, and glucose equivalents were determined by the method of Bergmeyer (29Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd English Ed. Verlag Chemie; Academic Press, New York1974: 1128-1131Google Scholar). Glycogen content is expressed as μmol of glucosyl units/g of wet weight. Samples from the LSS and LSP described above were used for Western blot analyses. For skeletal muscle, comparable amounts of LSS and LSP were loaded. The brain homogenates of the samples used for Western blots of laforin were prepared in the absence of added glycogen. Brain LSPs were enriched with respect to the LSS because of the low protein concentration in the fraction. However, all quantitations were normalized for comparable amounts of samples. More details are in the supplemental material. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by an unpaired Student's t test and was considered significant at p < 0.05. ES cells, targeted for deletion of the single exon of the Epm2b/NHLRC1 gene (Fig. 1A), were obtained from KOMP and used to generate mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Germline transmission of the disrupted allele gave heterozygous Epm2b−/+ mice in a C57/Bl6 background. Progeny from crosses of heterozygous mice generated animals for characterization. Homozygous mice were born at the expected frequency for Mendelian inheritance. Because we have been unable to obtain usable antibodies against mouse malin, we adopted several independent approaches to assure deletion. Standard PCR directed at both the 5′-end and the 3′-end of the insertion clearly distinguished the wild type and mutant alleles (Fig. 1B). Quantitative PCR was applied to determine message levels and did not detect malin message in Epm2b−/− mice (Fig. 1C). Finally, the gene disruption strategy places β-galactosidase under the control of the malin promoter. Therefore, the presence of β-galactosidase marks the targeted deletion of Epm2b in tissues that express malin. Samples from brain and muscle of Epm2b−/+ and Epm2b−/− mice were positive for β-galactosidase by Western blotting, whereas no signal was detected in the wild type mice (Fig. 1D). From all of these criteria, we conclude that the Epm2b−/− mice indeed carry a disruption in both alleles of the gene. We also used quantitative PCR to analyze the laforin mRNA level and found no change in the Epm2b−/− mice (Fig. 1E). A characteristic feature of Lafora disease is the presence of Lafora bodies in tissues. Therefore, we analyzed various tissues for their presence. Sections from brain, skeletal muscle, heart, and liver of 3-month-old wild type and knock-out mice were treated with diastase and then stained with periodic acid-Schiff to visualize α-amylase resistant polysaccharide. Periodic acid-Schiff/diastase-positive structures, indicative of Lafora bodies, were visible in most areas of the brain. They were most abundant in the cerebellum (Fig. 2A) and were also plentiful in the hippocampus (Fig. 2C) and cortex (not shown) of Epm2b−/− animals. Comparable structures were absent in corresponding sections from wild type littermates (Fig. 2, B and D). Although less abundant than in brain, Lafora bodies were also readily detectable in heart muscle from knock-out mice (Fig. 2E) but not wild type littermates (Fig. 2F). We have yet to complete a systematic survey of skeletal muscle, but it is apparent that Lafora bodies are much more scarce in muscle than in brains or even hearts from Epm2b−/− mice at this age. We found some Lafora bodies in soleus muscle (Fig. 2G) but not in wild type controls (Fig. 2H). The lower incidence of Lafora bodies in skeletal muscle as compared with brain is consistent with the lesser degree of glycogen synthase and laforin redistribution to the insoluble LSP in these tissues (see below). No Lafora bodies were detected in the livers of Epm2b−/− mice (not shown). Although Lafora bodies were present in the brains of 3-month-old Epm2b−/− mice, we observed no obvious movement disorder or spontaneous seizures. Photostimulation using a strobe light source did not elicit any abnormal response. However, based on the studies of Epm2a−/− mice (30Ganesh S. Delgado-Escueta A.V. Sakamoto T. Avila M.R. Machado-Salas J. Hoshii Y. Akagi T. Gomi H. Suzuki T. Amano K. Agarwala K.L. Hasegawa Y. Bai D.S. Ishihara T. Hashikawa T. Itohara S. Cornford E.M. Niki H. Yamakawa K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we might not expect to observe any neurological or behavioral abnormalities in mice this young. Also, there is some evidence that Lafora disease caused by malin mutation has a somewhat milder course than that due to laforin mutation (31Singh S. Ganesh S. Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because Lafora disease is associated with abnormal glycogen metabolism, it was important to analyze glycogen and associated proteins in the Epm2b−/− mice, also because several of these proteins have been proposed to be targets of malin action, as described in the Introduction. A small but significant increase in total glycogen was observed in muscle and brain from Epm2b−/− mice (Fig. 3, A and D). Low speed centrifugation of tissue extracts separates glycogen into the soluble supernatant (LSS) and the insoluble pellet (LSP). In muscle, the distribution of glycogen was unchanged, but in brain, there was a significant increase in the proportion of insoluble glycogen in tissue from Epm2b−/− mice (Fig. 3, compare B and C and E and F). Glycogen synthase total activity and −/+ G6P activity ratios were unchanged in the knock-out animals (Fig. 4, A–H), although in brain, there was a trend to increased total activity in the LSP (Fig. 4H). These results were confirmed by Western blotting with anti-glycogen synthase antibodies (see Figs. 6A and 7A), and in the case of brain, the increased proportion of glycogen synthase in the LSP was statistically significant. Glycogen phosphorylase total activity, activation state (−/+ AMP activity ratio), and distribution between soluble and insoluble fractions in muscle and brain were unaffected by loss of the Emp2b gene (Fig. 5, A–H). The knock-out animals did, however, display a significant increase in total phosphorylase activity in the LSP (Fig. 5H). The level of the other metabolic enzyme analyzed, debranching enzyme, was also unaltered in knock-out animals (Figs. 6A and 7A). In brain extracts, the AGL signal by Western blotting was weak, and so the enzyme was enriched by high speed centrifugation of the LSS to produce a glycogen pellet. AGL levels in this pellet were the same in wild type and knock-out mice (Fig. 7B). Therefore, the only potentially significant changes associated with Epm2b disruption in these analyses was a slight increase in total glycogen and an enrichment of glycogen and glycogen synthase in the insoluble fraction in brain.FIGURE 4Glycogen synthase activity in skeletal muscle and brain of Epm2b−/− mice.

However, the molecular mechanism by which CARD9 mediates C. albicans-induced NF-κB activation is not fully characterized. Here we demonstrate that CARD9 is involved in mediating NF-κB activation induced by the hyphal form of C. albicans hyphae (Hyphae) but not by its heat-inactivated unicellular form. Our data show that inhibiting Dectin-2 expression selectively blocked Hyphae-induced NF-κB, whereas inhibiting Dectin-1 mainly suppressed zymosan-induced NF-κB, indicating that Hyphae-induced NF-κB activation is mainly through Dectin-2 and not Dectin-1. Consistently, we find that the hyphae stimulation induces CARD9 association with Bcl10, an adaptor protein that functions downstream of CARD9 and is also involved in C. albicans-induced NF-κB activation. This association is dependent on Dectin-2 but not Dectin-1 following the hyphae stimulation. Finally, we find that although both CARD9 and Syk are required for Hyphae-induced NF-κB activation, they regulate different signaling events in which CARD9 mediates IκBα kinase ubiquitination, whereas Syk regulates IκBα kinase phosphorylation.

IntroductionCandida albicans is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen that predominantly causes infection to cancer patients and immunocompromised individuals. During C. albicans infection, macrophages and dendritic cells recognize components from the fungal cell wall through their pattern recognition receptors (1Netea M.G. Brown G.D. Kullberg B.J. Gow N.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Sancho D. Slack E.C. LeibundGut-Landmann S. Reis e Sousa C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), which triggers a series of signaling cascades leading to activation of various transcription factors including NF-κB (1Netea M.G. Brown G.D. Kullberg B.J. Gow N.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB and other transcription factors further induce the expression of various cytokines and chemokines and inflammatory responses. However, the pattern recognition receptors that recognize fungal cell wall components are not fully defined (3Willment J.A. Brown G.D. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 27-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).NF-κB is a family of transcription factors that control the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in immune cells (4Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). In resting cells, the activity of NF-κB is tightly controlled by the IκB family of proteins, which bind to NF-κB dimers and keep these dimers in the cytoplasm. The canonical NF-κB activation pathway by most of NF-κB-inducing stimuli activates the IκBα kinase (IKK) 2The abbreviations used are: IKKIκBα kinaseTLRToll-like receptorLPSlipopolysaccharideERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageshRNAsmall hairpin RNAILinterleukinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMOImultiplicity of infection. complex. The IKK complex is controlled by signal-induced phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ subunits (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4046) Google Scholar) and signal-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of the regulatory subunit NEMO (6Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The activated IKK complex in turn phosphorylates IκBα proteins on N-terminal conserved serine residues to target them for ubiquitination-dependent degradation (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4046) Google Scholar). This process releases NF-κB and allows its translocation into the nucleus for the activation of its target genes (4Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that bacterial and viral infections induce IKK activation by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the molecular mechanism by which fungal infection induces NF-κB activation is not fully defined.Dectin-1 is a glycosylated type II transmembrane receptor and is mainly expressed in myeloid cells (7Ariizumi K.

It contains a single extracellular C-type lectin-like domain and a cytoplasmic domain containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation-like motif (7Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Xu S.

In addition, it has been shown that Dectin-1 collaborates with TLRs to activate inflammatory responses following fungal infection (14Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Underhill D.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that Dectin-1 functions as a pattern recognition receptor for fungal infection and mediates anti-fungus immune responses (8Reid D.M. Gow N.A. Brown G.D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2009; 21: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Underhill D.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 15Brown G.D.

In addition, it has been shown that β-glucan on the surface of C. albicans is predominantly buried beneath a monoprotein coat upon transforming C. albicans into its hyphal form under the infection condition (19Wheeler R.T. Fink G.R. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, the β-glucan moiety on the cell wall of C. albicans is invisible for the host, suggesting that the host innate immunity is also induced by other components rather than β-glucan on the surface of C. albicans.Dectin-2 is another C-type lectin-like receptor and is expressed in myeloid cells (20Ariizumi K.

In contrast to Dectin-1, Dectin-2 does not contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation-like motif in its cytoplasmic tail (20Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Ritter 3rd, R. Zukas P.

However, the molecular mechanism by which Dectin-2 mediates anti-fungus immunity is not fully characterized.

Veelken H. Warnatz K. Tahami F. Jamal S. Manguiat A. Rezaei N. Amirzargar A.A. Plebani A. Hannesschläger N. Gross O. Ruland J. Grimbacher B. New Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism by which CARD9 is involved in anti-fungal responses is not fully characterized, it has been shown that CARD9-deficient cells are defective in zymosan-induced NF-κB activation (27Gross O. Gewies A. Finger K. Schäfer M. Sparwasser T. Peschel C. Förster I. Ruland J. Nature. 2006; 442: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Zymosan is a β-glucan, a component of yeast cell wall, and a ligand for Dectin-1 (9Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Williams D.L. Martinez-Pomares L. Wong S.Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Therefore, the current model for fungal infection-induced NF-κB activation is that fungal cell wall components, such as β-glucan, activate Dectin-1, and then Dectin-1 activates NF-κB through a Syk- and CARD9-dependent pathway (2Robinson M.J. Sancho D. Slack E.C. LeibundGut-Landmann S. Reis e Sousa C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 27Gross O. Gewies A. Finger K. Schäfer M. Sparwasser T.

Tybulewicz V. Brown G.D. Ruland J. Reis e Sousa C. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 630-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrated that CARD9-deficient macrophages were defective for C. albicans-induced NF-κB activation. Our data indicate that NF-κB activation induced by live C. albicans is mainly through its hyphal form, which activates Dectin-2 but not Dectin-1. In contrast, NF-κB activation induced by zymosan, a β-glucan from yeast, is mainly dependent on Dectin-1 but not Dectin-2. Furthermore, our results indicate that CARD9 mediates Dectin-2-induced IKK ubiquitination, but not IKK phosphorylation, following Hyphae stimulation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that C. albicans can induce NF-κB activation through two independent pathways. One pathway is induced by the yeast-like, unicellular form of C. albicans through recognizing Dectin-1 to activate downstream signaling cascades, whereas the other pathway is induced by the hyphal form of C. albicans through recognizing Dectin-2 to activate downstream signaling cascades. Although Syk is required for both the Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 pathways, CARD9 is mainly involved in the Dectin-2 pathway. Our data further demonstrate that Syk and CARD9 function independently with Syk regulating IKK phosphorylation and CARD9 regulating IKK ubiquitination (Fig. 7). Therefore, our study proposes a new model for fungi-induced NF-κB activation in which C. albicans infection mainly induces NF-κB through a Dectin-2-CARD9 signaling cascade, instead of the previously proposed model that C. albicans infection induces NF-κB through the Dectin-1-Syk-CARD9 signaling cascade.Fungi such as C. albicans are rapidly transformed from their yeast forms to the hyphal forms under the vegetative growth condition, such as in condition for mammalian cell culture or after infecting into mammalian bodies. After they are transformed to hyphae, the β-glucan in the surface of yeast cell wall is mainly buried by other components (19Wheeler R.T. Fink G.R. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), such as monosylated glycoproteins (Mannan) (1Netea M.G. Brown G.D. Kullberg B.J. Gow N.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that macrophages recognize the Mannan moiety on their surface of Hyphae and lead to activation of inflammatory signaling cascades. Our findings that Dectin-2 is required for Hyphae-induced NF-κB activation and cytokine production are consistent with previous observations that Dectin-2 recognizes Man9GlcNAc2 with a high affinity (22McGreal E.P. Rosas M. Brown G.D. Zamze S. Wong S.Y. Gordon S. Martinez-Pomares L. Taylor P.R. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and that C. albicans contains Man9GlcNAc2 on its cell wall (34Mora-Montes H.M. López-Romero E. Zinker S. Ponce-Noyola P. Flores-Carreón A. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although our preliminary studies indicate that Man9GlcNAc2 is not sufficient to activate NF-κB (data not shown), it will be interesting to determine whether Man9GlcNAc2 structure is required for hyphae-mediated NF-κB.Our data showing that CARD9 is required for the inflammatory response induced by the live or hyphal form of C. albicans but not by heat-inactive C. albicans suggest that the CARD9-dependent inflammatory response induced by C. albicans is not induced by β-glucan in the cell wall of C. albicans. Consistent with this notion, we have found that β-glucans, such as zymosan and curdlan, induce NF-κB through a CARD9-independent pathway. This result appears to directly contradict a previous report that zymosan-induced NF-κB is dependent on CARD9 (27Gross O. Gewies A. Finger K. Schäfer M. Sparwasser T. Peschel C. Förster I. Ruland J. Nature. 2006; 442: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In our studies, we have used both EMSA and immunoblotting analysis and demonstrated that the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and IκB phosphorylation/degradation is not defective in CARD9-deficient macrophages. Although we cannot explain the discrepancy regarding the role of CARD9 in zymosan-induced NF-κB activation between our results and those reported by Gross et al. (27Gross O. Gewies A. Finger K. Schäfer M. Sparwasser T. Peschel C. Förster I. Ruland J. Nature. 2006; 442: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), one possible explanation is that Gross et al. used bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, whereas we used bone marrow-derived macrophages. However, in our studies, we observed only a slight difference of NF-κB activation in wild-type and CARD9 knock-out dendritic cells (supplemental Fig. S1).Recently, Robinson et al. (24Robinson M.J. Osorio F. Rosas M. Freitas R.P. Schweighoffer E. Gross O. Verbeek J.S. Ruland J. Tybulewicz V. Brown G.D. Moita L.F. Taylor P.R. Reis e Sousa C. J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 2037-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) reported that Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 appear to function in a redundant manner for anti-fungi immunity (24Robinson M.J. Osorio F. Rosas M. Freitas R.P. Schweighoffer E. Gross O. Verbeek J.S. Ruland J. Tybulewicz V. Brown G.D. Moita L.F. Taylor P.R. Reis e Sousa C. J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 2037-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Their data also suggest that Syk functions downstream of both Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 but upstream of CARD9. Our data support the notion that Syk functions downstream of both Dectin-1 and Dectin-2. However, our results argue that Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 function independently in response to different ligands from C. albicans. In particular, we find that inhibiting Dectin-2 expression completely blocks hyphae-induced NF-κB and cytokine production. The difference between our findings versus those of Robinson et al. is likely due to the fact that Robinson et al. used Dectin-2 antibodies to trigger the endocytosis of surface Dectin-2, whereas we used Dectin-2 shRNA to block Dectin-2 expression. During the reviewing process of our manuscript, Saijo et al. (35Saijo S. Ikeda S. Yamabe K. Kakuta S. Ishigame H. Akitsu A. Fujikado N. Kusaka T. Kubo S. Chung S.H. Komatsu R. Miura N. Adachi Y. Ohno N. Shibuya K. Yamamoto N. Kawakami K. Yamasaki S. Saito T. Akira S. Iwakura Y. Immunity. 2010; 32: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) published a paper demonstrating that Dectin-2-deficient mice but not Dectin-1-deficient mice are highly susceptible to C. albicans infection.Our results also show that CARD9 is inducibly associated with Bcl10 following stimulation of the Dectin-2-dependent pathway, which provides direct evidence that CARD9 functions downstream of Dectin-2. However, it remains to be determined what molecule(s) link CARD9 to Dectin-2 (Fig. 7). In addition, we find that CARD9 deficiency significantly affects signal-induced IKK ubiquitination, whereas inhibition of Syk activity blocks the signal-induced IKK phosphorylation, suggesting that CARD9 and Syk may not work in a linear arrangement in the signaling pathway following C. albicans stimulation.Although our data showing that suppressing Dectin-2 expression blocks hyphae-induced NF-κB activation clearly demonstrate that Dectin-2 is an essential component of the receptor for mediating C. albicans hyphae-induced NF-κB activation, we cannot rule out the possibility that other receptors, such as TLRs, may also participate in mediating C. albicans hyphae-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, future studies will need to determine whether Dectin-2 is the only component or whether it also forms a complex with other receptors to mediate hyphae-induced NF-κB activation.In summary, several important conclusions can be drawn from our study. First, C. albicans induces the host-inflammatory response mainly through its hyphal form. Second, unknown components other than β-glucan on the hyphal surface are recognized by Dectin-2 on host cells. The stimulation of Dectin-2 by hyphae induces at least two independent signaling cascades in which the Syk-dependent cascade regulates IKK phosphorylation, whereas the CARD9-dependent cascade controls IKK ubiquitination. Thus, phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the IKK complex induce its kinase activity and leads to phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and activation of NF-κB (Fig. 7). Together, our study reveals a more detailed molecular mechanism of fungal infection-induced inflammatory response and provides potential targets for designing therapeutic agents against fungus infection. IntroductionCandida albicans is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen that predominantly causes infection to cancer patients and immunocompromised individuals. During C. albicans infection, macrophages and dendritic cells recognize components from the fungal cell wall through their pattern recognition receptors (1Netea M.G. Brown G.D. Kullberg B.J. Gow N.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Sancho D. Slack E.C. LeibundGut-Landmann S. Reis e Sousa C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), which triggers a series of signaling cascades leading to activation of various transcription factors including NF-κB (1Netea M.G. Brown G.D. Kullberg B.J. Gow N.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB and other transcription factors further induce the expression of various cytokines and chemokines and inflammatory responses. However, the pattern recognition receptors that recognize fungal cell wall components are not fully defined (3Willment J.A. Brown G.D. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 27-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).NF-κB is a family of transcription factors that control the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in immune cells (4Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). In resting cells, the activity of NF-κB is tightly controlled by the IκB family of proteins, which bind to NF-κB dimers and keep these dimers in the cytoplasm. The canonical NF-κB activation pathway by most of NF-κB-inducing stimuli activates the IκBα kinase (IKK) 2The abbreviations used are: IKKIκBα kinaseTLRToll-like receptorLPSlipopolysaccharideERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageshRNAsmall hairpin RNAILinterleukinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMOImultiplicity of infection. complex. The IKK complex is controlled by signal-induced phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ subunits (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4046) Google Scholar) and signal-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of the regulatory subunit NEMO (6Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The activated IKK complex in turn phosphorylates IκBα proteins on N-terminal conserved serine residues to target them for ubiquitination-dependent degradation (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4046) Google Scholar). This process releases NF-κB and allows its translocation into the nucleus for the activation of its target genes (4Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that bacterial and viral infections induce IKK activation by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the molecular mechanism by which fungal infection induces NF-κB activation is not fully defined.Dectin-1 is a glycosylated type II transmembrane receptor and is mainly expressed in myeloid cells (7Ariizumi K.

Therefore, it has been proposed that Dectin-1 functions as a pattern recognition receptor for fungal infection and mediates anti-fungus immune responses (8Reid D.M. Gow N.A. Brown G.D. Curr. Opin.

PTPN22 encodes the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP), which forms a complex with the kinase Csk and is a critical negative regulator of signaling through the T cell receptor. The C1858T single nucleotide polymorphism results in the LYP-R620W variation within the LYP-Csk interaction motif. LYP-W620 exhibits a greatly reduced interaction with Csk and is a gain-of-function inhibitor of signaling. Here we show that LYP constitutively interacts with its substrate Lck in a Csk-dependent manner. T cell receptor-induced phosphorylation of LYP by Lck on an inhibitory tyrosine residue releases tonic inhibition of signaling by LYP. The R620W variation disrupts the interaction between Lck and LYP, leading to reduced phosphorylation of LYP, which ultimately contributes to gain-of-function inhibition of T cell signaling.

Point mutagenesis of LYP constructs was performed by PCR using primers containing the desired mutation.

Full-length LYP-R620 and -W620 and their C227S mutants were cloned in the BamHI site of the pFastBac-HTa (Invitrogen) in-frame with a FLAG tag, and recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses were produced using the Bac-to-Bac® method (Invitrogen). Virus titers/times of incubation were optimized to obtain high expression of full-length recombinant proteins in Spodoptera fungiperda 9 cells. The protein was purified from lysates of insect cells using single-step affinity chromatography on FLAG-M2 beads and eluting with a combination of FLAG peptide and high concentrations of DTT.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

To generate JTAg cells stably expressing Δ288LYP, the cells were transfected with linearized plasmid and after 2 days were subjected to selection with 0.2 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were used for experiments at the polyclonal stage. COS cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). For pervanadate (PV) stimulation of JTAg, a PV solution was added to RPMI medium to achieve a 200 μm PV final concentration. C305 stimulation of JTAg and Hut78 cells was performed using C305 hybridoma (25Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) supernatant. For stimulation of primary human T cells, the cells were incubated in RPMI medium with OKT3 (1 μg/ml) and anti-huCD4 (1 μg/ml) or anti-huCD28 (1 μg/ml), followed by cross-linking with 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse IgG for the time indicated in the figure.

Saijo K. Niidome T. Kühn R. Aizawa S. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 1998; 394: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thymi were isolated from 4–6-week-old mice, and thymocytes were purified using standard protocols. All of the procedures involving animals described in this manuscript were approved by the University of Southern California (protocol numbers 10714 and 10853) and LIAI (protocol number AP-NB1-0709) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Anonymous buffy coats were purchased from Advanced Bioservices, LLC (Reseda, CA) or obtained from the blood bank of the Tor Vergata University Hospital in Rome, Italy. T cells were isolated by Lymphoprep (VWR) or Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation followed by depletion of B cells and monocytes by anti-CD19 and anti-CD14 Dynabeads (Invitrogen). If necessary to induce expression of LYP, the cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h. When needed, genomic DNA was extracted from 100 μl of peripheral blood using a genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.), and the genotype at the LYP-R620W locus (single nucleotide polymorphism rs2476601) was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR as described in Ref. 1Bottini N.

All of the procedures involving human subjects described in this manuscript were approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board (exempt approval number 053029) or by the Ethical Committee of the Tor Vergata University Hospital. For IPs, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The lysis buffer also contained either 5 mm iodoacetamide or Na3VO4 in concentrations variable between 1 and 10 mm. 10 mm Na3VO4 was added when it was necessary to preserve the phosphorylation of active LYP/PEP in TCR-stimulated cells. The IP of LYP by PT66 or 4G10 Ab was not affected by the presence of Na3VO4 in the lysis buffer up to 5 or 10 mm, respectively (data not shown). Denaturing IPs were carried out by adding 1% SDS to the lysate. The lysates were diluted to reduce the final concentration of SDS to 0.1% immediately prior to the addition of the Ab. Coomassie gel bands of interest were excised and chopped into small pieces and digested by trypsin as described elsewhere (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). In brief, the proteins were reduced in 10 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature, alkylated in 55 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and digested overnight at room temperature with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (proteomics grade; Sigma). The digestion medium was then acidified to 2% trifluoroacetic acid. The supernatant was loaded onto a self-packed 200-μl pipette tip plugged with C18 material (3M EmporeTM C18 disk; 3M Bioanalytical Technologies, St. Paul, MN) filled first with 2 mm of TiO2 beads (GL Sciences Inc. Tokyo, Japan) and then another C18 disk. Bound peptides to the first upper C18 disk were desalted by a wash with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then eluted onto underneath TiO2 beads with 30 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The bound peptides to TiO2 were washed once with the previous buffer and then once with a similar buffer without 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The peptides were eluted using 50 μl of 20% NH4OH in 40% acetonitrile in water, pH ≥ 10.5. Phosphopeptide mixture was almost dried using a SpeedVac concentrator (Concentrator 5301; Eppendorf AG, Hamburg Germany) and then resuspended in 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis. An LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, Bremen, Germany) coupled on-line to nano-LC (Ultimate, Dionex) was used. To prepare an analytical column C18 material (ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) was packed into a spray emitter (75-μm inner diameter, 8-μm opening, 70-mm length; New Objectives) using a high pressure packing device (NanobaumeTM; Western Fluids Engineering). Mobile phase A consisted of water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.5% acetic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile and 0.5% acetic acid. The five most intense peaks of the MS scan were selected in the ion trap for MS2 (normal scan, filling 5 × 105 ions, 500-ms maximum fill time for MS scan, 2 × 105 ions for MS2, multistage activation enabled, 200-ms maximum fill time, dynamic exclusion for 60 s). The raw files were processed using DTAsupercharge v.1.18. The generated peak lists were searched against the IPI human data base using Mascot 2.2 with the parameters: monoisotopic masses, 10 ppm on MS, 0.5 Da on MS/MS, electrospray ionization trap parameters, full tryptic specificity, cysteine carbamidomethylated as fixed modification, oxidation on methionine, phosphorylation on serine, threonine, or tyrosine, protein N-acetylation, and deamidation on glutamine and asparagine as variable modifications, with three missed cleavage sites allowed. The results were parsed through MSQuant 1.4.3a74. The identified phosphopeptide was manually validated. Luciferase assays were performed as described in Ref. 6Vang T. Congia M. Macis M.D. Musumeci L. Orrú V. Zavattari P. Nika K. Tautz L. Taskén K. Cucca F. Mustelin T. Bottini N. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar. The difference in the ratio between firefly and Renilla luciferase activity in stimulated versus unstimulated cells (TCR-induced increased activation of reporter) was then plotted against the expression of LYP assessed by densitometric scanning of anti-HA blots of total lysates. All of the samples were acquired on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). For induction of CD69, the cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml OKT3 for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed, fixed, permeabilized, blocked with 10% mouse serum, and co-stained with AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD69 antibody. The cells overexpressing LYP were gated by comparing AlexaFluor488 fluorescence of cells transfected with HA-LYP versus cells transfected with vector alone. Autodephosphorylation of PTPs is a well known phenomenon that complicates the assessment of the effect of phosphorylation on the phosphatase activity of PTPs. We observed initial autodephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated LYP already after 5 min of incubation in phosphatase buffer (Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 5 mm DTT) (data not shown). To study the activity of phospho-LYP in conditions of fast enzyme autodephosphorylation, we used a fluorogenic peptide based on a Tyr(P) mimicking coumarin amino acid, which has recently been developed by the Barrios group (29Mitra S. Barrios A.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 5142-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The enantiomerically pure, appropriately protected, phosphorylated coumaryl amino propionic acid (pCAP) can be incorporated into peptide substrates using standard N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based solid phase peptide synthesis methodologies and undergoes enzymatic dephosphorylation by PTPs to CAP (29Mitra S. Barrios A.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 5142-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Upon excitation ∼340 nm, CAP-containing peptides are over 104 times more fluorescent than pCAP-containing peptides (λem = 460 nm). Thus, PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pCAP-containing peptides results in a fluorogenic, continuous, and direct assay for PTP activity. The assay is extremely sensitive compared with the standard Tyr(P) peptide assay, and minimal spontaneous hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide ensures that the signal/background ratio of this assay is optimal even for short assay times (29Mitra S. Barrios A.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 5142-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Mitra S. Barrios A.M. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 370: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also because the assay is direct, continuous monitoring of linearity of the reaction is possible. We synthesized and purified the pCAP-containing peptide substrate ARLIEDNE(pCAP)TAREG (peptide 14LckpCAP394), a sequence based on residues around the Lck Tyr394 autophosphorylation site, which is a physiological substrate of LYP. A shorter version of this peptide has been reported to be an excellent LYP substrate (30Mitra S. Barrios A.M. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 370: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and we found that the recombinant catalytic domain of LYP dephosphorylates the 14LckpCAP394 peptide following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with Km and kcat values equal or better than the corresponding 14-aa Tyr(P) peptide (kcat was 11.7 and 4.4 s−1, and Km was 81 and 71 μm for the pCAP and Tyr(P) peptides, respectively). 6E.

Bottini, unpublished data. For detection of phosphatase activity of LYP IPed from transfected cells, the IPs were washed in Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, and then resuspended in phosphatase buffer (Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 5 mm DTT). After the addition of 0.4 mm peptide, the reaction was monitored continuously by measuring the increase in fluorescence (λex = 340 nm and λem = 460 nm) at 60-s intervals for 30 min. The activity measured in triplicate was corrected for the nonspecific signal of identical reactions performed also in triplicate without the addition of enzyme. The activity corrected for background fluorescence of substrate alone was then normalized for LYP expression as assessed by anti-HA Western blotting of fractions of IPs taken after resuspension in the final phosphatase buffer. Graphs, curve fittings, and kinetic parameter calculations were performed using the Graphpad Prism software package (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). All of the S.D. values of the differences and ratios were calculated according to the error propagation rules described by Taylor (31Taylor J.R. An Introduction to Error Analysis.2nd Ed. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1997: 45-92Google Scholar). To explain the gain-of-function phenotype of LYP-W620, we first assessed whether (i) the polymorphism directly affects the protein to induce increased enzymatic activity or (ii) simple binding of LYP to Csk is sufficient to inhibit the activity of the phosphatase. We purified recombinant full-length LYP-R620 and LYP-W620 and their inactive C227S mutants from lysates of insect cells (Fig. 1A). Because insect Csk lacks a functional SH3 domain (32Read R.D. Bach E.A. Cagan R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6676-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we obtained Csk-free LYP, which could be used to in vitro reconstitute the complex between LYP and Csk (Fig. 1B). When we measured the activity of recombinant LYP using an Lck-derived peptide as a substrate, we observed no significant difference between the activity of LYP-R620 and LYP-W620 (Fig. 1C). In control assays both LYP-C227S variants did not show any activity (data not shown, and see also Ref. 33Liu Y. Stanford S.M. Jog S.P. Fiorillo E. Orrú V. Comai L. Bottini N. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The addition of Csk to the reaction did not affect the activity of LYP-R620 or LYP-W620 (Fig. 1C). Despite the limitations imposed by our in vitro system (for example, differences in post-translational modifications of LYP between mammalian and insect cells), these data suggest that the polymorphism does not induce gain-of-function through a direct effect on the protein and that binding of Csk to LYP is not sufficient per se to induce changes in the enzymatic activity. We next hypothesized that differences in post-translational modifications between LYP-R620 and LYP-W620 contribute to the gain-of-function phenotype of LYP-W620. Given that LYP forms a complex with Csk, a PTK, and the pol"

Salicylic acid (SA), derived from the shikimate/isochorismate pathway, is a key hormone in resistance to biotrophic pathogens.

However, the range and modes of action of SA-related metabolites remain elusive. In Arabidopsis, Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1) promotes SA-dependent and SA-independent responses in resistance against pathogens. Here, we used metabolite profiling of Arabidopsis wild type and eds1 mutant leaf extracts to identify molecules, other than SA, whose accumulation requires EDS1 signaling. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry of isolated and purified compounds revealed 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) as an isochorismate-derived secondary metabolite whose accumulation depends on EDS1 in resistance responses and during ageing of plants. 2,3-DHBA exists predominantly as a xylose-conjugated form (2-hydroxy-3-β-O-d-xylopyranosyloxy benzoic acid) that is structurally distinct from known SA-glucose conjugates. Analysis of DHBA accumulation profiles in various Arabidopsis mutants suggests an enzymatic route to 2,3-DHBA synthesis that is under the control of EDS1.

https://openalex.org/W1980188755,"Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells that represent an important link between innate and adaptive immunity. Danger signals such as toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists induce maturation of DC leading to a T-cell mediated adaptive immune response. In this study, we show that exogenous as well as endogenous inflammatory stimuli for TLR4 and TLR2 induce the expression of HIF-1α in human monocyte-derived DC under normoxic conditions. On the functional level, inhibition of HIF-1α using chetomin (CTM), YC-1 and digoxin lead to no consistent effect on MoDC maturation, or cytokine secretion despite having the common effect of blocking HIF-1α stabilization or activity through different mechanisms. Stabilization of HIF-1α protein by hypoxia or CoCl2 did not result in maturation of human DC. In addition, we could show that TLR stimulation resulted in an increase of HIF-1α controlled VEGF secretion. These results show that stimulation of human MoDC with exogenous as well as endogenous TLR agonists induces the expression of HIF-1α in a time-dependent manner. Hypoxia alone does not induce maturation of DC, but is able to augment maturation after TLR ligation. Current evidence suggests that different target genes may be affected by HIF-1α under normoxic conditions with physiological roles that differ from those induced by hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2039057009,"Transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), an MAP3K, is a key player in processing a multitude of inflammatory stimuli. TAK1 autoactivation involves the interplay with TAK1-binding proteins (TAB), e.g. TAB1 and TAB2, and phosphorylation of several activation segment residues. However, the TAK1 autoactivation is not yet fully understood on the molecular level due to the static nature of available x-ray structural data and the complexity of cellular systems applied for investigation. Here, we established a bacterial expression system to generate recombinant mammalian TAK1 complexes. Co-expression of TAK1 and TAB1, but not TAB2, resulted in a functional and active TAK1-TAB1 complex capable of directly activating full-length heterotrimeric mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. TAK1-dependent AMPK activation was mediated via hydrophobic residues of the AMPK kinase domain alphaG-helix as observed in vitro and in transfected cell culture. Co-immunoprecipitation of differently epitope-tagged TAK1 from transfected cells and mutation of hydrophobic alphaG-helix residues in TAK1 point to an intermolecular mechanism of TAB1-induced TAK1 autoactivation, as TAK1 autophosphorylation of the activation segment was impaired in these mutants. TAB1 phosphorylation was enhanced in a subset of these mutants, indicating a critical role of alphaG-helix residues in this process. Analyses of phosphorylation site mutants of the activation segment indicate that autophosphorylation of Ser-192 precedes TAB1 phosphorylation and is followed by sequential phosphorylation of Thr-178, Thr-187, and finally Thr-184.

We postulated that CRMP-2 levels affects the actions of LCM on VGSCs. CRMP-2 labeling by LCM analogs was competitively displaced by excess LCM in rat brain lysates. Manipulation of CRMP-2 levels in the neuronal model system CAD cells affected slow inactivation of VGSCs without any effects on other voltage-dependent properties. In silico docking was performed to identify putative binding sites in CRMP-2 that may modulate the effects of LCM on VGSCs. These studies identified five cavities in CRMP-2 that can accommodate LCM. CRMP-2 alanine mutants of key residues within these cavities were functionally similar to wild-type CRMP-2 as assessed by similar levels of enhancement in dendritic complexity of cortical neurons. Next, we examined the effects of expression of wild-type and mutant CRMP-2 constructs on voltage-sensitive properties of VGSCs in CAD cells: 1) steady-state voltage-dependent activation and fast-inactivation properties were not affected by LCM, 2) CRMP-2 single alanine mutants reduced the LCM-mediated effects on the ability of endogenous Na(+) channels to transition to a slow inactivated state, and 3) a quintuplicate CRMP-2 alanine mutant further decreased this slow inactivated fraction. Collectively, these results identify key CRMP-2 residues that can coordinate LCM binding thus making it more effective on its primary clinical target."

HEK293 cell surface biotinylation experiments quantified the fraction of correctly targeted channel proteins. Our data suggested three distinct mutant channel subtypes: Group 1 mutants (L212P, P1298L, DelF1617, R1632H) gave peak current densities and cell surface targeting indistinguishable from wild-type hNa(v)1.5. Loss-of-function of these mutants resulted from altered channel kinetics, including a negative shift of steady-state inactivation and a reduced voltage dependency of open-state inactivation. Group 2 mutants (E161K, T220I, D1275N) gave significantly reduced whole-cell currents due to impaired cell surface localization (D1275N), altered channel properties at unchanged cell surface localization (T220I), or a combination of both (E161K). Group 3 mutant channels were non-functional, due to an almost complete lack of protein at the plasma membrane (T187I, W1421X, K1578fs/52, R1623X) or a probable gating/permeation defect with normal surface localisation (R878C, G1408R).This study indicates that multiple molecular mechanisms, including gating abnormalities, trafficking defects, or a combination of both, are responsible for SCN5A-related familial SSS."

Whereas conventional superconductors such as lead have a gap that is uniform in momentum space, the enigmatic cuprates have point nodes and a characteristic d -wave symmetry. The heavy fermion compound UPt 3 has long been known to exhibit unconventional pairing. Now, Strand et al. (p. 1368 ) have measured the momentum space dependence of UPt 3 's superconducting gap as a function of temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2027578670,"Histone lysine methylation is a dynamic process that plays an important role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. Recent studies have identified Jhd2, a JmjC domain-containing protein, as an H3K4-specific demethylase in budding yeast. However, important questions regarding the regulation and functions of Jhd2 remain unanswered. In this study, we show that Jhd2 has intrinsic activity to remove all three states of H3K4 methylation in vivo and can dynamically associate with chromatin to modulate H3K4 methylation levels on both active and repressed genes and at the telomeric regions. We found that the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of Jhd2 is important for its chromatin association in vivo. However, this association is not dependent on H3K4 methylation and the H3 N-terminal tail, suggesting the presence of an alternative mechanism by which Jhd2 binds nucleosomes. We also provide evidence that the JmjN domain and its interaction with the JmjC catalytic domain are important for Jhd2 function and that Not4 (an E3 ligase) monitors the structural integrity of this interdomain interaction to maintain the overall protein levels of Jhd2. We show that the S451R mutation in human SMCX (a homolog of Jhd2), which has been linked to mental retardation, and the homologous T359R mutation in Jhd2 affect the protein stability of both of these proteins. Therefore, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed defects in patients harboring this SMCX mutant and suggest the presence of a conserved pathway involving Not4 that modulates the protein stability of both yeast Jhd2 and human SMCX.

Covalent modifications of histones play an important role in genome maintenance and gene regulation. In particular, methylation on the side chains of lysine and arginine in histones H3 and H4 is important in regulating chromatin structure and gene transcription (1Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar, 2Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar). Lysine methylation is unique among the known histone modifications, as three modification states, monomethylation (me1), dimethylation (me2), and trimethylation (me3), can be generated, adding yet another level of variation to this modification “mark.” In general, methylation at H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 has been linked to gene activation, whereas H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20 methylation is associated with repressed genes (1Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar, 2Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have revealed that depending on the gene context, the methylation state of a specific modified lysine can exert an opposite effect on gene expression. For example, methylation of H3K9 within the promoter or coding region can result in gene repression or activation, respectively (3Vakoc C.R. Mandat S.A. Olenchock B.A. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas H3K4 methylation (especially H3K4me3) is strongly associated with gene activation (1Berger S.L.

Until recently, histone lysine methylation was thought to be stable and irreversible. However, this notion was dispelled by the identification of two different classes of lysine-specific histone demethylases, amine oxidases (e.g. LSD1) and JmjC domain-containing proteins. Both classes of enzymes catalyze lysine demethylation via an oxidation reaction that generates formaldehyde, but only JmjC class demethylases require ferrous ion (Fe2+) and α-ketoglutarate as cofactors (7Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 8Shi Y. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Whereas LSD1 specifically targets mono- and dimethylated H3K4 or H3K9, the JmjC class consists of several subfamilies that remove methyl groups from the modified H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, or H3K36 residue (7Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 8Shi Y. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). One member of the JmjC class is the evolutionarily conserved JARID1 family of histone demethylases, which specifically target Lys4-methylated H3 and function as transcriptional repressors (9Secombe J. Eisenman R.N. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to the JmjC catalytic domain, the JARID1 proteins also possess a conserved N-terminal motif (JmjN domain) that is strictly associated with the JmjC domain (7Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 9Secombe J. Eisenman R.N. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Metazoan JARID1 demethylases also contain several conserved functional motifs, including an ARID/BRIGHT DNA-binding domain, a C5HC2 zinc finger, and two or three plant homeodomain (PHD) 2The abbreviations used are: PHDplant homeodomainChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationWTwild typeORFopen reading frameWCEwhole-cell extractMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferase. fingers (7Klose R.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 14262-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have revealed that in the absence of JHD2, the levels of H3K4 methylation were altered compared with the wild type (WT) during activation and attenuation of GAL1 transcription (14Ingvarsdottir K. Edwards C. Lee M.G. Lee J.S. Schultz D.C. Shilatifard A. Shiekhattar R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7856-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Jhd2 in these processes. Evidence from genetic studies indicates that Jhd2 is important for maintaining normal gene silencing at telomere and silent mating-type loci (15Liang G. Klose R.J. Gardner K.E. Zhang Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Osborne E.A. Dudoit S. Rine J. Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that the protein stability and steady-state levels of Jhd2 are modulated by the proteasomal degradation following E3 ligase Not4-mediated polyubiquitination (20Mersman D.P. Du H.N. Fingerman I.M. South P.F. Briggs S.D. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite these advances in our understanding of the functions of Jhd2, many fundamental questions pertaining to its substrate specificity and selectivity, domain contributions, chromatin association, and overall regulation remain unanswered. In this study, we demonstrate that Jhd2 localizes to both transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin and regulates H3K4 methylation at these loci. Upon investigating the contributions of the conserved domains in Jhd2 to its function, we found that a proper interaction between JmjN and JmjC domains is important for Jhd2 function and that Not4 controls Jhd2 protein levels by monitoring the integrity of this JmjN-JmjC interdomain interaction. Additionally, our results show that the PHD finger is important for the interaction of Jhd2 with chromatin in vivo and that this interaction is independent of H3K4 methylation. Deletion mutants lacking Jhd2, Set1, Swd1, Sdc1, or Spp1 in strain YMH171 were created using PCR products containing the disrupted gene locus and the inserted KanMX4 selection module amplified from the genomic DNA template isolated from the respective BY4742-based yeast deletion strains (Open Biosystems). Jhd2 was genomically tagged with nine copies of Myc at its C terminus in YMH171 following PCR amplification using pYM6 as the template (21Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). MSY421, a histone H3/H4 shuffle strain (22Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), was used to mobilize the H3 N-terminal deletion mutant (H3(1–28Δ)). The FLAG-H2B and FLAG-H2B/set1Δ strains were derived from YZS276 (22Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Detailed genotypes of the yeast strains described in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. All the plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. For overexpressing the jumonji domain-containing proteins, PCR products containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) for RPH1, GIS1, ECM5, JHD1, or JHD2 and 500 bp of DNA upstream and downstream of each ORF were mobilized into a high copy vector, YEplac112 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). C-terminal LexA epitope-tagged Jhd2 was created by PCR amplifying the ORF of JHD2 and mobilizing it between the ADH1 promoter and a fragment of the LexA DNA-binding domain in pFBL23 (24Béranger F. Aresta S. de Gunzburg J. Camonis J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2035-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An XhoI-KpnI fragment containing the sequence encoding nine copies of the Myc epitope (9Myc) and the CYC1 terminator was obtained following PCR amplification and mobilized into pRS314. Subsequently, a 500-bp PCR product containing the JHD2 promoter was mobilized upstream of the region coding for 9Myc as a SacI-SpeI fragment. The entire JHD2 promoter-9Myc-CYC1 terminator module was mobilized as a SacI-KpnI fragment into pRS316. The ORF of JHD2 was then PCR-amplified and mobilized between the JHD2 promoter and the 9Myc-CYC1 terminator sequence in pRS314 or pRS316 as a SpeI-XhoI fragment. Point and truncation mutants of Jhd2 were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pRS314-JHD2-9Myc or pRS316-JHD2-9Myc as the template. For overexpression of JHD2 or its mutant derivatives, a fragment containing the WT or mutant ORF, the promoter, and the CYC1 terminator region was excised from the pRS314-based construct and mobilized into the high copy vector pRS426. To obtain purified recombinant Jhd2 PHD finger or its variants, a sequence encoding either the WT PHD finger or its mutant derivatives was amplified by PCR and mobilized into a bacterial expression vector, pBG101 (kindly provided by the Vanderbilt Structural Biology Core). The plasmids pCS3+-6Myc and pCS3+-SMCX-6Myc were kindly provided by Ralf Janknecht (25Kim T.D. Shin S. Janknecht R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 366: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the pCS3+-smcx(S451R)-6Myc construct was made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All of the constructs created using PCR amplification were verified by DNA sequencing. 3DNA primers used in this study are available upon request. To determine changes in Jhd2 levels (see Fig. 2C), whole-cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared as described (26Chandrasekharan M.B. Huang F. Sun Z.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16686-16691Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies raised against the Myc epitope (9E10; a gift from Ethan Lee) and Pgk1 (22C5, Molecular Probes) at 1:1000 and 1:5000 dilutions, respectively. Crude nuclear extracts were used to examine the levels of H3K4 methylation following the cell fractionation procedure described previously (26Chandrasekharan M.B. Huang F. Sun Z.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16686-16691Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased from Millipore and used in Western blotting to detect H3K4 methylation (with dilutions indicated in parentheses): anti-H3K4me1 (1:1000), anti-H3K4me2 (1:10,000), and anti-H3K4me3 (1:2500). The histone H3 loading was monitored using anti-H3 antibody (1:7500; Active Motif). For mammalian WCEs, HeLa cells were transfected with pCS3+-6Myc, pCS3+-SMCX-6Myc, or pCS3+-smcx(S451R)-6Myc using the Lipofectamine method. Following a 2-day incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed prior to and after harvesting with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) and boiled in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) for 10 min. After centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 5 min, equal volumes of WCEs were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Myc (1:1000) and anti-β-actin (1:10,000; Sigma) antibodies. WT and jhd2Δ strains were grown in yeast minimal synthetic complete medium without inositol (SC−Ino medium; Bio 101, Inc.) supplemented with 200 μm inositol and 2 mm choline (INO1 repression medium) (27Schüller H.J. Schorr R. Hoffmann B. Schweizer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5955-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at 30 °C overnight. The overnight cultures were reinoculated into INO1 repression medium at 2 × 106 cells/ml and grown at 30 °C to log phase. Cells (4 × 108) were subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking for ChIP assay (INO1 repressed state). The remaining cells were harvested, washed once with SC−Ino medium, inoculated at 4 × 106 cells/ml into fresh SC−Ino medium, and grown at 30 °C for 2 h to activate INO1 expression. Again, cells (4 × 108) were set aside and subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking (INO1 induced state). To assess temporal changes in histone modification or Jhd2 occupancy following INO1 repression, cells grown in inducing medium were reinoculated into INO1 repression medium at the following initial cell densities and grown at 30 °C for the various time periods (indicated in parentheses) to obtain ∼4 × 108 cells: 7 × 106 cells/ml (20 min), 6 × 106 cells/ml (1 h), 4 × 106 cells/ml (2 h), and 2 × 106 cells/ml (4 h). Cultures grown to different incubation times following INO1 re-repression were then subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking for ChIP assay (INO1 re-repression time course). Double cross-linking using dimethyl adipimidate (Sigma) and formaldehyde was done essentially as described previously (28Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6123-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Following incubation in 10 mm dimethyl adipimidate, cells were washed and resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with gentle agitation. The cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 130 mm glycine and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and harvested to prepare soluble chromatin for immunoprecipitating H3, H3K4me3, Jhd2-LexA, and Jhd2–9Myc using anti-H3, anti-H3K4me3, anti-LexA (Active Motif), and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. The data analysis of quantitative real-time PCR following ChIP was performed as described by Chandrasekharan et al. (26Chandrasekharan M.B. Huang F. Sun Z.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16686-16691Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, occupancy of H3K4me3 was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method (Bio-Rad real-time PCR applications guide). Chromatin obtained from the set1Δ strain was used as a control to determine nonspecific immunoprecipitation, and any value obtained for this strain was subtracted from the H3K4me3 occupancy values obtained from all other strains. Soluble chromatins from yeast strains transformed with plasmid vectors were used as negative controls (“no tag”) for ChIP of Jhd2–9Myc and Jhd2-LexA. The 2−ΔCT value obtained for the negative control was subtracted from 2−ΔCT values obtained for test samples containing epitope-tagged WT or mutant Jhd2.3 Spheroplast preparation and nuclei isolation were performed as described previously (26Chandrasekharan M.B. Huang F. Sun Z.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16686-16691Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). WCEs were prepared by bead-beating spheroplasts in buffer A (1% SDS, 8 m urea, 10 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), followed by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 20 min. Nuclear extracts were obtained by lysing isolated nuclei in buffer A, followed by sonication and centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 15 min. For chromatin fractions, isolated nuclei were resuspended in hypotonic solution (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 1700 × g for 5 min, the chromatin pellet was washed with hypotonic solution and then resuspended in buffer A. Following a brief sonication, soluble chromatin was obtained by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 15 min. The protein concentration of the clarified lysate was measured using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit following the manufacturer’s instructions, and an equal amount of total protein was subjected to Western blotting using anti-Myc, anti-Pgk1, or anti-H3 antibody. Cycloheximide treatment of yeast was done as described previously (29Belle A. Tanay A. Bitincka L. Shamir R. O'Shea E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13004-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, a 25-ml culture was grown to log phase, and cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 35 μg/ml to inhibit the translation machinery. Cells (3.5 × 107) were collected at 0, 20, 40, and 60 min after cycloheximide treatment and boiled in 100 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 5 min, equal volumes of lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Myc or anti-Pgk1 antibody. A log phase yeast culture (25 ml) was treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide or 0.1 mm MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) for 30 min. The effect of proteasomal inhibition on Jhd2 or its mutant derivatives was examined in a pdr5Δ strain to allow efficient uptake of MG132 (20Mersman D.P. Du H.N. Fingerman I.M. South P.F. Briggs S.D. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). WCEs were prepared in the presence of 0.1 mm MG132 and subjected to Western blotting as described above. The sequence of the PHD domain in Jhd2 was submitted to SWISS-MODEL structure prediction (ExPASy Proteomics Server). The software uses a homology-based search and predicts the structure utilizing solved structure(s) as a reference. The template used for the structure prediction is the solution structure of the PHD finger in JARID1D/SMCY (Protein Data Bank code 2E6R). Nuclei from FLAG-H2B and FLAG-H2B/set1Δ strains were isolated as described previously (26Chandrasekharan M.B. Huang F. Sun Z.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16686-16691Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the DNA content was determined by measuring the A260 of an aliquot of nuclei diluted in 1 n NaOH. Nuclei (equivalent to 660 μg of DNA) were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Micrococcal nuclease digestion was performed twice by the addition of 5 μl of 0.1 m CaCl2 and 500 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) to the nuclei suspension, followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min, and then 4.5 μl of 0.1 m EGTA (pH 8.0) was added to stop the digestion. After centrifugation at 9300 × g for 10 min, supernatants from the two digestions were combined. The nucleosome-enriched supernatant was diluted by the addition of an equal volume of buffer B containing 10% glycerol and subjected to anti-FLAG affinity chromatography (M2, Sigma). After extensive washes with buffer B with 5% glycerol, the immobilized nucleosomes were stored at 4 °C until further use in the in vitro nucleosome binding assay. DNA was isolated from an aliquot of the immobilized nucleosomes by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and resolved on a 2% agarose gel to examine the size of the nucleosomes bound to anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged WT and mutant PHD fingers (amino acid 209–320) of Jhd2 were purified from Escherichia coli using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The GST-tagged PHD finger (2 μg) was incubated with 5 μl of nucleosome-containing beads in 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes with binding buffer, the beads were boiled in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-GST (1:20,000; GE Healthcare) and anti-FLAG (M2, 1:5000) antibodies. The JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases are evolutionarily highly conserved across many genera (7Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). There are five JmjC domain-containing proteins (Rph1, Gis1, Ecm5, Jhd1, and Jhd2) in budding yeast.

Moreover, none of the JmjC domain-containing proteins exhibited any apparent demethylation of Lys79-methylated H3 under the same conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, Jhd2 is an H3K4 methylation-specific demethylase in yeast. Given the genome-wide distribution of H3K4 methylation (30Pokholok D.K. Harbison C.T. Levine S. Cole M. Hannett N.M. Lee T.I.

Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar, 2Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar), we tested whether Jhd2 plays a role in controlling this H3 modification during transcription. Toward this end, ChIP assays were undertaken to assess the occurrence and changes, if any, in Jhd2 occupancy and in H3K4me3 levels at the highly expressed PMA1 gene. Compared with the WT, deletion of JHD2 (jhd2Δ) or overexpression of JHD2-LexA led to a 2-fold increase or decrease in H3K4me3 at the promoter or ORF regions of PMA1, respectively (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that Jhd2 might be present on constitutively and highly expressed genes to maintain their normal H3K4 methylation levels. Indeed, ChIP data showed that Jhd2-LexA was present on the promoter and ORF regions of the PMA1 gene (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the distribution pattern of Jhd2-LexA across the PMA1 gene was similar to that seen for H3K4me3 (Fig. 1, compare B and C). Similar results were obtained from ChIP assays of HSP104 (see Fig. 8B), which is expressed at very low levels under normal conditions (32Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Given that H3K4me3 is the substrate for Jhd2, these data suggest that Jhd2"
https://openalex.org/W2009100953,"Reconsidering Recurrence The very long times between major earthquakes on known susceptible faults make estimating a long-term recurrence interval difficult. Deep, low-frequency earthquakes happen much more frequently and thus provide a natural setting for studying earthquake occurrence. Shelly (p. 1385 ) examined the timing of over 900 tiny earthquakes along a well-studied portion of the San Andreas Fault during a span of 8.5 years. The recurrence intervals between these microearthquakes, which roughly occurred on 3- and 6-day cycles, were sensitive to larger nearby events. For example, following the Parkfield earthquake in 2004, the 3-day cycle shortened and the 6-day cycle disappeared. If large-earthquake recurrence intervals are similarly variable over time, it will be extremely difficult to predict future damaging earthquakes from a short historical record."
https://openalex.org/W2093504320,"Cryptococcus gattii, an emerging fungal pathogen of humans and animals, is found on a variety of trees in tropical and temperate regions. The ecological niche and virulence of this yeast remain poorly defined. We used Arabidopsis thaliana plants and plant-derived substrates to model C. gattii in its natural habitat. Yeast cells readily colonized scratch-wounded plant leaves and formed distinctive extracellular fibrils (40–100 nm diameter ×500–3000 nm length). Extracellular fibrils were observed on live plants and plant-derived substrates by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by high voltage- EM (HVEM). Only encapsulated yeast cells formed extracellular fibrils as a capsule-deficient C. gattii mutant completely lacked fibrils. Cells deficient in environmental sensing only formed disorganized extracellular fibrils as apparent from experiments with a C. gattii STE12α mutant. C. gattii cells with extracellular fibrils were more virulent in murine model of pulmonary and systemic cryptococcosis than cells lacking fibrils. C. gattii cells with extracellular fibrils were also significantly more resistant to killing by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in vitro even though these PMN produced elaborate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These observations suggest that extracellular fibril formation could be a structural adaptation of C. gattii for cell-to-cell, cell-to-substrate and/or cell-to- phagocyte communications. Such ecological adaptation of C. gattii could play roles in enhanced virulence in mammalian hosts at least initially via inhibition of host PMN– mediated killing."
https://openalex.org/W2009360196,"Among the hundreds of genes encoding miRNAs in plants reported, much more were predicted by numerous computational methods. However, unlike protein-coding genes defined by start and stop codons, the ends of miRNA molecules do not have characteristics that can be used to define the mature miRNAs exactly, which made computational miRNA prediction methods often cannot predict the accurate location of the mature miRNA in a precursor with nucleotide-level precision. To our knowledge, there haven't been reports about comprehensive strategies determining the precise sequences, especially two termini, of these miRNAs.In this study, we report an efficient method to determine the precise sequences of computationally predicted microRNAs (miRNAs) that combines miRNA-enriched library preparation, two specific 5' and 3' miRNA RACE (miR-RACE) PCR reactions, and sequence-directed cloning, in which the most challenging step is the two specific gene specific primers designed for the two RACE reactions. miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage by RLM-5' RACE and sequencing were carried out to validate the miRNAs detected. Real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of each miRNA.The efficiency of this newly developed method was validated using nine trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) miRNAs predicted computationally. The miRNAs computationally identified were validated by miR-RACE and sequencing. Quantitative analysis showed that they have variable expression. Eight target genes have been experimentally verified by detection of the miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage in Poncirus trifoliate.The efficient and powerful approach developed herein can be successfully used to validate the sequences of miRNAs, especially the termini, which depict the complete miRNA sequence in the computationally predicted precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2046846306,"Chondrogenesis is the complex process that leads to the establishment of cartilage and bone formation. Due to their ability to differentiate in vitro and mimic development, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) show great potential for investigating developmental processes. In this study, we used chondrogenic differentiation of ESCs as a model to analyze morphogenetic events during chondrogenesis.ESCs were differentiated into the chondrocyte lineage, forming small cartilaginous aggregates in suspension. Differentiated ESCs showed that chondrogenesis was typically characterized by five overlapping stages. During the first stage, cell condensation and aggregate formation was observed. The second stage was characterized by differentiation into chondrocytes and fibril scaffold formation within spherical aggregates. Deposition of cartilaginous extracellular matrix and cartilage formation were hallmarks of the third stage. Apoptosis of chondrocytes, hypertrophy and/or degradation of cartilage occurred during the fourth stage. Finally, during the fifth stage, bone replacement with membranous calcified tissues took place.We demonstrate that ESCs show the chondrogenic differentiation pathway from the pluripotent stem cell to terminal skeletogenesis through these five stages in vitro. During each stage, morphological changes acquired in preceding stages played an important role in further development as a scaffold or template in subsequent stages. The study of chondrogenesis via ESC differentiation may be informative to our further understanding of skeletal growth and regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W1967832579,"Nicastrin and its relative Nicalin (Nicastrin-like protein) are both members of larger protein complexes, namely gamma-secretase and the Nicalin-NOMO (Nodal modulator) complex. The gamma-secretase complex, which contains Presenilin, APH-1, and PEN-2 in addition to Nicastrin, catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane domain of various proteins including the beta-amyloid precursor protein and Notch. Nicalin and its binding partner NOMO form a complex that was shown to modulate Nodal signaling in developing zebrafish embryos. Because its experimentally determined native size (200-220 kDa) could not be satisfyingly explained by the molecular masses of Nicalin (60 kDa) and NOMO (130 kDa), we searched in affinity-purified complex preparations for additional components in the low molecular mass range. A approximately 22-kDa protein was isolated and identified by mass spectrometry as transmembrane protein 147 (TMEM147), a novel, highly conserved membrane protein with a putative topology similar to APH-1. Like Nicalin and NOMO, it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is expressed during early zebrafish development. Overexpression and knockdown experiments in cultured cells demonstrate a close relationship between the three proteins and suggest that they are components of the same complex. We present evidence that, similar to gamma-secretase, its assembly is hierarchical starting with the formation of a Nicalin-NOMO intermediate. Nicalin appears to represent the limiting factor regulating the assembly rate by stabilizing the other two components. We conclude that TMEM147 is a novel core component of the Nicalin-NOMO complex, further emphasizing its similarity with gamma-secretase."

Many aspects of glioma CSCs (GSCs), however, have been characterized in non-physiological settings.We found gene expression similarity superiorly defined glioma ""stemness"", and revealed that GSC similarity increased with lower tumor grade. Using this method, we examined stemness in human grade IV gliomas (GBM) before and after dendritic cell (DC) vaccine therapy. This was followed by gene expression, phenotypic and functional analysis of murine GL26 tumors recovered from nude, wild-type, or DC-vaccinated host brains.GSC similarity was specifically increased in post-vaccine GBMs, and correlated best to vaccine-altered gene expression and endogenous anti-tumor T cell activity. GL26 analysis confirmed immune alterations, specific acquisition of stem cell markers, specifically enhanced sensitivity to anti-stem drug (cyclopamine), and enhanced tumorigenicity in wild-type hosts, in tumors in proportion to anti-tumor T cell activity. Nevertheless, vaccine-exposed GL26 cells were no more tumorigenic than parental GL26 in T cell-deficient hosts, though they otherwise appeared similar to GSCs enriched by chemotherapy. Finally, vaccine-exposed GBM and GL26 exhibited relatively homogeneous expression of genes expressed in progenitor cells and/or differentiation.T cell activity represents an inducible physiological process capable of proportionally enriching GSCs in human and mouse gliomas. Stem-like gliomas enriched by strong T cell activity, however, may differ from other GSCs in that their stem-like properties may be disassociated from increased tumor malignancy and heterogeneity under specific host immune conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2058516312,"Membrane tubulation is generally associated with rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and other cytoplasmic factors. Little is known about the contribution of extracellular matrix components to this process. Here, we demonstrate an essential role of proteoglycans in the tubulation of the cnidarian nematocyst vesicle. The morphogenesis of this extrusive organelle takes place inside a giant post-Golgi vesicle, which topologically represents extracellular space. This process includes the formation of a complex collagenous capsule structure that elongates into a long tubule, which invaginates after its completion. We show that a non-sulfated chondroitin appears as a scaffold in early morphogenesis of all nematocyst types in Hydra and Nematostella. It accompanies the tubulation of the vesicle membrane forming a provisional tubule structure, which after invagination matures by collagen incorporation. Inhibition of chondroitin synthesis by beta-xylosides arrests nematocyst morphogenesis at different stages of tubule outgrowth resulting in retention of tubule material and a depletion of mature capsules in the tentacles of hydra. Our data suggest a conserved role of proteoglycans in the stabilization of a membrane protrusion as an essential step in organelle morphogenesis."

Here, we show that PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 interact through their transmembrane domains, and not through the coiled-coil domain, by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a series of deletion mutants. Deletion mutants lacking the critical interaction region were not transported to the cell surface and remained in the cytoplasm, whereas PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 proteins were expressed at the cell surface when both are transfected. Calcium imaging analysis revealed that neither the coiled-coil domain nor the EF-hand domain located in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PKD2L1 was required for response on stimulation with an acidic solution. Finally, PKD2L1 did not localize to the taste pore but was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in taste cells of circumvallate and foliate papillae in PKD1L3(-/-) mice, whereas it localized to the taste pore in wild-type mice. Collectively, these results suggest that the interaction between PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 through their transmembrane domains is essential for proper trafficking of the channels to the cell surface in taste cells of circumvallate and foliate papillae and in cultured cells."

The mechanism by which radiation causes damage to human tissue is by ionization of atoms. Radiation is known to interfere with cellular functions at all levels of cell organization. Studies of people exposed to high doses of radiation have shown that there is a risk of cancer associated with high doses. The specific types of cancers associated with radiation exposure include leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and skin cancer. Animals exposed to 55-MeV protons had a high incidence of malignant brain tumors (1Wood D. Radiat. Res. 1991; 126: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

LE cells were irradiated with 250-MeV protons at different doses (0.1, 1, 2, and 4 gray (Gy)) at the Loma Linda Radiation Facility, cultured, and harvested at different time points depending on the experimental procedure. For comparative purposes, control cells were cultured similarly and harvested along with irradiated cells. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) system is a simple, accurate, and reproducible means of measuring the activity of living cells via mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. The key component is MTT. Solutions of MTT solubilized in tissue culture media or balanced salt solutions, without phenol red, are yellowish in color. Mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells cleave the tetrazolium ring, yielding purple MTT formazan crystals, which are insoluble in aqueous solutions. The crystals can be dissolved in acidified isopropyl alcohol. The resulting purple solution is spectrophotometrically measured. An increase in cell number results in an increase in the amount of MTT formazan formed and an increase in absorbance.

Nano Lett. 2005; 5: 1676-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). LE cells grown overnight were irradiated with different doses of protons and cultured for 36 h. The irradiated LE cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), MTT was added to a final concentration of 125 μg/ml, and incubation was continued for another 3 h. The formazan formed inside the cells was extracted using acidic methanol, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. Live/dead cell assays were performed essentially as described previously (9Manna S.K. Sarkar S. Barr J. Wise K. Barrera E.V. Jejelowo O. Rice-Ficht A.C. Ramesh G.T. Nano Lett. 2005; 5: 1676-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 LE cells were cultured for 24 h, irradiated with different doses of protons, and incubated for another 24 h. The irradiated cells were stained with 5 μm ethidium homodimer and 5 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The stained cells were analyzed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope and photographed. The measurement of intracellular ROS was performed as described previously (10Sarkar S. Sharma C. Yog R. Periyakaruppan A. Jejelowo O. Thomas R. Barrera E.V. Rice-Ficht A.C. Wilson B.L. Ramesh G.T. J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol. 2007; 7: 584-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal numbers of rat LE cells (2000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with 10 μm dichlorofluorescein(5,6)carboxy-2,7′-dichlorodihydroxy fluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) for 3 h, washed with PBS, and exposed to different doses of protons, and the intensity of fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 527 nm, respectively. The readings were taken immediately after irradiation and continued up to 3 h. The 2.5 h of post-irradiated readings shown in Fig. 2A are expressed as fluorescence units. Proton-induced LPO was determined using a kit from Cayman Chemical as described previously (11Wise K.C. Manna S.K. Yamauchi K. Ramesh V. Wilson B.L. Thomas R.L. Sarkar S. Kulkarni A.D. Pellis N.R. Ramesh G.T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 2005; 41: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of LE cells (4 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS, exposed to different doses of protons, and incubated for 12 h. The cells were then scraped with PBS and sonicated. Fifty micrograms of cell lysate and methanol were mixed and centrifuged after adding precooled chloroform at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing hydroperoxides was collected and used for the estimation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive malondialdehyde. The chromogen formed was detected at a wavelength of 500 nm. Glutathione is the key antioxidant present in most cells (12Ravichandran P. Periyakaruppan A. Sadanandan B. Ramesh V. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Ramesh G.T. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2009; 23: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reduced intracellular GSH activity was measured using a glutathione assay kit following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). In brief, LE cells (4 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in a 6-well plate and grown for 24 h. Next, cells were irradiated with different doses of protons, and incubation was continued for 12 h. The cells were then scraped and homogenized using PBS. Fifty micrograms of protein was deproteinized using 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid dihydrate solution and 400 mm sodium carbonate, followed by 1:8 dilutions with phosphate/EDTA buffer and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was then treated with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and incubation was continued for another 10 min. The GSH activity was measured at an absorbance of 415 nm. The assay was performed using the superoxide dismutase kit from Trevigen, Inc. (catalog no. 7500-100-K; Gaithersburg, MD). Fifty micrograms of protein extracts was used to assay total SOD activities following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, SOD reaction buffer was mixed with xanthine solution followed by nitro blue tetrazolium solution, the sample proteins isolated 12 h after proton irradiation were added, and the absorbance was set to zero at 550 nm. Finally, xanthine oxidase (XOD) solution was added to each sample, and readings were taken at 550 nm every 30 s for a period of 5 min. The total SOD activity was calculated based on the manufacturer's formula. Whole cell extracts were prepared at different time points from proton-irradiated and control cells using mammalian cell extraction buffer (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) as described previously (7Baluchamy S. Zhang Y. Ravichandran P. Ramesh V. Sodipe A. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Gridley D.S. Wu H. Ramesh G.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; (Apr 11)10.1007/s11010-010-0451-4PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk powder in PBS containing 0.1% IGEPAL, probed with the appropriate primary antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and developed using Pierce detection solution (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): caspase-3 (sc-7272), caspase-8 (sc-7890), SOD-1 (sc-11407), and SOD-2 (sc-18503). Anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma (A5441). The cleavage activities of caspase-3 and -8 substrates DEVD-AFC and IETD-AFC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, protein extracts were prepared from 24-h proton-irradiated and control cells, followed by estimation using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (catalog no. 1856210, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The DEVD-AFC and IETD-AFC substrates were added to 50 μg of protein extract for detecting caspase-3 and -8, respectively, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The formation of free AFC in the extract was measured at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 495 nm. The values of experimental samples were compared with those of control samples and expressed as fluorescence units. Genomic DNA was isolated from proton-irradiated (1, 2, and 4 Gy) and control cells using the ApoTarget quick apoptotic DNA ladder kit (catalog no. SKU-KHO1021, Invitrogen) according to the procedure specified by the manufacturer. Briefly, equal numbers of 24-h post-irradiated and control cells were homogenized in Tris/EDTA buffer, followed by mixing with Enzyme A solution and incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Enzyme B solution was added to the Enzyme A solution and incubated for an additional 30 min at 50 °C. To this, 0.1 volume of ammonium acetate and 2.5-fold cold ethanol were added and precipitated at −20 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation to obtain the DNA pellet. The pellet was washed with 70% cold ethanol and centrifuged again. Finally, the DNA was air-dried, resuspended in DNA suspension buffer, and analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. Data are expressed as means ± S.D., and statistical significance was analyzed by Student’s t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Previous observations from our group have shown the induction of DNA and tissue damage in 2-Gy proton-irradiated mouse brain tissues (7Baluchamy S. Zhang Y. Ravichandran P. Ramesh V. Sodipe A. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Gridley D.S. Wu H. Ramesh G.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; (Apr 11)10.1007/s11010-010-0451-4PubMed Google Scholar, 8Baluchamy S. Zhang Y. Ravichandran P. Ramesh V. Sodipe A. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Gridley D.S. Wu H. Ramesh G.T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 2010; (10-1007/s-11626-010-9330-2)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we tested the effect of protons on the in vitro system of rat LE cells. Here, we observed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells, which was evident by standard MTT dye uptake cell viability assay (Fig. 1A). Notably, LE cells exposed to a lower dose (0.1 Gy) did not show any change in cell proliferation compared with untreated control cells. To reconfirm cell viability, a live/dead cell assay was performed, and the results showed a similar effect, with an increased numbers of dead cells in proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Because we observed an inhibition of cell proliferation in proton-irradiated cells, we were interested in investigating whether proton irradiation alters oxidative stress to inhibit cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 2A, proton irradiation activated ROS significantly in a dose-dependent manner compared with control cells. For example, ROS levels were 3-fold higher at 4 Gy, 2.5-fold higher at 2 Gy, and 1.8-fold higher at 1 Gy than in control cells. However, a lower dose of 0.1 Gy did not affect ROS production. It has been shown in the literature that LPO, a standard biomarker for oxidative stress, is activated during external stress (12Ravichandran P. Periyakaruppan A. Sadanandan B. Ramesh V. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Ramesh G.T. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2009; 23: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured LPO levels at different time points in proton-irradiated cells and found a dose-dependent increased level of LPO in these cells that directly correlated with increased ROS levels observed under proton-irradiated conditions (Fig. 2B). The presence of many antioxidants has been reported in cells as a protective mechanism during oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death (13Sharma C.S. Sarkar S. Periyakaruppan A. Barr J. Wise K. Thomas R. Wilson B.L. Ramesh G.T. J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol. 2007; 7: 2466-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Glutathione and SOD are the major antioxidants in cells, and they balance ROS levels to maintain normal cellular functions when cells are under external stress (14Wiseman H. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Because an alteration of oxidant levels has been observed in proton-irradiated cells, antioxidant levels were also analyzed. A significant dose-dependent inhibition of GSH and SOD activities was detected in proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells. (Fig. 3, A and B). Notably, 50 and 80% reductions of GSH and SOD activities, respectively, were detected in 4-Gy proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells. In addition, Fig. 3C shows the dose-dependent reduction of SOD-1 and -2 proteins level in 12-h post-irradiated cells compared with control cells. DNA damage is caused mainly by external factors, particularly radiation and chemicals (15Burrows C.J. Muller J.G. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1109-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Our group has used external stress-inducing agents in an in vitro system and shown an induction of oxidative stress-mediated cell death through activation of caspase-3 and -8 (12Ravichandran P. Periyakaruppan A. Sadanandan B. Ramesh V. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Ramesh G.T. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2009; 23: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16NCRP Guidance on Radiation Received in Space Activities (Report 98). National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD1989Google Scholar). Here, we performed the same strategy in proton-irradiated cells to determine whether caspase levels are affected by proton irradiation. Fig. 4A shows a significantly increased level of caspase-3 activities at higher proton doses (2 and 4 Gy) compared with control cells and at a lower dose (0.1 Gy). Furthermore, the activation of caspase-3 was dependent on the early activation of either caspase-8 or -9. We continued our investigation of caspase-8 activity and observed a dose-dependent increase in caspase-8 activity in 2-Gy (2-fold) and 4-Gy (3-fold) proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). Our protein data for caspase-3 and -8 also show an increased level of these proteins in 2- and 4-Gy proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4C). It has long been known that radiation induces DNA damage. Also, our recently published report on irradiated mouse brain showed significant DNA damage compared with the control brain (7Baluchamy S. Zhang Y. Ravichandran P. Ramesh V. Sodipe A. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Gridley D.S. Wu H. Ramesh G.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; (Apr 11)10.1007/s11010-010-0451-4PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation is a key feature of programmed cell death, and the process is characterized by the activation of endogenous endonucleases with subsequent cleavage of chromatin DNA into internucleosomal fragments of 180 bp and multiples thereof (15Burrows C.J. Muller J.G. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1109-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). There are many methods to assess the DNA fragmentation caused by the apoptosis event, and the most standard technique involves detection of DNA ladders using agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 5 shows an apoptotic ladder of genomic DNA isolated from different doses of proton-irradiated cells and control cells. Notably, we detected more DNA fragmentation in 4-Gy proton-irradiated cells than in control cells and at other lower doses. Proton radiation therapy offers a number of potential advantages over conventional (photon) γ-radiation therapy for cancer because of a more localized delivery of the radiation dose. It is generally assumed that the relative biological effectiveness of protons is 1.1 cobalt Gy eq (sometimes referred to as Gy eq). At hospital-based proton facilities, a dose of 1.8–2 cobalt Gy eq is often used per fraction, with one fraction delivered per day over a period of 5 days/week for 5–7 weeks, depending on the type and location of the tumor as well as other considerations. Thus, the dose of 2 Gy used in this study is approximately equivalent to one fraction of proton irradiation delivered during therapy. However, it should be noted that although the total doses delivered to the intended target volume during treatment are much higher than those used here, normal cells located at a distance from the target may well be exposed to 0.1–4 Gy during or by the end of therapy. For example, at the Loma Linda University Medical Center, there are seven proton energies used for patient treatment, and all are within the range of 100–250 MeV. Protons are also the most abundant type of particles encountered by astronauts during missions both in low Earth orbit and to the Moon or Mars (16NCRP Guidance on Radiation Received in Space Activities (Report 98). National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD1989Google Scholar). The dose received by astronauts during a low Earth orbit mission that lasts for several months can be as high as 0.1 sievert. In space, proton energies have a much wider range and dependence on certain conditions. For example, proton energies could be up to several 100 MeV during a solar particle event and up to several 1000 MeV in galactic cosmic rays (17Schimmerling W. Gravit. Space Biol. Bull. 2003; 16: 5-10PubMed Google Scholar). Research on radiation has been ongoing for several decades, but the information available on protons is minimal. Currently, we lack critical knowledge of the molecular mechanism of proton irradiation to assess human radiation exposure, and this is a high priority, as it would enable better determination of health risks. Recently, a published report on a mouse system showed an activation of DNA damage- and apoptosis-related genes in 2-Gy proton-irradiated brain tissues compared with control brain tissues (7Baluchamy S. Zhang Y. Ravichandran P. Ramesh V. Sodipe A. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Gridley D.S. Wu H. Ramesh G.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; (Apr 11)10.1007/s11010-010-0451-4PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this work, we extended our radiation studies using different doses of protons in an in vitro cell line system, particularly rat LE cells, and investigated radiation-induced oxidative stress followed by cell death. Our cell viability observations from this study shows that proton irradiation inhibits cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in LE cells (Fig. 1). Several reports have shown that ROS could be activated through various stressors such as uranium, tobacco smoke, carbon nanotubes, high glucose, tumor necrosis factor-α, chemicals, radiation, etc., and the elevated levels of ROS regulate a broad array of signal transduction pathways that control various biological processes, including gene expression and cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (18Periyakaruppan A. Kumar F. Sarkar S. Sharma C.S. Ramesh G.T. Arch. Toxicol. 2007; 81: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Engel R.H. Evens A.M. Front. Biosci. 2006; 1: 300-312Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In agreement with the above-mentioned ROS activation, our data from this study also show a dose-dependent activation of ROS in proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). In biological systems, oxidant and antioxidant levels are maintained in a balanced state. For example, when cells are under stress, antioxidants are produced at higher concentrations to neutralize the ROS level for normal cellular activities. Evidence in the literature also suggests that overexpression of SOD protects cells from ROS-mediated apoptosis (20Zhao Y. Kiningham K.K. Lin S.M. Clair St., D.K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Dominguez-Rodriguez J.R. Gomez-Contreras P.C. Hernandez-Flores G. Lerma-Diaz J.M. Carranco A. Cervantes-Munguia R. Orbach-Arbouys S. Bravo-Cuella A. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 1869-1872PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the data from proton-irradiated cells show an inhibition of antioxidant levels compared with control cells, suggesting that proton irradiation blocks the production of antioxidants through an unidentified mechanism to kill the irradiated cells. The ultimate effect of radiation is to induce DNA damage and cell death (14Wiseman H. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that cell death induced by protons is apoptosis rather than necrosis or autophagy, and the apoptosis process is mediated through the activation of caspases (6Giedzinski E. Rola R. Fike J.R. Limoli C.L. Radiat. Res. 2005; 164: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Very recently, we also showed that mice exposed to 2-Gy protons demonstrated caspase-3 and -8 activation, fragmented DNA, and significant tissue damage with altered expression of DNA damage- and oxidative stress-signaling genes compared with control brain tissues (7Baluchamy S. Zhang Y. Ravichandran P. Ramesh V. Sodipe A. Hall J.C. Jejelowo O. Gridley D.S. Wu H. Ramesh G.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; (Apr 11)10.1007/s11010-010-0451-4PubMed Google Scholar, 8Baluchamy S.

Consistent with our earlier in vivo observation, the current in vitro cell line data also show a similar effect with an induction of caspase-3 and -8 and significant levels of fragmented DNA in proton-irradiated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4, A and B), which confirms that proton-irradiated cells induce the apoptotic pathway through activation of caspase-3 and -8 for cell death. Even though we detected a 2–3-fold increase in caspase activity in 4-Gy proton-irradiated cells, the caspase-3 protein seemed to be increased much more from 12 to 24 h in 4-Gy proton-irradiated cells. At present, we do not know why there is a dramatic increase in caspase-3 at these time points. In addition, an apoptotic ladder study showed more DNA fragmentation at 4 Gy compared with control cells and at other lower doses, suggesting that the proton-mediated cell death is dependent on dose and exposure time. It is important to note here that our DNA fragmentation and caspase activation data correlate with our cell viability data showing more dead cells at 24 h of 4-Gy proton irradiation. Studies on proton-mediated cellular signaling pathways such as NF-κB, AP-1, etc., and their effect on oxidative stress-induced cell death are under way to dissect the exact molecular mechanism of proton-mediated cell killing. Taken together, our findings show that there is an involvement of the oxidative stress pathway leading to functional activation of cell death-related caspase-3 and -8 following proton exposure that complements the response triggered by DNA damage. These data advance our knowledge of the cellular and molecular effects of proton irradiation and could be useful in improving current proton therapy protocols."
https://openalex.org/W1991652569,"Background Approximately 20% of oocytes are classified as immature and discarded following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures. These oocytes are obtained from gonadotropin-stimulated patients, and are routinely removed from the cumulus cells which normally would mature the oocytes. Given the ready access to these human oocytes, they represent a potential resource for both clinical and basic science application. However culture conditions for the maturation of cumulus-free oocytes have not been optimized. We aimed to improve maturation conditions for cumulus-free oocytes via culture with ovarian paracrine/autocrine factors identified by single cell analysis. Methodology/Principal Finding Immature human oocytes were matured in vitro via supplementation with ovarian paracrine/autocrine factors that were selected based on expression of ligands in the cumulus cells and their corresponding receptors in oocytes. Matured oocytes were artificially activated to assess developmental competence. Gene expression profiles of parthenotes were compared to IVF/ICSI embryos at morula and blastocyst stages. Following incubation in medium supplemented with ovarian factors (BDNF, IGF-I, estradiol, GDNF, FGF2 and leptin), a greater percentage of oocytes demonstrated nuclear maturation and subsequently, underwent parthenogenesis relative to control. Similarly, cytoplasmic maturation was also improved as indicated by development to blastocyst stage. Parthenogenic blastocysts exhibited mRNA expression profiles similar to those of blastocysts obtained after IVF/ICSI with the exception for MKLP2 and PEG1. Conclusions/Significance Human cumulus-free oocytes from hormone-stimulated cycles are capable of developing to blastocysts when cultured with ovarian factor supplementation. Our improved IVM culture conditions may be used for obtaining mature oocytes for clinical purposes and/or for derivation of embryonic stem cells following parthenogenesis or nuclear transfer."

We reported previously that NELL2 mRNA abundance in brain is increased by estrogen (E2) treatment and that NELL2 is involved in the E2-dependent organization of a sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area. In this study we cloned the mouse NELL2 promoter and found it to contain two half-E2 response elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and promoter assays showed that E2 and its receptors (ERα and ERβ) stimulated NELL2 transcription by binding to the two half-E2 response elements. Hippocampal neuroprogenitor HiB5 cells expressing recombinant NELL2 showed increased cell survival under cell death-inducing conditions. Blockade of endogenous synthesis of NELL2 in HiB5 cells abolished the cell survival effect of E2 and resulted in a decrease in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). These data suggest that the NELL2 gene is trans-activated by E2 and contributes to mediating the survival promoting effects of E2 via intracellular signaling pathway of ERK.

A prominent function of E2 in the nervous system is to protect neurons from cell death (for review, see Ref. 11Garcia-Segura L.M. Azcoitia I. DonCarlos L.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 63: 29-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). E2 produced locally by aromatization of circulating testosterone promotes survival of the SDN-POA in neonatal male rats, whereas this effect is not observed in females because fetoneonatal E2 binding protein blocks E2 action in the female brain (12Rhees R.W. Shryne J.E. Gorski R.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 52: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Arai Y. Murakami S. Nishizuka M. Horm. Behav. 1994; 28: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Davis E.C. Popper P. Gorski R.A. Brain Res. 1996; 734: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because blockade of NELL2 synthesis in the neonatal male rat brain resulted in a decreased size of SDN-POA (6Jeong J.K. Ryu B.J. Choi J. Kim D.H. Choi E.J. Park J.W. Park J.J. Lee B.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that NELL2 is involved in the E2-induced protection of SDN-POA in male rats. This notion was inferentially supported by the results of a differential display analysis of RNA samples from the hypothalamus of E2-injected female rats indicating that NELL2 is an E2-responsive gene (15Choi E.J. Ha C.M. Choi J. Kang S.S. Choi W.S. Park S.K. Kim K. Lee B.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).We now report that (a) E2-its receptor (ER) complexes bind and activate the NELL2 promoter, and (b) E2-induced cell survival is blocked by silencing the NELL2 gene via RNA interference (RNAi) and by overexpression of a mutant NELL2 lacking EGF-like domains. These results suggest that NELL2 is a mediator of E2-induced neuronal survival in the central nervous system.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported that hypothalamic NELL2 mRNA abundance is increased by E2 treatment (15Choi E.J. Ha C.M. Choi J. Kang S.S. Choi W.S. Park S.K. Kim K. Lee B.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that NELL2 is involved in the E2-dependent formation of the SDN-POA in male rats (6Jeong J.K. Ryu B.J. Choi J. Kim D.H. Choi E.J. Park J.W. Park J.J. Lee B.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that E2 and its receptors, ERα and ERβ, trans-activate the NELL2 gene and that NELL2 mediates the protective effect of E2 on cultured neuroprogenitor cells against cell death-inducing treatments.A stimulatory effect of E2 on NELL2 transcription appears to be at odds with the decrease in NELL2 mRNA that occurs at the time of female puberty (23Ha C.M. Choi J. Choi E.J. Costa M.E. Lee B.J. Ojeda S.R. Neuroendocrinology. 2008; 88: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NELL2 mRNA abundance increases in the hypothalamus during the juvenile period, when circulating E2 levels are low and decreases, instead of increasing, at the time of puberty, when circulating E2 levels are elevated. It is possible that the juvenile increase in NELL2 synthesis is independent from changes in E2 secretion and that the stimulatory effect of high (pubertal) E2 levels is counteracted by a repressive E2-independent mechanism set in motion at the time of puberty. Further investigation is obviously required to clarify this phenomenon.Sequence analysis revealed that the mNELL2 promoter does not have classical palindromic ERE(s). Instead, it contains two half-EREs and seven SP1REs. Both half-EREs strongly bind ERα and ERβ in EMSA, suggesting that these domains physically interact with ERα and ERβ. This interaction was further confirmed by supershift assays and ChIP assays. Deletion of each of the two half-EREs resulted in a significant decrease of E2-ER-dependent promoter activation. Thus, both the half-EREs are required for full E2-ER-dependent transactivation of NELL2. Earlier studies have demonstrated that E2-ER complexes regulate target gene promoters containing half-EREs (30Martini P.G. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Ediger T.R. Park S.E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1828-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays showed that ER specifically bound two conserved half-EREs in the prothymosin α gene (30Martini P.G. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and several half-EREs in the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor gene (31Ediger T.R. Park S.E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1828-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The half-EREs in these genes were critical for the ERα- and ERβ-dependent transcriptional regulation, although binding affinities of these half-EREs to ER are much less than that of the canonical palindromic ERE. EMSA and ChIP assays and promoter analyses in our study revealed that E2-ERs regulate transcription of the NELL2 gene also by directly binding to half-EREs.Interestingly, deletion of some SP1REs differentially affected the ERα and ERβ dependence of NELL2 transcription; deletion of SP1RE at −209 and −430 decreased ERβ-dependent-, but not the ERα-dependent activation of NELL2 transcription. The mechanism underlying this difference remains to be ascertained. The decrease of ERβ-dependent activation of NELL2 transcription by deletion of SP1RE at −209 and −430 suggests that the ERβ likely interacts with SP1 bound to these SP1REs. E2-ER action through interaction with SP1-SP1RE complexes has been reported to occur in several different genes and shown not to involve direct ER binding to SP1RE (26Rishi A.K. Shao Z.M.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1546-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Instead, ER appears to bind to SP1 and enhance SP1 binding to SP1REs.Sequence analysis and activity assays of the mNELL2 promoter revealed that the promoter contains neither a functional TATA box nor a CAAT box. Instead, the NELL2 promoter appears to be GC-rich, a feature shared with other GC-rich promoters that contain several SP1REs and multiple TSSs spread over a large region (32Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The majority of the genes lacking a TATA box exhibit multiple TSSs, which is a typical feature of housekeeping genes (33Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar) that also contain SP1REs upstream from the TSSs (34Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, some members of this class do not have housekeeping functions but instead appear to be involved in regulation of growth and differentiation, such as the genes encoding c-Ki-ras (35Hoffman E.K. Trusko S.P. Freeman N. George D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the EGF receptor (36Ishii S. Xu Y.H. Stratton R.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4920-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and nerve growth factor receptor (34Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NELL2 is also believed to be involved in regulating proliferation and differentiation processes (5Kim H. Ha C.M. Choi J. Choi E.J. Jeon J. Kim C. Park S.K. Kang S.S. Kim K. Lee B.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Nelson B.R. Claes K. Todd V. Chaverra M. Lefcort F. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 322-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and thus, it may share similar mechanisms of transcriptional control with the aforementioned genes (34Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SP1 may control the accuracy of transcription initiation in TATA-less genes (37Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 38Lu J. Lee W. Jiang C. Keller E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5391-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Seven conserved SP1REs are found upstream from the TSS located at the 5′ end of exon 2 in mNELL2 gene. Despite these features, the mNELL2 promoter also contains putative binding sites for transcriptional regulators such as retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor and progesterone receptor/glucocorticoid receptor, suggesting that it may be subjected to inducible control by factors binding to these sites.Our transcription assays demonstrated that deletion of intron 1 of NELL2 gene resulted in loss of basal promoter activity, suggesting that intron 1 is essential for normal NELL2 transcription. In addition to the promoter region, the intron 1 contains a half-ERE at −223 and several SP1REs. Deletion of these sequences resulted in a decrease of E2-ER-dependent stimulation of NELL2 transcription, supporting the notion that intron 1 is also important for the transcriptional regulation of NELL2 gene by E2. Such an involvement of intronic regions in transcriptional regulation has also been reported for several other genes, including those encoding apolipoprotein B (40Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7848-7859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), renin (41Voigtländer T. Ganten D. Bader M. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 303-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and vasopressin V1b receptor (42Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).E2 is an important steroid hormone that exhibits multiple effects on various tissues including the nervous system. E2 exerts neuroprotective action in various model systems where it reduces neuronal damage caused by serum deprivation (43Bishop J. Simpkins J.W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 44Green P.S. Bishop J. Simpkins J.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 511-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), β-amyloid treatment (45Fitzpatrick J.L. Mize A.L. Wade C.B. Harris J.A. Shapiro R.A. Dorsa D.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 46Behl C. Widmann M. Trapp T. Holsboer F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and exposure to glutamate (46Behl C. Widmann M. Trapp T. Holsboer F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the present study we found that E2 protects HiB5 cells against toxicity induced by AMPA and Aβ peptide. Earlier studies suggested that the neuroprotection exerted by E2 may be mediated by rapid intracellular signaling events in addition to ERE-mediated transcriptional regulation (for review, see Ref. 11Garcia-Segura L.M. Azcoitia I. DonCarlos L.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 63: 29-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar and 29Toran-Allerand C.D. Singh M. Sétáló Jr., G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 97-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For example, activation of the MAPK pathway is necessary for E2 to exert its neuroprotective effects, because blockade of this pathway with a mitogen/extracellular-signal regulated kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1) inhibitor prevented E2-dependent neuroprotection (48Mize A.L. Shapiro R.A. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). MAPK activation was induced by E2 even in cells transfected with a mutated ERα lacking the ability to mediate ERE-dependent transcription, suggesting that MAPK-mediated neuroprotective action of E2 does not require E2-ER-dependent transcription (48Mize A.L. Shapiro R.A. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Aihara et al. (8Aihara K. Kuroda S. Kanayama N. Matsuyama S. Tanizawa K. Horie M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported that recombinant rat NELL2 promoted survival of primary cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons via the MAPK-dependent pathway. These authors found that NELL2-induced neuronal survival is partly due to inactivation of ERK and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In the present study, however, a decreased availability of NELL2 by siRNA induced a decrease of ERK phosphorylation and increase of Bax expression and, in turn, resulted in an increase of apoptosis. Discrepancy between the two studies may be due to differences of cells and treatments.In this study we showed that E2-ERs activate NELL2 transcription and that NELL2 promotes neuroprogenitor HiB5 cell survival. Therefore, E2-induced survival of HiB5 cells may be at least in part mediated by ER-mediated trans-activation of NELL2. E2 is involved in phosphorylation of ERK through membrane receptors (11Garcia-Segura L.M. Azcoitia I. DonCarlos L.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 63: 29-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 29Toran-Allerand C.D. Singh M. Sétáló Jr., G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 97-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and ERK signaling induces a decrease of Bax expression (for review, see Ref. 49McCubrey J.A. Steelman L.S. Chappell W.H. Abrams S.L. Wong E.W. Chang F. Lehmann B. Terrian D.M. Milella M. Tafuri A. Stivala F. Libra M. Basecke J. Evangelisti C. Martelli A.M. Franklin R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1263-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Thus, our results, showing that NELL2 siRNA induced changes in ERK phosphorylation and Bax expression in the presence of E2 suggest that NELL2 may partly be also responsible to the non-genomic E2 action on ERK and Bax signaling for cell survival.Because NELL2 is a released protein (3Kuroda S. Tanizawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and a larger portion of NELL2 was found in the culture medium than in cellular extracts of HiB5 cells overexpressing NELL2 (6Jeong J.K. Ryu B.J. Choi J. Kim D.H. Choi E.J. Park J.W. Park J.J. Lee B.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it seems plausible that the survival promoting effect of transfected NELL2 in HiB5 cells might require a paracrine effect of NELL2 released to the culture medium. Whether NELL2 is recognized by a specific receptor is not known.The survival effect of E2 was inhibited not only by siRNA-mediated blockade of NELL2 synthesis but also by NELL2 mutants lacking EGF-like domains, suggesting that these domains are required for the survival effect of E2. It also appears that NELL2 mutants lacking EGF-like domains act as antagonists of NELL2, although the mechanism underlying this effect is not known.In summary, our results indicate that the NELL2 gene is trans-activated by E2 and that NELL2 mediates the survival promoting effect of E2 on HiB5 neuroprogenitor cells. The detailed cellular mechanism underlying this effect remains to be further identified.

NELL2 has a greater sequence similarity to chicken NEL than NELL1 and is strongly expressed in mammalian brain in an apparent neuron-specific manner (3Kuroda S. Tanizawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kanayama N. Matsuyama S. Tanizawa K. Horie M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).NELL2 is also involved in promoting the neuronal survival required for the formation of a sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) in male rats (6Jeong J.K. Ryu B.J. Choi J. Kim D.H. Choi E.J. Park J.W. Park J.J. Lee B.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The volume of the SDN-POA in male rats is much larger than females (for review, see Ref. 9Gorski R.A. J. Anim. Sci. 1985; 61: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This has been known to result from the actions of estrogen (E2) on cells of the male SDN-POA (9Gorski R.A. J. Anim. Sci. 1985; 61: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). E2 exerts multiple effects on developmental processes taking place in the mammalian central nervous system, such as neurogenesis, survival, and differentiation of different neuronal populations (for review, see Ref. 10McCarthy M.M.

https://openalex.org/W2092769125,"HIV-1 enters cells via interaction between the trimeric envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120/gp41 and the host cell surface receptor molecule CD4. The requirement of CD4 for viral entry has rationalized the development of recombinant CD4-based proteins as competitive viral attachment inhibitors and immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we describe a novel recombinant CD4 protein designed to bind gp120 through a targeted disulfide-exchange mechanism. According to structural models of the gp120-CD4 receptor complex, substitution of Ser(60) on the CD4 domain 1 alpha-helix with Cys positions a thiol in proximity of the gp120 V1/V2 loop disulfide (Cys(126)-Cys(196)), satisfying the stereochemical and geometric conditions for redox exchange between CD4 Cys(60) and gp120 Cys(126), and the consequent formation of an interchain disulfide bond. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for this effect by describing the expression, purification, refolding, receptor binding and antiviral activity analysis of a recombinant two-domain CD4 variant containing the S60C mutation (2dCD4-S60C). We show that 2dCD4-S60C binds HIV-1 gp120 with a significantly higher affinity than wild-type protein under conditions that facilitate disulfide exchange and that this translates into a corresponding increase in the efficacy of CD4-mediated viral entry inhibition. We propose that targeted redox exchange between conserved gp120 disulfides and nucleophilic moieties positioned strategically on CD4 (or CD4-like scaffolds) conceptualizes a new strategy in the development of high affinity HIV-1 Env ligands, with important implications for therapy and vaccine development. More generally, this chalcogen substitution approach provides a general means of stabilizing receptor-ligand complexes where the structural and biophysical conditions for disulfide exchange are satisfied."
https://openalex.org/W1976067534,"Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules are cell surface glycoproteins that present extracellular antigens to CD4(+) T cells and are essential for initiation of the adaptive immune response. MHC class II expression requires recruitment of a master regulator, the class II transactivator (CIITA), to the MHC class II promoter. Post-translational modifications to CIITA play important roles in modulating CIITA mediated transcription of various genes in different cell types. We have previously linked regulation of CIITA to the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS), and we and others have demonstrated that mono-ubiquitination of CIITA dramatically increases its transactivity whereas poly-ubiquitination leads to CIITA degradation. Here we identify three degron proximal lysine residues, Lys-315, Lys-330, and Lys-333, and a phosphorylation site, Ser-280, located within the CIITA degron, that regulate CIITA ubiquitination, stability, and MHC class II expression. Together, these findings contribute to the developing post-translational modification code for CIITA."
https://openalex.org/W2070971763,"Evidence was presented that thyrotropin [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)]-stimulated persistent cAMP signaling is dependent on receptor (with G-protein α subunits and adenylyl cyclase) internalization. Because it is not clear whether G proteins and adenylyl cyclase internalize with receptors, we tested whether persistent cAMP signaling by TSH receptor (TSHR) is dependent on internalization. We measured persistent TSHR signaling as an accumulation of cAMP in HEK-EM293 cells permanently expressing human TSHRs incubated with isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min after washing the cells to remove unbound TSH, and TSHR internalization by fluorescence microscopy using Alexa-tagged TSH and binding assays using (125)I-TSH. TSHRs, but not the closely related lutropin or follitropin receptors, exhibit persistent cAMP signaling. TSHRs were not internalized by 30 min incubation with unlabeled TSH; however, expression of β-arrestin-2 promoted TSHR internalization that was inhibited by dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor. Expression of β-arrestin-2 had no effect on TSHR cAMP signaling, dynasore inhibited TSHR cAMP signaling in the absence or presence of TSHR internalization, and expression of a dominant-negative mutant dynamin, which inhibited internalization, had no effect on persistent cAMP signaling. Persistent cAMP signaling was specifically inhibited by a small molecule TSHR antagonist. We conclude that TSHRs do not have to be internalized to exhibit persistent cAMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2118489324,"A series of surveys were carried out to characterize the physical and biological parameters of the Millennium Atoll lagoon during a research expedition in April of 2009. Millennium is a remote coral atoll in the Central Pacific belonging to the Republic of Kiribati, and a member of the Southern Line Islands chain. The atoll is among the few remaining coral reef ecosystems that are relatively pristine. The lagoon is highly enclosed, and was characterized by reticulate patch and line reefs throughout the center of the lagoon as well as perimeter reefs around the rim of the atoll. The depth reached a maximum of 33.3 m in the central region of the lagoon, and averaged between 8.8 and 13.7 m in most of the pools. The deepest areas were found to harbor large platforms of Favia matthaii, which presumably provided a base upon which the dominant corals (Acropora spp.) grew to form the reticulate reef structure. The benthic algal communities consisted mainly of crustose coralline algae (CCA), microfilamentous turf algae and isolated patches of Halimeda spp. and Caulerpa spp. Fish species richness in the lagoon was half of that observed on the adjacent fore reef. The lagoon is likely an important nursery habitat for a number of important fisheries species including the blacktip reef shark and Napoleon wrasse, which are heavily exploited elsewhere around the world but were common in the lagoon at Millennium. The lagoon also supports an abundance of giant clams (Tridacna maxima). Millennium lagoon provides an excellent reference of a relatively undisturbed coral atoll. As with most coral reefs around the world, the lagoon communities of Millennium may be threatened by climate change and associated warming, acidification and sea level rise, as well as sporadic local resource exploitation which is difficult to monitor and enforce because of the atoll's remote location. While the remote nature of Millennium has allowed it to remain one of the few nearly pristine coral reef ecosystems in the world, it is imperative that this ecosystem receives protection so that it may survive for future generations."
https://openalex.org/W2013212087,"The squash aspartic acid proteinase inhibitor (SQAPI), a proteinaceous proteinase inhibitor from squash, is an effective inhibitor of a range of aspartic proteinases. Proteinaceous aspartic proteinase inhibitors are rare in nature. The only other example in plants probably evolved from a precursor serine proteinase inhibitor. Earlier work based on sequence homology modeling suggested SQAPI evolved from an ancestral cystatin. In this work, we determined the solution structure of SQAPI using NMR and show that SQAPI shares the same fold as a plant cystatin. The structure is characterized by a four-strand anti-parallel beta-sheet gripping an alpha-helix in an analogous manner to fingers of a hand gripping a tennis racquet. Truncation and site-specific mutagenesis revealed that the unstructured N terminus and the loop connecting beta-strands 1 and 2 are important for pepsin inhibition, but the loop connecting strands 3 and 4 is not. Using ambiguous restraints based on the mutagenesis results, SQAPI was then docked computationally to pepsin. The resulting model places the N-terminal strand of SQAPI in the S' side of the substrate binding cleft, whereas the first SQAPI loop binds on the S side of the cleft. The backbone of SQAPI does not interact with the pepsin catalytic Asp(32)-Asp(215) diad, thus avoiding cleavage. The data show that SQAPI does share homologous structural elements with cystatin and appears to retain a similar protease inhibitory mechanism despite its different target. This strongly supports our hypothesis that SQAPI evolved from an ancestral cystatin."
https://openalex.org/W2084926664,"In eukaryotic cells a surveillance mechanism, the S phase checkpoint, detects and responds to DNA damage and replication stress, protecting DNA replication and arresting cell cycle progression. We show here that the S phase cyclins Clb5 and Clb6 are regulated in response to genotoxic stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Clb5 and Clb6 are responsible for the activation of the specific Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase activity that drives the onset and progression of the S phase. Intriguingly, Clb5 and Clb6 are regulated by different mechanisms. Thus, the presence of Clb6, which is eliminated early in an unperturbed S phase, is stabilized when replication is compromised by replication stress or DNA damage. Such stabilization depends on the checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53. The stabilization of Clb6 levels is a dynamic process that requires continued de novo protein synthesis, because the cyclin remains subject to degradation. It also requires the activity of the G(1) transcription factor Mlu1 cell cycle box-binding factor (MBF) in the S phase, whereas Dun1, the checkpoint kinase characteristically responsible for the transcriptional response to genotoxic stress, is dispensable in this case. On the other hand, two subpopulations of endogenous Clb5 can be distinguished according to turnover in an unperturbed S phase. In the presence of replication stress, the unstable Clb5 pool is stabilized, and such stabilization requires neither MBF transcriptional activity nor de novo protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029226831,"We have previously established that the anti-cancer lysophospholipid edelfosine (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Et-18-OCH(3)) induces cell death in yeast by selective modification of lipid raft composition at the plasma membrane. In this study we determined that alpha-tocopherol protects cells from the edelfosine cytotoxic effect, preventing the internalization of sterols and the plasma membrane proton pump ATPase, Pma1p. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were considered to explain the protective effect of alpha-tocopherol: (i) its classical antioxidant activity is necessary to break progression of lipid peroxidation, despite the fact Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not possess polyunsaturated fatty acids and (ii) due to its complementary cone shape, insertion of alpha-tocopherol could correct membrane curvature stress imposed by edelfosine (inverted cone shape). We then developed tools to distinguish between these two hypotheses and dissect the structural requirements that confer alpha-tocopherol its protective effect. Our results indicated its lipophilic nature and the H donating hydroxyl group from the chromanol ring are both required to counteract the cytotoxic effect of edelfosine, suggesting edelfosine induces oxidation of membrane components. To further support this finding and learn more about the early cellular response to edelfosine we investigated the role that known oxidative stress signaling pathways play in modulating sensitivity to the lipid drug. Our results indicate the transcription factors Yap1 and Skn7 as well as the major peroxiredoxin, Tsa1, mediate a response to edelfosine. Interestingly, the pathway differed from the one triggered by hydrogen peroxide and its activation (measured as Yap1 translocation to the nucleus) was abolished by co-treatment of the cells with alpha-tocopherol."
https://openalex.org/W2093065138,"The intrinsic oncolytic specificity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is currently being exploited to develop alternative therapeutic strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Identifying key regulators in diverse transduction pathways that define VSV oncolysis in cancer cells represents a fundamental prerequisite to engineering more effective oncolytic viral vectors and adjusting combination therapies. After having identified defects in the signalling cascade of type I interferon induction, responsible for attenuated antiviral responses in human HCC cell lines, we have now investigated the role of cell proliferation and translation initiation. Cell cycle progression and translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF2Bε have been recently identified as key regulators of VSV permissiveness in T-lymphocytes and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively. Here, we show that in HCC, decrease of cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibitors or siRNA-mediated reduction of G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase activities (CDK4) or cyclin D1 protein expression, do not significantly alter viral growth. Additionally, we demonstrate that translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF2Bε are negligible in sustaining VSV replication in HCC. Taken together, these results indicate that cellular proliferation and the initiation phase of cellular protein synthesis are not essential for successful VSV oncolysis of HCC. Moreover, our observations indicate the importance of cell-type specificity for VSV oncolysis, an important aspect to be considered in virotherapy applications in the future."
