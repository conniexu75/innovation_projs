https://openalex.org/W2059040088,"ANIMAL tissue contains a fibrinolytic activator (fibrinokinase) which cannot be brought into aqueous solution by the usual procedures for extracting biologically active substances1. This observation was confirmed by Tagnon2 and by Lewis and Ferguson3, who found that the microsome fraction of the disintegrated tissue was particularly active."

https://openalex.org/W1986125962,Macfarlane and Biggs1 have reported on fibrinolytic enzymes in extracts of human tissues. The recent isolation of a soluble fibrinolytic activator from washed and dehydrated pig heart tissue2 suggested a re-investigation of the fibrinolytic activity of such tissue extracts.
https://openalex.org/W2080918894,"CHLAMYDOSPORE formation and their numbers have been found to vary between species in the genus Fusarium and have been widely used in systematic nomenclature as a key character1,2. Nevertheless, no positive evidence has so far been adduced on the causes inducing the formation of this morphological structure, although it is generally presumed to be the result of unfavourable growth conditions. Control of soil-borne infection of various crop plants has been achieved by the addition of specific antibiotics3 or by suspensions of soil bacteria and their toxins4–6. These observations, together with the more recent discovery7 of plants absorbing antibiotics produced by soil micro-organisms, suggested the probability of this factor stimulating chlamydospore formation in Fusarium mycelia."

https://openalex.org/W2077526979,"EARLY workers, who studied the fate of sodium-24 administered to animals, showed that the isotope exchanged with the sodium of the tissues1. They assumed that all the body sodium participated in this exchange. That this assumption is incorrect was suggested by recent results obtained with dogs2 and humans3–5, in which 20–35 per cent of the body sodium was estimated to be non-exchangeable with plasma sodium-24."

https://openalex.org/W2086424699,"FLAVIN-ADENINE-DINUCLEOTIDE (FAD) is the coenzyme of a number of flavoprotein enzymes functioning as oxidation-reduction catalysts in biological systems. Isolated in 1938 by Warburg and Christian1, it was assigned a probable structure (I) on the basis of available degradative evidence, although its preparation in a pure state has probably been rarely accomplished since its original isolation. Flavin-adenine-dinucleotide is structurally related to several other equally complex coenzymes (for example, coenzymes I and II, uridine-diphosphate-glucose and coenzyme A) in that all of them appear to be diesters of pyrophosphoric acid, in which one ester group embraces a pyrimidine or purine nucleoside residue, and indeed the members of the group are usually described loosely as nucleotide coenzymes. No chemical synthesis of any of these coenzymes has hitherto been achieved, although both flavin-adenine-dinucleotide and coenzyme-I have been prepared by enzymic reactions2."
https://openalex.org/W1982367049,"INVESTIGATIONS on alkaloids of Veratrum viride necessitated the preparation of a pure specimen of protoveratrine and prompted an examination of the alkaloids which could be isolated from commercial samples of Veratrum album. As a result of these studies, we now report the isolation of two new hypotensive ester alkaloids which have been named ‘germitetrine’ and ‘veratetrine’."

https://openalex.org/W1989095507,"Bear and Cannan have reported1 new experiments with muscle exhibiting the so-called Lotmar–Picken2 X-ray pattern. We, too, recently founds a muscle (in our case a Mytilus adductor) which gave the pattern, and we have repeated their observation that after extraction with water it gave only the normal α-pattern characteristic of myosin. In addition, our specimen gave a number of new reflexions in the form of almost continuous circles, distinguished from the Lotmar–Picken reflexions in showing scarcely any orientation and in having a more grainy texture; these reflexions, too, disappeared on extraction with water. We attribute them to a new substance which we provisionally call ‘X’ An analysis of the diffraction pattern on these lines is given in the first three columns of the accompanying table."

https://openalex.org/W2017667749,"Murray and Clark1 have shown that, if red cells are heated to 50° C., substances can be obtained from the surrounding fluid which, even if derived from Rh-negative red cells, can give rise to anti-D agglutinins when injected into guinea pigs. Temperatures in the neighbourhood of 50°–56° produce extensive modifications of the human red-cell surface, namely, fragmentation, development of myelin forms, and, at the higher temperatures, haemolysis2. It is therefore likely that the substances found by Murray and Clark in the fluid surrounding the heated cells are the products of the fragmentation phenomena and the changes in the red-cell surface which accompany them."

https://openalex.org/W1977367698,"THAT cortisone is able to suppress the inflammatory reaction irrespective of the nature of the causative agent is now a generally accepted fact. The site at which it is able to exert this effect remains uncertain; but it has recently been shown that cortisone can prevent or nullify an increase in capillary permeability1, and that its administration is associated with an increase of arteriolar tone2. The latter authors consider that these two vascular effects are the most significant factors in the modification of the inflammatory processes."

https://openalex.org/W1993409788,"RECENT investigations1 of the behaviour of the Dische reagent2 towards various deoxysugars and their glycosides have revealed that a coloration is obtained with a number of such compounds, and that the reagent cannot be regarded as specific for 2-deoxy-ribose. Colorimetric evidence based on the Disehe test thus does not preclude the occurrence of deoxysugars other than 2-deoxy ribose3 in the deoxy-pentose nucleic acid structure. As an extension to the investigations on the known 2-deoxyribose4 and 3-deoxyribose5 (otherwise known as 3-deoxyxylose), we have synthesized 4-deoxy-L-ribose, with a view to its characterization and the study of its behaviour towards colorimetric reagents."
