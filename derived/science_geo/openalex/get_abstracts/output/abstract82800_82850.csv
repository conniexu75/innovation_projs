https://openalex.org/W1548966243,"Membranes may be prepared from A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells which have the ability to bind 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) in a specific manner and which, in the presence of EGF, catalyze the phosphorylation of a number of endogenous membrane proteins. The activation of the membrane associated protein kinase by EGF appears to be a reversible phenomenon. The membrane preparation may be solubilized by a number of nonionic detergents with the retention of both 125I-labeled EGF-binding activity and EGF-enhanced phosphorylation of specific membrane proteins. The solubilized membrane preparation may be purified by affinity chromatography using EGF covalently linked to Affi-Gel. The purified preparation retains both EGF-binding activity and EGF-enhanced phosphorylation activity. Analysis of the affinity-purified preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis indicates the presence of one major protein band of molecular weight 150,000 and several trace bands. The evidence suggests that the major 150,000 protein band is the receptor for EGF and is a substrate of the phosphorylation reaction. The co-purification of EGF-binding activity and EGF-stimulated phosphorylation activity suggests an inherent close relationship."

https://openalex.org/W2043040755,"Naloxazone, a hydrazone derivative of the opiate antagonist naloxone, has a high affinity for opiate receptor binding sites. Naloxazone injections reduce opiate receptor binding to extensively washed mouse brain membranes for more than 24 hours, suggesting that the effect is irreversible. High-affinity binding sites are abolished by this treatment, whereas low-affinity sites are unaffected. Naloxazone treatment blocks the analgesic effects of morphine for at least 24 hours but does not prevent death from high doses of morphine. Thus analgesic but nonlethal opiate effects may be mediated by the high-affinity subpopulation of opiate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1508115748,"We have investigated the covalent binding of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) to cytochrome c oxidase in relation to its inhibition of ferrocytochrome c-induced H+ translocation by the enzyme reconstituted in lipid vesicles. DCCD bound to the reconstituted oxidase in a time- and concentration-dependent manner which appeared to correlate with its inhibition of H+ translocation. In both reconstituted vesicles and intact beef heart mitochondria, the DCCD-binding site was located in subunit III of the oxidase. The apolar nature of DCCD and relatively minor effects of the hydrophilic carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, on H+ translocation by the oxidase indicate that the site of action of DCCD is hydrophobic. DCCD also bound to isolated cytochrome c oxidase, though in this case subunits III and IV were labeled. The maximal overall stoichiometries of DCCD molecules bound per cytochrome c oxidase molecule were 1 and 1.6 for the reconstituted and isolated enzymes, respectively. These findings point to subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase having an important role in H+ translocation by the enzyme and indicate that DCCD may prove a useful tool in elucidating the mechanism of H+ pumping."
https://openalex.org/W1485040905,"The specificity of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was examined using two series of dodecapeptides as substrates. One series consisted of peptides of the general sequence (Gly)x-Arg-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in which x + y = 6. The other series consisted of peptides of the sequence (Gly)x-Lys-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in which x + y was again equal to 6. The peptides Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly and Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly were also examined. In the series in which the adjacent arginines were located various distances from the serine, the substrate for which the enzyme clearly exhibited optimal kinetic constants contained one amino acid residue between the basic residues and serine. Direct binding studies of N alpha-[3H]acetyl peptides to catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase revealed a correlation between binding affinity and the ability to serve as substrate for the enzyme. In the second series in which the adjacent basic amino acids were Lys-Arg, optimal kinetic constants were again obtained when these residues were separated from serine by a single amino acid. This latter result was surprising in view of phosphorylation site sequences in the known physiologically significant protein substrates for the kinase, since those containing Lys-Arg all contain two amino acids between these residues and serine."

https://openalex.org/W2094278552,"Amphibians of the family Bufonidae contain high levels of skin compounds that both inhibit Na+- and K+-dependent adenosinetriphosphatase and antagonize the binding of ouabain to the enzyme. In species of Bufo and Atelopus, these compounds are relatively nonpolar bufodienolides, whereas Dendrophryniscus and Melanophryniscus contain more polar compounds of unknown structure. Skin extracts from 30 of 48 species of frogs representing an additional eight families contained relatively low levels of compounds that inhibit binding of ouabain to Na+,K+-adenosinetriphosphatase. The widespread occurrence of low levels of inhibitory compounds is consonant with a role for these compounds as physiological regulators of Na+,K+-adenosinetriphosphatase in amphibian skin; high levels in the Bufonidae probably also serve as a defense against some predators."

Chloroquine has also been shown to cause phospho~pid storage in animal tissues. In a previous study of drug-induced lipidosis in rat liver, we found that the lysosomal fraction is the intracelhrlar site of the stored phospholipid and that it contains most of tbe ehloroquine or 4,4’-bis(diethylaminoethoxyh@diethyldiphenylethane (Matsuzawa, Y., aud Hostetler, K.

In this paper, we have examined the effect of these cationic ampbiphilic agents on a soluble delipidated preparation from rat liver lysosomes which contains phospholipase A and C activity. Our data show that &loroquine and 4,4’-bis(~ethyl~inoetho~)a,~-~ethyldiphenylethane are potent inhibitors of lysosomal phospbo~pase A and C activities. However, these agents do not cause substantial iuhibition of the lysosomal phospholipase A wbieh catalyzes the trausaeylation step in the synthesis of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a lysosomal marker lipid which is greatly increased in this drug-induced phosphoiipidosis. The inhibition of lysosomal phospholipases A and C is reversible siuce full activity can be restored by dialysis or desalting. The mechanism of iuhibition of lysosomal phospholipases A and C by these drugs is as yet unknown and will require purification of the respective enzymes. However, our experiments clearly demonstrate direct inhibition of iysosomal phospholipases A and C chloroquine and 4,4’-bis(~ethyl~noethoxy)a,#&diethyldiphenylethane and suggest that it may be a major factor in the biochemical pathogenesis of drug-induced phospholipidosis."

The ESR spectrum of the radical adduct indicates that a carbon-centered arachidonic acid free radical has been observed. The formation of this species is inhibited by indomethacin, but not by phenol, and it is probably the first intermediate formed during the prostaglandin synthetase-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonic acid. The chemical identity of the trapped radical was substantiated with an independent synthesis of a closely related radical adduct."
https://openalex.org/W1503554756,"In order to examine the mechanism of the acute response of ureagenesis to amino acid loads, rats were injected intraperitoneally with various doses of a mixture of 20 amino acids. Blood ammonia rose only slightly with doses of 0.5 to 2.0 g/kg, but increased sharply at doses of 3 to 5 g/kg. Carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (EC 2.7.2.5) activity, assayed in intact mitochondria isolated from livers removed 15 min after injection of amino acids, with N-acetylglutamate at its endogenous levels, rose up to 5-fold with increasing doses up to 2 g/kg; no further activation occurred with larger doses. This maximal activity was the same as the activity measured in disrupted mitochondria. Hepatic levels of glutamate and N-acetylglutamate increased approximately linearly with dose of amino acids. The time course of these changes following a dose of 1.5 g/kg was studied. Glutamate, N-acetylglutamate, and carbamyl phosphate synthetase I activity all peaked 5 to 15 min after injection. All of these results were virtually unaltered by omission of arginine from the injected mixture, indicating that the increase in N-acetylglutamate was not attributable to activation by arginine of N-acetylglutamate synthetase. These results indicate that moderate loads of amino acids activate unreagenesis via a rapid increase in N-acetylglutamate levels, secondary to increased mitochondrial glutamate, and independently of injected arginine. This autoregulatory mechanism becomes saturated at large doses of amino acids, and hyperammonemia then supervenes."
https://openalex.org/W1519926076,"The binding of labeled hyaluronate to the surface of Simian virus 40-transformed 3T3 cells was studied as a function of 1) pH, 2) ionic strength, 3) temperature, and 4) molecular weight of the hyaluronate. Binding occurred over a wide range of pH values with optima at pH 7 and at less than pH 4. Binding at low pH was eliminated at high ionic strength whereas that at physiological pH was enhanced, with a maximum at 0.5 M NaCl. The enhancement of binding at pH 7 was reversible and independent of the particular salt used. Scatchard plot analysis showed that increasing the ionic strength resulted in both a decrease in the dissociation constant (Kd) and an increase in the amount bound at saturation (Bmax). Temperature also influenced the binding of hyaluronate to the cell surface. The amount bound at low temperatures (0 degrees C) was 3 to 5 times that bound at high temperatures (40 degrees C) with a sharp transition occurring at 18 degrees C, the temperature of phase transition of the plasma membrane. The temperature effect was primarily a change in the Bmax and was reversible. Finally the molecular weight of the ligand influenced the binding. High molecular weight preparations of hyaluronate had a higher binding affinity (lower Kd) and a lower Bmax than did smaller molecular weight preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1587133637,"The kinetic properties of human placental adenosine kinase, purified 3600-fold, were studied. The reaction velocity had an absolute requirement for magnesium and varied with the pH. Maximal activity was observed at pH 6.5 with a Mg2+:ATP ranging from 1:1 to 2:1. High concentrations of Mg2+ or free ATP were inhibitory. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity studies yielded intersecting lines for both adenosine and MgATP2-. The Michaelis constant was 0.4 micro M for adenosine and 75 micro M for MgATP2-. Inhibition by adenosine was observed at concentrations greater than 2.5 micro M. AMP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to adenosine and a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. ADP was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to adenosine and ATP. Hyperbolic inhibition was observed during noncompetitive inhibition of adenosine kinase by AMP and ADP. Other purine and pyrimidine nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates were poor inhibitors in general. S-Adenosylhomocysteine and 2'-deoxyadenosine inhibited adenosine kinase. The data suggest that (a) MgATP2- is the true substrate of adenosine kinase, and both pH and [Mg2+] may regulate its activity; (b) the kinetic mechanisms of adenosine kinase is Ordered Bi Bi; and (c) adenosine kinase may be regulated by the concentrations of its products, AMP and ADP, but is relatively insensitive to other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W2160121877,"The incorporation of saturated fatty acids into the phospholipids of cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages was shown to lead to reduced endocytic activity (Mahoney, E. M., Hamill, A. L., Scott, W. A., and Cohn, Z. A. (1977)Pmc. Natl. Ad Sei. U. S. A. 74,4895-4899). More detailed analyses concerning the kinetics of fatty acid substitution, lipid composition, membrane bilayer structure, and the fatty acid enrichment of a plasma membrane-derived organelle have now been performed. In these studies, macrophages were cultivated in serumless medium containing 10 pg/ml of fatty acid complexed with bovine serum albumin. Under these conditions, the rate of incorporation of 14C-fatty acid into cell phospholipids was determined to be 8.8 nmol/ h/mg of cell protein during the first 8 to 10 h, after which incorporation into phospholipids ceased. Although the fatty acyl composition of phospholipids was substantially altered, the relative amounts of the phospholipids and the molar cholesterol/phospholipid ratio remained unchanged during this period. Phagolysosomes, derived largely from plasma membrane, were isolated from macrophages labeled with I4C-fatty acid and similar enrichment of this fraction in the activity of the plasma membrane marker 5’-nucleotidase (4.1fold) and in 14C radioactivity (3.7-fold) suggested that the fatty acid supplement was incorporated into plasma membrane. Spin label electron spin resonance studies indicated that the membrane lipid bilayer of macrophages enriched with saturated fatty acids was more rigid than that of control cells. The reversibility of fatty acid enrichment and the concomitant increase in endocytic activity were shown in washout experiments. The cultivation of 14C-fatty acid-enriched macrophages in serum-containing medium led to the removal of 65% of the radiolabeled fatty acid from cell phospholipids within 24 h and was accompanied by a 123% increase in pinocytic activity. These results suggested that an increased content of saturated fatty acid in plasma membrane phospholipids leads to both reduced bilayer fluidity and reduced ability of the cell to interiorize plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1863846574,"The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of chloroperoxidase, a heme protein isolated from the mold Caldariomyces fumago, and its complexes with a variety of substrates and inhibitors have been investigated. At liquid helium temperatures, the EPR spectrum of native chloroperoxidase prepared at pH 1.5 is essentially that of high spin ferric heme iron, while frozen solutions of the enzyme at pH 5 exhibit a low spin spectrum. At pH 3.0, both the high and low spin forms of chloroperoxidase are observed. These results indicate that chloroperoxidase exists as a pH-dependent equilibrium mixture of high and low spin forms at low temperature, and that increasing the pH above 1.5 causes a pH-dependent spin transition from a high spin form having g values of 7.64,4.29, and 1.78 to a low spin form having g values near 2.61, 2.26, and 1.83. The binding of such ligands as Br-, I-, and F- to the enzyme results in a shift in the equilibrium that favors the high spin form while the addition of such ligands as cyanide, azide, imidazole, and 2-mercaptoethanol shifts the equilibrium almost completely towards low spin forms. The addition of chloride has no major effect on the high spin-low spin equilibrium. Analysis of the EPR spectrum for the high spin form of native chloroperoxidase shows that it exhibits an extremely large rhombic distortion (-20%). The addition of such ligands as F-, C1-, Br-, and I- not only alters the high spin-low spin equilibrium but also alters the rhombicity, indicating that the binding of halide ligands to the enzyme perturbs the symmetry of the heme as well. An analysis of the EPR spectrum of the low spin forms of chloroperoxidase indicates that the electronic environment of the heme iron bears closer resemblance to cytochrome P-450 than to various nitrogen-, oxygen-, and carbon-ligated low spin forms of myoglobin, hemoglobin, or horseradish peroxidase. However, the electronic environment of"

With the use of intervent dilution chromatography followed by sequential DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose column chromatography, the virus-associated enzyme has been isolated and purified 300-fold. The partially purified EBV DNA polymerase activity could be distinguished from cellular polymerases by its activation with salt and its degree of sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and phosphonoacetic acid. The enzyme showed maximum activity for copying activated calf thymus DNA in the presence of 100 mM ammonium sulfate. In the absence of salt, the enzyme utilized with high efficiency deoxyoligomer-homopolymer templates, but failed to copy poly(rA) . oligo(dT)10 and oligo(dT)10, showing that the enzyme had properties distinct from DNA polymerase gamma, reverse transcriptase, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W1533422152,"The intrinsic isotope effect on the reduction of the FAD-containing dehydrogenase electron transferase, adrenodoxin reductase, by (4S)-[2H]NADPH has been determined to be 7.1 to 7.7. The replacement of FAD by a series of FAD analogs at the active site of adrenodoxin reductase with oxidation-reduction potentials which vary over a range of 212 mV has made it possible to extrapolate to this limiting value from the variation in the observed isotope effect on Vmax with flavin midpoint potential. Stop-flow studies which allow the direct determination of the intrinsic isotope effect on the reductive half-reaction corroborate this result. During the steady state reduction of ferricyanide by the native enzyme under conditions of Vmax, this isotope effect is almost fully expressed (VH/VD = 6.7 to 6.8). In contrast, we observe a dramatic attenuation of the intrinsic isotope effect (due to hydride transfer to flavin) when the oxidative half-reaction is mediated by the natural acceptor protein, the 2Fe/2S ferredoxin, adrenodoxin. In a coupled three-protein system, the adrenodoxin-mediated reductions of both the artificial electron acceptor, cytochrome c, and the physiological electron acceptor, cytochrome P-450scc, by adrenodoxin reductase occur at similar rates and with similar kinetic isotope effects (1.9 to 2.0) when (4S)-[2H]NADPH is the reductant. We infer similar mechanisms for the reduction of both cytochromes. These results are in agreement with previous studies (Lambeth, J.D., and Kamin, H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2766-2774) which show that the reductive half-reaction is not solely rate-determining in adrenodoxin-mediated processes. The observation of a linear free energy relationship between Vmax and the flavin midpoint potential during steady state reduction of ferricyanide confirms that the reductive half-reaction is rate-determining in this assay. The relationship between Vmax and flavin midpoint potential in reactions which require adrenodoxin suggests that the midpoint potential of native adrenodoxin reductase has been optimized. Thus, the apoenzyme of adrenodoxin reductase tailors the midpoint potential of bound FAD in order to balance the activation energies of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions."
https://openalex.org/W28855093,"The functional domains of the regulatory subunit of isozyme II of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were studied. It was shown using Edman degradation that the regulatory subunit contained a phosphorylated residue which was very close in primary sequence to the site most sensitive to hydrolysis by low trypsin concentrations as postulated previously (Corbin, J.D., Sugden, P.H., West, L., Flockhart, D.A., Lincoln, T.M., and McCarthy, D. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 3997-4003). Catalytic subunit incorporated 0.9 mol of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into a preparation of regulatory subunit that contained 1.1 mol of endogenous phosphate. After phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit, the regulatory subunit contained 2.2 mol of chemical phosphate. The effects of heat denaturation upon the rate and extent of phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit were compared with the effects of these treatments upon the cAMP binding and inhibitory domains. These data suggested that the regulatory subunit required factors in addition to an intact phosphorylatable primary sequence in order for inhibitory activity to be expressed. Such factors might be part of the secondary or tertiary structure of the protein. These studies are discussed with respect to the mechanism of inhibition of catalytic activity, and a model of the regulatory subunit structure is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1546768697,"Linear simian virus 40 DNA has been transcribed in vitro with wheat germ RNA polymerase II. Transcription products have been fractionated on polyacrylamide gels and several discrete sized RNA bands are seen. The RNA band pattern is affected dramatically by deoxyribonuclease treatment during RNA isolation. This is because most of the RNA synthesized is covalently linked to DNA. This linkage has been demonstrated by density analysis in formaldehyde-CsCl gradients and by incorporation of alkali-stable ribonucleotides into DNA. The linear DNA templates transcribed were generated by treatment of circular DNA with restriction enzymes which, in addition to cutting once at a single primary site, were found also to produce single strand nicks at specific secondary sites. The discrete sized RNA bands observed result from initiation at these nicks and terminated at DNA ends. There are two modes of nick-dependent initiation. In one mode the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of the DNA at a single strand nick serves as a primer for the extension of an RNA chain. In a second mode de novo initiation of an RNA chain is promoted at the nick. RNAs which are not primed initiate predominantly with GTP. The catalytic action of wheat germ RNA polymerase II is similar to that of Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase which has also been shown to synthesize primarily RNA which is covalently linked to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1513226140,"Choleragen-dependent ADP ribosylation of soluble proteins from bovine thymus, using [32P]NAD as substrate, was increased 3- to 4-fold by GTP. The effect was specific for nucleoside triphosphate, with GTP approximately equal to ITP greater than CTP greater than ATP greater than UTP. Half-maximal enhancement was observed with 0.5 mM GTP. The magnitude of the GTP effect decreased with increasing NAD concentration; GTP had no effect on hydrolysis of NAD at low NAD concentrations. Digestion of ADP-ribosylated proteins with snake venom phosphodiesterase yielded primarily 5'-AMP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of soluble proteins from thymus after incubation with choleragen and [32P]NAD separated numerous ADP-ribosylated proteins; radioactivity in all bands was increased by nucleoside triphosphate. Choleragen catalyzed the ADP ribosylation of several purified proteins; depending on the protein, GTP either increased, decreased, or had no effect on the extent of ADP ribosylation. Choleragen-dependent ADP ribosylation of a wide variety of proteins is consistent with the possibility that intoxication results in covalent modification of more than one cellular protein and perhaps alters the activity of other enzymes in addition to adenylate cyclase."

Reconstituted beta receptors demonstrate saturable [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding (Bmax = 11.1 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg, K = 77.8 +/- 8.6 pM) and stereospecificity ((-)-propranolol, K = 11.0 nM; (+)-propranolol, K = 2000 nM; (-)-isoproterenol, K = 250 nM; (+)-isoproterenol, K = 82 micro M). Reconstituted beta receptors appear to be incorporated into acceptor membranes as integral proteins. Reconstituted beta receptors cannot be extracted by high salt or pH (3 to 11); detergent is required for resolubilization of reconstituted beta receptors. Adenylate cyclase stimulation was not obtained in reconstituted membranes since acceptor membranes lack a catalytic subunit. However, guanine nucleotide regulation of agonist affinity was observed indicating a functional reconstitution. GTP (100 micro M) produces a 5-fold decrease in the affinity of isoproterenol for reconstituted beta receptors. Experiments with sulfhydryl reagents indicate that the reconstituted beta receptor couples with the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein of the acceptor membranes. These data describe the successful reconstitution of a beta receptor and indicate that the reconstituted beta receptor can interact with the GTP binding protein of human erythrocyte acceptor membranes."

The effect of potassium was not inhibited by 10(-4) M atropine, sodium substitutes, or 10(-5) M tetrodotoxin. Exposure of lobules to elevated concentrations of potassium chloride did not increase the release of tissue lactic dehydrogenase and resulted in the appearance of exocytotic images detected by electron microscopy. The time course and extent of discharge due to 75 mM KCl were similar to those caused by the ionophore A23187 and the secretory effect of both agents depended on extracellular calcium and intracellular energy reserves. Potassium chloride stimulation of 75 mM increased the influx of extracellular calcium by 49%, as measured by net 45Ca uptake. Optimal carbamylcholine chloride or pancreozymin stimulation consistently showed a greater effect on discharge than optimal KCl or A23187 stimulation and the additional effect depended on the ability of these physiological secretagogues to recruit calcium from intracellular sources. Potassium chloride stimulation did not result in cyclic GMP elevations in the presence of atropine and those elevations due to A23187 stimulation were small (21 to 30%) and dissimilar both in character (calcium dependence) and time course compared to those resulting from the physiological secretagogues. These findings allow us to define two interrelated pathways which couple hormonal stimulation and discharge of secretory protein in the exocrine pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1588087226,"The structural organization of a family of repeated DNA sequences in the chicken genome has been determined by hybridization of a cloned repeated DNA sequence to Southern blots of total DNA. The length of the cloned DNA fragment is 3600 nucleotide pairs. This fragment consists principally, if not entirely, of a single repeated DNA sequence occurring only once within the cloned fragment. In the chicken genome, the family of repeated DNA sequences homologous to the cloned sequence has a limited number of alternative forms. Some of the restriction fragments of total DNA to which the cloned sequence hybridizes correspond to those expected from the location of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites within the cloned sequence. There are also a limited number of other genomic restriction fragments, each present in multiple copies, to which the cloned sequence hybridizes but which do not relate in any obvious way to the length of the cloned sequence. These various restriction fragments differ from one another in that they appear to be present in unequal amounts in total DNA, and many of them do not contain the entire cloned sequence. This study provides some new information about the structure of repeated DNA sequences in the chicken genome. The copies of a repeated DNA sequence may differ from one another both by minor variations in nucleotide sequence (divergence) and in more substantial ways as would be expected to arise from processes such as insertion, deletion, and translocation. In addition to this description of a single cloned repeated DNA sequence from the chicken genome, this paper reports the cloning of more than 100 different restriction fragments of chicken DNA, each of which contains one or more repeated DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1508077414,"The membrane-bound Enzyme IIbgl and IIglc are both inactivated in vivo by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide. The former is also inhibited by the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and p-mercuriphenylsulfonic acid, while the latter is resistant to these reagents. However, inhibition of this enzyme is observed after impairment, either transient or permanent, of the permeability barrier of bacterial envelopes. Since p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid are able to cross the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, their failure to inhibit in vivo Enzyme IIglc must be due to their inability to cross the inner membrane of the bacteria. It would therefore appear that sensitive thiol group(s) of Enzyme IIglc and Enzyme IIbgl, in spite of their functional similarity, exhibit opposite orientation within the cytoplasmic membrane, the first enzyme having an -SH group accessible from the outer surface of the membrane, while the second has an -SH group accessible from the inner surface of the membrane. The present results strengthen the view that these two enzymes have in asymmetric orientation within the membrane as already suggested by their vectorial function."

https://openalex.org/W91296512,"Four spin-labeled analogs of adenosylcobalamin have been synthesized to aid in the detection and identification of radical intermediates in the adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzymatic reactions and to serve as probes of the coenzyme, substrate, and effector binding sites of the protein. Three isomers of adenosylcobalamin, in which one of the propionamide side chains (b, d, or e) was hydrolyzed, and adenosylepicobalamin e-carboxylic acid were reacted with 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide to yield the spin-labeled adenosylcorrinoids. These spin-labeled derivatives of adenosylcobalamin function as coenzymes and/or inhibitors of dioldehydrase from Klebsiella pneumoniae and of ribonucleotide reductase from Corynebacterium nephridii. Electron spin resonance has been used to monitor the photolytic cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond of these analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1613439775,"The presence of both single copy sequences and repeated DNA sequences with a broad range of repetition frequency is a hallmark of the eukaryotic genome. The advent of recombinant DNA technology has made it possible to isolate cloned DNA fragments that encompass two or more DNA sequences with different repetition frequencies. This provides the first opportunity to investigate the structural relationships in the genome of DNA of the different repetition frequency classes in a thorough and systematic way. A cloned fragment of the chicken genome containing two different repeated DNA sequences has been used for this purpose. By hybridization of radioactive restriction fragments of the cloned DNA to filter-bound restriction fragments of total chicken DNA, it has been determined that the 5.5-kilobase inserted DNA in this clone contains a copy of each of two long, repeated DNA sequence elements with different repetition frequencies. These two repeated DNA sequences have very diverse arrangements in the chicken genome. The results establish that, in addition to the interspersion of single copy and repeated DNA sequences in the chicken genome, repeated DNA sequences with very different structural characteristics can be interspersed with one another. Thus, the chicken genome is a complex network of related sequences in which some members of a family of repeated DNA sequences are associated with other, nonhomologous repeated DNA sequences, while other members of the same family are flanked by single copy DNA."
