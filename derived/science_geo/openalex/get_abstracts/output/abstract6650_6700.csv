https://openalex.org/W1493756017,"A method is proposed to detect whether a given enzyme catalyzes a rate-limiting step in a metabolic pathway. With the use of a range of concentrations of specific inhibitors of an enzyme, the finding of a biphasic response with an initial null effect indicates the non-rate-limiting nature of the enzyme. With this method, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is indicated to catalyze a rate-limiting step in lactate gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes from fasted rats."

https://openalex.org/W29749834,"Removal of sialic acids from human erythrocytes with Vibrio cholera neuraminidase abolished hemagglutination by two paramyxoviruses, Sendai and Newcastle disease, and two orthomyxoviruses, a human influenza A2 virus (Japan/305/57), and an equine influenza A virus (Equine i/Prague/56). Selective replacement of sialic acid in the sequences NeuAccu2 + 6 Gal, NeuAca2 -+ GGalNAc, or NeuAccv2 + 3Gal was accomplished with three different homogeneous sialyltransferases, each of which is specific for the synthesis of one of these structures. Hemagglutination titers were restored to the original levels for all four viruses by the incorporation of about 40% of the sialic acid content of the native cells with the fl-galactoside a2 + 3 sialyltransferase. This enzyme has a strict acceptor substrate specificity for the Galfll + 3GalNAcal + 0-Thr/Ser sequence found in asialoglycophorin, the major erythrocyte glycoprotein, and forms the structure NeuAccvt -+ 3Gal/31+ 3GalNAcal -+ 0-Thr/Ser. Analysis of the labeled erythrocyte proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfategel electrophoresis showed that about 85 to 90% of the [l’C]NeuAc incorporated into erythrocytes co-migrated with glycophorin. Incorporation of sialic acid by other sialyltransferases did not result in hemagglutination by the Sendai, Newcastle disease, or equine influenza A viruses. In contrast, both of the other sialyltransferases restored hemagglutination by the human influenza A2 virus. Thus, attachment of sialic acid to erythrocytes in the sequence NeuAca2 -+ 6Gal or NeuAccvP + 6GalNAc restores erythrocyte receptor sites to only one of the four myxoviruses examined."

https://openalex.org/W2148458578,"The nematicidal compound alpha-terthienyl from roots of Tagetes species generates upon irradiation with near ultraviolet light reactive oxygen species on which the in vitro nematicidal activity depends. This system was studied by following the inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by photoactivated alpha-terthienyl and protection of the enzyme activity in the absence of oxygen and by various additions. Addition of mannitol, benzoate, superoxide dismutase or catalase did not have any effect nor did H2O2. This suggests that OH., O-.2, and H2O2 are not the reactive oxygen species involved. The enzyme was protected against photoactivated alpha-terthienyl in air-saturated solutions by singlet oxygen quenchers such as histidine, methionine, tryptophan, bovine serum albumin, and NaN3. Furthermore, inactivation of the enzyme was about 3.5 times faster in D2O than in H2O. When alpha-terthienyl in CH2Cl2 was irradiated in the presence of the olefin adamantylideneadamantane, a stable dioxetane was formed which decomposed to adamantanone when heated above its melting point. These results indicate a singlet oxygen-mediated process."

https://openalex.org/W2121469916,"The transcriptional properties of bacterial RNA polymerases purified from seven different species and representing a variety of bacterial orders have been studied using the well characterized DNA from phage T7 as template. The subunit composition of the different preparations suggests that each RNA polymerase holoenzyme has a protomer structure (ββ′α2σ) similar to that of the well studied E. coli and B. subtilis enzymes. Each enzyme utilizes DNA from bacteriophage T7 as an effective template for RNA synthesis, although all preparations contain a substantial fraction of inactive enzyme. Electrophoretic analysis of the RNA products made with the different RNA polymerases in vitro using T7 DNA (deletion mutant ΔD111) as template reveals that with minor exceptions, all of the heterologous RNA polymerases utilize the same collection of promoter sites on T7 used by the E. coli host enzyme, and only those promoter sites. The T7 early terminator is also efficiently utilized by each enzyme. Since the different bacterial species from which the RNA polymerases were derived are genetically quite distant, it appears that there is a structural element in the promoter which governs its recognition and which is universally recognized among RNA polymerases of different bacterial species. While the different bacterial RNA polymerases generally utilize the same set of T7 promoter sites, the efficiency of utilization of the different promoters varies considerably for different RNA polymerases and for different reaction conditions with the same RNA polymerase. Hence although the several T7 promoter sites share the ability to be recognized by bacterial RNA polymerases, each shows a unique pattern of utilization and therefore must possess a unique element of promoter structure as well. It has previously been shown ( Stahl and Chamberlin, 1977 Stahl S. Chamberlin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 122: 577 Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar ) that T7 promoters A1, C, D and E interact differently with E. coli RNA polymerase as judged by the properties of complexes formed between each promoter and the latter enzyme. Since competition takes place among different promoter sites on a template and since these sites can differ functionally, small changes in reaction conditions or in the structure of the RNA polymerase can lead to significant changes in the rate of utilization of different promoter sites even when these promoter sites share common elements. Because the T7 promoters and terminator are utilized efficiently by such a wide range of RNA polymerases and because each of the several T7 promoters possesses unique properties which govern its utilization by RNA polymerase, analysis of the transcripts formed on a T7 DNA template provides a simple and rapid procedure for detecting and analyzing alterations in bacterial RNA polymerases which affect promoter or terminator recognition or utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2146275508,"Human MN blood group activity has been restored to neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes by resialylation with different homogeneous sialyltransferases. The antigenicity of the resialylated cells always corresponded to that of the native cells from which they were prepared. In no case was a cell converted to an MN phenotype different from that of the blood donor. Either one of two sialyltransferases could restore the native MN phenotype to asialoerythrocytes, although some antisera appear to recognize selectively the products of only one of these enzymes. One sialyltransferase forms the structure, NeuAccw2 -+ 3Galpl-+ 3GalNAcal + OThr/Ser, and the other forms the structure, Galfil + 3meuAca2 + G]GalNAccul + 0-Thr/Ser. Both linkages are found in the Thr/Ser-linked tetrasaccharides of glycophorin, confirming the participation of alkali-labile oligosaccharides in MN blood group activity. A third sialyltransferase that forms the structure, NeuAca2 + 6Ga1/31+ 4GlcNAc, with asparagine-linked oligosaccharides did not restore MN blood group activity. Together these three sialyltransferases replace -60% of the sialic acid removed by neuraminidase. Radioactivity profiles obtained following gel electrophoresis of the 14C-labeled glycoproteins of ghosts from resialylated MM or NN cells were virtually identical. In each case, about 85 to 90% of the incorporated sialic acid was found associated with the major erythrocyte glycoprotein, glycophorin A. Since the modification of cell surface oligosaccharides by either of two sialyltransferases can restore both M and N activity, specific carbohydrate structures cannot be responsible for the difference between M and N antigens. These results are consistent with the proposal that the MN alleles specify the polypeptide sequence of glycophorin A. However, the selectivity of some antisera for erythrocytes modified by only one sialyltransferase shows that specific sialic acid structures may still be important for antibody recognition."

https://openalex.org/W2122953356,"Two allelic forms of the natural chicken ovalbumin gene have been independently cloned. These alleles differ from each other by an Eco RI restriction cleavage site in one of the seven intervening sequences within the natural ovalbumin gene. Restriction endonuclease mapping and sequence analyses of these cloned genotypic alleles have shown identical sequence organization and molecular structures of the interspersed structural and intervening sequences except for the particular Eco RI cleavage site. Sequencing data of the cloned DNA suggest that this Eco RI site may be created or eliminated by a single base mutation in the intervening sequence of the ovalbumin gene. The occurrence of apparent homozygous and heterozygous allelic forms of the ovalbumin gene in individual hens and roosters within the same breed has been observed. 10 and 40% of the chickens examined are homozygous for the ovalbumin gene with and without the extra Eco RI site, respectively, while 50% of them are heterozygous. Further analysis of individual chicken DNA cleaved by restriction endonuclease Hae III has revealed that there may be a series of such mutational variations within the ovalbumin gene. We have identified two Hae III cleavage sites that do not occur in all of the chickens, thus giving rise to several additional allelic variations of the ovalbumin gene. At least one of these Hae III sites is situated in the intervening sequence of the ovalbumin gene, and its lcoation has been mapped. Such allelic variations must be taken into consideration when determining eucaryotic gene structure by restriction mapping of the genomic DNA. Furthermore, this type of mutation within the intervening sequences of an eucaryotic gene has no known phenotypic manifestation. It represents an extrastructural silent mutation that must be taken account of in studies to estimate the rates of eucaryotic gene sequence divergence during evolution."

Phenobarbital induced the de novo synthesis of a microsomal protein of Mr = 51,000, whereas beta-naphthoflavone induced the de novo synthesis of a microsomal protein of Mr = 55,000. The increases in these proteins were associated with differential increases in aminopyrine-N-demethylation and benzo-(a)pyrene hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1572903046,"Plasma membranes from rat myometrium preincu- bated in Krebs-Ringer solution and homogenized in a Polytron were isolated by differential and sucrose den- sity gradient centrifugation. The enzyme activities of isolated plasma membranes were analyzed to deter- mine the contamination by mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and lyso- somes. The activities of succinate-cytochrome c reduc- tase and rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c re- ductase, markers for mitochondrial inner membrane, were enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and de- creased to a very low level in the plasma membrane fraction. Activities of monoamine oxidase and rote- none-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase, sup- posed markers for mitochondrial outer membrane, al- though enriched in the mitochondrial fraction, were also present in the plasma membrane fraction. RNA, protein synthesis, and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, markers for endoplasmic reticulum, were found in small amounts in plasma membrane but in increased amounts in heavier fractions in the sucrose density gradient. The activities of lysosomal enzymes, /3-glucuronidase and /I-galactosidase, were very low in this tissue and present predominantly in mitochondrial and soluble fractions. The plasma membrane fraction was highly enriched with 5’-nucleotidase activity and with lectin and specific oxytocin binding sites. Electron microscopy of the plasma membrane fraction revealed sealed vesicles with little contamination with other membranes. On the basis of protein concentration and marker enzyme activities, it was calculated that this fraction contained 70 to 80% plasma membrane. Cal- cium uptake by the plasma membrane fraction was the highest among all fractions both in the absence and in the presence of ATP, supporting its strong involvement in calcium exchange during excitation-contraction cou- pling and relaxation in intact muscle. We have reported a standard method for the isolation of subcellular membranes from myometrium and other smooth muscle (1, 2). The fraction markedly enriched in plasma membrane was capable of binding and transporting calcium in the presence of ATP under conditions suggesting that this membrane was involved in the regulation of intracellular * This work was supported by the Medical Research Council"
https://openalex.org/W200030721,"We have examined the pattern of accumulation of specific adult pancreas mRNAs during embryonic de- velopment by comparative analysis of the in vitro translation products of RNAs isolated from embryonic and adult pancreases. Changes in the concentration of individual mRNAs were inferred from the sodium do- decyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel profiles of the in vitro translation products. The concentrations of several mRNAs coding for predominant adult translation prod- ucts increased dramatically between 14 and 20 days of gestation, coincident with pancreatic cytodifferentia- tion. A few prominent adult mRNAs were not detected in RNA isolated from embryonic pancreases, indicating that further qualitative changes in pancreatic gene expression occur after birth. The accumulation of the mRNA for the major secre- tory enzyme, amylase, was measured by specific im- munoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products. In vitro synthesized amylase, identified by immunopre- cipitation and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl- amide gel separation of peptides generated by protease digestion, appeared approximately 2000 daltons larger than amylase isolated from adult pancreatic secretions. Amylase mRNA levels measured by immunoprecipita- tion of in vitro translation products increased a mini- mum of loo-fold between Days 14 and 20 of gestation, coincident with the increase in amylase synthesis. These results indicate that the rate of amylase synthe- sis during this developmental period is controlled in large part by the rate of accumulation of amylase mRNA. Enzymatic analyses have shown a biphasic accumulation of the exocrine digestive enzymes during the development of the rat pancreas (l-3). These data suggested that the developing exocrine pancreas undergoes at least two differentiative tran-"

https://openalex.org/W130733515,"Cells of Candida bogoriensis produce as a major extracellular lipid 13-[(2'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]docosanoic acid 6',6''-diacetate (Ac2Glc2HDA), the diacetylated sophoroside of 13-hydroxydocosanoic acid (HDA), along with mono- and unacetylated derivatives. The HDA glycolipid production is greater than 2 g/liter when cells are grown on a medium of 3% glucose and 0.15% yeast extract. Either lowering the glucose concentration (0.5 to 2.0% glucose, at 0.2% yeast extract) or raising the yeast extract concentration (2 to 4% yeast extract at 3% glucose) greatly decreased the yield of this glycolipid, as well as its rate of synthesis measured by [14C]acetate incorporation. Total HDA production was also depressed on the low glucose medium, as was the activity of UDP-glucose:HDA glucosyltransferase, the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of Ac2Glc2HDA from HDA. Levels of acetyl-CoA:Glc2HDA acetyltransferase were not decreased by growth on a low glucose medium, however, even under conditions in which glycolipid production was less than 4% of that found in the standard medium. Low levels of the HDA glycolipids were monitored by high pressure liquid chromatography of their p-bromophenacyl esters, formed by the action of alpha,beta-dibromoacetophenone on the sodium salt of the lipid in the presence of a crown reagent catalyst. This regulation of extracellular Ac2Glc2HDA production by the nutrient composition of the growth medium may represent an important property in the adaptation of C. bogoriensis to its natural environment, the phyllosphere."

https://openalex.org/W160527501,"A procedure for the purification of cholyl CoA:glycine and taurine N-acyltransferase activities from the soluble cell fraction of bovine liver is described. The procedure results is an 900-fold enrichment relative to the soluble cell fraction. The final preparation gives a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Mr = 50,900, and runs as a single peak, Mr = 47,000, on gel filtration. The preparation is approximately 80% pure as judged by isoelectric focusing and focuses at a pH of 6.6. The glycine and taurine conjugating activities co-purified and did not separate to any extent in any of the chromatographic steps employed, including a gradient elution from an affinity column and an isoelectric focusing column. Also, kinetic analysis revealed that glycine and taurine appear to compete for a common active site. The two activities had identical temperature-denaturation curves and were equivalently stabilized against temperature denaturation by taurocholate. This data provides strong evidence for a common enzyme for both glycine and taurine conjugation in bovine liver. A preliminary kinetic characterization of the enzyme revealed non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1605949697,"The degradation characteristics of 56 individual newly synthesized proteins of the Day 4 mouse blastocyst have been examined employing double isotope labeling of proteins for half-life measurement and two-dimensional electrophoresis for separation of proteins. The half-lives ranged from 1 to approximately 30 h with a mean of 12.4 h. Several proteins appeared to have half-lives greater than 30 h but decay times were insufficient to provide precise information for these proteins. The results suggest there is a tendency for proteins with acidic isoelectric points to be degraded more rapidly than basic proteins, and for high molecular weight proteins to be degraded more rapidly than low molecular weight proteins. Although the regressions of these two parameters on half-life were not significant, the direction and magnitude of the trends were similar to those previously described for liver proteins. Two specific proteins, tubulin and actin, were tentatively identified, and their half-lives determined. Tubulin had a half-life of 9.0 h. The half-lives of the provisionally identified gamma, beta, and alpha forms of actin were 2.2, 8.7, and 5.4 h respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2081828879,"Cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts-26) of Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) or with wild-type virus were labeled with 35S-methionine, and cell extracts were examined for radioactive polypeptides which could be precipitated by monospecific antisera to viral proteins. When shifted from permissive (31 degrees C) to nonpermissive (39 degrees C) temperature, cells infected with ts-26 rapidly begin to accumulate gPr90enr, the glycoprotein precursor to the membrane envelope glycoprotein gp70 and to the membrane-associated protein p15E. Simultaneously, formation of these mature virion proteins ceases. In addition, lactoperoxidase-catalyzed surface labeling with 125I--iodine indicates that the plasma membrane of cells infected with ts-26 becomes depleted of gp70 antigens at 39 degrees C. Nevertheless, at 39 degrees C these cells release defective MuLVs which lack gp70 and p15E but contain an outer membrane. The released particles also contain an aberrantly processed form of the major virion core protein p30, and many of these virion cores have an unusual immature crescent shape. It has previously been reported that cells infected with the ts-26 mutant of R-MuLV process a 65,000 dalton precursor (Pr65gag) of the virion core proteins more slowly at 39 degrees C than do cells infected with wild-type virus (Stephenson, Tronick and Aaronson, 1975). Although we have confirmed these results, this effect is relatively small and it is known that various alterations of MuLV assembly can lead secondarily to inhibited processing of Pr65gag. We propose that the ts-26 mutant has a primary temperature-sensitive defect in membrane glycoprotein synthesis and that this change causes pleiotropic effects on core morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2086536131,"EMBRYONIC development is controlled by the information carried by the gametes of the zygote's parents. However, although the chromosomal information is similar in both gametes the oocyte also provides a structural frame (determining embryonic axes), determinants in the cortex and a metabolic pool to support early embryonic events (see ref. 1). The active transcription of thousands of DNA loops in the lampbrush chromosomes of amphibian oocytes suggests that the egg contains transcripts of a large fraction of the genome2. In sea urchin oocytes the mRNA complexity might account for the synthesis of several thousands of different protein species3,4. Genetic analysis should help to establish the functional meaning of the information present in the oocytes for embryonic development. In this study we have analysed the effect of chromosome deletions on the development of Drosophila embryos. The results indicate that the products of a large proportion of the maternal genome, present in the oocyte, are sufficient and necessary for epidermal morphogenesis and differentiation in the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2144898364,"The fluorescence and absorbance of merocyanine 540 in suspensions of skeletal muscle microsomes is altered by the binding of Ca2+ and other cations to the membrane. The order of effectiveness of various cations in causing this effect is La greater than Ca congruent to Mg greater than K. Competition between Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ suggests the involvement of low affinity, relatively nonspecific cation binding sites in the process. Changes in the fluorescence and absorbance of merocyanine were also observed during ATP-dependent accumulation of calcium into sarcoplasmic reticulum. These changes are satisfactorily explained by the binding of accumulated calcium to binding sites on the interior of sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The small absorbance response of the oxonol dye bis[1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid-(5)]trimethinoxonol to Ca2+ and ATP is qualitatively similar to that of merocyanine 540 and can be readily explained by the same mechanism. We have found no clear evidence that any of the observed dye responses are due to changes in the diffusion potential across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane generated by an electrogenic transport mechanism. The possibility is considered that merocyanine and oxonol dyes respond to changes in electrostatic surface potential caused by the binding of cations."

The nitroxide spin label hapten was contained in host bilayers of either dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine in the form of both liposomes and vesicles. At a temperature of 32 degrees C, which is intermediate between the hydrocarbon chain-melting temperatures of the two phospholipids, activation of C1 in such vesicles and liposomes is more efficient in the fluid membrane. Studies of C1 activation in binary mixtures of cholesterol and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine indicate that the activation of C1 is not limited by the lateral diffusion of the lipid haptens in these membranes."

In order to facilitate monitoring the recovery of antigen, trace amounts of previously purified and radioiodinated antigen from another lung tumor were added to the crude extract. The purified antigen was a glycoprotein and contained sialic acid. The antigen had a molecular weight of 76,000 and appeared to contain three subunits, each with a molecular weight of 25,000. The antigen had the following physical properties: Stokes radius, 39.4 A; S20,w, 4.24 S; D20,w, 5.15 x 10(-7) cm2 S-1; and a frictional ratio of 1.40. In addition, the purified, radioiodinated antigen retained complete immune reactivity since it could be quantitatively precipitated with specific immune serum. All of these properties were in close agreement with the properties of another antigen which was purified from a separate human lung tumor. Thus, it appeared from the biochemical and immunochemical criteria presented in this report that a common and identical antigen was isolated from two distinct human lung tumor extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1575660671,"Oxygen quenching was used to decrease the fluorescence lifetime of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) when this fluorophore was bound to phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Quenching caused a shift of the TNS fluorescence emission to shorter wavelengths, and the extent of these spectral shifts depended upon the temperature, phase state, and the chemical composition of the lipid bilayers. Control experiments using equivalent pressures of nitrogen, a nonquenching gas, indicated that the observed spectral shifts are a result of quenching, and not a result of the increased pressure. These fluorescence lifetime-resolved emission spectra were used to quantitate the time required for membrane relaxation around the excited state dipole of TNS. The membrane relaxation times decreased dramatically at temperatures above the transition temperature of dimyristoyl-L-cu-phosphatidylcholine vesicles, representative values being 10.7 and 3.8 ns at 16 and 35”C, respectively. Progressively shorter relaxation times were observed for vesicles of dioleoyl+a-phosphatidylcholine as the temperature was increased from 5 to 45”C, representative values are 3.9 and 2.4 ns at 15 and 35”C, respectively. The data for both lipids indicated that the relaxation process is probably multiexponential. This novel quenching method can provide detailed information on relaxation processes as short as 0.3 ns, and thereby provides information which is difficult to obtain by time-resolved pulse methods. Since lifetimeresolved spectra must always be obtained for times shorter than the unquenched fluorescence lifetime, this method is complementary to time-resolved methods which permit data acquisition at times longer than the fluorescence lifetime."
