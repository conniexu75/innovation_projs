https://openalex.org/W2083371696,"ANANDAMIDE (N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine) was recently identified as a brain arachidonate derivative that binds to and activates cannabinoid receptors1–4, yet the mechanisms underlying formation, release and inactivation of this putative messenger molecule are still unclear. Here we report that anandamide is produced in and released from cultured brain neurons in a calcium ion-dependent manner when the neurons are stimulated with membrane-depolarizing agents. Anandamide formation occurs through phos-phodiesterase-mediated cleavage of a novel phospholipid precursor, N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. A similar mechanism also governs the formation of a family of anandamide congeners, whose possible roles in neuronal signalling remain unknown. Our results and those of others5,6indicate therefore that multiple biochemical pathways may participate in anandamide formation in brain tissue. The life span of extracellular anandamide is limited by a rapid and selective process of cellular uptake, which is accompanied by hydrolytic degradation to ethanolamine and arachidonate. Our results thus strongly support the proposed role of anandamide as an endogenous neuronal messenger."

https://openalex.org/W2005900169,"Growth factors activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and Jun kinases (JNKs). Although the signaling cascade from growth factor receptors to ERKs is relatively well understood, the pathway leading to JNK activation is more obscure. Activation of JNK by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or nerve growth factor (NGF) was dependent on H-Ras activation, whereas JNK activation by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) was Ras-independent. Ras activates two protein kinases, Raf-1 and MEK (MAPK, or ERK, kinase) kinase (MEKK). Raf-1 contributes directly to ERK activation but not to JNK activation, whereas MEKK participated in JNK activation but caused ERK activation only after overexpression. These results demonstrate the existence of two distinct Ras-dependent MAPK cascades—one initiated by Raf-1 leading to ERK activation, and the other initiated by MEKK leading to JNK activation."

https://openalex.org/W2049219353,"A Candida albicans gene (CPH1) was cloned that encodes a protein homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste12p, a transcription factor that is the target of the pheromone response mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. CPH1 complements both the mating defect of ste12 haploids and the filamentous growth defect of ste12/ste12 diploids. Candida albicans strains without a functional CPH1 gene (cph1/cph1) show suppressed hyphal formation on solid medium. However, cph1/cph1 strains can still form hyphae in liquid culture and in response to serum. Thus, filamentous growth may be activated in C. albicans by the same signaling kinase cascade that activates Ste12p in S. cerevisiae; however, alternative pathways may exist in C. albicans."

https://openalex.org/W1986923087,"AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor channels mediate the fast component of excitatory postsynaptic currents in the central nervous system. Site-selective nuclear RNA editing controls the calcium permeability of these channels, and RNA editing at a second site is shown here to affect the kinetic aspects of these channels in rat brain. In three of the four AMPA receptor subunits (GluR-B, -C, and -D), intronic elements determine a codon switch (AGA, arginine, to GGA, glycine) in the primary transcripts in a position termed the R/G site, which immediately precedes the alternatively spliced modules ""flip"" and ""flop."" The extent of editing at this site progresses with brain development in a manner specific for subunit and splice form, and edited channels possess faster recovery rates from desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2035090455,"CATIONIC drugs of different types and structures (antihistaminics, antiarrhythmics, sedatives, opiates, cytostatics and antibiotics, for example) are excreted in mammals by epithelial cells of the renal proximal tubules and by hepatocytes in the liverl–4. In the proximal tubules, two functionally disparate transport systems are involved which are localized in the basolateral and luminal plasma membrane and are different from the previously identified neuronal monoamine transporters and ATP-dependent multidrug exporting proteins1–3,5–12. Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA from rat kidney that encodes a 556-amino-acid membrane protein, OCT1, which has the functional characteristics of organic cation uptake over the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubules and of organic cation uptake into hepatocytes. OCT1 is not homologous to any other known protein and is found in kidney, liver and intestine. As OCT1 translocates hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic cations of different structures, it is considered to be a new prototype of polyspecific transporters that are important for drug elimination."

https://openalex.org/W2076178582,"Translation of key proteins in the chloroplast is regulated by light. Genetic and biochemical studies in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii suggest that light may regulate translation by modulating the binding of activator proteins to the 5' untranslated region of chloroplast messenger RNAs. In vitro binding of the activator proteins to psbA messenger RNA and in vivo translation of psbA messenger RNA is regulated by the redox state of these proteins, suggesting that the light stimulus is transduced by the photosynthesis-generated redox potential."

Tubulin carboxyl-terminal peptides were isolated and analyzed by Edman degradation sequencing, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. All of the peptides, derived from both alpha and beta tubulin subunits, were modified by polyglycylation, containing up to 34 glycyl units covalently bound to the gamma carboxyl group of glutamyl residues. This modification, present in one of the most stable microtubular systems, may influence microtubule stability or axoneme function, or both."

https://openalex.org/W2040386515,"Most eukaryotic pre-messenger RNAs are processed at their 3' ends by endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation. In yeast, this processing requires polyadenylate [poly(A)] polymerase (PAP) and other proteins that have not yet been characterized. Here, mutations in the PAP1 gene were shown to be synergistically lethal with previously identified mutations in the RNA14 and RNA15 genes, which suggests that their encoded proteins participate in 3'-end processing. Indeed, extracts from ma14 and rna15 mutants were shown to be deficient in both steps of processing. Biochemical complementation experiments and reconstitution of both activities with partially purified cleavage factor I (CF I) validated the genetic prediction."
https://openalex.org/W1988335886,"THE bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis which offers potential advantages as a vector for mucosal delivery of antigens1–3. Recombinant BCG elicits protective humoral immune responses to a variety of antigens4. Furthermore, BCG binds specifically to microfold cells5 present in the epithelium overlying lymphoid follicles throughout the mucosal immune system6–8. Here we show that a single intra-nasal vaccination with recombinant BCG expressing the outer-surface protein A antigen from B. burgdorferi9 results in a prolonged (more than one year) protective systemic IgG response and a highly sustained secretory IgA response which is disseminated throughout the mucosal immune system. Furthermore, intranasal immunization induces marked, organized lymphocyte accumulation in the proximal nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue as well as at distal mucosal sites; the appearance and persistence of lymphoid aggregates correlates with the secretory immune responses. Thus intranasal immunization with recombinant BCG is a powerful method for inducing long-lasting secretory and systemic immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2023278467,"The association between quantitative genetic variation in bristle number and molecular variation at a candidate neurogenic locus, scabrous, was examined in Drosophila melanogaster. Approximately 32 percent of the genetic variation in abdominal bristle number (21 percent for sternopleural bristle number) among 47 second chromosomes from a natural population was correlated with DNA sequence polymorphisms at this locus. Several polymorphic sites associated with large phenotypic effects occurred at intermediate frequency. Quantitative genetic variation in natural populations caused by alleles that have large effects at a few loci and that segregate at intermediate frequencies conflicts with the classical infinitesimal model of the genetic basis of quantitative variation."

https://openalex.org/W1968909172,"Complete 16S-like ribosomal RNA coding regions were obtained from the fungal symbiont of five genera of attine (leaf-cutting) ants and two free-living fungi. Phylogenetic analyses with distance matrix, maximum likelihood, and parsimony methods revealed that the attine fungal symbionts are homobasidiomycetes in the order Agaricales. Comparison of the topology of the attine fungal symbiont phylogenetic tree with a tree based on attine ant morphology revealed a congruent branching pattern of the more derived attine ants and their fungal symbionts. The parallel branching pattern suggests a long-term coevolution of derived leaf-cutting attine ants and their fungal symbionts."
https://openalex.org/W1562048214,"Hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) catalyzes the last step in the metabolic pathway that synthesizes the hormone melatonin. We have found HIOMT mRNA present in small amounts in human retina and in relatively high abundance in the pineal gland. Two distinct 5' ends were found in human retina using a solid-phase 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. The two 5' regions appear to originate from two distinct putative promoters. Although many similarities exist between the two promoters, they contain distinctive elements. Putative promoter A, for example, contains a recently discovered photoreceptor-conserved element (PCE-1, CAATTAAG) at -27 not found in promoter B, while promoter B contains an Ap1 site (ATGAGTCAA) at -166 and an octamer site (ATGCAAT) at -59 not found in promoter A. The HIOMT messages are also alternatively spliced in between exons 6 and 8, generating three distinct messages. One of the alternatively spliced messages contains a line-1 repetitive element that is spliced into the mRNA precisely as exon 6. Importantly, the downstream open reading frame is not altered by any of these splicing combinations. The gene is approximately 35 kilobases long containing either 9 or 10 exons (including the line-1 element) depending on which promoter is active. All of the splice sites follow the GT/AG rule. The dual promoters and opportunities for alternative splicing suggest a variety of mechanisms for control of HIOMT expression and biological activity in different tissues not previously recognized."

https://openalex.org/W1500341118,"The residues forming the 3'-->5' exonuclease active site of phi 29 DNA polymerase, located at the N-terminal conserved motifs Exo I, Exo II and Exo III, have been defined by site-directed mutagenesis (Bernad, A., Blanco, L., Lazaro, J. M., Martin, G., and Salas, M. (1989) Cell 59, 219-228; Soengas, M. S., Esteban, J. A., Lazaro, J. M., Bernad, A., Blasco, M. A., Salas, M., and Blanco, L. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 4227-4237). To understand their catalytic role, the residual exonuclease activity of mutants at these active site residues has been kinetically studied. The critical function of residues Asp12, Glu14, Asp66, and Asp169 is supported by a 10(5)-fold reduction in the exonuclease catalytic rate upon single mutation. Residue Tyr165 seems to play a secondary role in the exonuclease reaction based on the 10(2)-10(3)-fold reduced catalytic rate of mutants Y165F and Y165C. Most of the mutants were specially active in the presence of Mn2+ ions, which could be indicative of a direct involvement of these residues in a metal ion-assisted exonucleolytic reaction. The data obtained strongly suggest that the 3'-->5' exonuclease active site of phi 29 DNA polymerase is structurally and functionally similar to that of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. In addition, these residues were also very important for the strand displacement ability of phi 29 DNA polymerase, suggesting a structural overlapping of this activity with the 3'-->5' exonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1498016263,"The splicing activities of 5-fluorouracil (FUra)-substituted U2 and U6 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) were examined in an in vitro splicing system. Yeast splicing extracts were specifically depleted of endogenous U2 and U6 snRNAs by antisense oligonucleotide-directed RNase H hydrolysis. Splicing activity was recovered when the extracts were reconstituted with synthetic U2 and U6 snRNAs. However, U2 snRNA with all uracils substituted with FUra (FU2) did not restore any splicing activity. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis showed that FU2 failed to promote the assembly of spliceosome complexes. The ability of U2 snRNA to restore splicing in U2-depleted extracts increased as FUra content decreased but was still only 60% of control activity at 25% substitution of uracils with FUra. Addition of FU2 to nondepleted extracts caused strong inhibition of splicing accompanied by increased degradation of the pre-mRNA, suggesting that FU2 forms an inactive complex with a protein splicing factor that normally binds to the pre-mRNA. FU6 restored full splicing activity to U6-depleted extracts, but at a 5-fold higher concentration than U6 snRNA. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of FUra can impair the functions of catalytic RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1571499921,"The 2',3'-dialdehyde analogue of GTP, oGTP, was devised as an irreversible antagonist of regulatory GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Here, we show that oGTP uncouples transmembrane signaling mediated by a set of distinct G proteins both in isolated membranes and in whole cells. In human platelet membranes, pretreatment with oGTP suppressed receptor- and G protein-controlled regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. In chick neuronal cells, inhibition of the voltage-sensitive Ca(2+)-current by various membrane receptors (alpha 2-adrenergic, somatostatin, GABAB) was eliminated when oGTP was applied intracellularly in the whole cell patch-clamp configuration. Disruption of endogenous signaling pathways by oGTP occurred through specific blockage of the GTP-binding site of G protein alpha-subunits by the following criteria: (i) pretreatment of membranes with oGTP blocked direct G protein activation by guanine nucleotides as well as labeling of Gs alpha and Gi alpha with the photoaffinity probe [alpha-32P]GTP azidoanilide. (ii) The effect of oGTP was antagonized by the simultaneous introduction of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate into the patch-clamped cell. (iii) The time to onset of action was similar for oGTP and guanosine 5'-O-thio)diphosphate. (iv) Inactivation of G protein-dependent signaling was overcome by substituting G protein alpha-subunits. Addition of both the short and long form of recombinant Gs alpha (rGs alpha-s and rGs alpha-L) restored guanine nucleotide-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity to oGTP-treated platelet membranes with rGs alpha-L being approximately 3-10-fold more potent than rGs alpha-s. This apparent preference was due to the intrinsically different activation rates of rGs alpha-L and rGs alpha-s. When reconstituted with exogenous rGs alpha, the A2-adenosine receptor did not discriminate among the two forms of rGs alpha. Thus, Gs alpha-L is the primary determinant of basal cAMP formation in platelets. In contrast, neither the addition of various recombinant subtypes of Gi/o nor purified bovine brain beta gamma-dimers reconstituted adenylyl cyclase inhibition in oGTP-treated membranes. All subtypes of Gi alpha stimulated adenylyl cyclase. In the presence of rGs alpha, a conditional stimulation by beta gamma-dimers was observed. This pattern of stimulation shows that platelet adenylyl cyclase is a type II-like isoform. Either a differently modified G protein or an ancillary GTP-binding component is required for adenylyl cyclase inhibition in platelets. oGTP can be considered a useful tool for disruption and reconstitution of transmembrane signaling mediated by presumably all classes of heterotrimeric G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1485375737,"The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) retrovirus causes mammary adenocarcinomas in mice by proviral insertion near members of the wnt family of proto-oncogenes, leading to their deregulation and cellular transformation. The 5‘ end of the MMTV long terminal repeat (LTR) has been implicated in tissue-specific activation of these genes. In this study, we characterize an enhancer element (Ban2; -1075 to -978) at the 5‘ end of the MMTV LTR. We show that this enhancer is 5-fold more active in a murine mammary carcinoma cell line (34i) than in a fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3), and is inactive in the liver carcinoma cell line HepG2. Mutagenesis of the enhancer reveals four cis-acting elements that are required for maximal activity. DNA-binding proteins that interact with each of the four elements have been identified. One of these factors, designated mp5, is either identical to, or closely related to, the transcription factor AP-2. The mp5/AP-2 DNA binding activity co-migrates with recombinant AP-2 and is supershifted by anti-AP-2 antibodies. We also show that the lack of enhancer activity in HepG2 cells results from the absence of AP-2 protein in these cells. Co-transfection of an AP-2 expression vector restores the activity of this enhancer in HepG2 cells, and requires an intact mp5-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1515921668,"G alpha i2 is a tissue-specific proto-oncogene product, whose activated mutant gip2 induces transformation through less defined downstream pathways. We found that c-fos promoter is a target of gip2 in multiple kinds of cells. Serum response element was shown to be the positive enhancer element that mediates gip2-induced c-fos expression. We further demonstrated that gip2 stimulates the negative silencer activity of the retinoblastoma (Rb) control element (RCE) and inhibits the c-fos promoter activity through RCE located in the c-fos promoter region. The effect of gip2 on RCE was shown to be mediated by the Rb gene product (pRb). Furthermore, gip2 augmented underphosphorylated active form of pRb by promoting pRb expression and by affecting the phosphorylation state of pRb. gip2 therefore propagates both positive and negative signals to the c-fos promoter through two different elements, and pRb mediates the negative signal of gip2. We conclude that gip2 has bifunctional roles in transformation which pRb critically regulates. Given that Rat-1 cells, which gip2 can transform, lack the sensitivity to the gip2/pRb-mediated negative pathway, this study provides a novel insight into oncogenesis by gip2 and its tissue specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1485021250,"Abstract We have searched for irreversible ligands which target the guanine nucleotide binding pocket of G protein alpha-subunits by testing the ability of periodate-oxidized 2',3'-dialdehyde guanine nucleotide analogues of GTP (oGTP) and GTP gamma S (oGTP gamma S) to bind to the recombinant alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein, rGs alpha-s. oGTP and oGTP gamma S bind to rGs alpha-s in a quasi-irreversible manner via formation of a Schiff's base, which can be reduced with borhydrid resulting in covalent incorporation of [alpha-32P]oGTP and [35S]oGTP gamma S into rGs alpha-s. When bound to rGs alpha-s, oGTP is hydrolyzed and traps the protein in the inactive conformation, while oGTP gamma S persistently activates rGs alpha. Thus, oGTP and oGTP gamma S act as irreversible G protein antagonist and agonist, respectively, and represent a pair of nucleotide analogues suitable as functional and structural tools. Cleavage of covalently labeled rGs alpha-s with cyanogen bromide generates several labeled fragments. Labeled fragments were assigned to the G1 and G4 region of the guanine nucleotide binding pocket using sequence-specific antisera. An additional, labeled fragment was identified by amino-terminal sequencing and corresponded to the helix alpha A in the recently determined crystal structure of the transducin alpha-subunit (Noel, J. P., Hamm, H. E., and Sigler, P. B. (1993) Nature 366, 654-663). In the oGDP-liganded conformation, incorporation occurs predominantly into the G1-fragment, while [35S]oGTP gamma S labels the additional fragments to a similar extent indicating tight packing around the guanine nucleotide binding pocket in the active conformation. Furthermore, rGs alpha-s contains a single acid cleavable bond (Asp317-Pro318), such that formic acid releases a carboxyl-terminal fragment from [alpha-32P]oGTP- and [35S]oGTP gamma S-liganded rGs alpha-s. This fragment contains a single lysine residue (Lys324) which is only labeled by [35S]oGTP gamma S. Lys324 is unique to Gs alpha and lies within its effector binding region. Hence, during the switch from the inactive to the active state, this region undergoes a major conformational change that moves it closer to the nucleotide binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1527014072,"We have characterized several mutants that contain alterations in the hydrophilic domain (N region) of the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gC signal sequence. In general, our results agree with previous findings and indicate that basic residues in the N region are not essential for efficient export of gC in infected cells. While reducing the N region to a net neutral charge led to a slight impairment of membrane translocation, a substantial gC export defect was not observed until a net negative charge was introduced. However, there was one exception to this pattern. The substitution of a leucine for an arginine at the carboxyl terminus of the N region led to a considerable export defect despite maintaining a net positive charge. As a consequence of the substitution, the mutant signal sequence was 1.5 times more hydrophobic than wild type, but we found that the defect could be largely corrected if an additional alteration that lessened the overall hydrophobicity of the gC signal sequence was incorporated. We suggest that an upper limit of hydrophobicity may exist for eukaryotic signal sequences; exceeding this value could lead to an export defect."
