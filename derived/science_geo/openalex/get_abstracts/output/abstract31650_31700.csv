https://openalex.org/W2032118018,"A thermostable DNA polymerase was used in an in vitro DNA amplification procedure, the polymerase chain reaction. The enzyme, isolated from Thermus aquaticus, greatly simplifies the procedure and, by enabling the amplification reaction to be performed at higher temperatures, significantly improves the specificity, yield, sensitivity, and length of products that can be amplified. Single-copy genomic sequences were amplified by a factor of more than 10 million with very high specificity, and DNA segments up to 2000 base pairs were readily amplified. In addition, the method was used to amplify and detect a target DNA molecule present only once in a sample of 10(5) cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971799655,"The Toll gene of Drosophila, a maternal effect gene that plays a central role in the establishment of the embryonic dorsal-ventral pattern, has been cloned using P element tagging. A 5.3 kb poly(A)+ ovarian transcript from the cloned region was purified by hybrid selection with the cloned DNA. This purified transcript complements the Toll mutant phenotype when injected into Toll- embryos, which proves that it is the Toll transcript. The sequence of cDNAs suggests that the Toll protein is an integral membrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain and a large extracytoplasmic domain. The putative extracytoplasmic domain contains at least 15 repeats of a 24 amino acid, leucine-rich sequence found in both human and yeast membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2077369265,"Abnormal functional activity induces long-lasting physiological alterations in neural pathways that may play a role in the development of epilepsy. The cellular mechanisms of these alterations are not well understood. One hypothesis is that abnormal activity causes structural reorganization of neural pathways and promotes epileptogenesis. This report provides morphological evidence that synchronous perforant path activation and kindling of limbic pathways induce axonal growth and synaptic reorganization in the hippocampus, in the absence of overt morphological damage. The results show a previously unrecognized anatomic plasticity associated with synchronous activity and development of epileptic seizures in neural pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1974999120,"A prospective lineage analysis was performed to determine the variety of cell types that could be formed by individual precursor cells of the developing frog retina. Fluorescent dextran was iontophoretically injected into single cells of the embryonic optic vesicle. After further development of the embryo, labeled descendants were observed in all three layers of the larval retina. Furthermore, different clones were composed of various combinations of all major cell types, including the glial Müller cells. Hence, single optic vesicle cells have the potential to form any type of retinal cell, suggesting that the interactions that specify the differentiation pathway of retinal cells must occur late in development."

https://openalex.org/W2004200027,"The envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is synthesized as a polyprotein (gp160) and cleaved intracellularly to a gp120-gp41 heterodimer. In this study, the tryptic-like endoproteolytic cleavage site was removed by site-directed mutagenesis and replaced with a chymotryptic-like site. The resultant mutant, RIP7/mut10, was found to be indistinguishable from wild-type HIV when analyzed at the level of proviral replication, RNA processing, protein expression, and viral assembly. However, the gp160 polyprotein was not cleaved and the mutated virions were biologically inactive, until and unless they were exposed to limiting concentrations of chymotrypsin. As is the case for other enveloped mammalian viruses, endoproteolytic cleavage of the HIV envelope protein and release of a unique hydrophobic domain appear to be necessary for the full expression of viral infectivity."

These experiments were designed to investigate the consequences of the expression of immunological effector molecules by nonimmunological cells. In both of these studies we observed the disappearance from the pancreas of the insulin-producing β cells coinciding with the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Transgenic mice expressing both chains of the I-A gene showed progressive atrophy of the islets of Langerhans, whereas mice expressing interferon-gamma suffered an inflammatory destruction of the islets."
https://openalex.org/W1624505911,"We identified the major autophosphorylation sites in the insulin receptor and correlated their phosphorylation with the phosphotransferase activity of the receptor on synthetic peptides. The receptor, purified from Fao hepatoma cells on immobilized wheat germ agglutinin, undergoes autophosphorylation at several tyrosine residues in its beta-subunit; however, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (alpha-PY) inhibited most of the phosphorylation by trapping the initial sites in an inactive complex. Exhaustive trypsin digestion of the inhibited beta-subunit yielded two peptides derived from the Tyr-1150 domain (Ullrich, A, Bell, J. R., Chen, E. Y., Herrera, R., Petruzzelli, L. M., Dull, T. J., Gray, A., Coussens, L., Liao, Y.-C., Tsubokawa, M., Mason, A., Seeburg, P. H., Grunfeld, C., Rosen, O. M., and Ramachandran, J. (1985) Nature 313, 756-761) called pY4 and pY5. Both peptides contained 2 phosphotyrosyl residues (2Tyr(P], one corresponding to Tyr-1146 and the other to Tyr-1150 or Tyr-1151. In the absence of the alpha-PY additional sites were phosphorylated. The C-terminal domain of the beta-subunit contained phosphotyrosine at Tyr-1316 and Tyr-1322. Removal of the C-terminal domain by mild trypsinolysis did not affect the phosphotransferase activity of the beta-subunit suggesting that these sites did not play a regulatory role. Full activation of the insulin receptor during in vitro assay correlated with the appearance of two phosphopeptides in the tryptic digest of the beta-subunit, pY1 and pY1a, that were inhibited by the alpha-PY. Structural analysis suggested that pY1 and pY1a were derived from the Tyr-1150 domain and contained 3 phosphotyrosyl residues (3Tyr(P] corresponding to Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, and Tyr-1151. The phosphotransferase of the receptor that was phosphorylated in the presence of alpha-PY at 2 tyrosyl residues in the Tyr-1150 domain was not fully activated during kinase assays carried out with saturating substrate concentrations which inhibited further autophosphorylation. During insulin stimulation of the intact cell, the 3Tyr(P) form of the Tyr-1150 domain was barely detected, whereas the 2Tyr(P) form predominated. We conclude that 1) autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor begins by phosphorylation of Tyr-1146 and either Tyr-1150 or Tyr-1151; 2) progression of the cascade to phosphorylation of the third tyrosyl residue fully activates the phosphotransferase during in vitro assay; 3) in vivo, the 2Tyr(P) form predominates, suggesting that progression of the autophosphorylation cascade to the 3Tyr(P) form is regulated during insulin stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W2071196984,"CD14 is a myelomonocytic differentiation antigen expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and activated granulocytes and is detectable with the monoclonal antibodies MO2, MY4, and LeuM3. Analyses of complementary DNA and genomic clones of CD14 show that it has a novel structure and that it maps to chromosome 5 within a region containing other genes encoding growth factors and receptors; it may therefore represent a new receptor important for myeloid differentiation. In addition, the CD14 gene is included in the ""critical"" region that is frequently deleted in certain myeloid leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W2090821655,"At least half the pp60c-src in NIH 3T3-derived c-src overexpresser cells in modified by novel threonine and, possibly, serine phosphorylation within its amino 16 kd region during mitosis. At the same time, the tryptic phosphopeptide containing Ser 17, the site of cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, is either modified or dephosphorylated. While the amount of pp60c-src is not significantly altered, the in vitro-specific kinase activity of modified pp60c-src is enhanced 4- to 7-fold. Modified pp60c-src has the same tyrosine-containing tryptic phosphopeptides as pp60c-src from unsynchronized cells, indicating that activation is independent of Tyr 416/Tyr 527 phosphorylation. Electrophoretic mobility retardations indicated that endogenous pp60c-src and pp60v-src are similarly modified during mitosis. The modifications and enhanced activity disappear near the time of cell division. These results suggest that pp60c-src is regulated by and, in turn, may regulate mitosis-specific events in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2055963067,"Early events in ligand-induced endocytosis of the EGF receptor have been examined. A mutant EGF receptor devoid of intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity bound EGF and dimerized normally yet failed to undergo ligand-induced internalization. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that receptors lacking kinase activity failed to undergo the ligand-induced internalization characteristic of receptors with kinase activity. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies effectively inhibited phosphorylation of exogenous substrates in vitro and, when microinjected into cells containing active EGF receptors, prevented internalization of the receptor when cells were subsequently challenged with EGF. These results point to a crucial role for the kinase activity of the EGF receptor in the process of ligand-induced endocytosis of receptors, and imply that a phosphorylated substrate(s) is required."

https://openalex.org/W1937089820,"The neural control system for generation of locomotion is an important system for analysis of neural mechanisms underlying complex motor acts. In these studies, a novel experimental model using neonatal rat brain stem and spinal cord in vitro was developed for investigation of the locomotor system in mammals. The in vitro brain stem and spinal cord system was shown to retain functional circuitry for locomotor command generation, motor pattern generation, and sensorimotor integration. This system was exploited to investigate neurochemical mechanisms involved in neurogenesis of locomotion. Evidence was obtained for peptidergic and gamma-amino-butyric acid-mediated mechanisms in brain-stem circuits generating locomotor commands. Cholinergic, dopaminergic, and excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms were shown to activate spinal cord circuits for locomotor pattern generation. Endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors in spinal networks were found to play a central role in the generation of locomotion. The chemically induced patterns of motor activity and rhythmic membrane potential oscillations of spinal motoneurons were characteristic of those during locomotion in other mammals in vivo. The in vitro brain stem and spinal cord model provides a versatile and powerful experimental system with potentially broad application for investigation of diverse aspects of the neurobiology of mammalian motor control systems."
https://openalex.org/W2094608685,"Magnesium ions play a fundamental role in cellular function, but the effects of changes in the concentration of intracellular ionized magnesium ([Mg2+]i) on cell physiology have only recently received experimental attention. Increasing [Mg2+]i from 0.3 to 3.0 mM in cardiac cells by internal perfusion has only small effects on the basal voltage-gated calcium current (ICa) or on ICa elevated by dihydropyridine calcium channel agonists. In contrast, ICa elevated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation decreases by more than 50 percent. The effect of [Mg2+]i is not due to changes in the concentration of cAMP or in the velocity of phosphorylation but rather appears to be a direct effect on the phosphorylated channel or on channel dephosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2045673068,"Patch clamp recordings of whole-cell and single channel currents revealed the presence of two voltage-sensitive calcium channel types in the membrane of 3T3 fibroblasts. The two calcium channel types were identified by their unitary properties and pharmacological sensitivities. Both calcium channel types were present in all control 3T3 cells, but one type was selectively suppressed in 3T3 cells that had been transformed by activated c-H-ras, EJ-ras, v-fms, or polyoma middle T oncogenes. The presence of voltage-sensitive calcium channels in these nonexcitable cells and the control of their functional expression by transforming oncogenes raises questions about their role in the control of calcium-sensitive processes such as cell motility, cytoskeletal organization, and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2004280721,"E. coli expressing the papA-I genes produce pili that mediate specific adhesion to mammalian cells. We show that the major pilus subunit gene, papA, is part of a polycistronic transcriptional unit subject to specific posttranscriptional processing. A primary transcript also encoding the papB regulatory gene product is endonucleolytically cleaved, resulting in the rapid decay of the papB-encoding 5' half of the mRNA, whereas the papA-encoding 3' half remains as a quite stable transcript. Processing and differential mRNA stability thereby result in accumulation of mRNAs encoding only the major pilus subunit. A sequence immediately downstream of the papA coding region may serve as a stability determinant for the papA transcript and concomitantly attenuate read-through transcription into the minor pilus subunit gene papH. This suggests that differential expression of genes within an operon may include endo- and exonucleolytic processing of the mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2052531952,"Ion channels were studied in four major subsets of developing murine thymocytes by using patch-clamp recording and cell-surface staining techniques. The expression of three types of voltage-gated potassium channels in thymocytes varies consistently with the cell′s developmental state and functional class as defined by cell-surface markers. One class of potassium channel (type n) predominates in immature thymocyte subsets as well as in mature-phenotype CD4+CD8- thymocytes (precursors to helper T lymphocytes), and the average surface density of this channel type correlates with the extent of cell proliferation. Two additional types of potassium channels (types n′ and l) are found in the mature CD4-CD8+ thymocyte subset that contains precursors to cytotoxic and suppressor T cells. The subset-specific expression of type n′ and l potassium channels suggests their use as additional cell-surface markers with which to identify precursors to the cytotoxic suppressor T cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2054547054,"Segmental differences in stability within the polycistronic transcripts of the puf operon contribute to differential expression of photosynthesis genes in R. capculatus. The comparatively stable 5′ segment of these transcripts ends in a large intercistronic stem-loop structure. We show here that deletion of this RNA hairpin destabilizes the 5′ puf mRNA segment but that its insertion at the 3′ end of the puf operon transcripts fails to stabilize the labile 3′ puf mRNA segment. Evidence is presented that decay of the 3′ segment begins with endonucleolytic cleavage in which the intercistronic stem-loop structure does not participate. We conclude that this RNA hairpin is necessary but insufficient for the stability of mRNA upstream of it, and that it functions in message degradation solely as an mRNA decay terminator that protects upstream mRNA segments from degradation by 3′ exoribonucleases."

https://openalex.org/W2090153088,"Monoclonal antibody 24B10 (MAb24B10) specifically stains photoreceptor neurons in D. melanogaster. It recognizes a 160 kd glycoprotein localized to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. Using an immunoscreen, we identified two mutations in the encoding gene that cause microvillar disorganization in developing rhabdomeres and disruption of the closely apposed membranes of adjacent cells. In accordance with the mutant phenotype, we have renamed this genetic locus chaoptic and the encoded glycoprotein, chaoptin. Immunoelectron microscopy indicates that chaoptin is distributed along the length of the microvillus. This localization and the morphological abnormalities in mutants support the hypothesis that chaoptin may mediate adhesion between closely apposed membranes. In principle, the immunoscreen utilized here can be used to identify mutations in any gene in Drosophila for which antibodies to the gene product are available."

https://openalex.org/W1577788031,"Previously, monoclonal antibody FDC-6 was established, which defines a structure specific for fibronectins isolated from fetal and malignant cells and tissues. The presence of the FDC-6-defined structure at type III connecting segment (III CS) is characteristic of oncofetal fibronectin (onf-FN), and its absence is characteristic of normal fibronectin (nor-FN) (Matsuura, H., and Hakomori, S. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 6517-6521). Hepatoma fibronectin was sequentially digested by various proteases, followed by subsequent chromatography on an FDC-6 affinity column and reverse-phase columns at each step of digestion. A single strongly active glycosylhexapeptide (glycopeptide 1) and an inactive glycosylpentapeptide (glycopeptide 3) were isolated from glycopeptide A containing 35 amino acid residues. The minimum essential structure required for the FDC-6 activity was found to be a hexapeptide sequence Val-Thr-His-Pro-Gly-Tyr having NeuAc alpha 2—-3Gal beta 1—-3GalNAc or its core (Gal beta 1—-3GalNAc or GalNAc) linked at threonine. Various synthetic peptides including the Val-Thr-His-Pro-Gly-Tyr sequence and a glycopeptide having the Val-Thr-His-Pro-Gly pentapeptide with the same glycosylation at threonine were all inactive. Elimination of sialic acid slightly increased the activity, and subsequent elimination of galactose did not alter the activity; however, removal of the Gal beta 1—-3GalNAc residue by endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from desialylated glycopeptide A resulted in total inactivation of the reactivity with FDC-6 antibody. Thus, a single glycosylation at a defined threonine residue of the III CS region may induce conformational changes in the peptide to form the specific oncofetal epitope recognized by FDC-6 antibody. This finding opens the possibility that a number of other oncofetal epitopes consist of a peptide and a common O-linked carbohydrate and that the combination produces a conformation specific to cancer or to a stage of development."
https://openalex.org/W1653542260,"The products of the arsenical resistance operon of resistance plasmid R733 form an efflux system for arsenicals. Detoxification results from active efflux of the oxyanions, preventing their concentration from reaching toxic levels. The largest polypeptide encoded by the ars operon was purified. From N-terminal sequencing the purified protein, termed the ArsA protein, was shown to correspond to the product of the arsA gene. The purified protein was demonstrated to bind ATP by two methods. First, a photoadduct of the protein with [alpha-32P]ATP was formed by irradiation at 254 nm. Second, the purified protein bound a fluorescent ATP analogue, 2‘,3‘-o-(2,4,6)trinitrophenyl ATP, with a half-maximal affinity of 2 microM. By both assays competition was observed with ATP or ADP, but not with AMP, GTP, CTP, or UTP. In both nucleotide binding assays, Mg2+ was required, but neither arsenite nor antimonate had any affect. In contrast, the ArsA protein exhibited an ATPase activity which was dependent on the presence of arsenite or antimonate. The results suggest that the ArsA protein is the catalytic subunit of an oxyanion-translocating ATPase."

These genetically engineered filamentous phage display the recombinant proteins on their surface. We demonstrate that they are both antigenic and immunogenic in rabbits. The recombinant phage were shown to be useful as a source of antigen for this scarce malaria protein, for producing carrier-hapten conjugates for obtaining immunological reagents in rabbits, and for B epitope mapping. In addition, in mice the antibody response to the cloned antigens seems to be controlled by immune response genes. Therefore this system also has the potential for use in helper T cell epitope mapping using inbred mouse strains. This advantage will be of use in vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W1588565399,"The pulmonary surfactant apoprotein with a reduced denatured molecular mass of 26-38 kDa (PSP-A) has recently been identified as an inhibitor of surfactant phospholipid secretion by isolated rat alveolar type II cells. We have investigated some of the structural determinants of PSP-A that are relevant to the inhibitory process. The PSP-A was isolated from rats given an intratracheal instillation of silica. The yield of PSP-A from silica-treated animals was 20-40-fold higher than that obtained from untreated animals. Reduction of PSP-A with 2-mercaptoethanol caused a reversible loss of biological activity that was restored by mild oxidation. Alkylation of the protein with excess iodoacetamide also led to inactivation, although titration with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) indicated that the protein initially contained no free sulfhydryl moieties. Neither alkylation nor reduction plus alkylation completely prevented the formation of oligomers as determined by gel permeation analysis. The apparent molecular mass of PSP-A at 4 degrees C in low ionic strength buffers was 1.6 megadaltons, and at 37 degrees C in normal ionic strength buffers was greater than 1.5 megadaltons. Removal of the oligosaccharide moiety with endoglycosidase F also had no effect upon biological activity. Five distinct monoclonal antibodies recognizing peptides epitopes on PSP-A were produced. All monoclonal antibodies exhibited similar affinity for PSP-A and recognized the delipidated and deglycosylated form. Four monoclonal antibodies reacted with epitopes on PSP-A that altered its function as an inhibitor. One monoclonal antibody was clearly ineffective at altering the activity of PSP-A. These results demonstrate that: 1) disulfide bonds are required for the activity of PSP-A, 2) disruption of disulfides does not prevent the formation of oligomeric forms of PSP-A, 3) the oligosaccharide moiety is not essential for biological activity, and 4) monoclonal antibodies can be used to map the epitopes responsible for biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2083191700,"The yeast plasmid 2 micron circle actively maintains high but stable copy levels in the cell, even though the plasmid confers no selective advantage to its host. To address the mechanism by which stable copy control is achieved, we have examined the level of expression of the genes resident on the yeast plasmid 2 micron circle as a function of the presence of proteins encoded by the plasmid. We find that transcription of the site-specific recombinase gene, FLP, is repressed at least 100-fold by the concerted action of the products of two other plasmid genes, REP1 and REP2. In addition, these products repress transcription of the REP1 gene itself. These results can be formulated into a consistent model for plasmid copy control."
https://openalex.org/W1492038348,"Vitronectin is a glycoprotein that mediates cell adhesion and spreading in a number of cell culture systems. Liposomes containing platelet glycoproteins IIb-IIIa complex have been shown to bind vitronectin-coated surfaces through an Arg-Gly-Asp cell attachment mechanism. We examined the expression of the binding sites for vitronectin on the surface of intact, resting platelets and following stimulation. 125I-Labeled vitronectin bound specifically in a saturable manner to platelets treated with physiological concentrations of thrombin. The binding reached saturation at 100 nM concentration, and, at saturation, approximately 5000 specific binding sites were detected per platelet. The binding was divalent cation-dependent and only partially reversible after complete saturation. A synthetic hexapeptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence inhibited vitronectin binding to platelets. A monoclonal antibody against platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex also inhibited the binding of vitronectin to stimulated platelets. These data suggest that platelets possess an inducible divalent cation-dependent receptor for vitronectin and that the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex is involved in the expression of the vitronectin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1520380437,"We have investigated the role that ATP plays in the synthesis of accurately initiated transcripts from the adenovirus 2 major late and mouse interleukin-3 promoters by a purified RNA polymerase II transcription system prepared from rat liver. The synthesis of 250-330 nucleotide run-off transcripts and 4-9 nucleotide Sarkosyl-resistant transcription intermediates requires ATP both for RNA synthesis and for activation of the system prior to RNA synthesis. Activation specifically requires an adenine nucleoside triphosphate containing a hydrolyzable beta, gamma-phosphoanhydride bond. ATP, adenine-9-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (araATP), and dATP are potent activators of transcription; they activate transcription to 50% of maximum at 2 microM. ATP analogs containing nonhydrolyzable beta, gamma-phosphoanhydride bonds such as adenyl-5'-yl imidodephosphate, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate, and adenosine 5'-O-(thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S) function efficiently in chain elongation, but do not activate transcription. Furthermore, ATP gamma S is a potent, reversible inhibitor of ATP activation. 20 microM ATP gamma S inhibits the synthesis of both full-length run-off transcripts and sarkosyl-resistant intermediates by 50% when the concentration of ATP is 10 microM. ATP gamma S inhibition can be overcome by high concentrations of ATP, dATP, araATP, or ddATP. Inhibition of the synthesis of Sarkosyl-resistant transcription intermediates by ATP gamma S is prevented by preincubation of the transcription enzymes and DNA template with ATP and magnesium prior to the addition of ATP gamma S and the remaining ribonucleoside triphosphates. Thus we argue that ATP activates the transcription system in a step prior to RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1535079527,"Weak stringent or relaxed responses were induced in Escherichia coli (relA+), using mild amino acid starvation or treatment with chloramphenicol at low concentrations, respectively, such that the growth rate was barely reduced. In this manner, the intracellular concentration of the nucleotide guanosine tetraphosphate, ppGpp, could be varied in any desired range between 0 and 1000 pmol of ppGpp per OD460 unit of culture mass. At the same time, the rate of synthesis of stable RNA (rs; rRNA and tRNA) was measured, relative to the total instantaneous rate of RNA synthesis (rt). The correlation between the cytoplasmic concentration of ppGpp and stable RNA gene activity (rs/rt) was the same as that observed previously with relA+ and relA strains growing exponentially at different rates in different media. This suggests that the distinction between growth control and stringent control of stable RNA synthesis is arbitrary, and that both kinds of control reflect the same ppGpp-dependent phenomenon. By increasing the stable RNA gene dosage, using high copy number plasmids carrying an rrn gene, we have tested the idea that ppGpp partitions the bacterial RNA polymerase into two forms with different probabilities to initiate at stable RNA and mRNA promoters. The relaxed response was not significantly altered, but the extent of the stringent response was reduced by the presence of extra rrn genes. The results agree with quantitative predictions derived from the RNA polymerase partitioning hypothesis."

Second, trimerization begins within 1 to 2 min following synthesis, with a half-time of approximately 5 min. Third, trimerization occurs only after the HA has been transported from the endoplasmic reticulum. Fourth, newly formed trimers are sensitive to acid-induced conformational alterations associated with viral fusion activity."
https://openalex.org/W1533515471,"The cytotoxic effects of gliotoxin (Mullbacher, A., and Eichner, R. D. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 3835-3837), a fungal secondary metabolite, and related epipolythiodioxopiperazines have been investigated using plasmid and eukaryotic DNA. Incubation of the dithiol derivative of these compounds with DNA and Fe3+ is sufficient to cause single- and double-stranded breaks as determined by neutral agarose gel electrophoresis. The disulfide form is inactive except in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, such as reduced glutathione, dithiothreitol, or reduced pyridine coenzymes. The autooxidation of these dithiols produces reducing equivalents as evidenced by (i) the production of H2O2 and (ii) the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive products when incubated with deoxyribose. The latter process is inhibited by ethanol and desferrioxamine. The DNA damage is abrogated by metal chelators and catalase. We conclude that the antiproliferative action of gliotoxin may be caused by DNA damage effected by reactive oxygen species or other radicals generated through redox cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1523173450,"It was previously reported that monoclonal IgM from two patients with gammopathy and neuropathy showed similar specificity by reacting with the same group of unidentified minor components in the ganglioside fractions of human nervous tissues (Ilyas, A.

Enzymatic degradation, ion-exchange chromatography, and immunostaining of purified ganglioside standards on thin-layer chromatograms have now revealed that the antigenic glycolipids recognized by the IgM from these patients are gangliosides GalNAc beta 1-4Gal(3-2 alpha NeuAc)beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer(GM2), GalNAc beta 1-4Gal(3-2 alpha NeuAc)beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer (IV4GalNAcGM1b), and GalNAc beta 1-4Gal(3-2 alpha NeuAc)beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4 beta Gal(3-2 alpha NeuAc)beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1-Cer (IV4GalNAcGD1a). The monoclonal IgM appears to be reacting with the terminal [GalNAc beta 1-4Gal(3-2 alpha NeuAc)beta 1-] moiety shared by these three gangliosides and is a useful probe for detecting small amounts of GM2, IV4GalNAcGM1b, IV4GalNAcGD1a, and other gangliosides with the same terminal sugar configuration in tissues. Species distribution studies using the antibody revealed that GM2 is present in the brains and nerves of all species examined, while IV4GalNAcGM1b and IV4GalNAcGD1a exhibit some striking species specificity. GM2, but not IV4GalNAcGD1a, is enriched in purified myelin from human brain."

Using this technique, we have studied the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle passively loaded with 5 mM Ca2+. The effect of known effectors (adenine nucleotides and caffeine) and inhibitors (Mg2+ and ruthenium red) of this release were investigated. In a medium composed of 100 mM KCl buffered at pH 6.8 with 20 mM K/3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid the Ca2+ release rate was maximal (500 nmol of Ca2+ released.(mg of protein)-1.s-1) at 1 micron external Ca2+ and 5 mM ATP. We also observed a rapid Ca2+ release induced by micromolar Ag+ in the presence of ATP (at 1 nM Ca2+). The Ag+-induced Ca2+ release was totally inhibited by 5 micron ruthenium red. We have also investigated the effect of monovalent ions on the Ca2+ release elicited by Ca2+ or Ag+. We show that the Ca2+ release rate: 1) was dependent upon the presence of K+ or Na+ in the release medium and 2) was influenced by a K+ gradient created across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. These results directly support the idea of the involvement of an influx of K+ (through K+ channels) during the Ca2+ release and allow to reconsider a possible influence of the membrane potential of the sarcoplasmic reticulum on the Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W1607145485,"To study the three-dimensional organization of alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) from human plasma, immunoelectron microscopy of negatively stained specimens was used. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificities typical for the two major conformers of alpha 2M (native and protease-transformed) was explored. The mAb have been selected and were classified biochemically as specific for either native or transformed alpha 2M or as reactive with both conformers. Furthermore, among the mAb that were specific for the proteinase-transformed form of alpha 2M, those reacting with the 20-kDa receptor-binding domain were considered a fourth category. Immunoelectron microscopy with these 20-kDa receptor-binding domain-specific mAb yielded the most typical result: predominantly, individual H-like alpha 2M-chymotrypsin molecules were complexed with two IgG molecules, each one bound to the extremities of two arms of the H-like figure. The resulting planar complex has the appearance of a dumbbell. Since this was observed with eight different mAb of this specificity, the result is interpreted to mean that the 20-kDa receptor-binding domain is compact and constitutes the outermost domain at the extremes of the arms of the H-like transformed alpha 2M. The mAb which are specific for the transformed state of alpha 2M but which do not react with the 20-kDa receptor-binding domain, also bound at the arms of the H-like figure, but at nonterminal positions. Moreover, these mAb produced mostly linear, chain-like immune complexes of numerous H-like alpha 2M molecules cross-linked by the IgG. The large category of mAb that reacted with both conformers of alpha 2M (native and proteinase complex) were observed to make various types of immune complexes with intra- and intermolecular cross-linking by the IgG. The observations of reaction of these mAb with Cd2+-induced dimers (half-molecules of alpha 2M), either native or transformed, proved helpful and, for certain mAb, essential to understand the organization of the alpha 2M-IgG complexes. Combined, the observations allow us to propose new models for the three-dimensional organization of native and chymotrypsin-transformed dimeric and tetrameric human alpha 2M."
https://openalex.org/W1540478742,"Dibutyryl cyclic GMP (Bu2cGMP) inhibited agonist-induced secretion of amylase from isolated rat pancreatic acini. In contrast to previous studies, this inhibitory action was not confined to butyryl derivatives of cyclic GMP, since the membrane-permeant cyclic GMP analogues Bu2cGMP and cyclic 8-bromo-GMP (8-Br-cGMP) were equipotent (IC50 2 nM) in their inhibition of amylase secretion stimulated by cholecystokinin-(26-33)-octapeptide (CCK8): at extracellular concentrations up to 1 mM, cyclic GMP itself was devoid of inhibitory activity. Both Bu2cGMP and 8-Br-cGMP also potently inhibited secretion stimulated by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (IC50 6 nM), but only partially inhibited responses elicited by bethanechol or bombesin and were without effect on A23187-evoked secretion. Furthermore, agents that are known to raise intracellular cyclic GMP levels (MB22948 (2-o-propoxyphenyl-8-azapurin-6-one) or nitroprusside) or antagonize the actions of protein kinase C (4 alpha-PMA or staurosporine), also inhibited CCK8- or PMA-stimulated secretion but not secretion elicited by bombesin, bethanechol, or A23187. It is concluded from these and other observations reported here that protein kinase C is the major intracellular mediator of amylase secretion stimulated by CCK8 and that this pathway may be regulated by cyclic GMP at a step that follows protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1561957445,"Factors affecting the association of apolipoprotein E (apoE) with human plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were investigated in experiments in which the lipid content of the lipoprotein was modified either by lipid transfer in the absence of lipolysis or through the action of lipoprotein lipase. In both cases, lipoprotein particles initially containing no apoE (VLDL-E), isolated by heparin affinity chromatography, were modified until they had the same lipid composition as native apoE-containing VLDL (VLDL+E) from the same plasma. Transfer-modified lipoproteins, unlike native VLDL+E, did not bind apoE or interact with heparin. In contrast, VLDL-E, whose lipid composition was modified to the same extent by lipase, bound apoE and bound to heparin under the same conditions as native VLDL+E. A structural protein (apolipoprotein B) epitope characteristic of VLDL+E was expressed during lipolysis prior to ApoE or heparin binding. The data suggest that the reaction of apoE with VLDL-E is a two-step reaction. The appearance of apoB is modified during lipolysis, with expression of a major heparin-binding site. The modified VLDL then becomes competent to bind apoE. The lipid composition of VLDL appears not to be a major factor in the ability of VLDL to bind apoE or to bind to heparin."

https://openalex.org/W1588256140,"Tay-Sachs disease is a biochemically heterogeneous lysosomal storage disorder caused by lack of the A isoenzyme of beta-hexosaminidase; the underlying defect is a mutation in the gene encoding the alpha-chain. It has been shown that fibroblasts isolated from Tay-Sachs patients of Ashkenazi Jewish origin contain no alpha-chain mRNA detectable on Northern blots. We now have compared run-on transcription in nuclei isolated from three strains of Ashkenazi Tay-Sachs fibroblasts and from a strain of normal (IMR90) cells. Using alpha-chain and beta-chain cDNAs as probes, we found no difference in the relative amount of [32P]ribonucleotide added to nascent transcripts; the average ratio of alpha/beta hybridizable radioactivity was 1.3 and 1.4 for mutant and normal cells, respectively. The identity of the Tay-Sachs alpha-chain transcript was confirmed by competition hybridization with excess alpha-chain mRNA. The results indicate that the Ashkenazi Tay-Sachs mutation permits a normal level of transcription of the alpha-chain gene and points to a posttranscriptional defect, such as RNA processing, transport, or stability."

https://openalex.org/W1537844383,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is generally considered to stimulate phosphoinositide turnover resulting in activation of protein kinase C and increased cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. We have examined the role of these secondary effects in regulation of c-myc mRNA accumulation in the MG-63 human osteogenic sarcoma line. Treatment of quiescent cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to down-regulate protein kinase C inhibited TPA-stimulated c-myc expression but did not affect the PDGF-modulated process. When cytoplasmic [Ca2+] was increased by addition of a Ca2+ ionophore (A23187 or ionomycin), no stimulation of c-myc RNA was seen; furthermore, these agents did not enhance the PDGF-modulated c-myc expression. Addition of EGTA to cultures treated with both PDGF and a Ca2+ ionophore did not inhibit c-myc induction but rather caused a superinduction of c-myc RNA accumulation. Superinduction occurred only if the [EGTA] was greater than [Ca2+] in the medium. This superinduction was distinct from the increased induction caused by inhibition of protein synthesis. Because PDGF-induced c-myc expression is independent of protein kinase C and increased cytoplasmic [Ca2+], the evidence suggests that PDGF modulates c-myc RNA accumulation in MG-63 cells via a novel pathway, seemingly uncoupled from the classic action of increased phosphoinositide metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1495253133,"The properties of the two monoclonal antibodies which were found to inhibit cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP)-stimulated abortive initiation without affecting cAMP binding (Li, X.-M., and Krakow, J. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4378-4383) have been characterized. Binding of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 66C3 to CRP is stimulated by cAMP while CRP binding by mAb 63B2 is not affected by cAMP. Binding of cAMP-CRP-mAb 63B2 to the lac P+ DNA is completely inhibited. Whereas cAMP-CRP forms a stable complex only at the CRP site 1 of the lac P+ promoter fragment, cAMP-CRP-mAb 66C3 binds to both site 1 and site 2. DNase I footprinting using a HpaII fragment carrying only the lac site 2 does not show any protection by cAMP-CRP-mAb 66C3. With the lac L8UV5 promoter, binding is not seen at either the L8 site 1 or the unaltered site 2. In the presence of 25% glycerol, cAMP-CRP-mAb 66C3 binds to both L8 site 1 and site 2. RNA polymerase is unable to bind to the cAMP-CRP-mAb 66C3-lac P+ complex. In the presence of RNA polymerase, cAMP-CRP forms a stable complex at the L8 site 1, the subsequent addition of mAb 66C3 results in the release of CRP. The CRP present in the lac P+ open promoter complex is partially resistant to subsequent incubation with mAb 66C3. The results provide further evidence regarding possible contacts between CRP and RNA polymerase involved in establishing the open promoter complex."

https://openalex.org/W1592581498,"Abstract An assay that employs guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) was used to measure correct initiation of RNA chains in isolated cell nuclei, where chromatin structure is relatively undisturbed. RNA chains initiated with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) were separated from the remaining RNA by mercury-Sepharose column chromatography and analyzed for correctly initiated mouse mammary tumor virus RNA with a T1 nuclease protection assay. The monovalent cation concentration dependence for initiation in isolated nuclei was similar to that previously observed for initiation from naked DNA templates (optimum near 90 mM) but different from that for elongation of nascent RNA chains. However, in contrast to the systems that employ naked DNA templates, initiation efficiency in the nuclear system was relatively unaffected by moderate changes in pH (6.7-8.3), temperature (25-37 degrees C), and magnesium ion concentration (1-9 mM). The optimized assay was used to assess the inhibitory activity of several compounds that have been reported to be specific inhibitors of transcription initiation on naked DNA templates. Both Sarkosyl and heparin were effective inhibitors of specific initiation by RNA polymerases I and II in isolated nuclei without inhibiting elongation of nascent chains, but 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside was relatively ineffective as a specific inhibitor of initiation by RNA polymerase II."
