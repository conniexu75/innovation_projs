https://openalex.org/W2565834876,"Accumulating data suggest that metastatic dissemination often occurs early during tumour formation, but the mechanisms of early metastatic spread have not yet been addressed. Here, by studying metastasis in a HER2-driven mouse breast cancer model, we show that progesterone-induced signalling triggers migration of cancer cells from early lesions shortly after HER2 activation, but promotes proliferation in advanced primary tumour cells. The switch from migration to proliferation was regulated by increased HER2 expression and tumour-cell density involving microRNA-mediated progesterone receptor downregulation, and was reversible. Cells from early, low-density lesions displayed more stemness features, migrated more and founded more metastases than cells from dense, advanced tumours. Notably, we found that at least 80% of metastases were derived from early disseminated cancer cells. Karyotypic and phenotypic analysis of human disseminated cancer cells and primary tumours corroborated the relevance of these findings for human metastatic dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2545421204,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders that affect distinct brain regions, progress at different rates, and exhibit specific patterns of tau accumulation. The source of this diversity is unknown. We previously characterized two tau strains that stably maintain unique conformations in vitro and in vivo, but did not determine the relationship of each strain to parameters that discriminate between tauopathies such as regional vulnerability or rate of spread. We have now isolated and characterized 18 tau strains in cells based on detailed biochemical and biological criteria. Inoculation of PS19 transgenic tau (P301S) mice with these strains causes strain-specific intracellular pathology in distinct cell types and brain regions, and induces different rates of network propagation. In this system, strains alone are sufficient to account for diverse neuropathological presentations, similar to those that define human tauopathies. Further study of these strains can thus establish a structural logic that governs these biological effects."

https://openalex.org/W2563923631,"The Ca2+-activated K+ channel, Slo1, has an unusually large conductance and contains a voltage sensor and multiple chemical sensors. Dual activation by membrane voltage and Ca2+ renders Slo1 central to processes that couple electrical signalling to Ca2+-mediated events such as muscle contraction and neuronal excitability. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a full-length Slo1 channel from Aplysia californica in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The channel adopts an open conformation. Its voltage-sensor domain adopts a non-domain-swapped attachment to the pore and contacts the cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding domain from a neighbouring subunit. Unique structural features of the Slo1 voltage sensor suggest that it undergoes different conformational changes than other known voltage sensors. The structure reveals the molecular details of three distinct divalent cation-binding sites identified through electrophysiological studies of mutant Slo1 channels."

Here we report the sequencing and de novo assembly of the genome of the tiger tail seahorse, Hippocampus comes . Comparative genomic analysis identifies higher protein and nucleotide evolutionary rates in H. comes compared with other teleost fish genomes. We identified an astacin metalloprotease gene family that has undergone expansion and is highly expressed in the male brood pouch. We also find that the H. comes genome lacks enamel matrix protein-coding proline/glutamine-rich secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein genes, which might have led to the loss of mineralized teeth. tbx4 , a regulator of hindlimb development, is also not found in H. comes genome. Knockout of tbx4 in zebrafish showed a ‘pelvic fin-loss’ phenotype similar to that of seahorses."

https://openalex.org/W2562383183,"The precise control of an ion channel gate by environmental stimuli is crucial for the fulfilment of its biological role. The gate in Slo1 K+ channels is regulated by two separate stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane voltage. Slo1 is thus central to understanding the relationship between intracellular Ca2+ and membrane excitability. Here we present the Slo1 structure from Aplysia californica in the absence of Ca2+ and compare it with the Ca2+-bound channel. We show that Ca2+ binding at two unique binding sites per subunit stabilizes an expanded conformation of the Ca2+ sensor gating ring. These conformational changes are propagated from the gating ring to the pore through covalent linkers and through protein interfaces formed between the gating ring and the voltage sensors. The gating ring and the voltage sensors are directly connected through these interfaces, which allow membrane voltage to regulate gating of the pore by influencing the Ca2+ sensors."

https://openalex.org/W2560874509,"Objective Acupuncture has become popular and widely practiced in many countries around the world. Despite the large amount of acupuncture-related literature that has been published, broader trends in the prevalence and scope of acupuncture research remain underexplored. The current study quantitatively analyzes trends in acupuncture research publications in the past 20 years. Methods A bibliometric approach was used to search PubMed for all acupuncture-related research articles including clinical and animal studies. Inclusion criteria were articles published between 1995 and 2014 with sufficient information for bibliometric analyses. Rates and patterns of acupuncture publication within the 20 year observational period were estimated, and compared with broader publication rates in biomedicine. Identified eligible publications were further analyzed with respect to study type/design, clinical condition addressed, country of origin, and journal impact factor. Results A total of 13,320 acupuncture-related publications were identified using our search strategy and eligibility criteria. Regression analyses indicated an exponential growth in publications over the past two decades, with a mean annual growth rate of 10.7%. This compares to a mean annual growth rate of 4.5% in biomedicine. A striking trend was an observed increase in the proportion of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), from 7.4% in 1995 to 20.3% in 2014, exceeding the 4.5% proportional growth of RCTs in biomedicine. Over the 20 year period, pain was consistently the most common focus of acupuncture research (37.9% of publications). Other top rankings with respect to medical focus were arthritis, neoplasms/cancer, pregnancy or labor, mood disorders, stroke, nausea/vomiting, sleep, and paralysis/palsy. Acupuncture research was conducted in 60 countries, with the top 3 contributors being China (47.4%), United States (17.5%), and United Kingdom (8.2%). Retrieved articles were published mostly in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) journals with impact factors ranging between 0.7 and 2.8 in the top 20 journals, followed by journals specializing in neuroscience, pain, anesthesia/analgesia, internal medicine and comprehensive fields. Conclusion Acupuncture research has grown markedly in the past two decades, with a 2-fold higher growth rate than for biomedical research overall. Both the increases in the proportion of RCTs and the impact factor of journals support that the quality of published research has improved. While pain was a consistently dominant research focus, other topics gained more attention during this time period. These findings provide a context for analyzing strengths and gaps in the current state of acupuncture research, and for informing a comprehensive strategy for further advancing the field."
https://openalex.org/W2567438393,"Young stars are associated with prominent outflows of molecular gas. The ejection of gas is believed to remove angular momentum from the protostellar system, permitting young stars to grow by the accretion of material from the protostellar disk. The underlying mechanism for outflow ejection is not yet understood, but is believed to be closely linked to the protostellar disk. Various models have been proposed to explain the outflows, differing mainly in the region where acceleration of material takes place: close to the protostar itself ('X-wind', or stellar wind), in a larger region throughout the protostellar disk (disk wind), or at the interface between the two. Outflow launching regions have so far been probed only by indirect extrapolation because of observational limits. Here we report resolved images of carbon monoxide towards the outflow associated with the TMC1A protostellar system. These data show that gas is ejected from a region extending up to a radial distance of 25 astronomical units from the central protostar, and that angular momentum is removed from an extended region of the disk. This demonstrates that the outflowing gas is launched by an extended disk wind from a Keplerian disk."
https://openalex.org/W2543622711,"Mutations in several genes encoding centrosomal proteins dramatically decrease the size of the human brain. We show that Aspm (abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly-associated) and Wdr62 (WD repeat-containing protein 62) interact genetically to control brain size, with mice lacking Wdr62, Aspm, or both showing gene dose-related centriole duplication defects that parallel the severity of the microcephaly and increased ectopic basal progenitors, suggesting premature delamination from the ventricular zone. Wdr62 and Aspm localize to the proximal end of the mother centriole and interact physically, with Wdr62 required for Aspm localization, and both proteins, as well as microcephaly protein Cep63, required to localize CENPJ/CPAP/Sas-4, a final common target. Unexpectedly, Aspm and Wdr62 are required for normal apical complex localization and apical epithelial structure, providing a plausible unifying mechanism for the premature delamination and precocious differentiation of progenitors. Together, our results reveal links among centrioles, apical proteins, and cell fate, and illuminate how alterations in these interactions can dynamically regulate brain size."
https://openalex.org/W2564225457,"Background Despite numerous studies of geographic variation in healthcare cost and utilization at the local, regional, and state levels across the U.S., a comprehensive characterization of geographic variation in outcomes has not been published. Our objective was to quantify variation in US health outcomes in an all-payer population before and after risk-adjustment. Methods and Findings We used information from 16 independent data sources, including 22 million all-payer inpatient admissions from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (which covers regions where 50% of the U.S. population lives) to analyze 24 inpatient mortality, inpatient safety, and prevention outcomes. We compared outcome variation at state, hospital referral region, hospital service area, county, and hospital levels. Risk-adjusted outcomes were calculated after adjusting for population factors, co-morbidities, and health system factors. Even after risk-adjustment, there exists large geographical variation in outcomes. The variation in healthcare outcomes exceeds the well publicized variation in US healthcare costs. On average, we observed a 2.1-fold difference in risk-adjusted mortality outcomes between top- and bottom-decile hospitals. For example, we observed a 2.3-fold difference for risk-adjusted acute myocardial infarction inpatient mortality. On average a 10.2-fold difference in risk-adjusted patient safety outcomes exists between top and bottom-decile hospitals, including an 18.3-fold difference for risk-adjusted Central Venous Catheter Bloodstream Infection rates. A 3.0-fold difference in prevention outcomes exists between top- and bottom-decile counties on average; including a 2.2-fold difference for risk-adjusted congestive heart failure admission rates. The population, co-morbidity, and health system factors accounted for a range of R2 between 18–64% of variability in mortality outcomes, 3–39% of variability in patient safety outcomes, and 22–70% of variability in prevention outcomes. Conclusion The amount of variability in health outcomes in the U.S. is large even after accounting for differences in population, co-morbidities, and health system factors. These findings suggest that: 1) additional examination of regional and local variation in risk-adjusted outcomes should be a priority; 2) assumptions of uniform hospital quality that underpin rationale for policy choices (such as narrow insurance networks or antitrust enforcement) should be challenged; and 3) there exists substantial opportunity for outcomes improvement in the US healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2575658961,"Nod-like receptor family card containing 4 (NLRC4)/Ipaf is involved in recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns leading to caspase-1 activation and cytokine release, which mediate protective innate immune response. Point mutations in NLRC4 cause autoinflammatory syndromes. Although all the mutations result in constitutive caspase-1 activation, their phenotypic presentations are different, implying that these mutations cause different alterations in properties of NLRC4. NLRC4 interacts with SUG1 and induces caspase-8-mediated cell death. Here, we show that one of the autoinflammatory syndrome-causing mutants of NLRC4, H443P, but not T337A and V341A, constitutively activates caspase-8 and induces apoptotic cell death in human lung epithelial cells. Compared with wild type NLRC4, the H443P mutant shows stronger interaction with SUG1 and with ubiquitinated cellular proteins. Phosphorylation of NLRC4 at Ser533 plays a crucial role in caspase-8 activation and cell death. However, H443P mutant does not require Ser533 phosphorylation for caspase-8 activation and cell death. Caspase-8 activation by NLRC4 and its H443P mutant are dependent on the adaptor protein FADD. A phosphomimicking mutant of NLRC4, S533D does not require SUG1 activity for inducing cell death. Ubiquitin-tagged NLRC4 could induce cell death and activate caspase-8 independent of Ser533 phosphorylation. Our work suggests that SUG1-mediated signaling results in enhanced ubiquitination and regulates FADD-dependent caspase-8 activation by NLRC4. We show that the autoinflammation-associated H443P mutant is altered in interaction with SUG1 and ubiquitinated proteins, triggering constitutive caspase-8-mediated cell death dependent on FADD but independent of Ser533 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2572210247,"The Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4) is implicated in controlling cell cycle, DNA damage repair, and checkpoint response based on studies employing cell lines and mouse models. CRL4 proteins, including CUL4A and CUL4B, are often highly accumulated in human malignancies. Elevated CRL4 attenuates DNA damage repair and increases genome instability that is believed to facilitate tumorigenesis. However, this has yet to be evaluated in human patients with cancer. In our study, 352 lung cancer and 62 normal lung specimens of Asian origin were constructed into tissue microarrays of four distinct lung cancer subtypes. Expression of CUL4A, CUL4B, and their substrates was detected by immunohistochemistry and analyzed statistically for their prognostic value and association with DNA damage response and genomic instability. Our results show that both CUL4A and CUL4B are overexpressed in the majority of lung carcinomas (PCUL4A <0.001 and PCUL4B <0.001) and significantly associated with tumor size (PCUL4A <0.001 and PCUL4B = 0.002), lymphatic invasion (PCUL4A = 0.004 and PCUL4B <0.001), metastasis (PCUL4A = 0.019 and PCUL4B = 0.006), and advanced TNM stage (PCUL4A <0.001 and PCUL4B <0.001), which parallels gene amplification and abnormal activation of the canonical WNT signaling. Moreover, overexpression of CUL4A, but not CUL4B, is significantly associated with tobacco smoking (p = 0.01) and is inversely correlated with XPC and P21, both of which are substrates of CUL4A (PCUL4A = 0.019 and PCUL4B = 0.006). Higher levels of CUL4A or CUL4B are significantly associated with the overall survival of patients (PCUL4A <0.001 and PCUL4B <0.001) and progression-free survival (PCUL4A <0.001 and PCUL4B = 0.001). Our findings revealed that CUL4A and CUL4B are differentially associated with etiologic factors for pulmonary malignancies and are independent prognostic markers for the survival of distinct lung cancer subtypes.

Our findings revealed that CUL4A and CUL4B are differentially associated with etiologic factors for pulmonary malignancies and are independent prognostic markers for the survival of distinct lung cancer subtypes. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The death rate of lung cancer has increased more than 800% in males and has more than doubled in females during the last 25 years (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2016; 66: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21983) Google Scholar). In recent years, intense investigations have led to an exponential increase in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer growth, metastasis, relapse, and drug resistance, resulting in the development of novel intervention strategies, such as EGF receptor mutation-targeted therapy by tarceva and irasa and immunotherapy by Nivolumab (Opdivo). However, these Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are directed against small subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer. Targeting a specific trait for managing different lung cancer subtypes remains a daunting task. The CRL4 ubiquitin ligase regulates a wide variety of cellular processes, including control of cell cycle, signal transduction, DNA repair, and embryonic development (2Kerzendorfer C. Whibley A. Carpenter G. Outwin E. Chiang S.C. Turner G. Schwartz C. El-Khamisy S. Raymond F.L. O'Driscoll M.

CRL4 contains four subunits, in which CUL4A or CUL4B serves as an elongated docking platform to assemble the ubiquitin ligase complex; the N-terminal region of CUL4 recruits substrates via the adaptor protein DDB1 and various DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor substrate receptors, whereas the C terminus of CRL4 binds to the RBX1/ROC1 adaptor that recruits ubiquitin-bearing E2 enzymes. As such, substrates and activated ubiquitin are brought into close proximity to facilitate ubiquitin transfer to the substrates (4Lee J. Zhou P.

CUL4A and CUL4B are also expressed at different stages of spermatogenesis, and germ line deletion of either cul4 gene results in male infertility (24Liu L. Yin Y. Li Y. Prevedel L. Lacy E.H. Ma L.

Therefore, CUL4A and CUL4B share overlapping functions in growth and survival, while also playing distinct roles in diverse cellular processes. In this study, we measured the expression of CUL4A and CUL4B in four different subtypes of lung carcinoma in patients of Asian ethnic group, including adenocarcinoma (ADC), large cell carcinoma (LCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and we analyzed the relationship between their expression levels and the clinicopathologic factors, as well as the OS and PFS of these patients. To determine the expression of CUL4A and CUL4B in lung cancers, subtype-specific lung cancer TMAs were constructed from 92 cases of ADC, 61 cases of LCC, 127 cases of SCC, 72 cases of SCLC, and 62 para-carcinoma tissues as control. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out with antibodies against CUL4A or CUL4B and scored by lung pathologists at TMUCIH using the two-way scoring system (28Kyo S. Sakaguchi J. Ohno S.

Unlike the low/negative expression in normal lung, significantly higher expression of CUL4A was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of lung carcinoma (p < 0.001; Fig. 1, A–E and K; Table 1). Approximately 50% of cases in each subtype of lung carcinoma express high levels of CUL4A, with ADC (48%), LCC (61%), SCC (46%), and SCLC (51%). CUL4B was expressed exclusively in the nucleus, and about half of the lung carcinoma cases displayed abnormally higher expression levels of CUL4B compared with normal lung (p < 0.001; Fig. 1, F–J and L; Table 1). Of all four subtypes, overexpression of CUL4B was detected in 49% ADC, 64% LCC, 50% SCC, and 54% SCLC. Among all the 352 cases, 33.2% had high expression of both CUL4A and CUL4B, whereas 29.8% were low CUL4A and CUL4B expressers.TABLE 1CUL4A and CUL4B expression in lung carcinoma patientsTotal no. of casesCUL4A, case no.

High expression of CUL4A was significantly associated with tumor size (p < 0.001), presence of lymphatic invasion (p = 0.004), metastasis (p = 0.019), and advanced TNM stage (p < 0.001), suggesting the crucial role of CUL4A in lung carcinoma growth and progression (Table 2). CUL4A was recently shown to inhibit nucleotide excision repair (15Liu L. Lee S. Zhang J. Peters S.B. Hannah J. Zhang Y. Yin Y. Koff A. Ma L. Zhou P. CUL4A abrogation augments DNA damage response and protection against skin carcinogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a key DNA repair pathway that removes alkylating DNA adducts induced by cigarette smoking or environmental pollutions. Indeed, high CUL4A expression is significantly associated with tobacco smoking (p = 0.010), suggesting that CUL4A could be a smoking-related risk factor for lung carcinogenesis among smokers. However, CUL4A is not related to the smoking score in smokers (Table 3). More interestingly, the association between CUL4A expression and tobacco smoking was found to be subtype-specific; in SCC and SCLC that are known as smoking-related subtypes (31Morabia A. Wynder E.L. Cigarette smoking and lung cancer cell types.Cancer. 1991; 68: 2074-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Selamat S.A. Galler J.S. Joshi A.D. Fyfe M.N. Campan M. Siegmund K.D. Kerr K.M. Laird-Offringa I.A. DNA methylation changes in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, and lung adenocarcinoma.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e21443Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the correlation between CUL4A expression and smoking is statistically significant (PSCC = 0.002 and PSCLC = 0.019) (Table 4). In ADC and LCC, which are not directly related to smoking (31Morabia A. Wynder E.L. Cigarette smoking and lung cancer cell types.Cancer. 1991; 68: 2074-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Selamat S.A. Galler J.S. Joshi A.D. Fyfe M.N. Campan M. Siegmund K.D. Kerr K.M. Laird-Offringa I.A. DNA methylation changes in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, and lung adenocarcinoma.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e21443Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), there was no correlation between CUL4A and tobacco smoking (p > 0.05). Instead, CUL4A overexpression was found to significantly associate with TNM stage in ADC (p < 0.001) and LCC (p < 0.001) but not SCC or SCLC (p > 0.05). Moreover, different subtypes of lung cancer displayed certain level of divergences in clinicopathologic parameters in relation to CUL4A status; tumor size was related to CUL4A expression in ADC (p = 0.013), SCC (p = 0.037), and SCLC (p = 0.035) but not in LCC (p = 0.239); the presence of lymphatic invasion was associated with high expression of CUL4A in both ADC (p = 0.012) and LCC (p = 0.006), whereas distant metastasis showed positive correlation with CUL4A expression only in ADC (p = 0.001) (Table 4).TABLE 2Association between clinicopathologic factors and CUL4A/CUL4B expressionVariableCase no.

Contrary to CUL4A, CUL4B expression is not significantly associated with tobacco smoking (p = 0.085) except in SCLC (p < 0.001) (TABLE 2, TABLE 4), consistent with the finding that CUL4B inactivation had no effect on NER activity in primary cells (15Liu L. Lee S. Zhang J. Peters S.B. Hannah J. Zhang Y. Yin Y. Koff A. Ma L. Zhou P. CUL4A abrogation augments DNA damage response and protection against skin carcinogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Subtype-specific associations between CUL4B and clinicopathologic parameters were also observed (Table 4). In ADC, CUL4Bhigh cases had more advanced TNM stages (p < 0.001) and more prevalent lymphatic invasion (p = 0.001). In SCC, CUL4B was strongly associated with TNM stage (p < 0.001), tumor size (p = 0.034), lymphatic invasion (p = 0.003), and tumor metastasis (p = 0.021). CUL4B expression also correlated significantly with TNM stage in LCC (p = 0.030) and tumor size in SCLC (p = 0.045) (Table 4). Because of the unavailable survival information of 25 cases, 327 cases were included in the survival analysis. 192 (58.7%) were seen with disease progression post-surgery, and 161 (49.2%) patients eventually died of tumor within the follow-up period of 2 months to 125 months. The median OS was 40 months, and the median PFS was 25 months. To investigate whether CUL4A or CUL4B overexpression correlates with the survival probability of patients with lung cancer, survival analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2, both CUL4Ahigh and CUL4Bhigh patients had significantly worse prognosis than those with low levels of CUL4A or CUL4B expression. For all lung cancer cases, both CUL4A and CUL4B are of prognostic value for OS (PCUL4A < 0.001 and PCUL4B < 0.001) and PFS (PCUL4A < 0.001 and PCUL4B = 0.001) (Table 5 and Fig. 2), indicating patients with low expression of CUL4A or CUL4B had significantly longer survival than the high expressers. Furthermore, combination of CUL4A and CUL4B (CUL4Ahigh CUL4Bhigh) could serve as a better prognostic marker for poor OS and PFS than that of CUL4A or CUL4B alone; meanwhile, CUL4Alow CUL4Blow predicted more favorable OS and PFS (POS < 0.001 and PPFS < 0.001, Table 6 and Fig. 3). Aside from the expression of CUL4A and CUL4B, TNM stage, tumor size, lymphatic invasion, and tumor metastasis were also shown to significantly associate with OS and PFS (Table 5).TABLE 5Association between clinicopathologic factors and OS and PFS in lung carcinomaVariableCase no.

However, the underlying mechanisms of CD4+ T cell activation remain largely undefined. Our aim was to investigate whether the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) was associated with CD4+ T cell activation in DCM. CD4+ T cells from DCM patients showed increased expression levels of CD25 and CD69 and enhanced proliferation in response to anti-CD3/28, indicating an activated state. miRNA profiling analysis of magnetically sorted CD4+ T cells revealed a distinct pattern of miRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from DCM patients compared with controls. The level of miRNA-451a (miR-451a) was significantly decreased in the CD4+ T cells of DCM patients compared with that of the controls. The transfection of T cells with an miR-451a mimic inhibited their activation and proliferation, whereas an miR-451a inhibitor produced the opposite effects. Myc was directly inhibited by miR-451a via interaction with its 3′-UTR, thus identifying it as an miR-451a target in T cells. The knockdown of Myc suppressed the activation and proliferation of T cells, and the expression of Myc was significantly up-regulated at the mRNA level in CD4+ T cells from patients with DCM. A strong inverse correlation was observed between the Myc mRNA expression and miR-451a transcription level. Our data suggest that the down-regulation of miR-451a contributes to the activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells by targeting the transcription factor Myc in DCM patients and may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of DCM."

We previously demonstrated that the lipid environment is also a determinant of initial protein topology, which is dynamically responsive to post-assembly changes in membrane lipid composition. However, the effect on protein topology of post-assembly phosphorylation of amino acids localized within initially cytoplasmically oriented extramembrane domains has never been investigated. Here, we show in a controlled in vitro system that phosphorylation of a membrane protein can trigger a change in topological arrangement. The rate of change occurred on a scale of seconds, comparable with the rates observed upon changes in the protein lipid environment. The rate and extent of topological rearrangement were dependent on the charges of extramembrane domains and the lipid bilayer surface. Using model membranes mimicking the lipid compositions of eukaryotic organelles, we determined that anionic lipids, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and membrane fluidity play critical roles in these processes.

Changes in lipid environment, also associated with differences in membrane properties, occur during cell division, membrane fission and fusion, vesicular protein trafficking, and lateral movement of proteins in membranes (25van Meer G.

Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle.Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar). A TMD sequence analysis of membrane proteins with known organelle localization pointed out organelle specificity for TMD sequence and length (27Sharpe H.J. Stevens T.J. Munro S. A comprehensive comparison of transmembrane domains reveals organelle-specific properties.Cell. 2010; 142: 158-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, depending on their final destination, membrane proteins trafficking to their target organelle will encounter drastically different lipid environments. Therefore, it is likely that a sub-fraction of membrane proteins undergoes lipid-induced post-assembly changes in their topology (28Bowie J.U. Structural biology. Membrane protein twists and turns.Science. 2013; 339: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phosphokinase-specific phosphorylation is one the most widespread post-translational modifications in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although reversible phosphorylation is recognized to trigger significant conformational changes in a protein to regulate its function or mediate a signal transduction cascade, little is known about the consequences of post-translational phosphorylation of a membrane protein on its topological orientation. Only a limited number of examples have been reported where membrane protein phosphorylation was postulated to trigger a topological reorientation. The mechanism by which CD38 metabolizes adenosine 5′-diphosphate-ribose as an intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing messenger is still elusive. However, the ability of two interconverted populations of CD38 to co-exist was demonstrated recently (1Zhao Y.J. Lam C.M. Lee H.C. The membrane-bound enzyme CD38 exists in two opposing orientations.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: ra67Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle was suggested to control the orientation of the single TMD-spanning eukaryotic protein CD38 (1Zhao Y.J. Lam C.M. Lee H.C. The membrane-bound enzyme CD38 exists in two opposing orientations.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: ra67Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Zhao Y.J. Zhu W.J. Wang X.W. Zhang L.H. Lee H.C. Determinants of the membrane orientation of a calcium signaling enzyme CD38.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1853: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting a new topology-dependent mechanism regulating the signaling activity of CD38. Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSC1), which is also phosphorylated, undergoes topological changes during cell differentiation (30Herate C. Ramdani G. Grant N.J. Marion S. Gasman S. Niedergang F. Benichou S. Bouchet J. Phospholipid scramblase 1 modulates FcR-mediated phagocytosis in differentiated macrophages.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0145617Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence linking post-translational phosphorylation to TMD orientation has been reported. We hypothesize that naturally occurring phosphorylation within EMDs of membrane protein can serve as a physiological signal, which in the context of different phospholipid environments has the potential to result in a membrane protein adopting a new TMD organization and possibly a new function. If phosphorylation can induce a post-assembly inversion of protein TMDs, a new mechanism for regulation of membrane protein function would be uncovered. Herein, we have used a previously established fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay (21Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic membrane protein topological switching upon changes in phospholipid environment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 13874-13879Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to monitor EMD flipping now induced by phosphorylation. Using E. coli lactose permease (LacY) derivative as a complex model 12 TMD model membrane protein, wherein phosphorylation sites were genetically engineered, we have determined the rate and extent of phosphorylation-induced TMD flipping in vitro. Using proteoliposomes of various lipid compositions mimicking E. coli membranes and eukaryotic organelles, we have investigated the lipid dependence of phosphorylation-induced topological switching. We now demonstrate that phosphorylation of a membrane protein, which changes the effective net charge of an EMD, can induce a re-orientation of adjacent TMDs relative to the plane of the lipid bilayer. The switch proceeds at a physiologically significant rate as we demonstrated for lipid-induced TMD flipping (21Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic membrane protein topological switching upon changes in phospholipid environment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 13874-13879Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can introduce a new topogenic signal, which can be executed post-assembly outside of the translocon in a lipid- and organelle-dependent manner. Our results establish a novel post-translational mechanism for the dynamic regulation of the structure and function of membrane proteins, which is potentially widespread, thus expanding our knowledge of the roles played by membrane lipids in the establishment and maintenance of membrane protein topology. We sought to determine the effects of one of the most common post-translational modifications of EMDs on membrane protein dynamic organization, as a function of the lipid environment. We have developed a set of in vitro approaches to monitor membrane protein topology, both dynamically and at steady state, along with assessment of membrane properties. Our model membrane protein is LacY, a paradigm for secondary transporters throughout nature, for which we have characterized the effect of membrane anionic surface charge density contributed by lipid head groups and net charge of EMDs on topology. Assembly of LacY in vivo (16Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. A polytopic membrane protein displays a reversible topology dependent on membrane lipid composition.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or in vitro (20Vitrac H. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. In vitro reconstitution of lipid-dependent dual topology and postassembly topological switching of a membrane protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9338-9343Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in membranes or proteoliposomes, respectively, containing only anionic phospholipids (i.e. lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) results in the inversion of the topology of the N-terminal six-TMD bundle with respect to the C-terminal five-TMD bundle. In addition, TMD VII exits the membrane and is exposed to the normally periplasmic side of LacY. The same lipid-dependent inversion of LacY TMDs was verified in vitro using atomic force microscopy (31Serdiuk T. Sugihara J. Mari S.A. Kaback H.R. Müller D.J. Observing a lipid-dependent alteration in single lactose permeases.Structure. 2015; 23: 754-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that changing the net charge of cytoplasmic EMDs C2/C4/C6 of LacY (Fig. 1A) from +2/+2/+2 (WT LacY) to −2/−2/−2 results in topological inversion of the N-terminal six-TMD bundle of LacY in wild type E. coli cells, whereas a change to −2/0/−2 did not result in inversion (19Bogdanov M. Xie J. Heacock P. Dowhan W. To flip or not to flip: lipid-protein charge interactions are a determinant of final membrane protein topology.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These findings pointed us toward the use of two different LacY charge templates, −2/+2/+2 and −2/0/−2, the latter being closer to the topological switch threshold based on net charge of its EMDs. The charge templates −2/0/−2 (which contains the following mutations: K69E, K74E, K131E, K211E, and K218E) and −2/+2/+2 (which contains the following mutations: K69E and K74E) have been previously described (19Bogdanov M. Xie J. Heacock P. Dowhan W. To flip or not to flip: lipid-protein charge interactions are a determinant of final membrane protein topology.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Native LacY does not contain any known phosphorylation site; therefore, we engineered phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) EMD sites based on the lack of charged amino acids in their kinase consensus sequences. In proteoliposomes, native LacY presents an inside-out orientation (cytoplasmic domains outside) relative to whole cells. Therefore, we engineered phosphorylation site(s) into EMD C6, which will be accessible to the outside of the proteoliposomes composed of native lipid composition (Fig. 1A). The ability of PDK1 and LKB1 kinases (used either alone or in combination) to phosphorylate LacY was verified by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for phospho-Ser/Thr (Fig. 1B). First, we sought to determine the effect of phosphorylation on steady state LacY topology when reconstituted in proteoliposomes made of E. coli total lipids. Employing a single cysteine located in EMD C6 (Fig. 1A), we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method for determining TMD orientation (SCAM™) to analyze LacY TMD orientation in proteoliposomes before and after addition of kinase(s) (Fig. 2A). 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) is a biotinylated sulfhydryl-specific probe that is impermeable to proteoliposome membranes. Therefore, cysteines located on the outside of the proteoliposomes should be derivatized by MPB, whereas cysteines located in the lumen (inside) of the proteoliposomes should be protected, unless the membrane is solubilized before or during labeling (use of the detergent octyl glucoside (OG)). 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), another membrane-impermeable but non-biotinylated maleimide, was used to block exposed cysteines prior to MPB treatment, thus preventing biotinylation of outward-facing cysteines. We found that the two LacY charge templates behave differently upon phosphorylation, following the Charge Balance Rule. Addition of a single phosphate group in the −2/+2/+2 template does not lead to any inversion, although we observe mixed topology (∼80% inversion) in the −2/0/−2 template. Addition of two phosphate groups resulted in mixed topology for the −2/+2/+2 template and close to full inversion for the −2/0/−2 template. According to the Charge Balance Rule (8Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Vitrac H. Lipids and topological rules governing membrane protein assembly.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the zwitterionic net neutral lipid PE appears to dampen the translocation potential of negatively charged residues in cytoplasmic EMDs in favor of the retention potential of positively charged residues. The requirement for multiple phosphorylation events to induce near complete inversion of LacY EMD C6 is consistent with this previous observation. Next, we determined the rate of phosphorylation-induced TMD flipping in vitro to establish whether flipping proceeds at a physiologically significant rate as we demonstrated for lipid-induced TMD flipping. All the kinetic measurements were performed using LacY −2/0/−2 charge templates containing a single phosphorylation site (LKB1) engineered in EMD C6. The previously established FRET-based assay (21Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic membrane protein topological switching upon changes in phospholipid environment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 13874-13879Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used to monitor EMD flipping now induced by phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). The same established Trp residues, serving as donor for the FRET pair, were introduced in EMD NT or C6. V331C, whose topology is insensitive to lipid environment (17Vitrac H. Bogdanov M. Heacock P. Dowhan W. Lipids and topological rules of membrane protein assembly: balance between long- and short-range lipid-protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15182-15194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was labeled by 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) in the C-terminal TMD bundle of newly engineered LacY (Fig. 2B) to serve as the acceptor for the FRET pair. In the case of NT and C6 EMDs, high FRET indicates native orientation (both donor and acceptor in close proximity on the same side of the membrane), whereas low FRET indicates inverted orientation of LacY (donor and acceptor located across the membrane from each other). All controls directly linking fluorescence changes with the extent of topological changes followed by SCAM™ and lack of FRET signals from native Trp residues were previously established (21Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic membrane protein topological switching upon changes in phospholipid environment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 13874-13879Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Addition of excess kinase (so that phosphorylation is not rate-limiting) at 20 °C resulted in a flipping of the C6 EMD followed by a delayed yet faster flipping of the NT EMD on a time scale of seconds (Fig. 2B). The delayed flipping of EMD NT, compared with EMD C6, was previously observed for lipid-induced flipping. The faster phosphorylation-dependent flipping rate of EMD NT, compared with lipid-induced flipping, could be partially explained by the elimination of the charge pair Asp-68–Lys-131 (32Kwaw I. Zen K.C. Hu Y. Kaback H.R. Site-directed sulfhydryl labeling of the lactose permease of Escherichia coli: helices IV and V that contain the major determinants for substrate binding.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10491-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), resulting in a decreased protein stability. Such a modification was not present in the LacY template used to investigate the lipid-induced protein flipping. We previously showed that lipid-induced flipping at a physiological temperature of 37 °C was too fast to measure. These results fully support our hypothesis, indicating that increasing the negative charge of an EMD by phosphorylation can induce topological changes in a membrane protein. Therefore, topological switching can be triggered by sufficient EMD charge modifications, independent of changes in the lipid environment or any other cellular factors. Membrane lipid composition drastically varies among eukaryotic organelles. Besides additional phospholipid classes over those found in bacteria, eukaryotic organelles also contain sphingolipids and cholesterol. These various lipid species are extremely diverse, both in chemical and physical properties, leading to striking differences in organelle membrane properties such as membrane thickness, fluidity, asymmetry or surface charge. We sought to identify the effect of organelle membrane properties on the rate and extent of phosphorylation-triggered TMD flipping. Therefore, we used LacY reconstituted in proteoliposomes with lipid composition mimicking five canonical organelles (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, plasma membrane (PM), and endosomes) (25van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4480) Google Scholar). The phospholipid content of these model organelles is presented in Fig. 3A, along with E. coli total phospholipids. The detailed lipid composition of the various model organelles (with cholesterol approximating physiological levels) is presented in Table 1.TABLE 1Detailed lipid composition of the various model membranes used in this studySamplePhospholipidsChol/PL ratioPEPCPIPSPGCLSMmol %E. coli7500020500Mitochondria30475151200.1ER30501550000.15Golgi18558400150.2Endosomes27552100150.5PM25402.57.500251Mitochondria-No Chol30475151200ER-No Chol30501550000Golgi-No Chol18558400150Endosomes-No Chol27552100150PM-No Chol25402.57.500250Golgi-MoreNeg184581400150.2Golgi-MoreChol18558400151PM-MoreNeg25302.517.500251PM-LessChol25402.57.500250.2 Open table in a new tab As an indicator of lipid-dependent changes in cellular membrane properties, we examined the impact of proteoliposome lipid composition on membrane fluidity using Laurdan general polarization (GP) (33Stott B.M.

The more positive GP values indicate higher membrane order, whereas negative GP values correspond to disordered membranes with higher water content (i.e. membrane packing defects). The results (Fig. 3C), indicating the impact of lipid composition with particular emphasis on cholesterol, are in good agreement with previous measurements performed using Laurdan on membranes isolated from various prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (34Kaiser H.J.

https://openalex.org/W2542939531,"Johnston's organ is the largest mechanosensory organ in Drosophila; it analyzes movements of the antenna due to sound, wind, gravity, and touch. Different Johnston's organ neurons (JONs) encode distinct stimulus features. Certain JONs respond in a sustained manner to steady displacements, and these JONs subdivide into opponent populations that prefer push or pull displacements. Here, we describe neurons in the brain (aPN3 neurons) that combine excitation and inhibition from push/pull JONs in different ratios. Consequently, different aPN3 neurons are sensitive to movement in different parts of the antenna's range, at different frequencies, or at different amplitude modulation rates. We use a model to show how the tuning of aPN3 neurons can arise from rectification and temporal filtering in JONs, followed by mixing of JON signals in different proportions. These results illustrate how several canonical neural circuit components-rectification, opponency, and filtering-can combine to produce selectivity for complex stimulus features."

The Shigella T3SS consists of a cytoplasmic portion and a transmembrane region traversing both bacterial membranes, into which a hollow needle, made of MxiH, is embedded protruding from the bacterial surface (2Hodgkinson J.L.

IpaD is hydrophilic and required for tip recruitment of the other two proteins, which are hydrophobic, and hence chaperoned by IpgC intrabacterially (8Ménard R. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Vasselon T.

The three proteins are collectively called the translocators. T3SSs are assembled, using a broadly conserved morphogenesis pathway (9Diepold A. Wagner S. Assembly of the bacterial type III secretion machinery.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38: 802-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), following detection of environmental cues indicating entry into the host. In addition, virulence effectors acting late in the host cell manipulation cascade are only expressed once the presynthesized early effectors have been secreted at host cell contact. Most components and/or molecular mechanisms of these regulatory pathways diverge from one T3SS-carrying organism to another (10Brutinel E.D. Yahr T.L. Control of gene expression by type III secretory activity.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, one regulatory cascade is conserved, a process allowing hierarchical secretion of substrates, although the stages it covers vary as follows: needle versus translocator components in plant pathogens or translocators and then early effectors in animal ones (11Wei H.L. Collmer A. Multiple lessons from the multiple functions of a regulator of type III secretion system assembly in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 85: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here, we focus on how this cascade functions in animal pathogens. After T3SS assembly, effector secretion is prevented through the concerted action of surface TC proteins and regulators that control secretion from within the bacterial cytoplasm. The TC may prevent premature effector secretion by allosterically constraining the T3SS in a secretion “off” conformation without blocking the secretion channel (12Martinez-Argudo I. Blocker A.J.

Next, translocators are secreted to form the pore in the host cell membrane (3Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. The tripartite type III secretion of Shigella flexneri inserts IpaB and IpaC into host membranes.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Successful pore formation at the needle tip generates Signal 2, also transmitted via the needle, that allows inactivation or T3S-mediated removal of a conserved cytoplasmic regulatory protein MxiC in Shigella (12Martinez-Argudo I.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42929-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Then the early effector proteins are secreted and translocated into the host cell, and late effector expression is activated (17Mavris M. Page A.L. Tournebize R. Demers B. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Regulation of transcription by the activity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MxiC belongs to a class of “gatekeeper” proteins that is conserved among different type III secretion systems (18Pallen M.J. Beatson S.A. Bailey C.M. Bioinformatics analysis of the locus for enterocyte effacement provides novel insights into type-III secretion.BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). They repress effector secretion in the absence of a secretion signal but have different roles in translocator secretion, impairing it in a ΔmxiC mutant (12Martinez-Argudo I. Blocker A.J. The Shigella T3SS needle transmits a signal for MxiC release, which controls secretion of effectors.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1365-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) while stimulating it in a Yersinia ΔyopN mutant (19Ferracci F. Schubot F.D. Waugh D.S. Plano G.V. Selection and characterization of Yersinia pestis YopN mutants that constitutively block Yop secretion.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 970-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although gatekeepers are clearly involved in the cytoplasmic steps controlling T3SS secretion hierarchy upon activation, their mechanism of action remains unclear. The gatekeepers have conserved structures (20Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S.

Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After an N-terminal secretion signal and putative chaperone-binding domain (CBD), three α-helical X-bundles (domains 1–3; see supplemental Fig. S1, A–C) form a flat, elongated structure (21Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) typical for “hub proteins” regulating processes via interaction with multiple partners. In some species, gatekeepers are composed of two proteins where the second polypeptide covers the C-terminal X-bundle (domain 3; supplemental Fig. S1, D and E) (20Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. Three-dimensional structure of a macromolecular assembly that regulates type III secretion in Yersinia pestis.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MxiC is secreted by the type III secretion system (22Buchrieser C. Glaser P. Rusniok C. Nedjari H. D’Hauteville H. Kunst F. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. The virulence plasmid pWR100 and the repertoire of proteins secreted by the type III secretion apparatus of Shigella flexneri.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Its N-terminal 30 residues contain the secretion signal (23Botteaux A. Sory M.P. Biskri L. Parsot C. Allaoui A. MxiC is secreted by and controls the substrate specificity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immediately thereafter is a domain similar to the chaperone-binding domain of Yersinia YopN (20Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. Three-dimensional structure of a macromolecular assembly that regulates type III secretion in Yersinia pestis.J. Mol.

Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This domain is partially conserved (18Pallen M.J. Beatson S.A. Bailey C.M. Bioinformatics analysis of the locus for enterocyte effacement provides novel insights into type-III secretion.BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) even though not every MxiC homolog has an identified chaperone. Although this area is enriched in hydrophobic residues that mediate interactions with the chaperones, fewer hydrophobic residues are found in MxiC. Many type III secreted proteins are bound by a chaperone inside the bacterium. These chaperones have various roles, including stabilization of their binding partners, aiding their secretion and mediation of secretion hierarchy (24Page A.L. Parsot C. Chaperones of the type III secretion pathway: jacks of all trades.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Several MxiC homologs bind to specific heterodimeric chaperones. For instance, Yersinia YopN binds to the SycN/YscB heterodimer (20Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. Three-dimensional structure of a macromolecular assembly that regulates type III secretion in Yersinia pestis.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Day J.B. Plano G.V. A complex composed of SycN and YscB functions as a specific chaperone for YopN in Yersinia pestis.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It wraps around its heterodimeric chaperone in a conformation similar to other effector-chaperone complexes (20Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. Three-dimensional structure of a macromolecular assembly that regulates type III secretion in Yersinia pestis.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This domain is disordered in the absence of the chaperones. Interestingly, the first ∼75 residues of MxiC are also likely to be disordered (21Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Yet, so far no chaperone has been identified for MxiC (23Botteaux A. Sory M.P. Biskri L. Parsot C. Allaoui A. MxiC is secreted by and controls the substrate specificity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MxiC's helix 9 of is a straight helix, although the structurally equivalent helix in YopN/TyeA is kinked into two smaller helices. The structure of the EPEC MxiC homolog, SepL, is also bent at an equivalent location (26Burkinshaw B.J. Souza S.A. Strynadka N.C. Structural analysis of SepL, an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli type III secretion-system gatekeeper protein.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2015; 71: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, one face of the molecule is flat in MxiC, although it is concave in YopN/TyeA and SepL (21Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Burkinshaw B.J. Souza S.A. Strynadka N.C. Structural analysis of SepL, an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli type III secretion-system gatekeeper protein.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2015; 71: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this surface contains a negatively charged patch (Glu-201, Glu-276, and Glu-293 (21Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) that we showed is important for MxiC functions that involve IpaD (15Roehrich A.D. Guillossou E. Blocker A.J. Martinez-Argudo I. Shigella IpaD has a dual role: signal transduction from the type III secretion system needle tip and intracellular secretion regulation.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 87: 690-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Chlamydia hydrophobic translocator chaperone Scc3 binds to its gatekeeper at the flat interface between domains 2 and 3 (27Archuleta T.L. Spiller B.W. A gatekeeper chaperone complex directs translocator secretion during type three secretion.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which the kink in the YopN/TyeA renders convex. Deane et al. (21Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) already suggested this structural difference between MxiC and YopN/TyeA could be a “conformational switch,” and these new findings suggest it might allow the switch from hydrophilic to hydrophobic translocator secretion. To dissect MxiC's interconnected functions, we used site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant design was guided by the description of MxiC structure by Deane et al. (21Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the sequence alignment of MxiC homologs by Pallen et al. (18Pallen M.J. Beatson S.A. Bailey C.M. Bioinformatics analysis of the locus for enterocyte effacement provides novel insights into type-III secretion.BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our mutations (Fig. 1) focused on the N-terminal non-crystallized region and domains 2 and 3 of the crystal structure (21Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. Structures of the Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system protein MxiC reveal conformational variability amongst homologs.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We identified mutants predominantly affecting all known features of MxiC regulation as follows: secretion of translocators, MxiC, and effectors. Using molecular genetics to map at which point in the regulatory cascade the mutants were affected, we further dissected MxiC's role. Analysis of some of these mutants led us to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments that, together with phenotypic analysis of the mutants, provide evidence that MxiC's conformation is regulated via a direct interaction with IpaD. A non-secretable form of MxiC lacking residues 2–30 is unable to prevent effector secretion (23Botteaux A. Sory M.P. Biskri L. Parsot C. Allaoui A. MxiC is secreted by and controls the substrate specificity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, MxiC also regulates inducible translocator secretion (12Martinez-Argudo I. Blocker A.J. The Shigella T3SS needle transmits a signal for MxiC release, which controls secretion of effectors.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1365-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This had not yet been characterized when the mxiCΔNterm mutant was first described. We thus investigated whether MxiC's two roles could be uncoupled. We generated an mxiCΔNterm mutant equivalent to that of Botteaux et al. (23Botteaux A. Sory M.P. Biskri L. Parsot C. Allaoui A. MxiC is secreted by and controls the substrate specificity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In our hands, MxiCΔNterm was unstable, whereas wild-type mxiC was induced to wild-type levels after addition of 25 μm IPTG, and mxiCΔNterm was only expressed at similar levels after addition of 100 μm IPTG. Furthermore, MxiCΔNterm seemed partially degraded (Fig. 2B). As described previously, MxiCΔNterm is not secreted after Congo red (CR) induction (Fig. 2A) (23Botteaux A. Sory M.P. Biskri L. Parsot C. Allaoui A. MxiC is secreted by and controls the substrate specificity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and effector proteins are leaked (data not shown) (23Botteaux A. Sory M.P. Biskri L. Parsot C. Allaoui A. MxiC is secreted by and controls the substrate specificity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MxiCΔNterm was not secreted in a ΔipaB constitutive secretor background (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating deletion of the N terminus affects its ability to become secreted. However, secretion of IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD was unaffected in mxiCΔNterm; small differences between ΔmxiC/mxiC+ and mxiCΔNterm were not statistically significant (Fig. 2, A and C). Thus, the ability of MxiC to prevent effector secretion and to promote inducible translocator secretion are not coupled, and only the former requires its secretion signal. The 11 C-terminal residues of the EPEC MxiC homolog, SepL, are required for regulation of effector secretion but not for translocator secretion (28Wang D. Roe A.J. McAteer S. Shipston M.J. Gally D.L. Hierarchal type III secretion of translocators and effectors from Escherichia coli O157:H7 requires the carboxy terminus of SepL that binds to Tir.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a complementary experiment, we deleted the last 14 residues of MxiC (Fig. 1, bottom), which are equivalent to the last 11 residues of SepL (supplemental Fig. S3) (18Pallen M.J. Beatson S.A. Bailey C.M. Bioinformatics analysis of the locus for enterocyte effacement provides novel insights into type-III secretion.BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The resulting mxiCΔCterm mutant was stably expressed but unable to complement ΔmxiC (supplemental Fig. S4); translocators were only weakly induced, and effector proteins were leaked. In addition, MxiCΔCterm itself was only poorly secreted (supplemental Fig. S4) even in ΔipaB (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, unlike for SepL, MxiC's C terminus is essential. The chaperone-binding domain of YopN has a chaperone-independent role in secretion regulation (29Joseph S.S. Plano G.V. The SycN/YscB chaperone-binding domain of YopN is required for the calcium-dependent regulation of Yop secretion by Yersinia pestis.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2013; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We thus wondered whether MxiC's putative chaperone-binding domain is required for its function. First, we deleted the whole CBD (Fig. 1, top) to generate mxiCΔCBD, lacking residues 32–72. This construct was stably expressed, but it was leaked and only weakly secreted upon CR induction (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, secretion of MxiCΔCBD was enhanced in a ΔipaB background (supplemental Fig. S2). This indicates the chaperone-binding domain influences the regulation of MxiC secretion rather than the intrinsic ability of the protein to become secreted. Furthermore, although mxiCΔCBD could not block effector secretion, it was able to promote translocator secretion (Fig. 3A). Next, we investigated which YopN residues contacting the chaperones are conserved in MxiC. As the alignment of this area is ambiguous (supplemental Fig. S5), we made several single and combined charge-swap mutations. mxiCK66E was unable to complement ΔmxiC. Paradoxically, the mutant protein was detected in culture supernatants and, to a lesser degree, in the supernatants after CR induction, but only low levels were detected in whole culture lysates (Fig. 3C). mxiC(D46K,D49K) had a wild-type-like phenotype, except for some premature MxiC secretions. mxiC(D46K,D49K,K66E) leaked MxiC at high levels and was unable to prevent effector secretion (data not shown). A similar phenotype was observed in mxiCK68E (Fig. 3). Furthermore, mxiCK68E and mxiCK66E, but not mxiCΔCBD, displayed reduced induction of translocator secretion, suggesting the effect of the point mutations on translocator secretion is indirect. Therefore, the putative chaperone-binding domain is required for regulating MxiC secretion and for preventing effector secretion. MxiC lacking its secretion signal is not secreted and is also unable to prevent effector secretion (23Botteaux A. Sory M.P. Biskri L. Parsot C. Allaoui A. MxiC is secreted by and controls the substrate specificity of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In an mxiHK69A mutant where MxiC is not secreted, effectors are also not released (12Martinez-Argudo I. Blocker A.J. The Shigella T3SS needle transmits a signal for MxiC release, which controls secretion of effectors.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1365-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Kenjale R. Wilson J. Zenk S.F. Saurya S. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Blocker A. The needle component of the type III secreton of Shigella regulates the activity of the secretion apparatus.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42929-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a correlation between “secretability” and the ability to block secretion. We hence tested whether MxiC needs to be quantitatively removed from the cytoplasm to release the block on effector secretion. We compared the levels of several secreted proteins in supernatants after induction with CR with levels in the corresponding total cultures, i.e. samples containing secreted and intracellular proteins. The translocators IpaB and IpaC were secreted nearly completely, whereas only 8 ± 6% of MxiC was secreted in the same period (supplemental Fig. S6). Translocator IpaD and early effector IpgD were secreted at intermediate levels of ∼40–50%. Thus, either only a small proportion of intracellular MxiC is involved in blocking secretion and/or its secretion per se is not required to release this block. As MxiC's putative CBD is essential for regulating the protein's secretion and as Yersinia YopN needs its heterodimeric chaperone SycN/YscB for effi"
https://openalex.org/W2577027008,"T follicular helper (TFH) cells have been shown to be critically required for the germinal center (GC) reaction where B cells undergo class switch recombination and clonal selection to generate high affinity neutralizing antibodies. However, detailed knowledge of the physiological cues within the GC microenvironment that regulate T cell help is limited. The cAMP-elevating, Gs protein-coupled A2a adenosine receptor (A2aR) is an evolutionarily conserved receptor that limits and redirects cellular immunity. However, the role of A2aR in humoral immunity and B cell differentiation is unknown. We hypothesized that the hypoxic microenvironment within the GC facilitates an extracellular adenosine-rich milieu, which serves to limit TFH frequency and function, and also promotes immunosuppressive T follicular regulatory cells (TFR). In support of this hypothesis, we found that following immunization, mice lacking A2aR (A2aRKO) exhibited a significant expansion of T follicular cells, as well as increases in TFH to TFR ratio, GC T cell frequency, GC B cell frequency, and class switching of GC B cells to IgG1. Transfer of CD4 T cells from A2aRKO or wild type donors into T cell-deficient hosts revealed that these increases were largely T cell-intrinsic. Finally, injection of A2aR agonist, CGS21680, following immunization suppressed T follicular differentiation, GC B cell frequency, and class switching of GC B cells to IgG1. Taken together, these observations point to a previously unappreciated role of GS protein-coupled A2aR in regulating humoral immunity, which may be pharmacologically targeted during vaccination or pathological states in which GC-derived autoantibodies contribute to the pathology.

Novel vaccination strategies to elicit high affinity broadly neutralizing antibodies to difficult immunogens such as HIV-1 and influenza require detailed investigation into the physiologically relevant, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that control humoral immunity. Ideally, such mechanisms that are easily pharmacologically targetable would be of particular value for vaccine design.

Res. 2014; 2: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The GC reaction has been shown to be critically dependent on T follicular helper cells (TFH), which provide help to B cells through a variety of surface molecules such as ICOS (inducible costimulator) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) and by soluble cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-21, as well (11Crotty S. A brief history of T cell help to B cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). TFH have been shown to be limiting for both entry into the GC as well as for GC maintenance and affinity maturation during the iterative process of somatic hypermutation and clonal selection (2Crotty S.

Studies of mechanisms that regulate the GC have led to the identification of a relatively new subset of T regulatory (Treg) cells, T follicular regulatory cells (TFR) (12Linterman M.A. Pierson W.

The A2a adenosine receptor (A2aR) has been shown to be a cyclic AMP-elevating, GS protein-coupled GPCR that can limit cellular immunity in vivo in multiple murine models of inflammation (16Ohta A.

Additional evidence has shown that the role of A2aR in limiting inflammation appears to be phylogenetically conserved on human T cells (19Koshiba M. Rosin D.L. Hayashi N. Linden J. Sitkovsky M.V.

Functionally, A2aR has been shown to be expressed at higher levels on differentiated human Th1 and Th2 cells that produce cytokines (19Koshiba M. Rosin D.L. Hayashi N. Linden J. Sitkovsky M.V. Patterns of A2A extracellular adenosine receptor expression in different functional subsets of human peripheral T cells. Flow cytometry studies with anti-A2A receptor monoclonal antibodies.Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 614-624PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of A2aR in regulating humoral immunity following vaccination or infection has remained largely unexplored. We recently reported that the GC develops a hypoxic microenvironment that promotes B cell differentiation (22Abbott R.K. Thayer M. Labuda J. Silva M. Philbrook P. Cain D.W. Kojima H. Hatfield S. Sethumadhavan S. Ohta A. Reinherz E.L. Kelsoe G. Sitkovsky M. Germinal center hypoxia potentiates immunoglobulin class switch recombination.J. Immunol. 2016; 197: 4014-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because hypoxic microenvironments are also often rich in extracellular adenosine (“hypoxia-adenosinergic”) (17Eltzschig H.K. Sitkovsky M.V. Robson S.C. Purinergic signaling during inflammation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 2322-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the hypoxic GC develops an adenosine-rich microenvironment that could serve to regulate local T cell help through A2aR. We show here that A2aR is indeed required for maintaining normal frequencies of TFH, TFH/TFR ratios, and the overall ratio of T to B cells in GCs. Additionally, we found that A2aR deletion results in increased frequencies of GC B cells and class switching to IgG1 within GCs. Utilizing a T cell transfer model, we determined these observed differences to be due largely to A2aR signaling specifically on CD4 T cells. Lastly, in excellent correlation with these determinations, we found that pharmacological stimulation of the A2aR from days 2 to 8 following primary vaccination led to significant decreases in the frequency of GC B cells and T follicular cells as well as reduced class switching of GC B cells to IgG1. To ascertain whether the GC comprises regions of high extracellular adenosine (exAdo), we looked for a proxy for adenosine generation as direct measurement of exAdo via equilibrium microdialysis probes is not technically feasible. Expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked ecto-enzyme 5′-nucleotidase (CD73), which catalyzes the degradation of AMP to adenosine (17Eltzschig H.K. Sitkovsky M.V. Robson S.C.

Therefore, in lieu of direct exAdo measurements, we assessed whether CD73 was up-regulated on TFH and TFR as defined by the diagnostic CD4+,B220−,CXCR5+, PD-1+, FoxP3− and CD4+, B220−, CXCR5+, PD-1+,FoxP3+ phenotypes, respectively. We found that CD73 is highly expressed on both TFH and TFR (Fig. 1A), consistent with other groups showing high expression on T follicular cells (28Iyer S.S. Latner D.R. Zilliox M.J. McCausland M. Akondy R.S. Penaloza-Macmaster P. Hale J.S. Ye L. Mohammed A.U. Yamaguchi T. Sakaguchi S. Amara R.R. Ahmed R. Identification of novel markers for mouse CD4+ T follicular helper cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 2013; 43: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because a clear definition of GC TFH by flow cytometry in mouse is somewhat difficult, we opted to directly stain GCs for CD73 by immunohistology in situ to assess whether CD73 was detectable within GCs. We found prominent expression of CD73 by a subset of cells within the GCs (Fig. 1B). With the observation that the GC is likely under the influence of the hypoxia adenosinergic pathway, we next assessed whether A2aR is prominently expressed on T follicular cells. Due to the fact that there is no reliable monoclonal antibody for detecting mouse A2aR via flow cytometry, we opted to purify T follicular cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and then stimulate the cells with A2aR-specific agonist CGS21680 (CGS) in vitro and measure downstream cAMP induction. We found that both control CD4 T cells and to a greater extent T follicular cells showed increases in cAMP upon A2aR stimulation, indicative of functional A2aR expression (Fig. 1, C and D). To test our hypothesis that exAdo in the GC regulates the GC via the A2aR, we chose to immunize A2aR-deficient mice (A2aRKO) i.p. with the hapten-protein conjugate, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl(acetyl) ovalbumin (NP-OVA), precipitated in aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (alum), and assessed the induction of splenic T follicular cells 12 days after immunization. By flow cytometric analysis, we found that A2aRKO mice exhibited significant increases in the frequency of T follicular cells as defined by either CD4+,CD8−,CXCR5+, PD-1+, or CD4+,B220−, CXCR5+, BCL-6+ phenotypes (Fig. 2, A and B) when compared with C57Bl/6J WT controls. Furthermore, we determined that naive unimmunized A2aRKO mice housed in our specific pathogen-free vivarium contained no appreciable perturbations in major lymphocyte population or the frequency of naive CD4 T cells capable of responding to immunization (supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with the increase in frequencies of T follicular cells, we noted a significant increase in the frequency of T follicular cells in A2aRKO mice that expressed the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the increase in T follicular cells was reflected in the proportion of T cells within the GC, we performed immunohistology to quantify T cells in GCs. Indeed, we found a significant increase (p < 0.01 × 10−15) in the fraction of TCRβ+ cells contained within the GC areas as determined by GL-7 and B220 staining (Fig. 2D). Because the T follicular compartment (CD4+,B220−,CXCR5+, PD-1+) contains both TFH and TFR, we wanted to determine whether our observed increases in T follicular cells in A2aRKO mice were a proportional increase between the two populations, or whether either population was more favorably expanded. To distinguish TFH from TFR, we utilized the detection of the transcription factor Foxp3, thus defining TFR as CD4+,B220−,CXCR5+, PD-1+, Foxp3+ and TFH as CD4+, B220−,CXCR5+, PD-1+, Foxp3−. In this way, we found that A2aRKO mice exhibit a significant increase in the proportion of TFH to TFR (Fig. 2E), showing reduced relative frequency of TFR. Taken together with our data showing expansion of T follicular cells (CD4+,B220−,CXCR5+, PD-1+), this relative reduction in TFR frequency suggests that A2aR deficiency allows for selective expansion of the TFH population. We next sought to determine whether A2aR deficiency affected functional aspects of TFH and TFR. Further investigation into the activation state of TFH revealed that TFH in A2aR KO mice exhibited increased expression level of the co-activator ICOS (Fig. 2F), which is critical for TFH development (29Choi Y.S. Kageyama R. Eto D. Escobar T.C. Johnston R.J. Monticelli L. Lao C. Crotty S. ICOS receptor instructs T follicular helper cell versus effector cell differentiation via induction of the transcriptional repressor Bcl6.Immunity. 2011; 34: 932-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) and is one mechanism by which TFH provide help to GC B cells (2Crotty S. T follicular helper cell differentiation, function, and roles in disease.Immunity. 2014; 41: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Due to the fact that A2aR signaling is known to promote the function of conventional Treg (30Ohta A. Sitkovsky M. Extracellular adenosine-mediated modulation of regulatory T cells.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 304Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and TFR are thought to arise from natural Treg (12Linterman M.A. Pierson W. Lee S.K. Kallies A. Kawamoto S. Rayner T.F. Srivastava M. Divekar D.P. Beaton L. Hogan J.J. Fagarasan S. Liston A. Smith K.G. Vinuesa C.G. Foxp3+ follicular regulatory T cells control the germinal center response.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 13Chung Y. Tanaka S. Chu F. Nurieva R.I. Martinez G.J. Rawal S. Wang Y.H. Lim H. Reynolds J.M. Zhou X.H. Fan H.M. Liu Z.M.

Med. 2011; 17: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that A2aR may have a similar function on TFR by potentiating TFR regulatory capacity. Analysis of the TFR population revealed a significant decrease in Foxp3 expression level in A2aRKO mice (Fig. 2G), suggesting the possibility that A2aRKO TFR may have reduced suppressive ability. To investigate this notion further, we determined the level of CTLA-4 expression on TFR in A2aRKO mice, as CTLA-4 expression has been specifically shown to be one of the mechanisms by which TFR suppress GC reactions (14Sage P.T. Paterson A.M. Lovitch S.B. Sharpe A.H. The coinhibitory receptor CTLA-4 controls B cell responses by modulating T follicular helper, T follicular regulatory, and T regulatory cells.Immunity. 2014; 41: 1026-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Wing J.B. Ise W. Kurosaki T. Sakaguchi S. Regulatory T cells control antigen-specific expansion of Tfh cell number and humoral immune responses via the coreceptor CTLA-4.Immunity. 2014; 41: 1013-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In support of the hypothesis that A2aR signaling promotes TFR suppressive capacity, we found that A2aRKO mice had reduced expression of CTLA-4 on TFR (Fig. 2H). Consistent with the observation of increased TFH frequencies and potential increase in T cell help capacity in A2aRKO mice, we investigated the GC compartment by flow cytometry as defined by B220+, CD4−, CD38−, GL-7+. Consequently, we found a small but statistical increase in frequencies of GC B cells in A2aRKO mice on day 12 following immunization (Fig. 2I). It is important to note that the increase we observed in GC B cells was not as substantial as the increases we observed within the T follicular compartment (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with our histological analysis showing increased frequency of T cells within the GC (Fig. 2D). We next sought to investigate whether GC B cells were more functionally differentiated in A2aRKO mice. We observed that on day 12 following immunization, there was a greater proportion of class-switched IgG1+ cells within the GC B cell compartment in A2aRKO mice when compared with WT controls (Fig. 2J). We next asked whether these functional effects could be specifically attributed to A2aR signaling directly in T cells. To answer this question, we purified CD4 T cells by magnetic depletion and transferred equal numbers of either WT or A2aRKO CD4 T cells into mice genetically lacking T cells (TCRβ/δ) KO mice, thus generating mice in which A2aR deficiency is specific to the CD4 T cell compartment (referred to as WTCD4 or A2aRKOCD4) (Fig. 3A). After resting the mice for 4 days, we immunized them with NP-OVA/alum i.p. as we did before and determined the frequencies of splenic T follicular and GC B cells 12 days following immunization (Fig. 3A). We determined by flow cytometry that A2aRKOCD4 mice showed significant increases in T follicular frequencies (Fig. 3B) as well as a reduced proportion of TFR to TFH (Fig. 3C), suggesting a preferential expansion of TFH in A2aRKOCD4 mice. We also observed decreases in CTLA-4 expression on TFR in A2aRKOCD4 mice (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that increases in the potential for T cell help in total A2aRKO mice are largely due to lack of intrinsic A2aR signaling in CD4 T cells. Consistent with this observation, we noted a small but statistically significant increase in GC B cell frequency in A2aRKOCD4 mice when compared with controls (Fig. 3E). Most strikingly, however, we found a nearly 10-fold increase in class switching of GC B cells to IgG1 in A2aRKOCD4 mice (Fig. 3F). This observation further supports the hypothesis that A2aR on CD4 T cells functionally limits T cell help to GC B cells. Because we determined that A2aR signaling is required in regulating T follicular responses and GCs in vivo, we asked whether this pathway could be modulated by pharmacological manipulation following vaccination. To test this prediction, we immunized WT C57Bl/6J mice i.p. with NP-OVA/alum as before and administered the A2aR-specific agonist CGS twice daily starting from day 2 to day 8 following immunization (Fig. 4A). We found that splenic T follicular cells were significantly reduced on day 8 in mice treated with CGS when compared with vehicle control (Fig. 4B). Additionally, we found that the GC B cell population was significantly reduced in mice treated with CGS (Fig. 4C). Moreover, CGS-treated mice exhibited impairment in functional differentiation of GC B cells as evidenced by reduced frequencies of class-switched IgG1+ GC B cells (Fig. 4D). Consistent with our data from A2aRKO and A2aRKOCD4 mice, the results from our studies utilizing CGS indicate that extracellular adenosine signaling through A2aR serves to limit the GC reaction. Furthermore, these studies show that this pathway can be pharmacologically manipulated following vaccination. Taken together, our data reveal a previously unknown role for extracellular adenosine signaling through A2aR in the regulation of GC responses. We found that following immunization, A2aR functions to limit the magnitude of TFH help and that both A2aRKO and chimeric A2aRKOCD4 mice exhibit increased T follicular and GC B cell frequencies as well as GC B cell class switching to IgG1 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). A2aR deficiency also revealed potential reductions in relative TFR frequencies and function via CTLA-4 expression in both A2aRKO and A2aRKOCD4 mice when compared with respective controls (Figs. 2, E and H, and 3, C and D). Reaffirming these observations for a clear role of A2aR signaling in regulation of GCs, we found that administration of A2aR-specific agonist CGS from days 2 to 8 following immunization led to significant decreases in T follicular frequencies, GC B cell frequencies, and GC B cell class switching to IgG1 (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that A2aR plays a key role in regulating T cell help within the GC. While this investigation into the role of A2aR in regulating GC responses has provided evidence for a clear role for A2aR in regulating T follicular help within the GC, it is important to note both the limitations of our study and future directions. Although we show that A2aR intrinsically regulates CD4 T cell help in adoptive transfer studies (Fig. 3), it remains to be seen whether A2aR signaling is most critical in limiting TFH function intrinsically or by potentiating the suppressive capacity of TFR intrinsically, or due to the combination of the two. Generation of conditional knock-out mice, in which A2aR is specifically ablated in TFR independently, may help answer these questions. Additionally, there is the possibility of further role(s) for A2aR signaling directly on GC B cells, as we were able to detect functional A2aR expression on GC B cells (data not shown). It is tempting to postulate that extracellular adenosine signaling through A2aR serves to limit T cell help within the GC to both regulate clonal entry into the GC, as T cell help has been shown to be limiting for this process (31Schwickert T.A. Victora G.D. Fooksman D.R. Kamphorst A.O. Mugnier M.R. Gitlin A.D. Dustin M.L. Nussenzweig M.C. A dynamic T cell-limited checkpoint regulates affinity-dependent B cell entry into the germinal center.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and maintain an appropriate level of T cell help within the GC to drive affinity maturation. This notion also raises the idea that limiting T cell help within the GC microenvironment by A2aR signaling on TFH and TFR may serve to limit the genetic event of class switch recombination, which is the product of induced DNA damage (32Revy P.

Staudt L.M. Pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 565-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this regulation of T cell help by A2aR may help prevent the generation of autoreactive effector B cells that occurs in uncontrolled GC responses such as in systemic lupus erythematous (36Choi J.Y. Ho J.H. Pasoto S.G. Bunin V. Kim S.T. Carrasco S. Borba E.F. Gonçalves C.R. Costa P.R. Kallas E.G. Bonfa E. Craft J.

In terms of vaccine design, it is important to appreciate that both A2aR agonist and A2aR antagonist have been safely administered in human trials and approved for human use (38Navarro G.

Flow cytometry studies with anti-A2A receptor monoclonal antibodies.Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 614-624PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps pharmacological manipulation of the A2a receptor during different time points following vaccination could modulate the magnitude and/or epitope specificity for responding B cells to difficult immunogens such as candidate flu and HIV vaccines. Moreover, it is also a possibility that stimulating A2aR during established GC reactions for certain immunogens may help guide affinity maturation, as excessive T cell help has been shown to impair this process (41Preite S. Baumjohann D. Foglierini M. Basso C. Ronchi F. Fernandez Rodriguez B.M. Corti D. Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F.

Immunol. 2015; 45: 3010-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Clearly, future studies are needed to answer these questions. We view this study as opening the door for future work to elucidate the full role of adenosine signaling in the vaccine response and in diseases in which GC-derived autoantibodies may contribute to the pathology. A2aR gene (Adora2a)-deficient mice were originally generated as described (42Ledent C. Vaugeois J.M. Schiffmann S.N. Pedrazzini T. El Yacoubi M. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Costentin J. Heath J.K. Vassart G.

Mice were held under specific pathogen-free conditions at Northeastern University. Age- and sex-matched wild type C57Bl/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Female mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were used for most experiments. TCRβ/δ knock-out mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained as a breeding colony at Northeastern University. NP-OVA was conjugated in-house at a valency of 4–8 NP molecules per OVA. In most experiments, mice were immunized with 3 μg of NP-OVA i.p. in co-precipitated alum hydroxide. CGS21680 injections were given in Hanks’ balanced salt solution subcutaneously twice daily at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. All animal work was done in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols at Northeastern University. CD4+ Resting T cells were purified by magnetic depletion using the CD4 T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Depletion was done using an autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec), and purity was assessed to be greater than 95% by flow cytometry following purification. Cells (ranging between 1 and 3 × 106/mice per experiment depending on recovery) were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution and transferred i.p., and then recipient mice were rested for 4 days and immunized. Single cell suspensions were prepared by mechanical dissociation in FACS buffer (5% FCS in PBS). Cells were counted, and then Fc Block (2.4G2) was added for 10 min. Fluorescently conjugated mAbs were then added to each sample for 30 min at 4 °C. Fluorescently conjugated mAbs used were purchased from eBioscience, BD Biosciences, and BioLegend. Cells were acquired on a Cytek DxP 8 upgraded FACSCalibur, a BD Biosciences LSRII, or a BD Biosciences LSRFortessa. Cell sorting was done on a BD Biosciences Aria II. Analysis was done on FlowJo X (TreeStar). For cell sorting for T follicular and CD4 T cells, generally pools of 5–10 mice in a given experiment (day 8 following NP-OVA/alum) were used to recover enough cells for the functional assay to detect A2aR. cAMP detection was done essentially as described (18Ohta A.

Spleens from immunized mice were frozen in Tissue-Tek compound in a liquid nitrogen-cooled bath of 2-methylbutane. 5-μm sections were cut on a cryostat, air-dried, fixed in a 1:1 mixture of acetone and methanol, and kept frozen until staining. The staining procedure was done generally as described (26Hatfield S.M. Kjaergaard J. Lukashev D. Schreiber T.H. Belikoff B. Abbott R. Sethumadhavan S. Philbrook P. Ko K. Cannici R. Thayer M.

Fluorochromes used were Alexa Fluor 350, FITC/anti-FITC Oregon Green 488, and phycoerythrin. For T cell quantification, images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope, and then collected using Zen software. ImageJ/Fiji was used for analysis. Fluorochromes used include Alexa Fluor 488, phycoerythrin, and Pacific Blue. Mask files were created for GCs (B220+, GL-7+) and T cells (TCRβ+). T cell occupancy of GC was assessed by quantifying the percentage of the area of the GC mask that overlaps with the TCRβ mask. R. K.

https://openalex.org/W2566704109,"The world's Arctic latitudes are some of the most recently colonized by birds, and an understanding of the migratory connectivity of circumpolar species offers insights into the mechanisms of range expansion and speciation. Migratory divides exist for many birds, however for many taxa it is unclear where such boundaries lie, and to what extent these affect the connectivity of species breeding across their ranges. Sabine’s gulls (Xema sabini) have a patchy, circumpolar breeding distribution and overwinter in two ecologically similar areas in different ocean basins: the Humboldt Current off the coast of Peru in the Pacific, and the Benguela Current off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia in the Atlantic. We used geolocators to track Sabine’s gulls breeding at a colony in the Canadian High Arctic to determine their migratory pathways and wintering sites. Our study provides evidence that birds from this breeding site disperse to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans during the non-breeding season, which suggests that a migratory divide for this species exists in the Nearctic. Remarkably, members of one mated pair wintered in opposite oceans. Our results ultimately suggest that colonization of favorable breeding habitat may be one of the strongest drivers of range expansion in the High Arctic."

The development of new antibody conjugation strategies is a fast expanding field with applications in targeted drug delivery and tumor imaging. Classical non-site-specific coupling of drugs or dyes to primary amines or thiols carries the disadvantage of generating a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies with different numbers of attached molecules as well as different sites of attachment. Therefore, in recent years, several interesting new types of biorthogonal chemistry have been explored for antibody conjugation (1Agarwal P. Bertozzi C.R.

Horne D.A. Williams J.C. Identification and grafting of a unique peptide-binding site in the Fab framework of monoclonal antibodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 17456-17461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) developed a non-covalent affinity tag for therapeutic antibodies, which they coined a “meditope” (1010.Williams, J. C., Horne, D. A., Ma, Y., and Chen, H. W., (February 25, 2014) U. S. Patent US8658774 B2.Google Scholar). A meditope is a peptide that binds in a large pocket between the four immunoglobulin domains in the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) 2The abbreviations used are: Fabantigen-binding fragmentEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorDIPEAN,N-diisopropylethylamineRERrobust enrichment ratioSSCside scatterFSCforward scatterFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylO1Pen5-amino-3-oxapentanoic acidADAanti-drug antibodyMIDMultiplex IdentifierNMPN-methyl-2-pyrrolidoneBPbandpass. of antibodies (Fig. 1A). They identified a disulfide-constrained cyclic peptide (sequence, CQFDLSTRRLKC) that binds in this manner to the therapeutic anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab (trade name, ErbituxTM). Because the binding site that this meditope recognizes is distinct from the pockets found in natural human antibodies, the tag serves as a specific non-covalent and paratope-independent handle that can be used to specifically bind cetuximab.

At present, many of the potential applications for the cetuximab meditope peptide are limited by its moderate affinity. The original meditope was identified in a phage display screen of random 10-mer peptides flanked by cysteines (11Riemer A.B. Kurz H. Klinger M. Scheiner O. Zielinski C.C. Jensen-Jarolim E. Vaccination with cetuximab mimotopes and biological properties of induced anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As the sequence space of such a library is 106 times larger than the library that was used (12Riemer A.B. Klinger M. Wagner S. Bernhaus A. Mazzucchelli L. Pehamberger H. Scheiner O. Zielinski C.C. Jensen-Jarolim E. Generation of peptide mimics of the epitope recognized by trastuzumab on the oncogenic protein Her-2/neu.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), systematic exploration of the local sequence space is likely to reveal affinity enhancing mutations. Yeast surface display (Fig. 1B) is particularly suitable for such affinity maturation (13Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Yeast surface display for screening combinatorial polypeptide libraries.Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). In contrast to in vitro molecular display technologies such as phage- or ribosome display, which require panning as a means of selection, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) is used in yeast display, which offers more refined control of the selection pressure (14Reich L.L. Dutta S. Keating A.E. SORTCERY–a high-throughput method to affinity rank peptide ligands.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 2135-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yeast display is also less vulnerable to unintended selection of the most infectious or fastest-replicating clones (15Vodnik M. Zager U. Strukelj B. Lunder M. Phage display: selecting straws instead of a needle from a haystack.Molecules. 2011; 16: 790-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Finally, the yeast secretory pathway acts as a filter, ensuring that only well folded full-length proteins and peptides will be displayed (16Shusta E.V. Kieke M.C. Parke E. Kranz D.M. Wittrup K.D. Yeast polypeptide fusion surface display levels predict thermal stability and soluble secretion efficiency.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because subtle affinity enhancements may escape detection in classical screens for a select number of “hit” sequences, recently high-throughput protein display technologies have been used in conjunction with deep sequencing before and after selection, a combination loosely referred to as “deep mutational scanning” (17Fowler D.M. Fields S. Deep mutational scanning: a new style of protein science.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar18Shin H. Cho B.-K.

Deep mutational scanning: a highly parallel method to measure the effects of mutation on protein function.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2015; 2015: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This strategy allows the construction of fitness landscapes of the selected property (i.e. affinity) in which subtle effects of individual mutations can be discerned by the degree to which they are enriched or depleted by the selection. Deep mutational scanning has been applied successfully in combination with computational protein design for the engineering of enzyme inhibitors (20Procko E. Hedman R. Hamilton K. Seetharaman J.

In this work, we used yeast display and deep mutational scanning to improve the affinity of the meditope peptide for the therapeutic antibody cetuximab by screening all single and a select set of double amino acid substitutions. The effects of these mutations were quantified using fluorescence anisotropy titration experiments, and the best variant was tested for improved cancer cell targeting. The experimental approach was also compared with in silico mutagenesis with Rosetta using the crystal structure of the meditope-cetuximab complex to determine whether subtle affinity-enhancing mutations could also be identified computationally. The phage display screen that identified the cetuximab meditope sequence CQFDLSTRRLKC (hereafter called Md1) also reported three other binding sequences, CVWQRWQKSYVC (Md2), CQYNLSSRALKC (Md3), and CMWDRFSRWYKC (Md4) (11Riemer A.B. Kurz H. Klinger M. Scheiner O. Zielinski C.C. Jensen-Jarolim E. Vaccination with cetuximab mimotopes and biological properties of induced anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the cetuximab affinities of these other three peptides were not available, we synthesized fluorescently labeled versions of all four peptides and determined their affinity for cetuximab in a fluorescence polarization assay, yielding Kd values of 134.6 ± 5.6 nm for Md1, 371 ± 58 nm for Md2, and 739 ± 115 nm for Md3 (Fig. 2B). For Md4, no significant binding was observed up to 10 μm cetuximab. Next, we tested whether these disulfide-constrained peptides could be efficiently displayed and cyclized by the yeast secretory machinery. Correct folding and display were analyzed for each of the four peptide sequences by using FACS analysis to study binding of fluorescently labeled cetuximab at various concentrations. Remarkably, cetuximab binding was only observed for the original meditope sequence and not for any of the other three sequences (Fig. 2B). The affinity of the interaction between cetuximab and the meditope peptide displayed on the yeast surface seemed to be slightly weaker than that determined in the fluorescence polarization assay, but an accurate determination of Kd was precluded by the lack of a plateau. Especially for weaker interactions, dissociation of the bound cetuximab during washing may result in an underestimation of the affinity. The lack of cetuximab binding observed for Md2 and Md3, which did respond in the fluorescence polarization assay, suggests that these peptides were not cyclized efficiently by the yeast secretory machinery. Yeast display has been used extensively on different types of proteins (25Smith S.N. Harris D.T. Kranz D.M. T cell receptor engineering and analysis using the yeast display platform.Methods Mol.

Levin A.M. Cochran F.V. Cochran J.R. Engineered cystine knot peptides that bind αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrins with low-nanomolar affinity.Proteins. 2009; 77: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but those molecules possess a well defined tertiary structure that will favor correct disulfide pairing during oxidative folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Simple disulfide-constrained cyclic peptides lack such a stabilizing scaffold, and therefore they may form incorrect disulfide bridges with other proteins. Having established that Md1 has the highest cetuximab affinity and is correctly displayed on the yeast surface, we made 10 libraries of Md1 each harboring a single degenerate NNK codon (the cysteines were not mutated). The pooled single NNK libraries were sorted in three consecutive rounds for cetuximab binding. Two different selection stringencies were used in parallel using either 100 or 30 nm cetuximab (Fig. 3A). Sequence analysis of 12 single clones obtained after the third sorting round revealed three mutations that were enriched, Q1V, S5G, and K10R. These three mutant clones were cultured individually and analyzed by FACS, showing a modest increase in cetuximab binding (Fig. 3B). To quantify the effect of each mutation, we synthesized fluorescently labeled meditope peptides containing either a single mutation or harboring combinations of two or three of these mutations. After verification of correct cyclization by mass spectrometry, the dissociation constants for cetuximab-peptide complexes were determined in a fluorescence polarization assay (Fig. 3C and Table 1). The effects of the individual mutations on cetuximab binding were modest, with affinity increases of 1.2–1.8-fold. Fortunately, these subtle effects were fully additive, with the Q1V/S5G/K10R triple mutant showing a 4-fold lower dissociation constant of 30.3 ± 0.9 nm.TABLE 1Dissociation constants of mutant peptidesSequenceaExact peptide sequences (including labels, linkers, and flanking residues) are in supplemental Table S2, numbers 5–12.Kd bKd values were calculated with fluorescence polarization measurements (Fig. 3D).

Open table in a new tab Because the three identified mutations showed only minor improvements in affinity, we wondered whether other subtle mutations had evaded detection because of the limited number of analyzed clones. To determine the optimal amino acid at every position, we applied deep mutational scanning, in which the amino acid frequencies at every position are determined by deep sequencing both before and after selection. The degree of enrichment or depletion of an amino acid reflects its positive or negative effect on the binding affinity. Using this information, a “fitness landscape” can also be created to identify positions that tolerate diversity better than others, which is useful for designing double mutation libraries. Fig. 4A shows the deep mutational scanning strategy used in this study (see under “Materials and Methods” for a detailed description). Briefly, the 10 single NNK libraries were sorted separately for two consecutive rounds using 100 nm cetuximab. In the first round, a rectangular sorting gate was drawn to enrich all functional binders, regardless of their specific affinities (supplemental Fig. S1a). In the second sorting round, a triangular sorting gate was drawn such that half of the expressing population of a control sample displaying Md1 fell within this gate (supplemental Fig. S1b). In this way, any favorable mutants would be enriched more than the original, as a larger fraction of their expressing population would fall within the sorting gate. DNA was extracted from samples of each unsorted and each twice-sorted population. The cyclic peptide-encoding regions were amplified by PCR, during which Multiplex IDentifier (MID) barcode sequences were incorporated. Using six different forward and six different reverse primers containing unique MIDs, each sub-library (e.g. “NNK10 unsorted”) was tagged with an unambiguous combination of MIDs (Fig. 4A). Only after each sub-library was uniquely tagged were they combined into a single sequencing sample. Sequencing was done using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Paired-end sequencing was used, because the read-length of the Illumina method was too short to capture the cyclic peptide sequence and both MIDs in a single read (see under “Materials and Methods”). From the sequence analysis, enrichment ratios were calculated. To minimize the effect of sampling error on the enrichment ratios, we defined the “robust enrichment ratio” (RER) as a metric, which in effect is equal to the lower 95% confidence limit of the enrichment ratio (see under “Materials and Methods” for the definition). The robust enrichment ratios were represented as a heat map (Fig. 4B). The only mutations with higher RERs than the original residues at their respective positions were the three previously identified beneficial mutations, Q1V, S5G, and K10R. This confirmed that our deep mutational scanning strategy was able to correctly identify mutations with enhanced affinities, and this suggested that no other beneficial single mutations had been previously overlooked. In addition to identifying beneficial mutations, the analysis also revealed that some positions were more tolerant to mutation than others. Notably, at positions 1 and 3 and to some extent 5 and 6, many residues had RERs above 1, meaning that these mutants retained at least significant binding. In contrast, substitutions at positions 2, 7, 8, and 9 abrogated binding completely. At position 4, only one mutation (L4M) had an RER above 1, but otherwise this position was also intolerant to mutation. The effects of the three mutations that had been identified thus far were largely additive, but screening multiple amino acid substitution libraries could identify mutations that are cooperative, i.e. the effect of one mutation is enhanced by the presence of another mutation. Deep mutational scanning of the single mutant libraries revealed that positions 1, 3, 5, and 6 tolerated diversity. We therefore created five double NNK libraries harboring degenerate codons at positions 1 + 3, 1 + 5, 1 + 6, 3 + 5, and 5 + 6. These double amino acid substitution libraries were prepared, sorted, and sequenced in the same way as the single NNK libraries (supplemental Fig. S1). Analysis of the sequencing data confirmed that mutations Q1V and S5G were more strongly enriched compared with the respective original amino acids in the libraries NNK 1 + 3, 1 + 5, 1 + 6, and 3 + 5 (Fig. 5A). Only in NNK 5 + 6 was the original serine at position 5 more enriched than glycine. Two additional mutations, D3N and T6I, were found that had high RERs. In both the NNK 1 + 3 and NNK 3 + 5 libraries, an aspartate was more enriched at position 3 than the original asparagine, which suggested that the D3N mutation is only favorable for binding in the context of other mutations at positions 1 and/or 5. Other potentially beneficial mutations that only appeared in the double amino acid substitution libraries are T6I and T6V. These both had higher RERs (2.5 and 2.4, respectively) than the original threonine (RER 1.4) in the NNK 1 + 6 library. In the NNK 5 + 6 library, the threonine at position 6 had a higher enrichment ratio (8.5) than isoleucine (3.5) or valine (2.4). This suggests that mutating threonine 6 to a hydrophobic valine or isoleucine is favorable only in the context of a second mutation at position 1, but it is disfavored to some extent in the context of another mutation at position 5. In addition to the enrichment of amino acids, we also assessed the enrichments of specific pairs of mutations, to determine which residues were frequently selected together (supplemental Figs. S2–S6). From these analyses, mutations D3N and T6I also emerged as likely candidates that could further improve the affinity. To assess whether the D3N and T6I could further enhance the affinity of the Q1V/S5G/K10R meditope variant, three fluorescently labeled peptides were synthesized, carrying D3N, T6I, or both in addition to the Q1V, S5G, and K10R mutations. Fluorescence polarization assays showed that each of the single mutations enhanced cetuximab binding by a factor of 2, yielding Kd values of 14.5 ± 0.8 and 16.8 ± 2.1 nm for the tetramutants Q1V/D3N/S5G/K10R and Q1V/S5G/T6I/K10R, respectively. A pentamutant peptide carrying Q1V/D3N/S5G/T6I/K10R had a dissociation constant of 15.8 ± 3.9 nm. Apparently, the two additional mutations indeed improved the affinity further by a factor 2, but their effects were not additive. These combined mutations thus yielded an almost 10-fold increase in affinity. The availability of the crystal structure of the complex between the original meditope peptide (Md1) and cetuximab (9Donaldson J.M. Zer C. Avery K.N. Bzymek K.P. Horne D.A. Williams J.C. Identification and grafting of a unique peptide-binding site in the Fab framework of monoclonal antibodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 17456-17461Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) provided an opportunity to compare the fitness landscape determined using deep mutational sequencing with one obtained based on in silico mutagenesis. Such a comparison would serve as a rigorous test to assess whether in silico modeling could substitute for experimental screening. The well established Rosetta protein design software was used for in silico modeling, which employs an empirical score function to find the lowest energy conformation of mutant proteins or peptides (38Kortemme T. Kim D.E. Baker D. Computational alanine scanning of protein-protein interfaces.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: pl2PubMed Google Scholar, 39Smith C.A. Kortemme T. Backrub-like backbone simulation recapitulates natural protein conformational variability and improves mutant side-chain prediction.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 742-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Using the published crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 4GW1) as a starting point, all single amino acid substitutions were introduced in the peptide, and the binding of each mutant was compared with the original meditope. This strategy is effectively a computational counterpart of the single NNK screen carried out with deep mutational scanning. Fig. 6A shows the results of the computational screen as a heat map depicting the difference in binding scores between the mutants and the original peptide. In this heat map, negative values (Fig. 6A, black or dark gray areas) represent binding scores that were larger than that of the non-mutated peptide, suggesting affinity-improving mutations. Highly positive values (Fig. 6A, white or light gray areas), however, indicated a decreased affinity. The simulations globally reflected the experimental observations that positions 1, 3, 5, and 6 are most tolerant to mutation. The computational modeling suggested that especially positions 4, 7, a"
https://openalex.org/W2565199569,"The WNT-TCF signaling pathway participates in adult tissue homeostasis and repair, and is hyperactive in a number of human diseases including cancers of the colon. Whereas to date there are no antagonists approved for patient use, a potential problem for their sustained use is the blockade of WNT signaling in healthy tissues, thus provoking potentially serious co-lateral damage. Here we have screened a library of plant and microorganism small molecules for novel WNT signaling antagonists and describe withanolide F as a potent WNT-TCF response blocker. This steroidal lactone inhibits TCF-dependent colon cancer xenograft growth and mimics the effects of genetic blockade of TCF and of ivermectin, a previously reported WNT-TCF blocker. However, withanolide F is unique in that it imposes a long-lasting repression of tumor growth, WNT-TCF targets and cancer stem cell clonogenicity after drug treatment. These findings are paralleled by its modulation of chromatin regulators and its alteration of overall H3K4me1 levels. Our results open up the possibility to permanently repress essential signaling responses in cancer cells through limited treatments with small molecules."

Here, we searched for an information processing error during the emergence of seemingly insightful stone dropping in New Caledonian crows. We presented these birds with the platform apparatus, where a heavy object needs to be dropped down a tube and onto a platform in order to trigger the release of food. Our results show New Caledonian crows exhibit a weight inattention error: they do not attend to the weight of an object when innovating stone dropping. This suggests that these crows do not use an understanding of force when solving the platform task in a seemingly insightful manner. Our findings showcase the power of the signature-testing approach, where experiments search for information processing biases, errors and limits, in order to make strong inferences about the functioning of animal minds."
https://openalex.org/W2567582603,"With a more Internet-savvy and sophisticated user base, there are more demands for interactive applications and services. However, it is a challenge for existing radio access networks (e.g. 3G and 4G) to cope with the increasingly demanding requirements such as higher data rates and wider coverage area. One potential solution is the inter-collaborative deployment of multiple radio devices in a 5G setting designed to meet exacting user demands, and facilitate the high data rate requirements in the underlying networks. These heterogeneous 5G networks can readily resolve the data rate and coverage challenges. Networks established using the hybridization of existing networks have diverse military and civilian applications. However, there are inherent limitations in such networks such as irregular breakdown, node failures, and halts during speed transmissions. In recent years, there have been attempts to integrate heterogeneous 5G networks with existing ad hoc networks to provide a robust solution for delay-tolerant transmissions in the form of packet switched networks. However, continuous connectivity is still required in these networks, in order to efficiently regulate the flow to allow the formation of a robust network. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel network formation consisting of nodes from different network maneuvered by Unmanned Aircraft (UA). The proposed model utilizes the features of a biological aspect of genomes and forms a delay tolerant network with existing network models. This allows us to provide continuous and robust connectivity. We then demonstrate that the proposed network model has an efficient data delivery, lower overheads and lesser delays with high convergence rate in comparison to existing approaches, based on evaluations in both real-time testbed and simulation environment."

Current therapies include use of anti-VEGF agents to reduce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and edema. These treatments are effective in most cases, but spontaneous or acquired resistance to anti-VEGF and possible adverse effects of long-term VEGF inhibition in the retina and choroid highlight a need for additional alternative therapies. Integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, which regulate endothelial cell proliferation and stabilization, have been implicated in ocular angiogenesis. Lebecetin (LCT) is a 30-kDa heterodimeric C-type lectin that is isolated from Macrovipera lebetina venom and interacts with α5β1- and αv-containing integrins. We previously showed that LCT inhibits human brain microvascular endothelial cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and tubulogenesis. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of LCT on ocular angiogenesis, we cultured aortic and choroidal explants in the presence of LCT and analyzed the effect of LCT on CNV in the mouse CNV model and on retinal neovascularization in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Our data demonstrate that a single injection of LCT efficiently reduced CNV and retinal neovascularization in these models.—Montassar, F., Darche, M., Blaizot, A., Augustin, S., Conart, J.-B., Millet, A., Elayeb, M., Sahel, J.-A., Réaux-Le Goazigo, A., Sennlaub, F., Marrakchi, N., Messadi, E., Guillonneau, X.

https://openalex.org/W2562079131,"Stalling at DNA replication forks generates stretches of single-stranded (ss) DNA on both strands that are exposed to nucleolytic degradation, potentially compromising genome stability. One enzyme crucial for DNA replication fork repair and restart of stalled forks in human is Metnase (also known as SETMAR), a chimeric fusion protein consisting of a su(var)3–9, enhancer-of-zeste and trithorax (SET) histone methylase and transposase nuclease domain. We previously showed that Metnase possesses a unique fork cleavage activity necessary for its function in replication restart and that its SET domain is essential for recovery from hydroxyurea-induced DNA damage. However, its exact role in replication restart is unclear. In this study, we show that Metnase associates with exonuclease 1 (Exo1), a 5′-exonuclease crucial for 5′-end resection to mediate DNA processing at stalled forks. Metnase DNA cleavage activity was not required for Exo1 5′-exonuclease activity on the lagging strand daughter DNA, but its DNA binding activity mediated loading of Exo1 onto ssDNA overhangs. Metnase-induced enhancement of Exo1-mediated DNA strand resection required the presence of these overhangs but did not require Metnase’s DNA cleavage activity. These results suggest that Metnase enhances Exo1-mediated exonuclease activity on the lagging strand DNA by facilitating Exo1 loading onto a single strand gap at the stalled replication fork.

Upon replication fork arrest from deoxyribonucleotide depletion after hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, uncoupling of DNA polymerases and helicase generates ssDNA overhangs on both leading and lagging strands. Restart of stalled replication forks can occur via the reannealing of ssDNA, or forks can undergo regression and pairing of the newly synthesized strands to form a Holliday junction structure (“chicken foot”). When free 5′-ends are present, end resection creates 3′-ssDNA on which Rad51 can load, and Rad51-mediated DNA displacement loop formation eventually allows reloading of the replication machinery for fork restart. Rad51-mediated homologous recombination (HR) also mediates fork reversal for restart of replication (9Zellweger R. Dalcher D. Mutreja K. Berti M. Schmid J.A. Herrador R. Vindigni A. Lopes M.

https://openalex.org/W2565854398,"RNA degradation is crucial for regulating gene expression in all organisms. Like the decapping of eukaryotic mRNAs, the conversion of the 5′-terminal triphosphate of bacterial transcripts to a monophosphate can trigger RNA decay by exposing the transcript to attack by 5′-monophosphate-dependent ribonucleases. In both biological realms, this deprotection step is catalyzed by members of the Nudix hydrolase family. The genome of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative epsilonproteobacterium, encodes two proteins resembling Nudix enzymes. Here we present evidence that one of them, HP1228 (renamed HpRppH), is an RNA pyrophosphohydrolase that triggers RNA degradation in H. pylori, whereas the other, HP0507, lacks such activity. In vitro, HpRppH converts RNA 5′-triphosphates and diphosphates to monophosphates. It requires at least two unpaired nucleotides at the 5′ end of its substrates and prefers three or more but has only modest sequence preferences. The influence of HpRppH on RNA degradation in vivo was examined by using RNA-seq to search the H. pylori transcriptome for RNAs whose 5′-phosphorylation state and cellular concentration are governed by this enzyme. Analysis of cDNA libraries specific for transcripts bearing a 5′-triphosphate and/or monophosphate revealed at least 63 potential HpRppH targets. These included mRNAs and sRNAs, several of which were validated individually by half-life measurements and quantification of their 5′-terminal phosphorylation state in wild-type and mutant cells. These findings demonstrate an important role for RppH in post-transcriptional gene regulation in pathogenic Epsilonproteobacteria and suggest a possible basis for the phenotypes of H. pylori mutants lacking this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2564365914,"Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived adiponectin (APN) is a secreted adipokine that protects against hypertension-related cardiovascular injury. However, the regulation of APN expression in hypertension remains to be explored. In this study, we demonstrated that down-regulation of APN was associated with complement activation in the PVAT of desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive mice. Complement 3-deficient hypertensive mice were protected from ANP decrease in the PVAT. APN deficiency blockaded the protective effects of complement inhibition against hypertensive vascular injury. Mechanistically, complement 5a (C5a)-induced TNF-α secretion from macrophages is required for inhibiting APN expression in adipocytes. Macrophage depletion reversed C5a agonist peptide-induced TNF-α up-regulation and APN down-regulation in the PVAT of DOCA mice. Moreover, we detected increased macrophage infiltration and C5a expression associated with decreased APN expression in adipose tissue from patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma. These results identify a novel interaction between macrophages and adipocytes in the PVAT, where complement-mediated inhibition of APN acts as a potential risk factor for hypertensive vascular inflammation.-Ruan, C.-C., Ma, Y., Ge, Q., Li, Y., Zhu, L.-M., Zhang, Y., Kong, L.-R., Wu, Q-H., Li, F., Cheng, L., Zhao, A.

Acs is strictly regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels in enteric bacteria. Under carbon limitation, cAMP-CRP (cAMP receptor protein) binds upstream of the acs proximal promoter (acsP2) and initiates transcription of acs (10Beatty C.M. Browning D.F. Busby S.J. Wolfe A.J. Cyclic AMP receptor protein-dependent activation of the Escherichia coli acsP2 promoter by a synergistic class III mechanism.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5148-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, this cAMP-CRP-dependent activation may be inhibited by the nucleoid proteins IHF and FIS by competitive binding to the CRP-binding sites or other unknown steric hindrances (11Browning D.F.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The activity of Acs is regulated by acetylation catalyzed by the protein acetyltransferase Pat and deacetylation catalyzed by the NAD+-dependent deacetylase CobB. Pat transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA onto the Salmonella enterica Acs (SeAcs) Lys609 and blocks the first half of the catalytic reaction, acetyl-AMP formation (12Starai V.J.

Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), whereas CobB restores activity by specifically removing this acetyl group (13Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D.

Sir2-dependent activation of acetyl-CoA synthetase by deacetylation of active lysine.Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). cAMP is a master second messenger that is involved in rapid response to environmental nutritional changes in bacteria (14McKnight G.S.

New messages from old messengers: cAMP and mycobacteria.Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 543-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The acetate scavenging by Acs is an alternative pathway for acetyl-CoA production under a low-glucose condition, and cAMP regulates Acs in multiple ways. Besides the direct transcription activation of the acs gene by cAMP-CRP as described above (10Beatty C.M. Browning D.F. Busby S.J. Wolfe A.J. Cyclic AMP receptor protein-dependent activation of the Escherichia coli acsP2 promoter by a synergistic class III mechanism.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5148-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), cAMP indirectly modulates Acs activity by activating transcription of the pat gene in the presence of non-phosphotransferase system carbon sources in enteric bacteria (16Castaño-Cerezo S. Bernal V. Blanco-Catalá J. Iborra J.L. Cánovas M. cAMP-CRP co-ordinates the expression of the protein acetylation pathway with central metabolism in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 82: 1110-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or by activating Pat activity via binding to its allosteric site in mycobacteria (17Nambi S. Basu N.

Biol. 2012; 19: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we discovered that cAMP inhibits the activity of SeAcs by directly binding to the enzyme and competing against one of its substrates, ATP. The binding of cAMP increases SeAcs Lys609 acetylation, which further inhibits SeAcs activity. The acetylation is apparently caused by concomitant promotion of Pat-dependent acetylation and inhibition of CobB-dependent deacetylation. We further determined a crystal structure of SeAcs complexed with cAMP and CoA, and the crystal structure not only confirms that cAMP binds to the conserved ATP/AMP binding pocket of SeAcs, but also suggests cAMP, in addition to CoA, restrains SeAcs in an open conformation. This structure provides possible scenarios for the mechanism that promotes SeAcs Lys609 acetylation. In addition, we found cAMP also inhibited S. enterica propionyl-CoA synthetase (SePrpE) and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (SeFadD), which are from the same protein family of acyl- or aryl-CoA synthetases. As the residues of cAMP-binding site are generally conserved in this family, we infer that cAMP possibly inhibits other acyl- or aryl-CoA synthetases in S. enterica. We measured the thermodynamic parameters of the proposed interaction between cAMP and non-acetylated SeAcs isolated from a pat-null S. enterica strain using the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method to test whether cAMP binds directly to Acs. The result shows that cAMP directly interacted with SeAcs, with one cAMP-binding site for each SeAcs (blue in Fig. 1A). The dissociation constant (Kd) was estimated to be 164 ± 11 μm, which is very close to the physiological concentration of cAMP in live bacterial cells under starvation conditions (19Makman R.S. Sutherland E.W. Adenosine 3′,5′-phosphate in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1309-1314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Notley-McRobb L. Death A. Ferenci T. The relationship between external glucose concentration and cAMP levels inside Escherichia coli: implications for models of phosphotransferase-mediated regulation of adenylate cyclase.Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1909-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), implicating a physiological relevance. We next measured the interaction between cAMP and acetylated SeAcs isolated from a cobB-null S. enterica strain, and the Kd was estimated to be 297 ± 15 μm (red in Fig. 1A). Given that the 0.8-fold increase in Kd of cAMP binding to acetylated SeAcs compared with the non-acetylated enzyme, we investigated if acetylation of SeAcs also affects the binding of its natural substrate, ATP. The results indicate a similar 2.4-fold increase in Kd of ATP binding to the acetylated SeAcs (1.09 ± 0.079 mm; red in Fig. 1B) compared with the non-acetylated SeAcs (322 ± 19 μm; blue in Fig. 1B). Therefore, both cAMP and ATP preferably bind to the non-acetylated SeAcs. We next measured the acetylation level of Lys609, the primary site on SeAcs under acetylation regulation. There is a clear difference in the Lys609 acetylation level of SeAcs isolated from pat-null or cobB-null S. enterica cells (Fig. 2, A and B). As Lys609 participates in the catalytic reaction of SeAcs, it is not surprising that acetylation at Lys609 affects the binding of ATP to SeAcs. The results also suggest that cAMP might bind to a location similar to that of ATP in SeAcs. We measured SeAcs activity (isolated from pat-null S. enterica cells) in the presence or absence of cAMP to test whether binding of cAMP inhibits the activity of SeAcs, SeAcs catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA using CoA, acetate, and ATP as substrates. The potential inhibitory effect of cAMP on Acs was tested using a subsaturated concentration for each of the substrates. cAMP substantially inhibited SeAcs activity only in an enzymatic reaction system with a low concentration of ATP (Fig. 1C), suggesting cAMP inhibits SeAcs via an ATP-competitive mechanism. To further confirm that cAMP inhibits SeAcs by competing against the substrate ATP, we measured the apparent Km constants of ATP under various cAMP concentrations. The Lineweaver-Burk plot for cAMP shows a characteristic signature of a competitive inhibitor (Fig. 1D), in agreement with the above observation that cAMP barely inhibits SeAcs when ATP is saturated (Fig. 1C). The inhibition constant (Ki) for cAMP-SeAcs was estimated as 185 ± 25 μm by plotting the apparent Km (toward substrate ATP) against cAMP concentration (inset of Fig. 1D), which is similar to the ITC estimated Kd (164 ± 11 μm; blue in Fig. 1A). Acetylation of the catalytic lysine residue (Lys609 in SeAcs) is an efficient way to modulate Acs activity (12Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C.

Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 13Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Sir2-dependent activation of acetyl-CoA synthetase by deacetylation of active lysine.Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). cAMP has been reported to enhance Acs acetylation by activating the lysine acetyltransferase Pat in mycobacteria (17Nambi S. Basu N. Visweswariah S.S. cAMP-regulated protein lysine acetylases in mycobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24313-24323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Lee H.J.

Biol. 2012; 19: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) via binding to the allosteric site in the cyclic nucleotide (cNMP)-binding domain of Pat. This domain is unique to mycobacteria species (17Nambi S. Basu N. Visweswariah S.S. cAMP-regulated protein lysine acetylases in mycobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24313-24323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and we speculate that the mechanism by which cAMP affects the Acs in enteric bacteria, such as SeAcs, must be different. To determine whether direct binding of cAMP to SeAcs affects its Lys609 acetylation level, we performed in vitro enzymatic acetylation assays using purified non-acetylated SeAcs (from a pat-null S. enterica strain) and acetyl-CoA as the substrates. The acetylation assays were catalyzed by purified S. enterica protein acetyltransferase (SePat), with or without cAMP in the reaction system. The level of SeAcs acetylation was determined by Western blotting using an antibody that specifically recognizes acetylated Lys609 (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2C, SePat increases the acetylation level of SeAcs Lys609 in vitro (lane 4), and cAMP promotes Pat-dependent acetylation substantially (lane 7). The addition of cAMP to the acetylation assay system further decreases SeAcs activity, suggesting SeAcs acetylation promoted by cAMP also contributes to the inhibitory effect of cAMP on SeAcs. Because a cNMP-binding domain is absent in SePat (17Nambi S. Basu N. Visweswariah S.S. cAMP-regulated protein lysine acetylases in mycobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24313-24323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we infer that cAMP promotes SeAcs acetylation through direct binding to its ATP/AMP pocket as well. Lysine acetyltransferase Pat and deacetylase CobB exist normally as a pair to modulate cellular protein acetylation levels in most bacteria (21Hu L.I. Lima B.P. Wolfe A.J. Bacterial protein acetylation: the dawning of a new age.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To test if cAMP also affects deacetylation of SeAcs by SeCobB, we performed in vitro enzymatic deacetylation assay using purified acetylated SeAcs from a cobB-null S. enterica strain as the substrate, NAD+ as a coenzyme, and purified S. enterica Sir2-like lysine deacetylase (SeCobB) as the catalytic enzyme. The result in Fig. 2D confirmed that SeCobB was able to remove the acetyl group on Lys609 of SeAcs (lane 4), and rescued SeAcs activity. However, decrease in the acetylation level as well as the recovery of SeAcs activity by CobB treatment was inhibited remarkably in the presence of cAMP (lane 7). Because cAMP does not bind to SeCobB (data not shown), we infer that cAMP inhibits CobB-dependent deacetylation by directly binding to SeAcs. To understand the structural basis of SeAcs inhibition by cAMP, we determined the crystal structure of SeAcs complexed with cAMP, CoA, and acetate (Fig. 3, Table 1) at 1.65-Å resolution. The structure defined the binding site of cAMP on SeAcs, and the effects of cAMP and CoA binding on SeAcs conformation. The simulated annealing omit Fo − Fc electron density map shows unambiguous electron density of cAMP within the ATP/AMP binding pocket of SeAcs (Fig. 3, A and E), in agreement with our observation that cAMP inhibits SeAcs by competing with the substrate ATP (Fig. 1, C and D). The map also shows unambiguous electron density for adenosine and diphosphate moieties of CoA within the adjacent CoA binding pocket (right in Fig. 3A). However, no electron density for acetate was observed within the acetate-binding site of SeAcs, probably due to effect of steric hindrance by cAMP.TABLE 1Statistics of crystal structure of SeAcs in complex with cAMP and CoASeAcs-cAMP-CoAData collectionSpace groupP 21Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)60.2, 144.3, 71.7α, β, γ (°)90.0, 91.7, 90.0Resolution (Å)40.00–1.65 (1.68–1.65)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.Rsym or Rmerge0.146 (0.616)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.I/σI8.0 (2.0)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.Completeness (%)1.000 (1.000)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.Redundancy3.3 (3.3)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.CC1/2 in highest shell0.630RefinementResolution (Å)40.00–1.65No. reflections144575Rwork/Rfree0.169/0.207No. atomsProtein9998Ligand/ion138Water1113B-factors (Å2)Protein17.2Ligand/ion29.6Water25.3Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (°)1.148a Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Our crystal structure revealed that in the presence of cAMP and CoA, the C-terminal domain of SeAcs adopted an open conformation (red in Fig. 3B), exposing Lys609 to the solvent. Lys609 plays an important role in the first half of the reaction catalyzed by SeAcs and is subject to negative regulation by acetylation (13Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Sir2-dependent activation of acetyl-CoA synthetase by deacetylation of active lysine.Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We compared the “open” conformation in our crystal structure of SeAcs complex with the previously reported open conformation in a crystal structure of SeAcs in complex with CoA, acetate, and AMP (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2P2F) (22Reger A.S. Carney J.M. Gulick A.M. Biochemical and crystallographic analysis of substrate binding and conformational changes in acetyl-CoA synthetase.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6536-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); and the two open conformations are essentially identical. The Lys609 residue is located at the same position, and the side chains of Lys609 are both partially disordered in the two structures (Fig. 3C). We also compared our open conformation with a previously determined “closed” conformation of a crystal structure of yeast Acs in complex with AMP. We observed a large rotation of ∼100° in the Acs C-terminal domain, which includes Lys675 (Lys609 in SeAcs), in the closed conformation (Fig. 3D), as a result Lys675 is buried into the active center. The exposed conformation of Lys609 in our current structure would allow Lys609 to be more accessible for acetylation, consistent with the observation that the acetylation of SeAcs was remarkably increased in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 2C). Contacts between cAMP and residues of SeAcs are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. The adenine moiety of cAMP makes the same interactions with SeAcs as the adenine moiety of AMP makes in the crystal structure of SeAcs in complex with AMP, CoA, and acetate (PDB 2P2F; Fig. 3E) (22Reger A.S. Carney J.M. Gulick A.M. Biochemical and crystallographic analysis of substrate binding and conformational changes in acetyl-CoA synthetase.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6536-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These interactions are also the same for the adenine moiety of 5′-propyl-AMP in the crystal structure of SeAcs in complex with 5′-propyl-AMP and CoA (PDB 1PG4; Fig. 3E) (23Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. The 1.75-Å crystal structure of acetyl-CoA synthetase bound to adenosine-5′-propylphosphate and coenzyme A.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These interactions include: stacking effects of the adenine base to side chain atoms of Trp413 and Ile512 from one side and main chain atoms of Val386, Glu388, and Pro389 from the other side; one H-bond through the N6 atom of the adenine with Asp411; and one water-mediated H-bond through the N3 atom of the adenine with Asp500 (Fig. 4, A and B). The ribose moiety of cAMP makes three H-bonds through its 2′ OH group with Asp500, Gln415, and Arg515, respectively, and one H-bond through its 5′ O atom with Asn521. The phosphate group of cAMP contacts SeAcs by one H-bond with Thr416, one salt-bridge bond with Arg526, and Van der Waals interactions with Thr311 and Glu417. cAMP binds to the highly conserved ATP/AMP binding pocket of Acs and shares most contact residues with AMP (Figs. 3E and 4, A and B). Therefore it is not surprising that most contact residues of cAMP are conserved among bacterial species, yeast, and humans (Fig. 4C). We thereby propose that the regulatory effect of cAMP on Acs is possibly an important mechanism that has been preserved during evolution. Although the SeAcs crystal structure shows 14 total residues interact with cAMP either by H-bonds or Van der Waals forces (Fig. 4), it is still unknown which site(s) is critical. To further define the determinants of cAMP binding, we performed ITC experiments analyzing the binding affinity of cAMP to SeAcs derivatives bearing alanine substitution of residues that are involved in side chain interactions. As shown in Table 2, the derivatives of SeAcs W413A, Q415A, D500A, and R526A lost their ability to bind cAMP; whereas D411A, R515A, and N521A displayed decreased affinity; and T416A displayed a similar affinity to wild-type SeAcs.TABLE 2Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of cAMP to SeAcs derivativesSeAcsKdμmWT164 ± 11W413ANDaND, not detectable.Q415ANDD500ANDR526ANDT416A200 ± 50D411A1500 ± 300R515A1400 ± 300N521A590 ± 50a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab To verify that cAMP promotes SeAcs Lys609 acetylation through direct binding of cAMP to the ATP/AMP pocket in SeAcs, we performed similar in vitro Pat-dependent acetylation and CobB-dependent deacetylation assays using SeAcs derivatives W413A, Q415A, and D500A, which lost their cAMP binding ability. The W413A, Q415A, and D500A derivatives of SeAcs isolated from pat-null S. enterica cells were acetylated in vitro by SePat to a similar level to wild-type SeAcs (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 versus 3, 5 versus 6, 8 versus 9, and 11 versus 12). The W413A, Q415A, and D500A SeAcs derivatives isolated from cobB-null S. enterica cells were deacetylated by SeCobB in vitro to a similar level of undetectable acetylation to wild-type SeAcs (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 versus 3, 5 versus 6, 8 versus 9, and 11 versus 12). However, in contrast to wild-type SeAcs (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 1 versus 2), cAMP failed to affect either Pat-catalyzed acetylation (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 versus 5, 7 versus 8, and 10 versus 11) or CobB-catalyzed deacetylation (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 versus 5, 7 versus 8, and 10 versus 11) of the Lys609 on these SeAcs derivatives. As W413A, Q415A, and D500A derivatives of SeAcs were defective in cAMP binding (Table 2), the above results provide further support that the modulation of SeAcs acetylation by cAMP is dependent on direct cAMP binding. Acs belongs to a large acyl- or aryl-CoA synthetase protein family (EC 6.2.1-), which all contain a two-domain architecture and harbors a conserved ATP/AMP binding pocket (24Schmelz S. Naismith J.H. Adenylate-forming enzymes.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To explore whether cAMP might inhibit other members of the acyl- or aryl-CoA synthetase family in S. enterica, we tested the effect of cAMP against two other acyl-CoA synthetases from S. enterica, SePrpE and SeFadD. The potential inhibitory activities were measured in the presence of subsaturation ATP concentration. The activities of SePrpE and SeFadD were inhibited by cAMP by 80 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 6A). These results support our hypothesis that cAMP possibly regulates other members of the acyl- or aryl-CoA synthetase family in S. enterica. We aligned the protein sequences of all available acyl- or aryl-CoA synthetases (1190 records) from the UniPortKB database, and found that 13 of the 14 cAMP contact residues are generally conserved (Fig. 6B). We speculate that the regulation by cAMP might be a more widespread occurrence in this protein family in organisms apart from S. enterica. This study establishes that cAMP modulates Acs activity through a novel mechanism. We show that cAMP occupies the ATP/AMP binding pocket of SeAcs, inhibiting SeAcs activity by competitive binding against its natural substrate ATP. We found that cAMP cooperates with Pat/CobB to regulate SeAcs acetylation and activity. Finally, we observed a similar inhibitory effect of cAMP against SePrpE and SeFadD, both harboring the ATP/AMP-binding domain and forming AMP during catalysis, and thus, this novel regulatory mechanism is proposed to be extendable to acyl- or aryl-CoA synthetase family enzymes, subject to future confirmation. cAMP adjusts cellular anabolism and catabolism in some bacteria to allow adaptation to an environment with a non-preference carbon source. cAMP activates/represses the transcription of about 200 genes by directly binding to and allosterically activating CRP (25Zheng D. Constantinidou C. Hobman J.L. Minchin S.D. Identification of the CRP regulon using in vitro and in vivo transcriptional profiling.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5874-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). One of them is the gene that encodes Acs, which converts acetate to acetyl-CoA to fuel the life when glucose is absent and the environmental concentration of acetate is low. This reaction is costly and is deemed to be regulated by cAMP (10Beatty C.M. Browning D.F. Busby S.J. Wolfe A.J. Cyclic AMP receptor protein-dependent activation of the Escherichia coli acsP2 promoter by a synergistic class III mechanism.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5148-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Acs consumes one ATP for activating one acetate, releasing one AMP and one PPi. Two more ATPs in total are consumed by adenylate kinase to catalyze the recycling of AMP to ADP (the ATP precursor), and by pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase to catalyzes PPi hydrolysis (26Chan C.H.

Uncontrolled overexpression of Acs has been reported to cause a low-energy physiology state and arrest growth of S. enterica cells (26Chan C.H. Garrity J. Crosby H.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2563465038,"Ethylene is crucial in climacteric fruit ripening. The ethylene signal pathway regulates several physiological alterations such as softening, carotenoid accumulation and sugar level reduction, and production of volatile compounds. All these physiological processes are controlled by numerous genes and their expression simultaneously changes at the onset of ripening. Ethylene insensitive 2 (EIN2) is a key component for ethylene signal transduction, and its mutation causes ethylene insensitivity. In tomato, silencing SlEIN2 resulted in a non-ripening phenotype and low ethylene production. RNA sequencing of SlEIN2-silenced and wild type tomato, and differential gene expression analyses, indicated that silencing SlEIN2 caused changes in more than 4,000 genes, including those related to photosynthesis, defense, and secondary metabolism. The relative expression level of 28 genes covering ripening-associated transcription factors, ethylene biosynthesis, ethylene signal pathway, chlorophyll binding proteins, lycopene and aroma biosynthesis, and defense pathway, showed that SlEIN2 influences ripening inhibitor (RIN) in a feedback loop, thus controlling the expression of several other genes. SlEIN2 regulates many aspects of fruit ripening, and is a key factor in the ethylene signal transduction pathway. Silencing SlEIN2 ultimately results in lycopene biosynthesis inhibition, which is the reason why tomato does not turn red, and this gene also affects the expression of several defense-associated genes. Although SlEIN2-silenced and green wild type fruits are similar in appearance, their metabolism is significantly different at the molecular level."

Present study was designed to compare the impact of specific dairy proteins on muscular function with or without a low-intensity physical activity program on a treadmill in an aged rat model. We investigated the effects of nutritional supplementation, five days a week over a 2-month period with a slow digestible protein, casein or fast digestible proteins, whey or soluble milk protein, on strength and locomotor parameters in sedentary or active aged Wistar RjHan rats (17–19 months of age). An extensive gait analysis was performed before and after protein supplementation. After two months of protein administration and activity program, muscle force was evaluated using a grip test, spontaneous activity using an open-field and muscular mass by specific muscle sampling. When aged rats were supplemented with proteins without exercise, only minor effects of different diets on muscle mass and locomotion were observed: higher muscle mass in the casein group and improvement of stride frequencies with soluble milk protein. By contrast, supplementation with soluble milk protein just after physical activity was more effective at improving overall skeletal muscle function in old rats compared to casein. For active old rats supplemented with soluble milk protein, an increase in locomotor activity in the open field and an enhancement of static and dynamic gait parameters compared to active groups supplemented with casein or whey were observed without any differences in muscle mass and forelimb strength. These results suggest that consumption of soluble milk protein as a bolus immediately after a low intensity physical activity may be a suitable nutritional intervention to prevent decline in locomotion in aged rats and strengthen the interest to analyze the longitudinal aspect of locomotion in aged rodents."

In this study we investigated the effects of chronic treatment of olanzapine on the fatty acid composition of plasma in mice.Twenty 8-week female Balb/c mice were randomly assigned to two groups: the OLA group and the control group. After treatment with olanzapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle intraperitoneally for 8 weeks, fasting glucose, insulin levels and oral glucose tolerance test were determined. Effects on plasma fatty acid profile and plasma indices of D5 desaturase, D6 desaturase and SCD1 activity were also investigated.Chronic administration of olanzapine significantly elevated fasting glucose and insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance, but did not increase body weight. Total saturated fatty acids and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were significantly increased and total monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly decreased, while total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids showed no prominent changes. Chronic olanzapine treatment significantly up-regulated D6 desaturase activity while down-regulating D5 desaturase activity. Palmitic acid (C16:0), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6) and D6 desaturase were associated with an increase probability of insulin resistance, whereas nervonic acid (C24:1) and SCD1 were significantly associated with a lower insulin resistance probability.All results indicated that such drug-induced effects on fatty acid profile in plasma were relevant for the metabolic adverse effects associated with olanzapine and possibly other antipsychotics. Further studies are needed to investigate geneticand other mechanisms to explain how plasma fatty acids regulate glucose metabolism and affect the risk of insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2566710481,"Objectives To screen susceptibility loci for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) using an affected-only linkage analysis based on high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a genome-wide manner. Patients and Methods AS patients from ten families with Cantonese origin of China were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were genotyped using genomic DNA derived from peripheral blood leukocytes by Illumina HumanHap 610-Quad SNP Chip. Genotype data were generated using the Illumina BeadStudio 3.2 software. PLINK package was used to remove non-autosomal SNPs and to further eliminate markers of typing errors. An affected-only linkage analysis was carried out using both non-parametric and parametric linkage analyses, as implemented in MERLIN. Result Seventy-eight AS patients (48 males and 30 females, mean age: 39±16 years) were enrolled in the study. The mean age of onset was 23±10 years and mean duration of disease was 16.7±12.2 years. Iritis (2/76, 2.86%), dactylitis (5/78, 6.41%), hip joint involvement (9/78, 11.54%), peripheral arthritis (22/78, 28.21%), inflammatory back pain (IBP) (69/78, 88.46%) and HLA-B27 positivity (70/78, 89.74%) were observed in these patients. Using non-parameter linkage analysis, we found one susceptibility locus for AS, IBP and HLA-B27 in 6p21 respectively, spanning about 13.5Mb, 20.9Mb and 21.2Mb, respectively No significant results were found in the other clinical trait groups including dactylitis, hip involved and arthritis. The identical susceptibility locus region spanning above 9.44Mb was detected in AS IBP and HLA-B27 by the parametric linkage analysis. Conclusion Our genome-wide SNP linkage analysis in ten families with ankylosing spondylitis suggests a susceptibility locus on 6p21 in AS, which is a risk locus for IBP in AS patients."
