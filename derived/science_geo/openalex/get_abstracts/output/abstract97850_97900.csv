https://openalex.org/W2073618030,"Bright artificial light suppressed nocturnal secretion of melatonin in six normal human subjects. Room light of less intensity, which is sufficient to suppress melatonin secretion in other mammals, failed to do so in humans. In contrast to the results of previous experiments in which ordinary room light was used, these findings establish that the human response to light is qualitatively similar to that of other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1988484106,"We present the nucleotide sequences of the Gγ- and Aγ-globin genes from one chromosome (A) and of most of the Aγ gene from the other chromosome (B) of the same individual. All three genes have a small, highly conserved intervening sequence (IVS1) of 122 bp located between codons 30 and 31 and a large intervening sequence (IVS2) of variable length (866–904 bp) between codons 104 and 105. A stretch of simple sequence DNA occurs in IVS2 which appears to be a hot spot for recombination. On the 5′ side of this simple sequence, the allelic Aγ genes differ considerably in IVS2 whereas the nonallelic Gγ- and Aγ genes from chromosome A differ only slightly. Yet on the 3′ side of the simple sequence, the allelic genes differ only slightly whereas the nonallelic genes differ considerably. We hypothesize that the 5′ two thirds of the Aγ gene on chromosome A has been “converted” by an intergenic exchange to become more like the Gγ gene on its own chromosome A than it is like the allelic Aγ gene on the other chromosome B. Our sequence data suggest that intergenic conversions occur in the germ line. The DNA sequence differences between two chromosomes from a single individual strongly suggest that DNA sequence polymorphisms for localized deletions, additions and base substitutions are very common in human populations."

The duration of polygraphically recorded sleep episodes was highly correlated with the circadian phase of the body temperature rhythm at bedtime and not with the length of prior wakefulness. Furthermore, the rate of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep accumulation, REM latency, bedtime selection, and self-rated alertness assessments were also correlated with the body temperature rhythm."

A perceptual enumeration process called subitizing, present in 2-year-olds, probably underlies this capacity. This finding indicates that some number capacity is present before the onset of verbal counting, and it suggests that verbal counting may have precursors present during infancy."

Liposomes containing the pH-sensitive lipid palmitoyl homocysteine (PHC) were constructed so that the greatest pH differential (6.0 to 7.4) of drug release was obtained near physiological temperature. Such liposomes could be useful clinically if they enable drugs to be targeted to areas of the body in which pH is less than physiological, such as primary tumors and metastases or sites of inflammation and infection."
https://openalex.org/W1572064562,"A method employing reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography has been developed for the purification of large denatured peptides. The cyanogen bromide fragments of hemoglobin alpha, beta, and gamma chains (13 to 91 residues in length) could be separated and recovered in 71 to 95% yields using LiChrosorb C-8 columns and a binary solvent system consisting of 0.013 M trifluoroacetic acid in water and a limiting organic solvent. This procedure permits the nondestructive detection of peptides at low wavelength (210 nm) on as little as 50 ng of sample. The peptides are recovered directly by evaporation or lyophilization. An elutropic solvent series for the separation of large and small peptides on reverse phase supports is also described."
https://openalex.org/W2038197846,"The development of the polarized surface binding of the fluoresceinated ligand concanavalin A (FITC-Con A) was studied in blastomeres of the early mouse embryo. Single 8-cell blastomeres, natural 8-cell couplets derived from the in vitro division of individual 4-cell blastomeres, and reagregated couplets made from dissociated 8-cells were cultured for varying periods of time and on a variety of substrata. The development of surface polarity was found to be highly dependent upon cell contact. Over 50% of the cells in couplets were polarized after 4-5 hr in culture, with the smaller cell in the couplet usually more advanced in its polarization than the larger cell. The orientation of the poles of FITC-Con A binding was opposite the point of contact between cells in the couplets regardless of their previous orientation within the embryo or the plane of cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1979325051,"The fluorescent brightener, Calcofluor White ST, prevents the in vivo assembly of crystalline cellulose microfibrils and ribbons by Acetobacter xylinum. In the presence of more than 0.01 percent Calcofluor, Acetobacter continues to synthesize high-molecular-weight beta-1,4 glucans. X-ray crystallography shows that the altered product exhibits no detectable crystallinity in the wet state, but upon drying it changes into crystalline cellulose I. Calcofluor alters cellulose crystallization by hydrogen bonding with glucan chains. Synthesis of this altered product is reversible and can be monitored with fluorescence and electron microscopy. Use of Calcofluor has made it possible to separate the processes of polymerization and crystallization leading to the biogenesis of cellulose microfibrils, and has suggested that crystallization occurs by a cell-directed. self-assembly process in Acetobacter xylinum."

The inert gas xenon, which has anesthetic properties similar to those of nitrous oxide, does not cause teratogenic effects under the same experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2045280917,"A classical conditioning paradigm was used to demonstrate that male rats can learn to secrete luteinizing hormone and testosterone in anticipation of sexual activity. Sexually naïve males were exposed to a neutral stimulus and then to a sexually receptive female once daily. After exposure to the paired stimuli for 14 trials, the neutral stimulus was as effective as the female in triggering luteinizing hormone and testosterone secretion. These findings provide two novel perspectives on the control of reproductive hormone secretion in male rats: (i) environmental cues, which males learn to associate with sexual activity, induce the secretion of hormones that regulate pituitary-testis function, and (ii) classical conditioning may be used as a noninvasive method to evoke functional alterations in the secretion of luteinizing hormone and presumably the neuroendocrine pathways that mediate its release."
https://openalex.org/W2029191410,"Hepatitis B virus DNA contains a tightly bound protein which was not removed by healing to 60 degrees C with 2% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol. The protein was indirectly demonstrated by the extraction of the DNA-protein complex with phenol before but not after its digestion with proteinase K. The DNA-protein complex had a lower buoyant density than protease-treated or free DNA; it was bound to glass fiber filters; it migrated at a slower rate in gel electrophoresis; and it could be radiolabeled by oxidative iodination. The binding site of the protein was mapped by extraction of restriction endonuclease digests with phenol and analysis of the digests for missing DNA fragments. The protein was localized to a site near the 5' end of the complete viral DNA strand. It remained attached to this strand after heating with SDS to 90 degrees C or treatment with 0.1 N NaOH, suggesting a covalent linkage. The 5' end of neither viral DNA strand could be phosphorylated in a reaction with polynucleotide kinase, consistent with attachment of protein to the 5' ends. The incomplete DNA strand, however, which is the strand elongated by the virion DNA polymerase reaction, did not contain a detectable amount of polypeptide as did the complete strand. The reasons for the apparent block of the 5' end of the incomplete DNA strand is thus not known. The protein bound covalently to HBV DNA could be involved in the replication of the complete viral DNA strand and/or endonucleolytic generation of linear unit-length DNA pieces from replicative intermediates, although its function and origin are not yet known."
https://openalex.org/W2042951732,"The melatonin content measured by radioimmunoassay of the pineal gland over a 24-hour period (a light:dark cycle of 14 hours of light and 10 of darkness) was compared in young and old female and male Syrian hamsters. The young animals of both sexes exhibited roughly an eightfold rise in pineal melatonin during the dark phase of the cycle, whereas in the old hamsters the nocturnal rise in melatonin was almost completely absent. The results indicate a marked drop in pineal biosynthetic activity in the aging hamster."

https://openalex.org/W2002944360,"Two thirds of the natural chicken ovomucoid gene has been sequenced, including all exons and the intron sequences surrounding all fourteen intron/exon junctions. The junction sequences surrounding four of the introns are redundant; however, the sequences surrounding the other three introns contain no redundancies and thus the splicing sites at either end of these three introns are unambiguous. The splicing in all cases conforms to the GT-AG rule. The ovomucoid gene sequence around intron F can be used to predict the cause of an internal deletion polymorphism in the ovomucoid protein, which is an apparent error in the processing of the ovomucoid pre-mRNA. We also compare the structural organization of the ovomucoid gene with the ovomucoid protein sequence to examine theories of the evolution of ovomucoids as well as the origin of intervening sequences. This analysis suggests that the present ovomucoid gene evolved from a primordial ovomucoid gene by two separate intragenic duplications. Furthermore, sequence analyses suggest that introns were present in the primordial ovomucoid gene before birds and mammals diverged, about 300 million years ago. Finally, the positions of the introns within the ovomucoid gene support the theory that introns separate gene segments that code for functional domains of proteins and provide insight on the manner by which eucaryotic genes were constructed during the process of evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2069633295,"Fusion of phospholipid vesicles with a planar phospholipid bilayer membrane that contains a calcium-binding protein appears to mimic the essential aspects of cytoplasmic-vesicle fusion with plasma membranes (exocytosis) in that (i) there is a low basal rate of fusion in the absence of Ca2+, (ii) this basal rate is enormously increased by micromolar (approximately 10 microM) amounts of Ca2+, and (iii) this rate is not increased by millimolar Mg2+. Essential to this process is an osmotic gradient across the planar membrane, with the side containing the vesicles hyperosmotic to the opposite side. Similar osmotic gradients or their equivalent may be crucial for biological fusion events."
https://openalex.org/W2023463469,"At night efferent optic nerve activity generated by a circadian clock in the Limulus brain changes the structure of the photoreceptor and surrounding pigment cells in the animal's lateral eyes. The structural changes allow each ommatidium to gather light from a wider area at night than during the day. Visual sensitivity is thereby increased, but spatial resolution is diminished. At daybreak efferent activity from the clock stops, the structural changes reverse, and the field of view of each ommatidium decreases. The cyclic changes are endogenous and continue in the dark. Thus, under the control of a circadian clock, the Limulus eye exchanges its daytime acuity for greater sensitivity at night."

https://openalex.org/W1486373758,"Rabbit skeletal and cardiac tropomyosin were specifically labeled at their cysteine side chains with N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide. A high degree of intramolecular excimer formation due to interaction between adjacent pyrenes on Cys 190 of each chain was observed by fluorescence techniques. This modification produced low values of specific viscosity at low salt, indicating an inhibition of the salt-dependent polymerizability. Despite the loss of polymerizability, the excimer fluorescence of pyrene-tropomyosin increased with a similar salt dependence as the decrease in viscosity of an unlabeled control. Transient and steady state fluorescence measurements on the labeled tropomyosin indicated the presence of two states of labeled tropomyosin, an excimer-forming state (State B) and a nonexcimer-forming state (State A), in equilibrium with each other. The increase in excimer with increasing temperature and salt concentration can be explained by a shift in equilibrium toward State B. Steric considerations suggest that, in order for the pyrenes to form an excimer, localized chain separation in State B is required."
https://openalex.org/W1990897368,"Mild digestion of Xenopus nuclei with micrococcal nuclease results in the cleavage of oocyte-type 5S RNA genes once every four nucleosomes, or about once per tandem repeating unit of 5S DNA. This specific cleavage pattern is observed with nuclei from somatic cells where oocyte-type 5S genes are never transcribed (blood and liver) and with cultured cell nuclei where these genes are in a DNAase I-sensitive chromatin conformation and low level transcription is observed. Cleavage of protein-free DNA with micrococcal nuclease does not result in a specific digestion pattern. The similarity of the nuclease-generated repeat length and the sequence repeat length of oocyte-type 5S genes suggested a sequence-specific arrangement of nucleosomes on these DNA sequences. Restriction endonuclease analysis indicates that micrococcal nuclease preferentially cleaves in a restricted region within the 5S repeating unit, about 200 bp from the single Hind III site. Using specific end-labeled DNA probes derived from cloned 5S DNA we can recognize at least four possible modes of organization of the nucleosomes on 5S DNA. In each of these phase arrangements, functionally significant regions of the 5S gene (start of transcription, middle control region and transcription termination site) are found in or near nucleosome linkers."
https://openalex.org/W2078355859,Conditioned medium derived from organ or cell cultures prepared from 19- to 21-day fetal rat calvaria stimulated the incorporation of [3H]proline into collagen and of [3H]thymidine into DNA in organ cultures of the same tissue. Addition of cortisol enhanced the effect on collagen but not on DNA synthesis. These effects appeared to be due to a nondialyzable and heat-stable growth factor.
https://openalex.org/W1541852335,"The amphipathic helix hypothesis for plasma lipoproteins was investigated using synthetic peptides. The lipid-associating properties of two potentially amphipathic model peptides and two analogs were studied by incubating synthetic peptides with small unilamellar vesicles and protein-lipid association examined by equilibrium density centrifugation, leakage of liposome-entrapped fluorescence compounds, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The analog peptides were designed to determine the significance of the number and specific location of the charged residues in amphipathic domains of plasma lipoproteins to protein-lipid association. Based on the four procedures used to examine protein-lipid interactions, the two model peptides (18Aa, 18As) were found to associate strongly with liposomes; the two analog peptides (18As1, 18Asr), differing only with respect to the number and/or position of their charged residues, failed to demonstrate similar lipid binding properties. These findings support the earlier suggestions of the importance of the charged residues, but do not define the precise mechanisms involved. Such amino acids may help initiate the lipid-protein association by electrostatic interactions, contribute to the hydrophobicity of the nonpolar face of the helix by the acyl portion of lysine and arginine, and/or complement the charge distribution in the polar head regions of the phospholipid molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1979913685,"In mammals, ovarian cells that have been exposed to soluble H-Y antigen acquire the H-Y+ cellular phenotype. They absorb H-Y antibody in serological tests. To determine whether masculinization of the bovine freemartin, the synchorial female twin of a bull, could be due to attachment of circulating bull-twin-derived H-Y in the freemartin gonad, we exposed normal fetal ovarian cells to serum from fetal bulls, fetal cows and fetal freemartins. Ovarian target cells became H-Y+ after exposure to serum from fetal bulls or fetal freemartins, but not after exposure to serum from fetal cows. In a new competitive binding radioassay, uptake of Daudi-secreted tritiated H-Y was inhibited in fetal ovarian target cells first exposed to mouse testis supernatant, a demonstrated source of soluble H-Y. It was also inhibited in ovarian target cells exposed to serum from fetal bulls or fetal freemartins; uptake was unaffected by exposure to serum from fetal cows. Since Daudi-secreted H-Y is known to induce precocious testicular organogenesis in XX indifferent gonads in culture, we infer that initial transformation of the freemartin gonad is due to H-Y antigen that is secreted in the fetal bull, transmitted in the common chorionic vasculature and bound by gonadal receptors of the fetal cow."
https://openalex.org/W2036066698,"Long-lasting electrical changes of identified Hermissenda neurons, the type B photoreceptors, can account for concomitant associative behavioral changes. Depolarization of the type B cells after paired light and rotation accumulates (as monitored with intracellular electrodes) with reptition. This accumulation was specific to stimulus pairing (versus light alone or explicitly unpaired stimuli) and to the orientation of the nervous system with respect to the center of rotation; it provides a neural step in the acquisition of associative behavioral changes for gastropod mollusks and possibly other species."
https://openalex.org/W1506602202,"The levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear estrogen receptor have been determined in livers of male Xenopus laevis stimulated by estradiol-17 beta to synthesize vitellogenin mRNA. Estrogen receptor levels were also determined in unstimulated liver and following long term withdrawal of estrogen. In unstimulated liver cells, which do not contain detectable vitellogenin mRNA, more than 80% of the estrogen receptor is located in the nucleus (550 high affinity estrogen binding sites/nucleus), while the cytoplasm contains only 100 high affinity estrogen binding sites/cell. Administration of estradiol-17 beta, which induces massive synthesis and accumulation of vitellogenin mRNA, induces the estrogen receptor as well. The nuclear receptor level rises to approximately 2,000 estrogen binding sites/cell, while the cytosol receptor increases to only 150 sites/cel. Liver cells of male X. laevis which have been withdrawn from estrogen for 70 days exhibit a striking change in receptor levels. The nuclear receptor returns to the level prevailing in unstimulated cells (approximately 500 sites/cell) while the cytosol receptor level rises to more than 1,200 sites/cell (equivalent to 260 fmol/g of tissue). The existence of a pool of cytosol receptor, which is rapidly available for induction of vitellogenin mRNA, may in part explain the shorter lag period and more rapid induction of vitellogenin mRNA observed during secondary estrogen stimulation of withdrawn Xenopus liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W1538777732,"A concentrated, DNA-free extract of histone acetylase A was prepared from calf thymus tissues in two simple steps, which exploit the ability of polyethylene glycol to precipitate both nucleic acids and proteins from solutions containing high concentrations of salt (Alberts, B., and Herrick, G. (1971) Methods Enzymol. 21, 198-217). This extract was then chromatographed on four successive columns. The use of 75 microgram/ml of insulin as a carrier protein in all of these later steps, plus the inclusion of 1 M urea in some column buffers, has been useful in improving both the yield and reproducibility of the purification. The highly active enzyme obtained has a molecular weight of about 70,000, and the best fractions could be about 30% pure. Our data indicate that the acetylase A is only a very minor protein in cells, being present in perhaps a few thousand molecules per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1503052868,"Aspects of the binding and dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA thiol esters by the general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase from pig liver were investigated using a dead-end inhibitor, S-octyl-CoA, several alternate substrates, and three active site-directed inhibitors. Experiments with S-octyl-CoA indicate that the carbonyl group of acyl-CoA thiol esters is not absolutely required for binding to the enzyme. However, the mode of binding of the 8-carbon thiol ether can be distinguished from the mode of binding of the enoyl-CoA product, octenoyl-CoA. Octanoyl pantetheine, octanoyl-etheno-CoA, and octanoyl-3'-dephospho-CoA are alternate substrates of the dehydrogenase. Steady state kinetic constants obtained with these alternate substrates indicate that the adenosine 5'-diphosphate, but not the 3'-phosphate, of the nucleotide moiety of acyl-CoA substrates contribute to the tight binding of the substrates. The substrate analogs 3'-butynoyl-CoA and 3-octynoyl-CoA are active site-directed, mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors of the dehydrogenase. These inhibitors covalently modify the apoprotein rather than the flavin. This finding and the fact that 2,3-octadienoyl-CoA also completely and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme indicate that th 3-acetylenic thiol esters inhibit the enzyme by a mechanism involving: (1) base-catalyzed abstraction of a protein at C-2 followed by isomerization to the allene carbanion, (2) protonation of the carbanion, and (3) attack of a nucleophile in the enzyme-active site on C-3 of the 2,3-dienoyl-CoA. The data show that the alkynoyl-CoA's are activated and bound at the active site of the enzyme. The results suggest that abstraction of a proton at C-2 of acyl-CoA substrates is the initial step in the catalytic pathway of dehydrogenation of substrates by the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2069757251,"Paired, but not random, presentations of light and rotation produced long-term changes in Hermissenda's response to light. The nature of this change depended on the orientation of the animals with respect to the center of rotation and was predicted by known organizational features of Hermissenda's nervous system. When rotation that excited caudal hair cells was paired with light, a significant increase in response latency to test lights resulted. Rotation exciting cephalic hair cells when paired with light decreased the response latencies compared with latencies produced by random presentation of light and rotation."

https://openalex.org/W2132805873,"Iodination of alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha BuTx) gives rise to two products, mono- and diiodo-alpha BuTx. A combination of enzymatic digestion and Edman degradation revealed that the iodinated derivatives contain label in residue Tyr 54 exclusively. This labeling pattern is reminiscent of the reactivity toward iodination of “short” neurotoxins. The binding properties of the two derivatives were compared. At 20 degrees C, in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, the association of mono-125I-alpha BuTx to detergent-solubilized Torpedo californica electroplax acetylcholine receptor is characterized by a rate constant of 5.2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, which is indistinguishable from the on-rate constant of the native toxin. Introduction of the second iodine atom reduces the association rate constant to 1.7 X 10(6) M-1 s-1. The diiodo derivative was also found to bind more slowly than the monoiodinated toxin by factors of 2.6 and 2.5 to partially purified preparations of acetylcholine receptor from denervated chick muscle and of toxin receptor from chick brain, respectively. No difference in dissociation kinetics was observed; both derivatives bind irreversibly to electric tissue and muscle acetylcholine receptor and dissociate from the neuronal receptor with an off-rate constant of 5.9 X 10(-5) s-1. In muscle, two sets of binding sites are kinetically distinguishable as originally observed by Brockes and Hall (Brockes, J. P., and Hall, Z. W. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 2092-2099). Di-125I-alpha BuTx binds more slowly to each site than mono-125I-alpha BuTx by factors of 2.0 and 3.7, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1480933869,"In the presence of thiols such as glutathione or dithiothreitol, choleragen catalyzes the NAD-dependent ADP-ribosylation of arginine and proteins; thiols reduce the disulfide linking the A1 and A2 peptides of the A protomer of the toxin, releasing the active A1 peptide. Homogeneous thiol:protein disulfide oxidoreductase from bovine liver, in the presence of limiting concentrations of glutathione or dithiothreitol, increased the rate of activation of choleragen and its A protomer. The ability of oxidoreductase preparations to activate choleragen co-chromatographed with oxidoreductase protein on gel permeation columns and was proportional to the concentration of oxidoreductase in the assay. In the presence of oxidoreductase, the concentrations of glutathione and dithiothreitol necessary for activation were reduced. Thiol:protein disulfide oxidoreductase could play a role in the reduction of choleragen and release of the catalytically active A1 peptide."

By using the filipin probe in pancreatic acinar cells, it was found that the polarity of filipin-induced deformations in the membrane limiting the Golgi condensing vacuoles is opposite that in the membrane limiting the mature zymogen granules. This asymmetry could be due to unequal partitioning of cholesterol between the membrane leaflets in these two compartments during the transformation of the condensing vacuole into the zymogen granule."

https://openalex.org/W1990541190,"In vitro translation experiments showed that the lens fiber cells of two hereditary cataracts in mice (Nakano and Philly) possessed a full complement of crystallin messenger RNA's, despite severely reduced synthesis of crystallin in these cells. The reduction in synthesis in the lens fiber cells correlated with the increase in Na+ and the decrease in K+, which occurs during cataractogenesis. In contrast to the fiber cells, the epithelial cells continued to synthesize crystallins in the cataractous lenses. Crystallin synthesis was stimulated in the fiber cells by raising the K+ concentration and lowering the Na+ concentration in the cultured lenses. The reduction in crystallin synthesis in the initial stages of cataractogenesis in the Nakano and Philly lenses thus appears to be due to poor utilization of crystallin messenger RNA's in the fiber cells."

https://openalex.org/W1529919500,"The specificity of rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase with respect to its interaction with acceptor residues at the 3' end of tRNA was analyzed using a model acceptor system consisting of dinucleoside monophosphates or nucleosides. Of all the dinucleoside monophosphates tested, only CpC was an active AMP acceptor, indicating that the specificity of the enzyme conforms exactly to the structure present at the 3' terminus of the natural acceptor, tRNA-C-C. Similarly, CMP incorporation into model acceptors closely paralleled the specificity seen with tRNA-C and tRNA-X. Competition studies between the model acceptors and tRNAs with modified 3' termini suggested that the model compounds bind to the enzyme at the site normally recognizing the 3' terminus of tRNA. Comparison of nucleotide incorporation into tRNAs and into the model acceptors revealed a number of differences which allowed us to separate effects on tRNA structure from direct effects on the reaction. These studies enabled us to distinguish several subsites on the enzyme: an ATP-donor site, two sites specifically recognizing the 2 terminal C residues on tRNA, and a site recognizing the nonreacting part of the tRNA. Thus, these results support several features of the multisite model previously proposed (Deutscher, M. P. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 459-468) to explain tRNA nucleotidyltransferase action."
https://openalex.org/W244629471,"tRNA nucleotidyltransferase incorporates both AMP and CMP into tRNA acceptors. Studies of the effects of nucleoside triphosphates, nucleotide analogues, and affinity reagents on AMP and CMP incorporation indicate that these residues are donated from different subsites. However, neither of these sites is completely specific for nucleoside triphosphate binding, and CMP can actually be incorporated from the AMP-donating site, although at a slow rate. The two donor subsites interact with each other, such that binding of a ligand to the ATP site stimulates incorporation from the CMP-donating site. This interaction accounts for the biphasic CTP saturation curve and the unusual effects of nucleoside triphosphates on CMP incorporation observed earlier. In addition to donating CMP, the CTP subsite also serves as the position of binding of the terminal C residue of tRNA-C-C and, in the absence of CTP, for binding of the terminal residue of tRNA-C. These results, together with those in the accompanying paper, have defined multiple accepting and donating subsites within the active site of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, as predicted from our previous model for enzyme action (Deutscher, M. P. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 459-468). However, since we have been unable to obtain definitive evidence for two CMP-donating sites, we have considered a modification of this earlier model which utilizes only a single CMP-donating site. Using these models, we discuss how the specificity of the donor and acceptor subsites ensures the accurate synthesis of the -C-C-A sequence of tRNA."

The beads from the columns were washed, transferred to alkaline peptone broth, and incubated. The O1 serovars were isolated and identified by established procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1523356119,"We have measured the pyrimidine nucleotide contents of the culture fluid, acid-soluble fraction, and acid-insoluble fraction of cultures of hamster embryo fibroblasts (third subculture) through the final two divisions of growth in culture. The cells show a growth delay between the penultimate and ultimate division periods and a concomitant biochemical synchrony of pyrimidine metabolism. The cells exhibit normal excretion of pyrimidine nucleotides beginning with the ultimate division cycle. This excretion results from the net breakdown of ribonucleic acid and a cell-regulated maximum for pyrimidine mononucleoside polyphosphate content. This upper limit for the pyrimidine nucleoside polyphosphate content is not a steady state phenomenon but rather an absence of both synthesis and utilization. The hamster embryo fibroblast exhibits a directed flow of salvage uridine for ribonucleic acid synthesis. We show that de novo synthetic uridine 5'-monophosphate also can be used for ribonucleic acid synthesis without prior entry into the cytoplasmic uridine nucleoside polyphosphate pool. During attachment and first division salvage uridine does enter the cytoplasmic nucleotide pool. The properties of the cytidine pools differ from the uridine pools in specific activity and levels of cytidine, due to turnover of the terminal C-C-A of cytoplasmic transfer ribonucleic acid and the delay in conversion of of nonradioactive de novo synthetic uridine 5'-monophosphate to cytidine 5'-triphosphate. The partial synchrony in these cultures has been used as a temporal marker of the observed events."
https://openalex.org/W2072382905,The rate at which glucose enters nerve terminals in muscle was estimated indirectly by measuring changes in miniature end-plate potential frequency D-Glucose entered nerve terminals in muscles with a fast twitch more rapidly than it entered those with a slow twitch. This suggests that nerve terminals in fast- and slow-twitch muscles differ in their rate of metabolism.
https://openalex.org/W1515884659,"A new graphical analysis of fluorescence enhancement produced by NADPH binding to fatty acid synthetase from the uropygial gland of goose showed that the enzyme contains two binding sites per monomer with different Kd values. The site with the lower Kd (1.3 microM) showed lower enhancement than that with the higher Kd (7 microM). After specific inactivation of the enoyl reductase of the enzyme with pyridoxal phosphate (Poulose, a. J., and Kolattukudy, P. E. (1980) ARch. Biochem. Biophys. 201, 313-321) only the low affinity binding site was found. Graphical analyses of the data strongly suggest that each peptide of fatty acid synthetase contains one keto reductase domain with low affinity for NADPH and one enoyl reductase domain with high affinity for NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1673972525,"Abstract Acetylcholine release by the phrenic nerve was measured in the isolated, perfused rat hemidiaphragm. In controls, the rate of release of acetylcholine increases with time; however, when (--)-hydroxycitrate, an inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, is added to the perfusate, the release of acetylcholine stabilizes at a level 40% below the final control value. In this preparation, the capacity of the citrate cleavage pathway to transfer acetyl coenzyme A from the nerve cell mitochondria to the cytosol increases with time; this is not the case for other transport processes."
