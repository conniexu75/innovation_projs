https://openalex.org/W3147165070,"The present paper investigates factors contributing to the home advantage, by using the exceptional opportunity to study professional football matches played in the absence of spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. More than 40,000 matches before and during the pandemic, including more than 1,000 professional matches without spectators across the main European football leagues, have been analyzed. Results support the notion of a crowd-induced referee bias as the increased sanctioning of away teams disappears in the absence of spectators with regard to fouls (p &lt; .001), yellow cards (p &lt; .001), and red cards (p &lt; .05). Moreover, the match dominance of home teams decreases significantly as indicated by shots (p &lt; .001) and shots on target (p &lt; .01). In terms of the home advantage itself, surprisingly, only a non-significant decrease is found. While the present paper supports prior research with regard to a crowd-induced referee bias, spectators thus do not seem to be the main driving factor of the home advantage. Results from amateur football, being naturally played in absence of a crowd, provide further evidence that the home advantage is predominantly caused by factors not directly or indirectly attributable to a noteworthy number of spectators."

Although this minimal cell includes genes essential for population growth, the physiology of its single cells remained uncharacterized. To investigate striking morphological variation in JCVI-syn3.0 cells, we present an approach to characterize cell propagation and determine genes affecting cell morphology. Microfluidic chemostats allowed observation of intrinsic cell dynamics that result in irregular morphologies. A genome with 19 genes not retained in JCVI-syn3.0 generated JCVI-syn3A, which presents morphology similar to that of JCVI-syn1.0. We further identified seven of these 19 genes, including two known cell division genes, ftsZ and sepF, a hydrolase of unknown substrate, and four genes that encode membrane-associated proteins of unknown function, which are required together to restore a phenotype similar to that of JCVI-syn1.0. This result emphasizes the polygenic nature of cell division and morphology in a genomically minimal cell."
https://openalex.org/W3140855175,"Objective To characterize the functional impairments of a cohort of patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation after surviving severe COVID-19 illness, in order to better understand the ongoing needs of this patient population. Methods This study consisted of a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and admitted to a regional inpatient rehabilitation hospital from April 29 th to May 22 nd , 2020. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and complications from acute hospitalization were examined. Measures of fall risk (Berg Balance Scale), endurance (6 Minute Walk Test), gait speed (10 Meter Walk Test), mobility (transfer and ambulation independence), cognition, speech and swallowing (American Speech and Hearing Association National Outcomes Measurement System Functional Communication Measures) were assessed at rehabilitation admission and discharge. Results The study population included 29 patients and was 70% male, 58.6% white and with a mean age of 59.5. The mean length of acute hospitalization was 32.2 days with a mean of 18.7 days intubated. Patients spent a mean of 16.7 days in inpatient rehabilitation and 90% were discharged home. Patients demonstrated significant improvement from admission to discharge in measures of fall risk, endurance, gait speed, mobility, cognition, speech and swallowing, (p&lt; 0.05). At discharge, a significant portion of the population continued to deficits in cognition (attention 37%; memory 28%; problem solving 28%), balance (55%) and gait speed (97%). Conclusion Patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation after hospitalization with COVID-19 demonstrated deficits in mobility, cognition, speech and swallowing at admission and improved significantly in all of these domains by discharge. However, a significant number of patients exhibited residual deficits at discharge highlighting the post-acute care needs of this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W3148383524,"Predators use vision to hunt, and hunting success is one of evolution's main selection pressures. However, how viewing strategies and visual systems are adapted to predation is unclear. Tracking predator-prey interactions of mice and crickets in 3D, we find that mice trace crickets with their binocular visual fields and that monocular mice are poor hunters. Mammalian binocular vision requires ipsi- and contralateral projections of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to the brain. Large-scale single-cell recordings and morphological reconstructions reveal that only a small subset (9 of 40+) of RGC types in the ventrotemporal mouse retina innervate ipsilateral brain areas (ipsi-RGCs). Selective ablation of ipsi-RGCs (<2% of RGCs) in the adult retina drastically reduces the hunting success of mice. Stimuli based on ethological observations indicate that five ipsi-RGC types reliably signal prey. Thus, viewing strategies align with a spatially restricted and cell-type-specific set of ipsi-RGCs that supports binocular vision to guide predation."
https://openalex.org/W3147057700,"We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a rural district of South India, six months after the index case.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 509 adults aged more than 18 years. From all the four subdistricts, two grampanchayats (administrative cluster of 5-8 villages) were randomly selected followed by one village through convenience. The participants were invited for the study to the community-based study kiosk set up in all the eight villages through village health committees. We collected socio-demographic characteristics and symptoms using a mobile application-based questionnaire, and we tested samples for the presence of IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 using an electro chemiluminescent immunoassay. We calculated age-gender adjusted and test performance adjusted seroprevalence.The age-and gender-adjusted seroprevalence was 8.5% (95% CI 6.9%- 10.8%). The unadjusted seroprevalence among participants with hypertension and diabetes was 16.3% (95% CI:9.2-25.8) and 10.7% (95% CI: 5.5-18.3) respectively. When we adjusted for the test performance, the seroprevalence was 6.1% (95% CI 4.02-8.17). The study estimated 7 (95% CI 1:4.5-1:9) undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case. Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was calculated as 12.38 per 10000 infections as on 22 October 2020. History of self-reported symptoms and education were significantly associated with positive status (p < 0.05).A significant proportion of the rural population in a district of south India remains susceptible to COVID-19. A higher proportion of susceptible, relatively higher IFR and a poor tertiary healthcare network stress the importance of sustaining the public health measures and promoting early access to the vaccine are crucial to preserving the health of this population. Low population density, good housing, adequate ventilation, limited urbanisation combined with public, private and local health leadership are critical components of curbing future respiratory pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3149257624,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and has led to drastic reductions in non-urgent medical visits. Deferral of these visits may have critical health impact, including delayed diagnosis for melanoma and other skin cancers. We examined the influence of the pandemic on skin biopsy rates in a large population-based cohort. Methods Using a universal health care claims dataset from Ontario, we examined skin biopsies from January 6, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and compared these to the same period for 2019. Those diagnosed with anogenital cancers, younger than 20 years, residing out-of-province and with lapses in coverage were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of claims diagnoses compared to a validated algorithm to identify keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), or to the cancer registry for melanoma was evaluated. Factors associated with biopsy during the early pandemic were investigated with modified Poisson regression. Results A precipitous drop in total skin biopsies (15% of expected), biopsies for KC (18%) and melanoma (27%) was seen with the onset of COVID-19 cases ( p &lt;0.01). Claims diagnoses were of high specificity for KC (99%), and for melanoma (98%), though sensitivity was less (61%, 28% respectively). In adjusted analysis, the elderly (80+ years), females and residents of certain regions were less likely to be biopsied during the pandemic. Subsequently, there were substantial improvements in biopsy rates over 10 weeks. However, compared to 2019, a large backlog of expected cases still remained 28 weeks after lockdown (45,710 all biopsy, 9,104 KC, 595 melanoma). Interpretation A drastic reduction in skin biopsies is noted early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this disproportionately affected the elderly, females and certain geographic regions. Though biopsies subsequently increased, a large backlog of cases remained after almost half a year. This will have implications for downstream care of skin cancer. Efforts should be made to limit diagnostic delay."

https://openalex.org/W3144714362,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worldwide. Our goal was to identify risk factors associated with admission and disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2.This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for 7,995 patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical data repository.Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) is a five-hospital academic health system serving a diverse patient population with community and teaching facilities in both urban and suburban areas.The study included adult patients who had SARS-CoV-2 testing at YNHH between March 1 and April 30, 2020.Primary outcomes were admission and in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR testing. We also assessed features associated with the need for respiratory support.Of the 28605 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 7995 patients (27.9%) had an infection (median age 52.3 years) and 2154 (26.9%) of these had an associated admission (median age 66.2 years). Of admitted patients, 2152 (99.9%) had a discharge disposition at the end of the study period. Of these, 329 (15.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 305 (14.2%) expired. Increased age and male sex were positively associated with admission and in-hospital mortality (median age 80.7 years), while comorbidities had a much weaker association with the risk of admission or mortality. Black race (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.14-1.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.50-2.18) were identified as risk factors for admission, but, among discharged patients, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups.This observational study identified, among people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, older age and male sex as the most strongly associated risks for admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While minority racial and ethnic groups had increased burden of disease and risk of admission, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality for discharged patients was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. Ongoing studies will be needed to continue to evaluate these risks, particularly in the setting of evolving treatment guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3140568159,"Science communication has been increasingly viewed as a necessity and obligation of scientists in recent years. The rise of Web 2.0 technologies, such as social media, has made communication of science to the public more accessible as a whole. While one of the primary goals of science communication is to increase public engagement, there is very little research to show the type of communication that fosters the highest levels of engagement. Here we evaluate two social medial platforms, Instagram and TikTok, and assess the type of educational science content (ESC) that promotes user awareness and overall engagement. Specifically, we measured the level of engagement between static and dynamic posts on Instagram, and lecture-style and experimental videos on TikTok. User engagement is measured through the analysis of relative number of likes, comments, shares, saves, and views of each post in the various categories. We found that users interact with ESC significantly more (p<0.05) when the content is presented in dynamic ways with a component of experimentation. Together, we took the findings of this study and provided a series of suggestions for conducting science communication on social media, and the type of ESC that should be used to promote better user outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3151870888,"The plant plasma membrane (PM) is an essential barrier between the cell and the external environment, controlling signal perception and transmission. It consists of an asymmetrical lipid bilayer made up of three different lipid classes: sphingolipids, sterols, and phospholipids. The glycosyl inositol phosphoryl ceramides (GIPCs), representing up to 40% of total sphingolipids, are assumed to be almost exclusively in the outer leaflet of the PM. However, their biological role and properties are poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the role of GIPCs in membrane organization. Because GIPCs are not commercially available, we developed a protocol to extract and isolate GIPC-enriched fractions from eudicots (cauliflower and tobacco) and monocots (leek and rice). Lipidomic analysis confirmed the presence of trihydroxylated long chain bases and 2-hydroxylated very long-chain fatty acids up to 26 carbon atoms. The glycan head groups of the GIPCs from monocots and dicots were analyzed by gas chromatograph–mass spectrometry, revealing different sugar moieties. Multiple biophysics tools, namely Langmuir monolayer, ζ-Potential, light scattering, neutron reflectivity, solid state 2H-NMR, and molecular modeling, were used to investigate the physical properties of the GIPCs, as well as their interaction with free and conjugated phytosterols. We showed that GIPCs increase the thickness and electronegativity of model membranes, interact differentially with the different phytosterols species, and regulate the gel-to-fluid phase transition during temperature variations.

The plant plasma membrane (PM) contains three main classes of lipids: phytosterols, sphingolipids, and phospholipids, all with a high level of molecular complexity, see (1Cacas J.L. Buré C.

Vidal-Puig A. Orešič M. Informatics and computational strategies for the study of lipids.Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids are part of essential lipids involved in the regulation of cellular signaling, trafficking, growth, and stress responses. Ubiquitous to eukaryotes, they are structurally different between the animal, fungi, and plant kingdoms (3Markham J.E. Lynch D.V. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. Cahoon E.B. Plant sphingolipids: Function follows form.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2013; 16: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). While some sphingolipid structures such as sphingoid bases are conserved in both plants and animal, others are specific to fungi and plants. In animal, sphingolipids are highly studied for their involvement in human health and pathologies (4Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Sphingolipids and their metabolism in physiology and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The most abundant sphingolipid in animal is sphingomyelin (SM) and gangliosides. In plants and fungi, they are absent, whereas other complex lipids comprised of sphingoid bases bound to glycan groups are part of the most abundant sphingolipid. The major sphingolipid subclass of sphingolipids in plants is the glycosyl inositol phosphoryl ceramides (GIPCs). GIPCs were discovered in plants and fungi during the 1950s (5Carter H.E. Gigg R.H. Law J.H. Nakayama T. Weber E. Biochemistry of the sphingolipides. XI. Structure of phytoglycolipide.J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1309-1314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural diversity of GIPCs lies in the glycosylation and in the hydroxylation, degree and position of saturation of their fatty acid (FA) chain, and long chain base (LCB) (6Pata M.O. Hannun Y.A. Ng C.K.Y. Plant sphingolipids: Decoding the enigma of the sphinx.New Phytol. 2010; 185: 611-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Plant GIPCs predominantly consist of a t18:0 or t18:1 LCB (trihydroxylated saturated or monounsaturated) amidified to a very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) or 2-hydroxylated VLCFA (hVLCFA) to form a ceramide (1Cacas J.L.

Mass Spectrom. 2011; 25: 3131-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The GIPC head group linked to the ceramide consists of a phosphate bound to an inositol, forming the inositol phosphoryl ceramide (IPC) backbone, which is then further substituted with further sugar moieties. A broad study of the GIPC polar heads of 23 plant species from algae to monocots showed that polar head structures are largely unknown and vary widely across different biological taxa (8Cacas J.L. Buré C. Furt F. Maalouf J.P. Badoc A. Cluzet S. Schmitter J.M. Antajan E. Mongrand S. Biochemical survey of the polar head of plant glycosylinositolphosphoceramides unravels broad diversity.Phytochemistry. 2013; 96: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GIPCs are classified into series, based on the degree of glycosylation of their polar head group (7Buré C. Cacas J.L. Wang F. Gaudin K. Domergue F. Mongrand S. Schmitter J.M. Fast screening of highly glycosylated plant sphingolipids by tandem mass spectrometry.Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2011; 25: 3131-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In plants, all GIPCs characterized to date have a glucuronic acid (GlcA) as the first sugar on the IPC, followed by at least one more sugar unit of varying identity. For example, GIPC series A is defined as one monosaccharide addition to the GlcA-IPC form (7Buré C. Cacas J.L. Wang F. Gaudin K. Domergue F. Mongrand S. Schmitter J.M.

Additional sugar moieties were described, such as glucosamine (GlcN), N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), arabinose (Ara), galactose (Gal), and mannose (Man), which may lead to observed glycan patterns of three to seven sugars, the so-called GIPC series B to F.

The GIPC’s polar head is responsible for the high polarity of the GIPC, accounting for its insolubility in traditional lipid extraction solvents, such as chloroform/methanol. Consequently, they are lost in the aqueous phase or at the interface. GIPCs, although one of the fundamental components of the plant PM model, have been poorly studied, in part because of the absence of commercial preparations.

This highlighted the importance of investigating and understanding the chemical structures of these molecules and their functions in membrane organization. Lipids are not homogeneously distributed within the PM bilayers. The lateral partitioning observed in the PM might be because of differential phase behaviors of different lipid species due to specific interactions between their different lipid species (23Kaiser H.J. Lingwood D. Levental I. Sampaio J.L. Kalvodova L. Rajendran L. Simons K. Order of lipid phases in model and plasma membranes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The continuing mystery of lipid rafts.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 4749-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Lipid domains or liquid-ordered (Lo) phases are formed from saturated phospholipids and sphingolipids in the presence of sterol, whereas liquid-disordered phases are formed mainly from unsaturated phospholipids (25Lingwood D. Simons K. Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle.Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3169) Google Scholar, 26Baumgart T. Hunt G. Farkas E.R. Webb W.W. Feigenson G.W. Fluorescence probe partitioning between Lo/Ld phases in lipid membranes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2182-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In Lo phases, the high degree of conformational order is imposed on the acyl tails of lipids by the rigid ring structure of cholesterol. This increases the thickness of the lipid bilayer and lipid packing, although lipids remain laterally mobile (27Mannock D.A. Lewis R.N.A.H. McMullen T.P.W. McElhaney R.N.

https://openalex.org/W3150141329,"Dengue, the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans is a recurring global health problem. In Bangladesh, dengue outbreaks are on the increase despite the efforts of government and it is not clear what the understanding of the general Dhaka population towards dengue fever is. Knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) studies are essential guides in public health interventions. Hence, using KAP, this study aims to assess patient-perspectives with regards to factors associated with dengue, as well as investigate the associated factors between the two corporations in Dhaka. A Hospital-based cross-sectional study of 242 fever patients from two city-corporations in Dhaka (Dhaka North City Corporations, DNCC (n = 91, 37.6%) and Dhaka South City Corporation, DSCC (n = 151, 62.4%) was conducted using pre-tested KAP items. Wilcoxon's Rank Sum was used to determine the KAP by DNCC, DSCC and both corporations and multivariate Poisson regression analyses. The two corporations were analysed separately due to the differences in income distribution, concentration of slums, hospitals and clinics. The study found that more than half of the study population were knowledgeable about dengue (mean percentage scores was 52%), possess an appropriate and acceptable attitude towards the disease (69.2%), and about two thirds of the respondents (71.4%) engaged in practices towards its prevention. After adjusting for the potential cofounders, the factors associated with KAP about dengue fever varied between DNCC and DSCC; with duration of residency and use of mosquito nets were associated with knowledge in the north while income class and age were associated with knowledge and attitude in the south. In the pooled analysis (combining both corporations), knowledge of dengue was associated with good practice towards dengue fever among the respondents. The duration of residence in Dhaka (10+ years), not using mosquito nets and length of time spent in the hospital (7+ days) due to dengue, and decreased knowledge (Adjusted coefficient (β) = -0.01, 95%CI: -0.02, -0.01) were associated with attitude towards dengue in DNCC. On the other hand, middle-high income class, age (40+ years) and increased knowledge were associated with practice towards dengue in DSCC (β = 0.02, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.03). Efforts to increase knowledge about dengue fever through education by the administrations of both corporations would benefit from targeting these high-risk groups for a more sustainable outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3151492710,"Efficient contact tracing and testing are fundamental tools to contain the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We used multi-agent simulations to estimate the daily testing capacity required to find and isolate a number of infected agents sufficient to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, so decreasing the risk of new waves of infections. Depending on the non-pharmaceutical mitigation policies in place, the size of secondary infection clusters allowed or the percentage of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic (i.e., subclinical) infections, we estimated that the daily testing capacity required to contain the disease varies between 0.7 and 9.1 tests per thousand agents in the population. However, we also found that if contact tracing and testing efficacy dropped below 60% (e.g. due to false negatives or reduced tracing capability), the number of new daily infections did not always decrease and could even increase exponentially, irrespective of the testing capacity. Under these conditions, we show that population-level information about geographical distribution and travel behaviour could inform sampling policies to aid a successful containment, while avoiding concerns about government-controlled mass surveillance."

DL had an AUC = 0.99 using intragenic CpGs, with both sensitivity and specificity being 97%. High AD prediction was also achieved using intergenic/extragenic CpG sites (DL significance value being AUC = 0.99 with 97% sensitivity and specificity). Epigenetically altered genes included CR1L & CTSV (abnormal morphology of cerebral cortex), S1PR1 (CNS inflammation), and LTB4R (inflammatory response). These genes have been previously linked with AD and dementia. The differentially methylated genes CTSV & PRMT5 (ventricular hypertrophy and dilation) are linked to cardiovascular disease and of interest given the known association between impaired cerebral blood flow, cardiovascular disease, and AD.

The public’s knowledge and practices play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards COVID-19 during its rapid rise. A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among a sample of the Mosul-Iraq population between 20 th June to 1 st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants’ knowledge, 3) participants’ practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p &lt; 0.05) was considered statistically significant. The results showed a knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91±1.67) and (21.56± 2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards COVID-19. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P&lt;0 . 05 . We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 except for respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards COVID-19 should be targeted towards this group."
https://openalex.org/W3146409991,"Organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1/SLC22A6) is a drug transporter with numerous xenobiotic and endogenous substrates. The Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory suggests that drug transporters with compatible ligand preferences can play a role in “organ crosstalk,” mediating overall organismal communication. Other drug transporters are well known to transport lipids, but surprisingly little is known about the role of OAT1 in lipid metabolism. To explore this subject, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model using omics data from the Oat1 knockout mouse. The model implicated OAT1 in the regulation of many classes of lipids, including fatty acids, bile acids, and prostaglandins. Accordingly, serum metabolomics of Oat1 knockout mice revealed increased polyunsaturated fatty acids, diacylglycerols, and long-chain fatty acids and decreased ceramides and bile acids when compared with wildtype controls. Some aged knockout mice also displayed increased lipid droplets in the liver when compared with wildtype mice. Chemoinformatics and machine learning analyses of these altered lipids defined molecular properties that form the structural basis for lipid-transporter interactions, including the number of rings, positive charge/volume, and complexity of the lipids. Finally, we obtained targeted serum metabolomics data after short-term treatment of rodents with the OAT-inhibiting drug probenecid to identify potential drug–metabolite interactions.

Consistent with the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory, the data support a role of OAT1 in systemic lipid metabolism. Studies relating to the systems biology of solute carrier (SLC) and ABC transporter families have suggested that members of the solute carrier 22 (SLC22) family, including organic anion transporters (OATs), organic cation transporters, and organic carnitine/zwitterion transporters, play a central role in endogenous metabolism (1Nigam S.K. The SLC22 transporter family: A paradigm for the impact of drug transporters on metabolic pathways, signaling, and disease.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2018; 58: 663-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SLC22 transporters are expressed across nearly all epithelia (e.g., kidney, liver, retina, placenta, olfactory epithelium) and some other tissue types (e.g., blood–brain barrier). In a network analysis involving over 50 SLC families, SLC22 appears to be one of the main hubs of all SLC families, which together consist of over 400 transporters (2Cesar-Razquin A. Snijder B. Frappier-Brinton T. Isserlin R. Gyimesi G. Bai X.Y. Reithmeier R.A. Hepworth D. Hediger M.A. Edwards A.M. Superti-Furga G. A call for systematic research on solute carriers.Cell. 2015; 162: 478-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). SLC22 also appears to form a central cluster in a gut–liver–kidney centered cross-tissue coexpression network aimed at clarifying endogenous interactions of SLC, ABC, and drug metabolizing enzymes families (3Rosenthal S.B. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. A network of SLC and ABC transporter and DME genes involved in remote sensing and signaling in the gut-liver-kidney axis.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 11879Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SLC22 transporters are highly evolutionarily conserved across several species (4Zhu C. Nigam K.B. Date R.C. Bush K.T. Springer S.A. Saier M.H. Wu W. Nigam S.K. Evolutionary analysis and classification of OATs, OCTs, OCTNs, and other SLC22 transporters: Structure-function implications and analysis of sequence motifs.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0140569Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which suggests a central physiological role. Of note, knockdowns of many SLC22 transporters in fly lead to phenotypes affecting development, cell function, or response to oxidative stress (5Engelhart D.C. Azad P. Ali S. Granados J.C. Haddad G.G. Nigam S.K. Drosophila SLC22 orthologs related to OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs regulate development and responsiveness to oxidative stress.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 2002Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The systems biology and evolutionary analyses lead to the following question: What are the key functions of this large and highly conserved transporter family in endogenous physiology? Historically, this question has received little attention, in part because several multi-specific SLC22 transporters are among the best known “drug” and toxin transporters; they are responsible for the distribution and elimination of hundreds of clinically relevant xenobiotics. Here, we focus on organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1/SLC22A6), originally identified as novel kidney transporter (6LopezNieto C.E. You G.F. Bush K.T. Barros E.J.G. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is expressed on the basolateral side of the renal proximal tubule and displays high affinity for antivirals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, statins, antihypertensives, and other organic anion drugs (7Burckhardt G. Drug transport by organic anion transporters (OATs).Pharmacol. Ther. 2012; 136: 106-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Along with OAT3 (SLC22A8), these two transporters account for the bulk of the multispecific organic anion uptake by the kidney proximal tubule, the key part of the nephron involved in drug and toxin handling (8Otani N. Ouchi M. Hayashi K. Jutabha P. Anzai N. Roles of organic anion transporters (OATs) in renal proximal tubules and their localization.Anat. Sci.

In addition to drug transport, a combination of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies has made it clear that OAT1 and other SLC22 transporters are also involved in regulating endogenous metabolism through modulating the serum levels of key metabolites and signaling molecules (1Nigam S.K.

OAT1 has been shown to be a contributor to the transport of drugs, toxins, metabolites, signaling molecules, and gut microbe products from the blood into the proximal tubule cells; this is generally believed to lead to excretion into the urine via apical membrane drug transporters (7Burckhardt G.

There is a growing appreciation of how—even in patients treated with a course of antibiotics, or chronically with a small number of drugs for, say, mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia—drugs, metabolites, toxins, and signaling molecules might compete for transport by the OATs and other multispecific SLC and ABC transporters (14Lepist E.I. Ray A.S. Beyond drug-drug interactions: Effects of transporter inhibition on endobiotics, nutrients and toxins.Expert Opin. Drug Metab. Toxicol. 2017; 13: 1075-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is still relatively little understanding of how drug transporters affect in vivo metabolism. It has been posited that a major role of drug transporters is to help maintain local and systemic homeostasis through the regulation of small molecule levels (15Ahn S.Y. Nigam S.K.

The Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory focuses on the role of drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes in mediating intra-organ, inter-organ, and inter-organismal communication partly via the transport and metabolism of key metabolites and signaling molecules (3Rosenthal S.B.

Nephrol. 2019; 15: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this framework, the regulated expression of several transporters with compatible ligand preferences across multiple organs can lead to “organ cross talk” through shared substrates. For example, OAT1 shares metabolites and signaling molecule substrates with multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRPs) and organic anion transporting polypeptides in the liver and elsewhere (19Hagos Y. Wolff N.A. Assessment of the role of renal organic anion transporters in drug-induced nephrotoxicity.Toxins. 2010; 2: 2055-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Roth M. Obaidat A.

Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 1260-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Within the kidney, proteomic studies have also shown that the abundance of OAT1 is highly correlated with the efflux transporters MRP2 and MRP4 across several species (21Basit A. Radi Z. Vaidya V.S. Karasu M. Prasad B. Kidney cortical transporter expression across species using quantitative proteomics.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2019; 47: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OAT1 is expressed in the placenta and the choroid plexus, albeit at lower levels than in the kidney, implying a role in the function of these organs. Many other clinically relevant SLC and ABC multispecific transporters are also expressed in multiple tissues. In contrast to ABC transporters, which have been known for some time to play key roles in lipid transport (22Borst P. Zelcer N. van Helvoort A. ABC transporters in lipid transport.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) (as well as some metabolic diseases involving lipids), the role of SLC transporters, particularly multispecific ones such as OAT1, in lipid regulation is not well understood. In studies generally focused on other aspects of OAT function, in vitro assays have shown that OAT1-overexpressing cells transport certain fatty acids (23Yee S. Giacomini M.M. Hsueh C.H. Weitz D.

Nevertheless, there has been surprisingly little specific attention given to the role of OAT1 in lipid regulation. Although metabolic reconstructions centered on the OATs have been performed in the past (24Liu H.C. Jamshidi N. Chen Y. Eraly S.A. Cho S.Y. Bhatnagar V. Wu W. Bush K.T. Abagyan R. Palsson B.O.

Dispos. 2013; 41: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), genome-scale metabolic reconstruction methods using omics data have advanced considerably in recent years and now include several hundred more lipid metabolites. To further analyze the role of OAT1 in the regulation of lipids, we generated a novel metabolic reconstruction based on transcriptomic and metabolomic data from the Oat1 KO mice. The updated model placed an even greater emphasis on the lipids affected by OAT1 than previous reconstructions. Experimentally, targeted metabolomics analyzing hundreds of endogenous metabolites in the serum of Oat1 KO mice showed that the absence of this transporter had a striking impact on many different aspects of lipid metabolism. Many of the altered metabolites are well-established signaling molecules known to regulate G-protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors in remote organs (27Papackova Z. Cahova M. Fatty acid signaling: The new function of intracellular lipases.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015; 16: 3831-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Husted A.S. Trauelsen M. Rudenko O. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. GPCR-mediated signaling of metabolites.Cell Metab. 2017; 25: 777-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because of the large number of lipid metabolites with varying chemical structures analyzed, we were able to combine a chemoinformatics approach with machine learning methods to define distinct molecular properties of lipids regulated by OAT1. This work not only highlights the potential of OAT1 in the modulation of systemic lipid metabolism and signaling, but, as we show, it also provides insight into certain drug-induced dyslipidemias such as those seen with chronic treatment with OAT1-transported diuretics or antiviral cocktails (29Wofford M.R. King D.S. Harrell T.K. Drug-induced metabolic syndrome.J. Clin. Hypertens. (Greenwich). 2006; 8: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In recent years, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have greatly advanced (e.g., Recon3D) and found increasing use in the reconstruction of metabolism when a gene is deleted (30Gu C. Kim G.B. Kim W.J. Kim H.U. Lee S.Y. Current status and applications of genome-scale metabolic models.Genome Biol. 2019; 20: 121Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Brunk E. Sahoo S. Zielinski D.C.

Noronha A. et al.Recon3D enables a three-dimensional view of gene variation in human metabolism.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). They are based in transcriptomics data and may be constrained by metabolomics data, when available, to add in vivo relevance. Older metabolic reconstructions of Oat1 knockout animals had linked its absence to several unique metabolic pathways (24Liu H.C. Jamshidi N. Chen Y. Eraly S.A. Cho S.Y. Bhatnagar V. Wu W. Bush K.T. Abagyan R. Palsson B.O. Nigam S.K. An organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1)-centered metabolic network.J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 31522-31531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but these models used early methods and databases that were limited by the number of reactions and metabolites present in the genome-scale metabolic model. Often described as the most comprehensive metabolic network model to date, Recon3D has improved upon the previous genome-scale metabolic models and accounts for considerably more biochemical reactions and metabolites from the BiGG database than earlier versions of Recon (32King Z.A. Lu J. Drager A. Miller P. Federowicz S. Lerman J.A. Ebrahim A. Palsson B.O. Lewis N.E. BiGG models: A platform for integrating, standardizing and sharing genome-scale models.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D515-D522Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Particularly relevant to the work presented here is the fact that Recon3D includes over 600 new lipid metabolites (31Brunk E. Sahoo S. Zielinski D.C. Altunkaya A. Drager A. Mih N. Gatto F. Nilsson A. Preciat Gonzalez G.A. Aurich M.K. Prlic A. Sastry A. Danielsdottir A.D. Heinken A. Noronha A. et al.Recon3D enables a three-dimensional view of gene variation in human metabolism.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, we used Recon3D and focused on lipids, which had only received cursory attention in previous Oat1 KO metabolic reconstructions. Wildtype and Oat1 KO-based metabolic models were constructed using existing transcriptomic and metabolomic data from the Oat1 KO mice. In these Recon3D models, 1945 reactions belonging to different subsystems were significantly altered (Fig. 1A, Table S1). These reactions affected 312 metabolites (Table S2). It is noteworthy that, of those metabolites, 181 (58%) (Table S3) were annotated as lipids by Recon3D subsystems. These included bile acids, fatty acids, eicosanoids, and several other classes of lipid metabolites (Fig. 1B). These alterations in lipid metabolism were much greater than expected, and multiple classes of lipids were predicted to be altered by the new metabolic reconstruction because of OAT1 loss/inhibition (Fig. 1C). Thus, this systems biology integration of existing omics data from the Oat1 KO mouse clearly suggested that regulation/modulation of lipid metabolism, heretofore largely neglected, is a major function of OAT1. Although early untargeted metabolomics data were used to partly constrain the Recon3D metabolic reconstruction, those data were limited to less than two dozen metabolites (13Wikoff W.R. Nagle M.A. Kouznetsova V.L. Tsigelny I.F. Nigam S.K. Untargeted metabolomics identifies enterobiome metabolites and putative uremic toxins as substrates of organic anion transporter 1 (Oat1).J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the decade since, metabolomics methods and databases have substantially improved, and the number of unique lipids that can be detected and clearly identified is much greater. Because the metabolic reconstructions strongly supported the importance of OAT1 in regulating/modulating lipid metabolites and biochemical reactions involving lipids, targeted metabolomics data from the serum of Oat1 KO mice and their wildtype controls were used to analyze over 700 endogenous metabolites. Examination of the altered serum metabolites alone revealed at least some involvement of OAT1 in each of eight “Superpathways” associated with the following metabolic functions: Amino Acid, Carbohydrates, Energy, Lipid, Xenobiotics, Peptides, Nucleotide, and Cofactors and Vitamins. Of the 731 metabolites detected on the platform, 342 were classified as lipids (Table S4). It is remarkable that in the Oat1 knockout, 126 of these metabolites were either significantly altered (p ≤ 0.05) or trending toward significantly altered (0.05 < p ≤ 0.10). Of these, 86 were elevated and 40 were decreased (Fig. 2A). The altered metabolites also covered a wide range of subpathways. Thus, consistent with the Recon3D omics-based metabolic reconstruction described above, lipid metabolism was by far the most affected superpathway, at least based on the metabolites represented on the platform. We next delved more deeply into the different lipid classes. Then, taking advantage of the large number of altered lipids and their structural diversity, we used chemoinformatics analyses and machine learning methods to identify the molecular and physiochemical properties of the lipids that appear to target a lipid or lipid class for regulation or modulation by OAT1. Enrichment analysis showed that different subpathways were impacted depending on the fold change of the metabolites (Fig. 2, B and D). Among the 86 elevated metabolites, 32 belonged to either the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), or diacylglycerols (DAGs) subpathway. Eleven (58%) of the 19 metabolites comprising the PUFA subpathway, 7 (50%) of the 14 LCFAs (Fig. 2C), and 14 (48%) of the 29 measured DAGs were significantly elevated in the Oat1 KO. These were the main altered pathways, but several other metabolites, including those in the sphingolipid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism subpathways, also showed significant increases in the serum (Table S4). Elevated metabolites seem likely to be substrates of OAT1, as they are unable to enter OAT1-expressing cells, and thus accumulate in the serum. Considering the similarities in pharmaceutical substrates of OAT1 and OAT3, it is quite striking that the levels of bile acids change in opposite directions (33Bush K.T. Wu W. Lun C. Nigam S.K. The drug transporter OAT3 (SLC22A8) and endogenous metabolite communication via the gut-liver-kidney axis.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 15789-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the Oat1 KO mice, bile acids were among the metabolites with the greatest fold changes (Table S4). Taurocholate, tauro-beta-muricholate, tauroursodeoxycholate, and taurodeoxycholate all displayed significant decreases in the serum of the Oat1 KO with 0.24-, 0.36-, 0.31-, and 0.33-fold changes compared with wildtype mice, respectively. Of 13 ceramides, 11 were significantly or trending toward significantly decreased in the serum of the Oat1 KO (Fig. 2E). At present, there is little evidence to suggest that these lipids are directly transported by the OATs, and structurally they seem quite different from known OAT substrates (34Nigam A.K. Li J.G. Lall K. Shi D. Bush K.T. Bhatnagar V. Abagyan R. Nigam S.K. Unique metabolite preferences of the drug transporters OAT1 and OAT3 analyzed by machine learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 1829-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the results suggest that these pathways may somehow be affected by organic anion transporters. The metabolites associated with a particular superpathway are determined by their functionality in canonical biochemical pathways rather than chemical structures of the lipid metabolites themselves. However, the interaction of individual metabolites themselves with OAT1, a multi-specific transporter, depends on the molecular and physicochemical properties that arise from the structures of the individual lipid metabolites. It has been previously shown that, although elevation of a metabolite in the Oat1 knockout mouse is not necessarily an indication of direct interaction with the transporter, when a large number of such in vivo metabolites are considered, chemoinformatics analyses of altered metabolites together with machine learning classification corresponds well with in vitro data and can even make reasonable predictions of OAT1 drug binding and/or transport (34Nigam A.K. Li J.G. Lall K. Shi D. Bush K.T. Bhatnagar V. Abagyan R. Nigam S.K. Unique metabolite preferences of the drug transporters OAT1 and OAT3 analyzed by machine learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 1829-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the variety of structures (e.g., long-chain fatty acids, ceramides, bile acids, carnitine derivatives) in the >100 lipid metabolites might seem difficult to analyze structurally, a chemoinformatics approach, focused on capturing a variety of molecular and physiochemical properties (features) of the lipid metabolites elevated or decreased in the Oat1 KO, would help to better define the chemical basis of in vivo interaction of specific lipid molecules with the transporter. This might prove useful for understanding dyslipidemias that could result from drug–metabolite interactions (DMIs) at the level of the OAT1 transporter. We therefore calculated over 30 molecular descriptors for the elevated and decreased lipids in the Oat1 KO. These properties were then used to determine sets of features that are characteristic for the elevated compared with the decreased group. Visualization of the data as distributions suggested some important differences between the elevated and decreased Oat1 KO lipids, such as the number of rings. The 32 features were eventually narrowed down to six features. Multiple sets of six features gave reasonable classification accuracy scores with a variety of machine learning methods in the range of 65% to 85% of Oat1 KO elevated versus decreased lipids with acceptable levels of misclassification in a confusion matrix (Fig. S1). A typical decision tree provides insight into how various combinations of these molecular properties can be used to classify Oat1 KO elevated versus decreased lipids with high accuracy (Fig. 3A).The actual results depended upon the model (e.g., decision tree, Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression) and the sampling method used to balance the dataset (Fig. 3B).The feature set analyzed most often was the following: number of rings (nof_Rings), positive charge/volume, complexity, number of carboxyl groups (nof_COOH), number of hydroxyls (nof_OH), and number of rotatable bonds (nof_RotB). Another set that seemed to give roughly similar classification accuracies and confusion matrices was number of chirals (nof_Chirals), number of carbons with sp3 h"

Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1±0.6 (Mean±SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed."
https://openalex.org/W3149931164,"Combinatorial gut hormone therapy is one of the more promising strategies for identifying improved treatments for metabolic disease. Many approaches combine the established benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonism with one or more additional molecules with the aim of improving metabolic outcomes. Recent attention has been drawn to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) system due to compelling pre-clinical evidence describing the metabolic benefits of antagonising the GIP receptor (GIPR). We rationalised that benefit might be accrued from combining GIPR antagonism with GLP-1 agonism. Two GIPR peptide antagonists, GIPA-1 (mouse GIP(3-30)NH2) and GIPA-2 (NαAc-K10[γEγE-C16]-Arg18-hGIP(5-42)), were pharmacologically characterised and both exhibited potent antagonist properties. Acute in vivo administration of GIPA-1 during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) had negligible effects on glucose tolerance and insulin in lean mice. In contrast, GIPA-2 impaired glucose tolerance and attenuated circulating insulin levels. A mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) was used to investigate the potential metabolic benefits of chronic dosing of each antagonist, alone or in combination with liraglutide. Chronic administration studies showed expected effects of liraglutide, lowering food intake, body weight, fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations while improving glucose sensitivity, whereas delivery of either GIPR antagonist alone had negligible effects on these parameters. Interestingly, chronic dual therapy augmented insulin sensitizing effects and lowered plasma triglycerides and free-fatty acids, with more notable effects observed with GIPA-1 compared to GIPA-2. Thus, the co-administration of both a GIPR antagonist with a GLP1 agonist uncovers interesting beneficial effects on measures of insulin sensitivity, circulating lipids and certain adipose stores that seem influenced by the degree or nature of GIP receptor antagonism."
https://openalex.org/W3140901501,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a lipid mediator that is relatively abundant in plasma and plays an important role in the vascular and immune systems. To date, the only known mechanism for removing S1P from plasma has been dephosphorylation by phospholipid phosphatases (PLPPs) on the surface of cells in contact with the plasma. However, there remains a possibility that PLPP-independent dephosphorylation or direct S1P uptake into cells could occur. To examine these possibilities, here we generated triple KO (TKO) HAP1 cells that lacked all PLPPs (PLPP1–3) present in mammals. In the TKO cells, the intracellular metabolism of externally added deuterium-labeled S1P to ceramide was reduced to 17% compared with the WT cells, indicating that most extracellular S1P is dephosphorylated by PLPPs and then taken up into cells. However, this result also reveals the existence of a PLPP-independent S1P uptake pathway. Tracer experiments using [32P]S1P showed the existence of a direct S1P uptake pathway that functions without prior dephosphorylation. Overexpression of sphingolipid transporter 2 (SPNS2) or of major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2B (MFSD2B), both known S1P efflux transporters, in TKO cells increased the direct uptake of S1P, whereas KO of MFSD2B in TKO cells reduced this uptake. These results suggest that these are channel-type transporters and capable of not only exporting but also importing S1P. Furthermore, we observed that erythroid cells expressing MFSD2B, exhibited high S1P uptake activity.

Sphingolipids are one of the major lipids that constitute eukaryotic cell membranes, together with glycerophospholipids and sterols. Sphingolipids are composed of a hydrophobic ceramide backbone, in which a long-chain base is amide bonded with a fatty acid, and a polar group (7Kihara A.

Transporters are classified into two types: pumps for active transport and channels for passive transport. Pump-type transporters move substances using energy, such as ATP hydrolysis or an ion concentration gradient. In contrast, channel-type transporters allow the movement of substances depending on the concentration gradient of the substances themselves. It currently remains unclear whether the S1P transporters SPNS2 and MFSD2B are pumps or channels. S1P exists in plasma at relatively high concentration (hundreds of nanomolar to micromolar) bound to albumin or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (1Kihara A. Mitsutake S. Mizutani Y. Igarashi Y.

S1P release from platelets is dependent on platelet activation (36Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Sphingosine-1-phosphate: A platelet-activating sphingolipid released from agonist-stimulated human platelets.Blood. 1995; 86: 193-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and platelet contribution to plasma S1P is low (35Pappu R.

However, platelets do contribute to serum S1P, which has a higher concentration than plasma S1P (22Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S.

Pharmacol. 2018; 175: 3741-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). S1P lyase and S1P phosphatases are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and involved in the degradation of intracellular S1P (12Ogawa C. Kihara A. Gokoh M. Igarashi Y.

Commun. 2004; 325: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the degradation of extracellular S1P, such as the S1P in plasma, is catalyzed by the phospholipid phosphatase (PLPP)/lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP) family (38Brindley D.N. Pilquil C. Lipid phosphate phosphatases and signaling.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S225-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 39Tang X. Benesch M.G. Brindley D.N. Lipid phosphate phosphatases and their roles in mammalian physiology and pathology.J. Lipid Res. 2015; 56: 2048-2060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mammals have three PLPP members, PLPP1 (also known as LPP1 or phosphatidic acid phosphatase [PAP]-2a), PLPP2 (LPP2/PAP-2c), and PLPP3 (LPP3/PAP-2b). These dephosphorylate not only S1P but also other phosphorylated lipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid (PA), and ceramide 1-phosphate (38Brindley D.N. Pilquil C. Lipid phosphate phosphatases and signaling.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S225-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 39Tang X. Benesch M.G. Brindley D.N. Lipid phosphate phosphatases and their roles in mammalian physiology and pathology.J. Lipid Res. 2015; 56: 2048-2060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The efficiency of extracellular S1P uptake into cells is low, whereas that of Sph is high (40Narita T. Naganuma T. Sase Y. Kihara A. Long-chain bases of sphingolipids are transported into cells via the acyl-CoA synthetases.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 25469Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, extracellular S1P is considered to be taken into cells after being dephosphorylated to Sph by the PLPP family; PLPP1 was shown to be involved in this process in lung endothelial cells (41Zhao Y. Kalari S.K. Usatyuk P.V. Gorshkova I. He D. Watkins T. Brindley D.N. Sun C. Bittman R. Garcia J.G. Berdyshev E.V. Natarajan V. Intracellular generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate in human lung endothelial cells: Role of lipid phosphate phosphatase-1 and sphingosine kinase 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14165-14177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear what proportion of extracellular S1P is taken up by cells after PLPP-catalyzed dephosphorylation. It also remains possible that some S1P is transported into cells directly (without dephosphorylation) by unknown transporter(s). In the present study, to clarify the exact contribution of PLPPs to the overall uptake of extracellular S1P into cells, we created PLPP1–3 triple KO (TKO) cells. Although the contribution of the PLPP-dependent pathway was high, a PLPP-independent transport pathway directly importing S1P without dephosphorylation did exist. The direct S1P uptake activity was enhanced by overexpressing SPNS2 or MFSD2B and decreased by KO of MFSD2B in TKO cells. Furthermore, S1P uptake activity was also observed in erythroid cells, where MFSD2B is highly expressed. From these results, we speculate that plasma S1P concentration is regulated not only by S1P release from erythrocytes/endothelial cells and dephosphorylation by PLPPs but also by the direct uptake of S1P into cells in contact with plasma (especially erythrocytes). Furthermore, our results suggest that SPNS2 and MFSD2B are channel-type transporters that transport S1P both inward and outward, depending on the intracellular and extracellular S1P concentrations. To investigate the contribution of the PLPP-dependent dephosphorylation pathway to S1P uptake, PLPP1–3 TKO cells were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system from the near-haploid human cells, HAP1. A quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of PLPP1 were much higher than those of PLPP2 and PLPP3 in HAP1 WT cells (Fig. 2A). The generated PLPP1–3 TKO cells contained a 1-bp insertion in PLPP1, an 11-bp deletion in PLPP2, and a 5-bp deletion in PLPP3 (Fig. 2B). Uptake of S1P containing seven deuterium (2H7) atoms was compared between WT and TKO cells. After incubating the cells with 2H7-S1P for 2 h, the medium and cells were separated by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted from each fraction. More abundant 2H7-S1P was present in both the medium and the cell fractions of TKO cells (2.7-fold in both fractions) than in WT cells (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the amount of 2H7-Sph, the product of PLPPs, in the cell fraction of WT cells was about 6.8 times higher than in TKO cells. Since the 2H7-S1P and 2H7-Sph detected in the cell fraction possibly include not only those transported into cells but also those attached to the cell surface, the amounts of 2H7-S1P/2H7-Sph detected in the cell fraction might not accurately represent uptake. We considered that it would be useful to measure the amounts of the 2H7-S1P metabolite 2H7-ceramides, which are produced only within cells, as indicators of the actual amount of 2H7-S1P transported into cells. The amounts of 2H7-ceramides were reduced to 17% in TKO cells compared with WT cells. This result indicates that the uptake of 2H7-S1P indeed decreased in TKO cells. Next, we examined the uptake of 2H7-Sph. There was no significant difference between the WT and TKO cells in the amounts of 2H7-Sph in the medium fraction or in the cell fraction (Fig. 3B). As in the case of 2H7-S1P, the 2H7-Sph recovered in the cell fraction could be a mixture of that attached to the cell surface and that actually imported into the cells. Therefore, we also measured the amounts of 2H7-Sph metabolites, 2H7-S1P and 2H7-ceramides, which are produced only within cells, as indicators of 2H7-Sph transported into cells. The amount of 2H7-S1P in TKO cells was similar to that in WT cells. In contrast, the amounts of 2H7-ceramides were 1.4 times higher in TKO cells than in WT cells. Since S1P is abundant in the serum in the medium used for growth, it is expected that S1P is constantly taken up into cells in a PLPP-dependent manner and used for sphingolipid synthesis under normal culture conditions. We speculate that the impaired uptake of S1P in TKO cells caused a difference in sphingolipid metaboli"
https://openalex.org/W3146845062,"As is already known, statistical models are very important for modeling data in applied fields, particularly in engineering, medicine, and many other disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new family to introduce new distributions suitable for modeling reliability engineering data. We called our proposed family a new generalized- X family of distributions. For the practical illustration, we introduced a new special sub-model, called the new generalized-Weibull distribution, to describe the new family’s significance. For the proposed family, we introduced some mathematical reliability properties. The maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters of the new generalized-X distributions are derived. For assessing the performance of these estimators, a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out. To assess the efficiency of the proposed model, the new generalized-Weibull model is applied to the coating machine failure time data. Finally, Bayesian analysis and performance of Gibbs sampling for the coating machine failure time data are also carried out. Furthermore, the measures such as Gelman-Rubin, Geweke and Raftery-Lewis are used to track algorithm convergence."
https://openalex.org/W3143381542,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is shown to be an effective pre-processing algorithm in order to discriminate different classes of motor-based EEG signals by obtaining suitable spatial filters. The performance of these filters can be improved by regularized CSP, in which available prior information is added in terms of regularization terms into the objective function of conventional CSP. Variety of prior information can be used in this way. In this paper, we used time correlation between different classes of EEG signal as the prior information, which is clarified similarity between different classes of signal for regularizing CSP. Furthermore, the proposed objective function can be easily extended to more than two-class problems. We used three different standard datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Correlation-based CSP (CCSP) outperformed original CSP as well as the existing regularized CSP, Principle Component Cnalysis (PCA) and Fisher Discriminate Analysis (FDA) in both two-class and multi-class scenarios. The simulation results showed that the proposed method outperformed conventional CSP by 6.9% in 2-class and 2.23% in multi-class problem in term of mean classification accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3147311495,"Background In the prehospital setting, endotracheal intubation (ETI) may be required to secure the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient airway. It has been suggested that the use of a protective barrier can reduce possible aerosol delivery from patients to clinicians during ETI. We sought to assess the performance of ETI by paramedics wearing personal protective equipment with and without the use of a box barrier. Methods A randomized, crossover simulation study was performed in a simulation laboratory. Study participants were 18 paramedics actively working in the clinical environment. Participants’ performance of ETI via direct laryngoscopy (DL) with and without the use of a box barrier was assessed. The sequence of intubation was randomized to either BoxDL-first or DL-first. The primary outcome was the success rate of ETI on first-attempt. The secondary and tertiary outcomes were ETI success rates on three attempts and total intubation time, respectively. Results There were no differences between the DL group and the BoxDL group in one-attempt success rates (14/18 vs 12/18; P = 0.754), and in overall success rates (16/18 vs 14/18; P = 0.682). The mean (standard deviation) of the total intubation times for the DL group and the BoxDL group were 27.3 (19.7) seconds and 36.8 (26.2) seconds, respectively (P &lt; 0.015). Conclusions The findings of this pilot study suggest that paramedics wearing personal protective equipment can successfully perform ETI using a barrier box, but the intubation time may be prolonged. The applicability of these findings to the care of COVID-19 patients remain to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3144156883,"Introduction Community participation in the governance of health services is an important component in engaging stakeholders (patients, public and partners) in decision-making and related activities in health care. Community participation is assumed to contribute to quality improvement and goal attainment but remains elusive. We examined the implementation of community participation, through collaborative governance in primary health care facilities in Uasin Gishu County, Western Kenya, under the policy of devolved governance of 2013. Methods Utilizing a multiple case study methodology, five primary health care facilities were purposively selected. Study participants were individuals involved in the collaborative governance of primary health care facilities (from health service providers and community members), including in decision-making, management, oversight, service provision and problem solving. Data were collected through document review, key informant interviews and observations undertaken from 2017 to 2018. Audio recording, notetaking and a reflective journal aided data collection. Data were transcribed, cleaned, coded and analysed iteratively into emerging themes using a governance attributes framework. Findings A total of 60 participants representing individual service providers and community members participated in interviews and observations. The minutes of all meetings of five primary health care facilities were reviewed for three years (2014–2016) and eight health facility committee meetings were observed. Findings indicate that in some cases, structures for collaborative community engagement exist but functioning is ineffective for a number of reasons. Health facility committee meetings were most frequent when there were project funds, with discussions focusing mainly on construction projects as opposed to the day-to-day functioning of the facility. Committee members with the strongest influence and power had political connections or were retired government workers. There were no formal mechanisms for stakeholder forums and how these worked were unclear. Drug stock outs, funding delays and unclear operational guidelines affected collaborative governance performance. Conclusion Implementing collaborative governance effectively requires that the scope of focus for collaboration include both specific projects and the routine functioning of the primary health care facility by the health facility committee. In the study area, structures are required to manage effective stakeholder engagement."
https://openalex.org/W3151279943,"The purposes are to monitor the nitrogen utilization efficiency of crops and intelligently evaluate the absorption of nutrients by crops during the production process. The research object is Chinese cabbage. The Chinese cabbage population with different agricultural parameters is constructed through different densities and nitrogen fertilizer application rates based on digital image processing technology, and an estimation NC (Nitrogen Content) model is established. The population is classified through the K-Means Clustering algorithm using the feature extraction method, and the Chinese cabbage population quality BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) model is constructed. The nonlinear mapping relationship between different agricultural parameters and population quality, and the contribution rate of each indicator, are studied. The nitrogen utilization of Chinese cabbage is monitored effectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed NC estimation model has correlation coefficients above 0.70 in different growth stages. This model can accurately estimate the NC of the Chinese cabbage population. The results of the Chinese cabbage population quality BPNN model show that the population planting density based on the seedling number is reasonable. The constructed population quality evaluation model has a high R2 value and a comparatively low RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) value for the quality evaluation of Chinese cabbage in different periods, showing that it applies to evaluate the population quality of Chinese cabbage in different growth stages. The constructed nitrogen utilization model and quality evaluation model can monitor the nutrient utilization of crops in different growth stages, ascertain the agricultural characteristics of other yield groups in different growth stages, and clarify the performance of agricultural parameters in different growth stages. The above results can provide some ideas for crop growth intelligent detection."
https://openalex.org/W3140355663,"We explored the effects of silicon-containing water (BT) intake on gastrointestinal function and gut microbiota. BT was obtained by pressuring tap water through silicon minerals (mullite, Al6Si2O13) column. BT decreased H2O2 chemiluminescence counts, indicating its antioxidant activity. Four weeks of BT drinking increased H2O2 scavenging activity and glutathione peroxidase activity of plasma. BT drinking did not affect the body weight but significantly reduced the weight of feces and gastrointestinal motility. BT drinking significantly suppressed pylorus ligation enhanced gastric juice secretion, gastric reactive oxygen species amount, erythrocyte extravasation, IL-1β production by infiltrating leukocyte, and lipid peroxidation within gastric mucosa. Data from 16S rRNA sequencing revealed BT drinking significantly increased beneficial flora including Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Prevotellaceae NK3B31, Weissella paramesenteroides, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus murinus and decreased harmful flora including Mucispirillum, Rodentibacter, and Staphylococcus aureus. This study pioneerly provided scientific evidences for the potential effects of water-soluble forms of silicon intake on antioxidant activity, gastrointestinal function, and gut microbiota modulation."
https://openalex.org/W3140868495,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA fragments that generally do not code for a protein but are involved in epigenetic gene regulation. In this study, lncRNAs of Brassica rapa were classified into long intergenic noncoding RNAs, natural antisense RNAs, and intronic noncoding RNAs and their expression analyzed in relation to genome-wide 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), DNA methylation, and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation marks (H3K27me3). More than 65% of the lncRNAs analyzed consisted of one exon, and more than 55% overlapped with inverted repeat regions (IRRs). Overlap of lncRNAs with IRRs or genomic regions encoding for 24-nt siRNAs resulted in increased DNA methylation levels when both were present. LncRNA did not overlap greatly with H3K27me3 marks, but the expression level of intronic noncoding RNAs that did coincide with H3K27me3 marks was higher than without H3K27me3 marks. The Brassica genus comprises important vegetables and oil seed crops grown across the world. B . rapa is a diploid (AA genome) thought to be one of the ancestral species of both B . juncea (AABB genome) and B . napus (AACC) through genome merging (allotetrapolyploidization). Complex genome restructuring and epigenetic alterations are thought to be involved in these allotetrapolyploidization events. Comparison of lncRNAs between B . rapa and B . nigra , B . oleracea , B . juncea , and B . napus showed the highest conservation with B . oleracea . This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the epigenome structure of B . rapa at multi-epigenetic levels (siRNAs, DNA methylation, H3K27me3, and lncRNAs) and identified a suite of candidate lncRNAs that may be epigenetically regulated in the Brassica genus."
https://openalex.org/W3147069769,"An effective traffic control strategy will improve travel reliability in urban transportation networks. Lack of coordination between vehicles, however, exacerbates congestion due mainly to frequent stops at unsignalized intersections. It is beneficial to develop a conflict-free cooperation method that collects basic safety message from multiple approaching Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (for short, CAVs) and guarantees efficient unsignalized intersection operations with safe and incident free vehicle maneuvers. This paper proposes an interspersed traffic organization method under controlled constraints. Firstly, relied on shared location technology and considered the operating characteristics of CAVs at unsignalized intersections to detect and analyze traffic conflicts to establish a right-of-way judgment model for CAVs. In order to further ensure the safety and operating efficiency of the vehicle, based on the judgment results of right-of-way judgment model, a vehicle speed guidance model is established for different traffic conditions. Taking the real city standard intersection as the experimental analysis object, through data collection and simulation experiment, the signal control method and the organization method proposed in this paper are compared and analyzed. The results showed that the traffic organization method proposed in this paper improves the operational efficiency of 46%, the average travel time is reduced by 6.54s, which is not only better than the signal control method, but also supports the development of car networking technology."
https://openalex.org/W3150890926,"Trans women have been understudied in the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic, yet data suggest they may be at elevated risk of the disease. Using data collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) survey, we measured HCV seropositivity, viremia, and associated risk factors for HCV infection among trans women in San Francisco from June 2019 to February 2020. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used to obtain a diverse, community-based sample of 201 trans women, of whom 48 (23.9%, 95% CI 17.9% - 30.0%) were HCV seropositive. HCV seropositivity significantly increased with increasing age (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] 1.04 per year, 95% CI 1.01–1.07) and history of injection drug use (APR 4.44, 95% CI 2.15–9.18). We also found that many had HCV viremia as twelve (6.0% of the total sample, 95% CI 2.7% - 9.3%) were RNA-positive for HCV. Trans women are highly impacted by HCV and could benefit from access to regular and frequent HCV screening and treatment access. HCV screening could be offered regularly in trans-specific health services, in the community, in jails and prisons, and integrated syringe exchange programs where treatment access or referral are also available."
https://openalex.org/W3146744551,"Background Patients with peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication (PAD-IC) have altered gait variability from the first step they take, well before the onset of claudication pain. The mechanisms underlying these gait alterations are poorly understood. Aims To determine the effect of reduced blood flow on gait variability by comparing healthy older controls and patients with PAD-IC. We also determined the diagnostic value of gait variability parameters to identify the presence of PAD. Methods A cross-sectional cohort design was used. Thirty healthy older controls and thirty patients with PAD-IC walked on a treadmill at their self-selected speed in pain free walking (normal walking for healthy older controls; prior to claudication onset for PAD) and reduced blood flow (post vascular occlusion with thigh tourniquet for healthy older controls; pain for PAD) conditions. Gait variability was assessed using the largest Lyapunov exponent, approximate entropy, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of ankle, knee, and hip joints range of motion. Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses of the pain free walking condition were performed to determine the optimal cut-off values for separating individuals with PAD-IC from those without PAD-IC. Results and discussion Patients with PAD-IC have increased amount of variability for knee and hip ranges of motion compared with the healthy older control group. Regarding the main effect of condition, reduced blood flow demonstrated increased amount of variability compared with pain free walking. Significant interactions between group and condition at the ankle show increased values for temporal structure of variability, but a similar amount of variability in the reduced blood flow condition. This demonstrates subtle interactions in the movement patterns remain distinct between PAD-IC versus healthy older controls during the reduced blood flow condition. A combination of gait variability parameters correctly identifies PAD-IC disease 70% of the time or more. Conclusions Gait variability is affected both by PAD and by the mechanical induction of reduced blood flow. Gait variability parameters have potential diagnostic ability, as some measures had 90.0% probability of correctly identifying patients with PAD-IC."

This study aimed to understand the reasons for non-use of contraceptives among women in the context of male out-migration.Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted in two high male out-migration districts in Bihar, namely Nawada and Gopalganj. Twenty-five FGDs were conducted with currently married women with migrant husbands, currently married men and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) during April-June 2019. Data were analysed by using a thematic approach through Atlas.ti-6.2.The reasons for contraceptive non-use in areas with high male out-migration were complex, as this included barriers to contraceptive use unique to high-migration areas and reasons commonly found in other rural settings. Non-use of contraceptives among women with migrant husbands was mostly driven by lack of contraceptive preparedness before husband's arrival, inability to procure contraceptives due to inaccessibility to health facilities and stigma to procure when husband was away. Other migration environment related factors included low ASHA outreach, myths and side effects of contraceptives, community fertility norms and poor spousal communications around FP.The reasons for non-use of contraceptives are multifaceted, complex and interlinked. Exploration of these reasons in migration context suggest that FP programs in migration affected areas need to address a range of barriers to contraceptive use at multiple levels."

However, the effects of NDT80 on entomopathogenic fungi are still unknown. In this paper, the NDT80 orthologue BbTFO1 was examined in Beauveria bassiana , a filamentous entomopathogenic fungus, to explore the role of an NDT80-like protein for fungal pest control potential. Disruption of BbTFO1 resulted in impaired resistance to oxidative stress (OS) in a growth assay under OS and a 50% minimum inhibitory concentration experiment. Intriguingly, the oxidation resistance changes were accompanied by transcriptional repression of the two key antioxidant enzyme genes cat2 and cat5 . Δ BbTFO1 also displayed defective conidial germination, virulence and heat resistance. The specific supplementation of BbTFO1 reversed these phenotypic changes. As revealed by this work, BbTFO1 can affect the transcription of catalase genes and play vital roles in the maintenance of phenotypes associated with the biological control ability of B . bassiana ."
https://openalex.org/W3148766040,"Stressful events in daily life that are non-traumatic (e.g., family-, school-, work-, interpersonal-, and health-related problems) frequently cause various mood disturbances. For some people, being exposed to non-traumatic but stressful events could trigger the onset and relapse of mood disorders. Furthermore, non-traumatic stressful events also cause event-related psychological distress (ERPD), similar to that of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; i.e., intense intrusive imagery or memory recall, avoidance, and hyperarousal) in the general population and individuals with mood disorders. However, previous ERPD studies only showed that people with ERPD display PTSD-like symptoms after non-traumatic experiences; they failed to get to the crux of the matter by only utilizing trauma- or PTSD-related assessment tools. We thus aimed to identify the psychological phenomena and features of ERPD after individuals experienced non-traumatic stressful events, and to develop and validate an appropriate ERPD assessment tool. First, we conducted a qualitative study to obtain the psychological features through interviews with 22 individuals (mean age = 41.50 years old, SD = 12.24) with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Second, in the quantitative component, we implemented a web-based survey with 747 participants of the general population (mean age = 41.96 years old, SD = 12.64) by using ERPD-related questionnaires created based on the qualitative study; then, we examined the reliability and validity of the ERPD assessment tool. Results yielded that the psychological features of ERPD comprised four factors: feelings of revenge, rumination, self-denial, and mental paralysis. These were utilized in the developed 24-item measure of ERPD-a novel self-report assessment tool. For various professionals involved in mental healthcare, this tool can be used to clarify and assess psychological phenomena in people with ERPD."
https://openalex.org/W3151079065,"Protecting people from financial hardship and impoverishment due to health care costs is one of the fundamental purposes of the Mongolian health system. However, the inefficient, oversized hospital sector is considered one of the main shortcomings of the system. The aim of this study is to contribute to policy discussions by estimating the extent of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment due to inpatient care at secondary-level and tertiary-level public hospitals and private hospitals.Data were derived from a nationally representative survey, the Household Socio-Economic Survey 2012, conducted by the National Statistical Office of Mongolia. A total of 12,685 households were involved in the study. ""Catastrophic health expenditure"" is defined as out-of-pocket payments for inpatient care that exceed a threshold of 40% of households' non-discretionary expenditure. The ""impoverishment"" effect of out-of-pocket payments for inpatient care was estimated as the difference between the poverty level before health care payments and the poverty level after these payments.At the threshold of 40% of capacity to pay, 0.31%, 0.07%, and 0.02% of Mongolian households suffered financially as a result of their member(s) staying in tertiary-level and secondary-level public hospitals and private hospitals respectively. About 0.13% of the total Mongolian population was impoverished owing to out-of-pocket payments for inpatient care at tertiary-level hospitals. Out-of-pocket payments for inpatient care at secondary-level hospitals and private hospitals were responsible for 0.10% and 0.09% respectively of the total population being pushed into poverty.Although most inpatient care at public hospitals is covered by the social health insurance benefit package, patients who utilized inpatient care at tertiary-level public hospitals were more likely to push their households into financial hardship and poverty than the inpatients at private hospitals. Improving the hospital sector's efficiency and financial protection for inpatients would be a crucial means of attaining universal health coverage in Mongolia."
https://openalex.org/W3145356991,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) related morbidity, mortality and death. Exercise capacity in persons with type 2 diabetes has been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events. In this study, we used the data from the prospective randomized LOOK AHEAD study and used machine learning algorithms to help predict exercise capacity (measured in Mets) from the baseline data that included cardiovascular history, medications, blood pressure, demographic information, anthropometric and Dual-energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) measured body composition metrics. We excluded variables with high collinearity and included DXA obtained Subtotal (total minus head) fat percentage and Subtotal lean mass (gms). Thereafter, we used different machine learning methods to predict maximum exercise capacity. The different machine learning models showed a strong predictive performance for both females and males. Our study shows that using baseline data from a large prospective cohort, we can predict maximum exercise capacity in persons with diabetes mellitus. We show that subtotal fat percentage is the most important feature for predicting the exercise capacity for males and females after accounting for other important variables. Until now, BMI and waist circumference were commonly used surrogates for adiposity and there was a relative under-appreciation of body composition metrics for understanding the pathophysiology of CVD. The recognition of body fat percentage as an important marker in determining CVD risk has prognostic implications with respect to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3147506753,"Mice with a mutation (D244G, DG) in calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1), analogous to a human mutation in CASQ1 associated with a delayed onset human myopathy (vacuolar aggregate myopathy), display a progressive myopathy characterized by decreased activity, decreased ability of fast twitch muscles to generate force and low body weight after one year of age. The DG mutation causes CASQ1 to partially dissociate from the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Decreased junctional CASQ1 reduces SR Ca2+ release. Muscles from older DG mice display ER stress, ER expansion, increased mTOR signaling, inadequate clearance of aggregated proteins by the proteasomes, and elevation of protein aggregates and lysosomes. This study suggests that the myopathy associated with the D244G mutation in CASQ1 is driven by CASQ1 mislocalization, reduced SR Ca2+ release, CASQ1 misfolding/aggregation and ER stress. The subsequent maladaptive increase in protein synthesis and decreased protein aggregate clearance are likely to contribute to disease progression."

Inhalation of infected aerosol droplets is considered as the most frequent route of the infection. This study aims to investigate the current forms of tuberculosis in cattle and identify the possible transmission modes in dairy farms of China. 13,345 cows from eight dairy farms in three provinces were comprehensively diagnosed by a multitude of assays, including SIT, CIT, IFN-γ assay and ELISA. It has been indicated that advanced infection of bTB was found in 752 (5.64%) cattle, suggesting a high prevalence of tuberculosis in these dairy farms. In the necropsy examination of 151 positive cattle, typical bTB lesions were observed in 131 cattle (86.75%), of which, notably, 90.84% lesions appeared in liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, mammary lymph nodes and other organs, taking up a large proportion among cattle with advanced bTB infection. 71.26% extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) was related to gastrointestinal system. M. bovis nucleic acid was further found in milk and feces samples and M. bovis was even isolated from milk samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequencing unraveled that six isolates were closely related to M. bovis AF2122/97 originated from UK, whereas four isolates shared close relation to M. bovis 30 from China, respectively. Our data demonstrate that the increase of EPTB transmitted by digestive tract is implicated in the current high prevalence rate of bTB in China, which also provides leads for bTB control in other countries with high prevalence of bTB in the future."

A trope is a recurring storytelling device or pattern, or sometimes a meta-element, used by the authors to express ideas that the audience can recognize or relate to, such as the Hero’s Journey . Discovering tropes and how they cluster in popular works and doing it at scale to generate new plots may benefit writers; in this paper, we analyze them and use a principled procedure to identify trope combinations, or communities, that could possible be successful. The degree of development of these different communities can help us identify areas that are under-developed and, thus, susceptible to such a type of development. To detect these communities, with their associated degree of development and interest, we propose a methodology based on scientometric and complex network analysis techniques. As a secondary objective, we will obtain a general perspective in the trope and films network: the tropesphere . We have used a dataset of 10,766 movies and 25,776 tropes associated with them, together with rating, genres and popularity. Our analysis has shown that not only there are different trope communities associated with specific genres, and that there are significant differences between the rating and popularity of these communities but also there are differences on the level of development between them: emerging/declining, specific, transversal or motor."
https://openalex.org/W3148480392,"Watching another person's hand movement modulates somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs). Assuming that the mirror neuron system may have a role in this phenomenon, oxytocin should enhance these effects. This single-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study therefore used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate SEFs following electrical stimulation of the right median nerve in 20 healthy male participants during hand movement observation, which were initially presented as static images followed by moving images. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either oxytocin or saline during the first trial, with the treatment being reversed during a second trial. Log-transformed ratios of the N20 and N30 amplitudes were calculated and compared between moving and static images observations. Phase locking (calculated using intertrial phase coherence) of brain oscillations was also analyzed to evaluate alpha, beta and gamma rhythm changes after oxytocin administration. Log N30 ratios showed no significant changes after placebo administration but showed a decreasing tendency (albeit not significant) after placebo administration, which may suggest mirror neuron system involvement. In contrast, log N20 ratios were increased after placebo administration, but showed no significant change after oxytocin administration. Interestingly, the gamma band activity around N20 increased after placebo administration, suggesting that oxytocin exerted an analgesic effect on median nerve stimulation, and inhibited the gamma band increase. Oxytocin might therefore modulate not only the mirror neuron system, but also the sensory processing associated with median nerve stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3148515788,"Background Today, physicians are at the front lines of a pandemic response. Military physicians are uniquely trained to excel in such large-scale emergency situations. Civilian physicians can harness military know-how, but it will require research into military healthcare responses—specifically, we need to learn lessons from military interprofessional healthcare teams (MIHTs). Methods This research answers two questions: What are the characteristics of successful MIHTs? Why are those characteristics important to MIHT success in large-scale emergency situations? Using a Grounded Theory approach, 30 interviews were conducted soliciting perspectives from the broadest range of healthcare professionals who had experiences working in and leading MIHTs. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants broadly across: contexts where MIHTs work; military branches; ranks; genders; and healthcare professions. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed. Results 30 participants were interviewed (18 male (60%); 21 officers (70%); 9 enlisted (30%)) who held various healthcare occupations (medic/tech/corpsman (9); nurse (7); physician (7); dentist (2); occupational therapist (2); chaplain (1); physician’s assistant (1); and psychiatrist (1)). Six characteristics of successful MIHTs that are directly applicable to large-scale emergency situations were identified thatthat clustered into two themes: own your purposes and responsibilities (through mission focus and ethical bearing) and get it done , safely (via situational awareness, adaptability, and leadership with followership). Conclusions This study provides insights, informed by decades of military service and training, to help civilian physicians succeed in large-scale emergency situations. These experiences from the war front can support today’s pandemic responses on the home front."

This division results in both positive consequences, such as a sense of community, and negative ones, such as group conflict. Further, individuals in the middle of the spectrum can fall through the cracks of this categorization process and are seen as out-group by individuals on either side of the spectrum, becoming inbetweeners . Here, we propose a quantitative, dynamical-system model that studies the joint influence of cognitive and social processes. We model where two social groups draw the boundaries between “us” and ‘them” on a continuous attribute. Our model predicts that both groups tend to draw a more restrictive boundary than the middle of the spectrum. As a result, each group sees the individuals in the middle of the attribute space as an out-group. We test this prediction using U.S. political survey data on how political independents are perceived by registered party members as well as existing experiments on the perception of racially ambiguous faces, and find support."
https://openalex.org/W3149688887,"Background and objectives Vaccination status becomes more equitable when interventions are carried out to eliminate poverty or to improve levels in maternal education. Low-income countries need to identify interventions that would have a more immediate and equitable effect. The present study aimed to identify rapidly modifiable factors associated with full vaccination status among children in Niamey, Niger. Methods A cross-sectional, random cluster household survey was conducted in Niamey’s five health districts. Data on vaccination coverage and socioeconomic household characteristics were collected. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with data on 445 mothers and their children aged 12–23 months. Results Of 445 children, 38% were fully vaccinated. Mothers who were satisfied with their health worker’s attitude and had correct vaccination calendar knowledge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.05–13.82) were more likely to have fully vaccinated children. Mothers who had completed secondary school (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.17–3.55) were also associated with having fully vaccinated children. Conclusions A higher rate of full vaccination among children could be achieved by relatively short-term modifiable factors. These modifiable factors are mothers’ satisfaction with health workers’ attitudes and knowledge of the vaccination calendar. Maternal satisfaction with health workers’ attitudes could be improved through better interpersonal communication between health workers and mothers. Specifically, mothers should be given specific information on time intervals between appointments. Strengthened communication interventions may be effective in improving both the acceptability of health services and low vaccination coverage."

Seeds and seedlings must pass through a series of abiotic and biotic filters in order to recruit as members of their communities. These processes are part of the regeneration niche of the species. In arid regions, the regeneration niche is frequently associated to facilitation by shade. Facilitation is a positive interaction between plants, in which one of them acts as a benefactor (the nurse) of the other (the beneficiary). The result of this interaction can be reflected in the increased growth, survival, and/or reproduction of the beneficiary plant. In this study, we determined experimentally the effect of shade and irrigation on the germination and early survival of dominant species of a semi-arid Andean region, the Bolivian Prepuna. An experiment with Acacia feddeana, Prosopis ferox, Cercidium andicola (woody species), Parodia maassii, and Oreocereus celsianus (cactus species) was carried out at an experimental garden in La Paz, Bolivia, with a bifactorial design, considering shaded and unshaded pots, subjected to two irrigation treatments (≈50 and 80 mm of rainfall during the whole study period). Microenvironmental conditions did not affect the seed germination of the woody species. However, they showed differences in seedling survival: A. feddeana survived better under shade, whereas P. ferox and C. andicola survived better without shade. Cercidium andicola, compared to P. ferox, was more affected by shade and low irrigation. Although germination success of cacti was low, both species germinated better under shade and with high irrigation. These results showed differences in the regeneration niche of dominant species of the Prepuna which may favor their coexistence and which may be characteristic of other dry Andean regions."

https://openalex.org/W3147939352,"To explore the effect of introducing 24/7 resident labour ward consultant presence on neonatal and maternal outcomes in a large obstetric unit in England.Retrospective time sequence analysis of routinely collected data.Obstetric unit of large teaching hospital in England.Women and babies delivered between1 July 2011 and 30 June 2017. Births <24 weeks gestation or by planned caesarean section were excluded.The primary composite outcome comprised intrapartum stillbirth, neonatal death, babies requiring therapeutic hypothermia, or admission to neonatal intensive care within three hours of birth. Secondary outcomes included markers of neonatal and maternal morbidity. Planned subgroup analyses investigated gestation (<34 weeks; 34-36 weeks; ≥37 weeks) and time of day.17324 babies delivered before and 16110 after 24/7 consultant presence. The prevalence of the primary outcome increased by 0.65%, from 2.07% (359/17324) before 24/7 consultant presence to 2.72% (438/16110, P < 0.001) after 24/7 consultant presence which was consistent with an upward trend over time already well established before 24/7 consultant presence began (OR 1.09 p.a.; CI 1.04 to 1.13). Overall, there was no change in this trend associated with the transition to 24/7. However, in babies born ≥37 weeks gestation, the upward trend was reversed after implementation of 24/7 (OR 0.67 p.a.; CI 0.49 to 0.93; P = 0.017). No substantial differences were shown in other outcomes or subgroups.Overall, resident consultant obstetrician presence 24/7 on labour ward was not associated with a change in a pre-existing trend of increasing adverse infant outcomes. However, 24/7 presence was associated with a reversal in increasing adverse outcomes for term babies."
https://openalex.org/W3149894665,"Histamine is a critical inflammatory mediator in allergic diseases. We showed in a previous work that neutrophils from allergic patients produce histamine in response to allergens to which the patients were sensitized. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process using peripheral blood neutrophils. We challenged these cells in vitro with allergens and analyzed histamine release in the culture supernatants. We also explored the effect of common therapeutic drugs that ameliorate allergic symptoms, as well as allergen-specific immunotherapy. Additionally, we examined the expression of histidine decarboxylase and diamine oxidase, critical enzymes in the metabolism of histamine, under allergen challenge. We show that allergen-induced histamine release is dependent on the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways. We also found a contribution of the phosphatase calcineurin to lesser extent. Anti-histamines, glucocorticoids, anti-M3-muscarinic receptor antagonists, and mainly β2-receptor agonists abolished the allergen-dependent histamine release. Interestingly, allergen-specific immunotherapy canceled the histamine release through the downregulation of histidine decarboxylase expression. Our observations describe novel molecular mechanisms involved in the allergen-dependent histamine release by human neutrophils and provide new targets to inhibit histamine production."
https://openalex.org/W3144249271,"The interpretation of archaeological features often requires a combined methodological approach in order to make the most of the material record, particularly from sites where this may be limited. In practice, this requires the consultation of different sources of information in order to cross validate findings and combat issues of ambiguity and equifinality. However, the application of a multiproxy approach often generates incompatible data, and might therefore still provide ambiguous results. This paper explores the potential of a simple digital framework to increase the explanatory power of multiproxy data by enabling the incorporation of incompatible, ambiguous datasets in a single model. In order to achieve this, Bayesian confirmation was used in combination with decision trees. The results of phytolith and geochemical analyses carried out on soil samples from ephemeral sites in Jordan are used here as a case study. The combination of the two datasets as part of a single model enabled us to refine the initial interpretation of the use of space at the archaeological sites by providing an alternative identification for certain activity areas. The potential applications of this model are much broader, as it can also help researchers in other domains reach an integrated interpretation of analysis results by combining different datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3145373673,"Sea ice is one of the main loads acting on a wind turbine tower in areas prone to icing, and this threatens safe working life of the wind turbine tower. In our study, a simplified calculated model of ice, wind turbine tower, and water dynamic interaction under earthquake action was proposed, which could avoid to solve a large number of nonlinear equations. Then, the seismic behaviour of the wind turbine tower with and without the influence of sea ice was investigated, and we found that the influence of the greater mass of the sea ice on the seismic response of a wind turbine tower should be considered when the wind turbine tower is designed in an area with thick ice. With the influence of the most unfavourable ice mass, the deformation and energy dissipation capacity of the wind turbine tower are decreased, and the wall thickness or stiffening rib thickness should be increased to improve the seismic performance and ductility of the wind turbine tower; the shear force and bending moment increased significantly on the wind turbine tower, and the shear force changes at the bottom of the wind turbine tower and position of action of the sea ice: attention should be paid to the wind turbine tower design at these positions. Finally, we conducted the shaking table test, and verified the rationality of our proposed simplified model."
https://openalex.org/W3147863661,"Gene regulatory networks exhibiting Boolean behaviour, e.g. AND, OR or XOR, have been routinely designed for years. However, achieving more sophisticated functions, such as control or computation, usually requires sequential circuits or so-called state machines. For such a circuit, outputs depend both on inputs and the current state of the system. Although it is still possible to design such circuits by analogy with digital electronics, some particularities of biology make the task trickier. The impact of two of them, namely the stochasticity of biological processes and the inhomogeneity in the response of regulation mechanisms, are assessed in this paper. Numerical simulations performed in two use cases point out high risks of malfunctions even for designed GRNs functional from a theoretical point of view. Several solutions to improve reliability of such systems are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3151348257,"Deprivation can perpetuate across generations; however, the causative pathways are not well understood. Directed acyclic graphs (DAG) with mediation analysis can help elucidate and quantify complex pathways in order to identify modifiable factors at which to target interventions.We linked ten Scotland-wide databases (six health and four education) to produce a cohort of 217,226 pupils who attended Scottish schools between 2009 and 2013. The DAG comprised 23 potential mediators of the association between area deprivation at birth and subsequent offspring 'not in education, employment or training' status, covering maternal, antenatal, perinatal and child health, school engagement, and educational factors. Analyses were performed using modified g-computation. Deprivation at birth was associated with a 7.3% increase in offspring 'not in education, employment or training'. The principal mediators of this association were smoking during pregnancy (natural indirect effect of 0·016, 95% CI 0·013, 0·019) and school absences (natural indirect effect of 0·021, 95% CI 0·018, 0·024), explaining 22% and 30% of the total effect respectively. The proportion of the association potentially eliminated by addressing these factors was 19% (controlled direct effect when set to non-smoker 0·058; 95% CI 0·053, 0·063) for smoking during pregnancy and 38% (controlled direct effect when set to no absences 0·043; 95% CI 0·037, 0·049) for school absences.Combining a DAG with mediation analysis helped disentangle a complex public health problem and quantified the modifiable factors of maternal smoking and school absence that could be targeted for intervention. This study also demonstrates the general utility of DAGs in understanding complex public health problems."
https://openalex.org/W3152465938,"Insulin resistance (IR) has been considered as a therapeutic target in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Readily available, simple and low cost measures to identify individuals with IR is of utmost importance for clinicians to plan optimal management strategies. Research on the associations between surrogate markers of IR and routine clinical and lipid parameters have not been carried out in Sri Lanka, a developing country with rising burden of T2DM with inadequate resources. Therefore, we aimed to study the utility of readily available clinical parameters such as age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and triglyceride to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) in the fasting lipid profile in predicting IR in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed T2DM in Sri Lanka.We conducted a community based cross sectional study involving of 147 patients (age 30-60 years) with newly diagnosed T2DM in a suburban locality in Galle district, Sri Lanka. Data on age, BMI, WC, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration, fasting insulin concentration and serum lipid profile were collected from each subject. The indirect IR indices namely homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and McAuley index (MCA) were estimated. Both clinical and biochemical parameters across the lowest and the highest fasting insulin quartiles were compared using independent sample t-test. Linear correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlation between selected clinical parameters and indirect IR indices. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained to calculate optimal cut-off values for the clinical markers to differentiate IR. BMI (p<0.001) and WC (p = 0.01) were significantly increased whereas age (p = 0.06) was decreased and TG/HDL-C (p = 0.28) was increased across the insulin quartiles. BMI and WC were significantly correlated (p<0.05) with HOMA, QUICKI and MCA. Out of the clinical parameters, age showed a borderline significant correlation with QUICKI and TG/HDL-C showed a significant correlation only with MCA. The area under ROC of BMI was 0.728 (95% CI 0.648-0.809; p<0.001) and for WC, it was 0.646 (95% CI 0.559-0.734; p = 0.003). The optimized cut-off value for BMI and WC were 24.91 kg/m2 and 81.5 cm respectively to differentiate the patients with IR or ID. Study limitations include small sample size due to recruitment of patients only from a limited geographical locality of the country and not totally excluding of the possibility of inclusion of some patients with slowly progressive type 1 DM or Latent onset diabetes of adulthood from the study population.The results revealed that there was a significant positive correlation between BMI, WC and HOMA while a significant negative correlation with QUICKI and MCA among the cohort of patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. The cut-off values of BMI and WC as 24.91 kg/m2 and 81.5 cm respectively could be used as simple clinical parameters to identify IR in newly diagnosed patients with T2DM. Our results could be beneficial in rational decision making in the management of newly diagnosed patients with T2DM in limited resource settings."
