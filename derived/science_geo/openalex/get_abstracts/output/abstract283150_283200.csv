https://openalex.org/W2004127909,"My fieldwork in various parts of the world leads me to the conclusion that the retreat of cliffy coasts through abrasion and solutional erosion during Recent times has produced a whole complex of forms, including conspicuous benches well above sea level where bedrock conditions are favorable. In addition, flats of other origin are being developed at various levels. Broad exposures of beach rock are a marine phenomenon only in that such exposure is a result of beach recession and of the uncovering of materials that had been cemented, under freshwater conditions, along water tables, in some places 6 or more feet above sea level. Contemporary coral and algal flats are forming in some instances several feet above the level of the highest tides."

Adductor muscle fibers are up to 2 mm thick. They are innervated by separate nerves, each supplying one end, but not the central region, with terminals; each fiber receives two or three excitor axons. Depressor muscle fibers are up to 1.4 mm thick and receive multiterminal innervation along their entire length; they are innervated by two excitor axons. Postsynaptic potentials are of small or large size and lead to small or large twitches; they do not show facilitation. The muscle fibers shorten to as little as one-sixth resting length."

https://openalex.org/W1994742663,"Spiral flow has been observed in meandering rivers, braided rivers, very shallow sea water, model experiments, and dust devils. Experimental work also produced standing spiral waves and spouts of water. Many observed spirals reversed direction from time to time. Geometry of the system, roughness, and turbulence are perhaps dominant in the control of spiral flow."

However, no evidence has been recorded (i) that untoward consequences follow administration of cell-free preparations from such cultures to humans or (ii) that oncogenic or other viral activity is associated with the ability of cells of these lines to grow into neoplasms when transplanted into a suitable host. It seems very unlikely, nevertheless, that acceptance could be won at present for the general use of a live-virus vaccine prepared from a virus grown in cells showing evidences of malignancy. This conclusion is based more on psychological and public relations considerations than on the available scientific information, which, however, needs considerable augmentation. In this connection, careful consideration should be given to the question whether the absence of the cited kinds of abnormalities from a continuously cultured cell system is a sufficient indicator of freedom from oncogenic potential. In the absence of unfavorable data, we judge that present knowledge does not preclude judicious extension of clinical trials, in volunteers, of appropriately filtered and otherwise controlled experimental live-virus vaccines grown in carefully selected continuously cultured cell systems. Only in this way can sufficient data be collected, and adequate criteria be developed, to define eventually the conditions for acceptability of such preparations for general administration to humans. 4) Every possible effort should be devoted to the development of non-oncogenic and otherwise acceptable cell lines from normal tissues for use in viral vaccine production. It is suggested that exploratory studies begin with continuously cultured mixed-cell populations in the diploid state and stabilized cloned cultures. Criteria for the selection and monitoring of cell lines, and progressive steps leading to large-scale application are outlined. 5) If the need for immunization against a particular viral disease should be deemed sufficiently urgent, and if no practicable alternative were available, serious consideration might be given to a vaccine prepared by inactivating the virus, grown in such a selected stabilized cell line as HeLa or human skin epithelium. The conditions of preparation would have to be such as would inactivate the most resistant known viruses and infective nucleic acids with a generous margin of safety. 6) Principal areas needing intensified research emphasis are indicated."

https://openalex.org/W1979006247,By treatment of muscovite with molten lithium nitrate at 300 degrees C we have been able to remove a large portion of the interlayer potassium and observe a decrease in the apparent b-axis length as a function of potassium content over the range of 8.8 to 0.7 percent potassium. The b-axis length of Silversheen mica (a 2M(1) muscovite) decreases from 9.024 to 8.988 A as the potassium content decreases from 8.79 to 3.31 percent. The contraction of the b-dimension results in an effective decrease in the size of the ditrigonal opening in the planar surfaces with a consequent increase in the d(001) upon re-saturation with potassium.

Results are briefly discussed."
