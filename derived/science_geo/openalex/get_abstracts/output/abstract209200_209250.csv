https://openalex.org/W1984989420,Prolonged inspection of uniformly moving contours affects differentially the luminance threshold for the detection of test contours as a function of the direction of motion of the test contours. This finding supports a new explanation of the well-known aftereffect.

https://openalex.org/W2009826237,Morphological changes at the cell level have been produced experimentally by a pulsed ruby laser (optical maser). A pulse duration of approximately 500 microseconds caused discrete damage to structures in the cell without irreversible damage to the surrounding area.
https://openalex.org/W2031733294,"We have been able to produce chemiluminescence in firefly luciferin without utilizing the enzyme luciferase. Following the analogous mechanism of the chemiluminescence of luminol in the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, we have prepared synthetically the methyl ester of luciferin, the phosphate ester of luciferin and luciferyl adenylate by condensation in dimethyl sulfoxide with Khorana's reagent, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and diazomethane, phosphoric acid, and adenylic acid respectively. These compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of base emit a bright chemiluminescence. Like in vitro enzymatic bioluminescence, the luciferyl adenylate. chemiluminescence emission spectrum is dependent upon pH."
https://openalex.org/W1538811370,"The kinetics of hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum and from Proteus vulgaris were studied by measuring the HD and D/sub 2/ produced when the enzyme catalyzes the exchange between H/sub 2/ and 100% D/sub 2/O. The ratio of D/sub 2/ to HD production depends on the enzyme concentration because the HD produced by the exchange of H/sub 2/ can react with another enzyme molecule to give D/sub 2/ before it enters the gas phase. At very iow enzyme concentrations the ratio D/sub 2//HD is independent of the enzyme concentration. The D/sub 2// HD ratio depends on pH. For the hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum this ratio is a maximum at a pH of 7.5, whereas the maximum in the enzyme activity occurs at a pH of 8.3. The rate of conversion of p- to o-hydrogen in pure D/sub 2/O was measured and found to be less than 1/10 the rate of the exchange reaction. The ratio D/sub 2/ to HD production and the rate of conversion of p-hydrogen are calculated for three types of activation of the H/sub 2/: a homolytic cleavage of the H/sub 2/ into two hydrogen atoms bound to the enzyme; a cleavage of the H/sub 2/ into anmore » enzyme hydride and a proton, with the hydride not exchanging with the solvent; and, a cleavage of the H/sub 2/ into an enzyme hydride and a proton, but with the hydride able to exchange with the solvent. The experimental data are consistent with the cleavage of the H/sub 2/ into a proton and an enzyme hydride that can exchange with the solvent. It is also possible to interpret these data in terms of a hydride that does not exchange, if it is assumed that there is a cage of water molecules or protein around the active site which allows the H/sub 2/ molecule to react several times before it leaves the vicinity of the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1997937927,"Interpreting attention as a periodic phenomenon, we show its relevance to discriminating the successiveness of signals presented to separate sense modalities. Experiments confirm the expected linear relation between the probability of discriminating pairs of successive from pairs of simultaneous signals and make it possible to infer the period of attention."
https://openalex.org/W2015018941,"IN previous papers1–4 we showed that different metabolites, both in vivo and in vitro, produce insulin secretion which we measured by the method of the epididymal fat of the rat. In view of some of these results we decided to ascertain whether the intravenous injection of ATP was a stimulant to insulin secretion; although we are aware that the point of view actually held is that the metabolic processes affected by this nucleotide are intracellular."
https://openalex.org/W2055226390,A monkey was trained to discriminate between a shrinking and expanding test figure presented after steady fixation of the center of a rotating spiral. Differential shifts in the animal's perception of size constancy were found for clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of the spiral. The magnitude of the aftereffect was within the range found in human subjects.
https://openalex.org/W1997663825,"PITUITARY and chorionic gonadotrophins accelerate the synthesis of testosterone from acetate in dog testes in vivo1 and in rabbit testes in vitro2. It is known that reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPNH) is required for steroid synthesis3, and there is some evidence indicating that gonadotrophic hormones influence dehydrogenase activity in target glands. Thus, Samuels4 showed stimulation of 3-β-ol-dehydrogenase by chorionic gonadotrophin in rat testis and Niemi5 examined histochemically hormonal influences on d-1-β-hydroxybutyric and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases."

https://openalex.org/W1976527709,Kidney tumors in the frog are thought to be virus-caused and naturally transmitted. The present report indicates that natural transmission between mature adults is not a factor in spontaneous tumor development and implies primary infection at earlier stages if a virus is indeed involved. Parasitism and nutritional state appear to be of little significance.

https://openalex.org/W1970797272,Treatment with papain of human 7 S gamma globulin which has specific hemagglutinating antibody activity results in 3.5 S univalent fragments contaminated by intact bivalent globulin. The technique described in this report permits separation of univalent antibody fragments from the contaminating undigested molecule.
https://openalex.org/W1988724246,"Ten consecutive cases of acute transmural myocardial infarction were accompanied by a rise of 50 to 400 percent in the serum acid phenylphosphatase. The increase in phosphatase began several hours after onset of symptoms and lasted 3 to 5 days. A similar rise was seen during the acute stages of other thromboembolic diseases. While the mechanism by which this acid hyperphenylphosphatasia occurs is not clear, platelets may play an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1986235277,"DURING our screening for haptoglobin patterns in different Jewish ethnic groups1,2, we found a sample from a Kurdish boy (from Urmia in the Kurdish part of Persia) which appeared to contain a ‘Johnson type of haptoglobin pattern’3. (We thank Prof. H. Harris (London) for comparing it with a known sample and identifying it.) Further examination of the family revealed the following results (Figs. 1 and 2). The mother of the propositus had a Johnson pattern of Hp and the father a Hp2–1 pattern; of the 7 children two had Johnson type Hp, one Hp1–1, one Hp2–1, two ‘ahaptoglobinæmia’ and one a hypohaptoglobinæmia. Two-and-a-half-fold concentration of the two ahaptoglobinæmic and the hypohaptoglobinæmic sera revealed the presence of haptoglobin in all of them. However, the exact pattern in them could not be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1968867819,WE have described experiments on the incorporation of ammonium chloride labelled with nitrogen-15 into the collagen of (β-aminopropionitrile-treated (lathyritic) chick embryos1. After 3–4 days continued hatching the specific concentration in atom per cent excess was higher in collagen of the lathyritic embryos. In 4-h experiments with carrageenin granuloma slices the incorporation of radioactive proline was decreased by addition of β-aminopropionitrile. We believe that the discrepancy depended on the time factor. The primary effect is probably an inhibition in the utilization of the amino-acids so that the labelled constituents remain longer in the amino-acid pool and cause an apparently increased incorporation at later stages.

Although these findings have indicated the dominant role of the mother in the regulation of excretion of urine in such immature mammals, no attention has been paid to the possibility that mothers may also ingest the urine of their young. To examine this problem the transfer of iodine-131 from young rats through the lactating mothers into the body of the intact young was investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2047729561,"IN the course of investigations of the carcinogenic action of N-methyl-N-nitroso-urethane (NMU)1 it was observed that dilute solutions of this compound in aqueous ethanol, when left in direct sunshine, became decolorized and deposited colourless crystals. Solutions kept in the dark remained yellowish and free from crystalline deposit. This observation was confirmed by exposing 1 per cent solutions of NMU in 10 per cent aqueous ethanol to direct sunshine, or to the light from a mercury-vapour lamp. The solutions became decolorized in the course of several hours or days with deposition of colourless crystals. Red, green, yellow or orange filters, but not blue ones, protected the NMU solutions from this type of decomposition, indicating that the effect is due to the light near the ultra-violet range."
https://openalex.org/W2081892899,"IT has been shown1,2 that the effects of sympathomimetic amines, called indirect (tyramine, phenylethylamine, phenylethanolamine, ephedrine, amphetamine), are abolished by pretreatment with reserpine. However, immediately after an injection of reserpine, the effects of indirect sympathomimetic amines are potentiated2,3. On the other hand, it has been reported that bretylium enhances the effects of tyramine4."
