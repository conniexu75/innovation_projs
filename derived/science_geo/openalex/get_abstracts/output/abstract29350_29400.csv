https://openalex.org/W2004205790,"While it has been known for some time that the c-Myc protein binds to random DNA sequences, no sequence-specific binding activity has been detected. At its carboxyl terminus, c-Myc contains a basic--helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif, which is important for dimerization and specific DNA binding, as demonstrated for other bHLH protein family members. Of those studied, most bHLH proteins bind to sites that contain a CA- -TG consensus. In this study, the technique of selected and amplified binding-sequence (SAAB) imprinting was used to identify a DNA sequence that was recognized by c-Myc. A purified carboxyl-terminal fragment of human c-Myc that contained the bHLH domain bound in vitro in a sequence-specific manner to the sequence, CACGTG. These results suggest that some of the biological functions of Myc family proteins are accomplished by sequence-specific DNA binding that is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein."

Two phases of liver injury were identified, an initial phase during the first hour of reperfusion and a later progression phase with 80 +/- 3% hepatocyte necrosis and an 80-fold increase of neutrophil infiltration in the liver after 24 h. Pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody against neutrophils, which caused consistent neutropenia, protected the liver from reperfusion injury as indicated by 28 +/- 10% necrosis, and 84% reduction of hepatic neutrophil accumulation and a complete recovery of the hepatic ATP content. Our data suggest that the later progression phase of reperfusion injury after hepatic no-flow ischemia is mediated mainly by neutrophils."

Binding of recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) or the purified V1 domain of sCD4 to the surface glycoprotein gp120 on virions resulted in rapid dissociation of gp120 from its complex with the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. This may represent the initial stage in virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. Shedding of gp120 from virions induced by sCD4 may also contribute to the mechanism by which these soluble receptor molecules neutralize HIV-1.

https://openalex.org/W1992071621,"Mammalian skeletons experience peak locomotor stresses (force per area) that are 25 to 50% of their failure strength, indicating a safety factor of between two and four. The mechanism by which animals achieve a constant safety factor varies depending on the size of the animal. Over much of their size range (0.1 to 300 kilograms), larger mammals maintain uniform skeletal stress primarily by having a more upright posture, which decreases mass-specific muscle force by increasing muscle mechanical advantage. At greater sizes, increased skeletal allometry and decreased locomotor performance likely maintain stresses constant. At smaller sizes, skeletal stiffness may be more critical than strength. The decrease in mass-specific muscle force in mammals weighing 0.1 to 300 kilogram indicates that peak muscle stresses are also constant and correlates with a decrease in mass-specific energy cost of locomotion. The consistent pattern of locomotor stresses developed in long bones at different speeds and gaits within a species may have important implications for how bones adaptively remodel to changes in stress."

https://openalex.org/W2164074867,"The lutropin-choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor is a cell surface receptor comprised of two domains of roughly equivalent size. The amino-terminal half of the receptor is relatively hydrophilic and is located extracellularly, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half of the receptor shares amino acid homology with other receptors that couple to G proteins and is similarly thought to span the plasma membrane seven times, ending with a relatively short carboxyl-terminal tail. In order to test the role of the extracellular domain in binding hormone, we constructed a mutated rat luteal LH/CG receptor cDNA (termed pCLHR-D2), which encodes for only the extracellular domain, and used it to transiently transfect human kidney 293 cells. Here we report that the expressed extracellular domain of the LH/CG receptor is capable of binding human CG with a high affinity, comparable with that of the full-length receptor. Thus, not only is the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein hormone receptors involved in binding hormone, but it alone is capable of conferring high affinity binding. Unexpectedly, it was also found that this truncated receptor is not secreted into the culture media but remains trapped within the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580358086,"Untransformed steroid receptors in cytosol preparations are associated with the 90-kDa heat shock protein hsp90, but the study of how hsp90 affects receptor function has been held back by the inability to reassociate steroid receptors with hsp90 in cell-free systems. Recently we showed (Dalman, F.C., Bresnick, E. H., Patel, P. D., Perdew, G. H., Watson, S. J., and Pratt, W. B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19815-19821) that glucocorticoid receptors translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate bind to hsp90 at the termination of receptor translation. In this work we show that rabbit reticulocyte lysate promotes the temperature-dependent association of hsp90 with immunopurified mouse L cell glucocorticoid receptors. Reticulocyte lysate also promotes the temperature-dependent dissociation of hormone-free receptors from a prebound receptor-DNA complex. The glucocorticoid receptor is released from DNA in association with rabbit hsp90, and reconstitution of the receptor-hsp90 complex is accompanied by complete restitution of steroid binding activity and repression of DNA binding activity. This is the first time that transformation of a DNA-bound steroid receptor has been reversed and it raises the question of whether the same or a similar system is involved in the termination of transcriptional activation when steroid dissociates from DNA-bound receptors in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1573311539,"It has been reported that pyrimidine dimers (pyrimidine mean value of pyrimidine) are removed preferentially from actively transcribing genes. Furthermore, the preferential repair is restricted to the transcribed strand of these genes. Currently there is no mechanistic explanation for these phenomena. In this study we investigated the effect of transcription on nucleotide excision repair using defined Escherichia coli systems consisting of DNA substrates containing a strong promoter and either (a) a T mean value of T at a defined position in the nontranscribed or transcribed strand or (b) photoproducts randomly distributed in both strands, as well as transcription and nucleotide excision repair enzymes. While a T mean value of T in the nontranscribed strand had no effect on transcription, a photodimer in the transcribed strand blocked transcription causing RNA polymerase to stall at the T mean value of T site. This stalled elongation complex inhibited the excision of the photodimer by (A)BC excinuclease resulting in a net effect of preferential repair of the nontranscribed strand in a mixture containing both substrates. Similarly, when we conducted transcription/repair experiments with a superhelical plasmid no enhanced repair of the transcribed gene was observed compared to nontranscribed regions. We conclude that RNA polymerase stalled at a photodimer does not direct the (A)BC excinuclease to the damaged template strand and therefore cannot account for the strand-specific repair observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2016364197,"The mechanisms by which expression of the β-like globin genes are developmentally regulated are under intense investigation. The temporal control of human embryonic (ε) globin expression was analyzed. A 3.7-kilobase (kb) fragment that contained the entire human ε-globin gene was linked to a 2.5-kb cassette of the locus control region (LCR), and the developmental time of expression of this construct was studied in transgenic mice. The human ε-globin transgene was expressed in yolk sac-derived primitive erythroid cells, but not in fetal liver or bone marrow-derived definitive erythroid cells. The absence of ε gene expression in definitive erythroid cells suggests that the developmental regulation of the ε-globin gene depends only on the presence of the LCR and the ε-globin gene itself (that is, an autonomous negative control mechanism). The autonomy of ε-globin gene developmental control distinguishes it from the competitive mechanism of regulation of γ and β-globin genes, and therefore, suggests that at least two distinct mechanisms function in human hemoglobin switching."

https://openalex.org/W1513438812,"Monoclonal antibodies that bound to the external domain of the rabbit low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) were taken into rabbit fibroblasts by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Uptake occurred in fibroblasts from Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, which lack low density lipoprotein receptors, as well as in normal rabbit fibroblasts. The fate of the internalized antibodies differed, depending on the domain of LRP that was recognized. LRP is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain that is cleaved to form a heterodimer of two noncovalently bound proteins, 1) a 515-kDa subunit that contains the binding domain, and 2) an 85-kDa subunit that contains the membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic tail. A monoclonal antibody directed against the 515-kDa subunit (anti-LRP 515) rapidly dissociated from LRP at pH 5.2. After uptake by cells this antibody dissociated from the receptor and was degraded in lysosomes. A second antibody directed against the external portion of the 85-kDa subunit (anti-LRP 85) failed to dissociate at acid pH. After uptake by cells this antibody was not degraded, but instead was released from the cells in an acid-precipitable form. When administered intravenously to rabbits, both 125I-labeled antibodies were rapidly cleared from the circulation, 75-95% of the uptake occurring in the liver. The anti-LRP 515 antibody was degraded and acid-soluble products appeared in the plasma. No significant acid-soluble products appeared when the anti-LRP-85 antibody was infused. We conclude that LRP can carry out receptor-mediated endocytosis and that its ligand-binding domain, like the similar domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor, undergoes an acid-dependent conformational change that ejects ligands within the endosome. We also conclude that in the body this endocytotic function is expressed primarily in the liver. Both of these conclusions lend support to the hypothesis that LRP may function in humans and animals as a receptor for apolipoprotein E-enriched lipoproteins, such as chylomicron remnants."
https://openalex.org/W1526000693,"Regulation of the pointed, or slow-growing, end of actin filaments is essential to the regulation of filament length. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of skeletal muscle tropomyosin (TM) in regulating pointed end assembly and disassembly in vitro. The effects of TM upon assembly and disassembly of actin monomers from the pointed filament end were measured using pyrenyl-actin fluorescence assays in which the barbed ends were capped by villin. Tropomyosin did not affect pointed end elongation; however, filament disassembly from the pointed end stopped in the presence of TM under conditions where control filaments disassembled within minutes. The degree of protection against depolymerization was dependent upon free TM concentration and upon filament length. When filaments were diluted to a subcritical actin concentration in TM, up to 95% of the filamentous actin remained after 24 h and did not depolymerize further. Longer actin filaments (150 monomers average length) were more effectively protected from depolymerization than short filaments (50 monomers average length). Although filaments stopped depolymerizing in the presence of TM, they were not capped as shown by elongation assays. This study demonstrates that a protein, such as TM, which binds to the side of the actin filament can prevent dissociation of monomers from the end without capping the end to elongation. In skeletal muscle, tropomyosin could prevent thin filament disassembly from the pointed end and constitute a mechanism for regulating filament length."

https://openalex.org/W1543411735,"Sphingosine, a breakdown product of cellular sphingolipids, has recently been shown to stimulate DNA synthesis and act synergistically with known growth factors to induce proliferation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Hong, Z., Buckley, N. E., Gibson, K., and Spiegel, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 76-81). The present study demonstrates that mitogenic concentrations of sphingosine induce early increases in cytosolic phosphatidic acid, which is a potent mitogen for Swiss 3T3 cells. Structurally related analogs of sphingosine, such as N-stearoylsphingosine and other long chain aliphatic amines, did not mimic the mitogenic effect of sphingosine and did not elevate phosphatidic acid levels. Sphingosine not only stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation with similar efficiency and kinetics as phosphatidic acid, it also induced similar morphological alterations. Both sphingosine and phosphatidic acid acted synergistically with a variety of growth factors, such as, insulin, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. In sharp contrast, sphingosine and phosphatidic acid did not have additive or synergistic effects in either the presence or absence of other growth factors. Both sphingosine and phosphatidic acid stimulated DNA synthesis in cells made protein kinase C-deficient by prolonged treatment with phorbol ester and sphingosine still stimulated similar increases in phosphtidic acid in these cells. Furthermore, similar to the actions of phosphatidic acid on signal transduction in Swiss 3T3 cells, mitogenic concentrations of sphingosine also inhibit cAMP accumulation and trigger the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides. Our findings indicate that sphingosine and phosphatidic acid control cellular responses in Swiss 3T3 cells through a common pathway. In view of the prominent role of phosphatidic acid in signal transduction and cellular proliferation, our observations that sphingosine, at mitogenic concentrations, increases the level of phosphatidic acid and also mimics the effects of phosphatidic acid on signal transduction, have important implications for the mechanism of action of sphingosine."

https://openalex.org/W1654186153,"Abstract The hemocytes of the horseshoe crab have been found to contain a new family of Arthropodous antibiotics, termed the family. These peptides are composed of 17-18 amino acid residues with a carboxyl-terminal arginine alpha-amide. We report here the entire cDNA sequence coding for the tachyplesin precursors and their distribution in various tissues of the horseshoe crab. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNAs revealed that the tachyplesin precursors consist of 77 amino acids with 23 residues in a presegment, and that there are two types of mRNAs corresponding to the isopeptides tachyplesins I and II. Both precursors contain a putative signal peptide, a processing peptide sequence and a carboxyl-terminal amidation signal Gly-Lys-Arg connected to the mature tachyplesin peptide. Moreover, an unusual acidic amino acid cluster, Asp-Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-COOH, is present in the carboxyl-terminal portions of both precursors. These results suggest that the two types of tachyplesin precursors are first synthesized as preproproteins and are then incorporated into the intracellular organelle, accompanied by various processing events. Northern blot analysis on a total RNA from various tissues of the horseshoe crab revealed that the tachyplesin precursors are expressed mainly in hemocytes and cardiac and brain tissues. Tachyplesin was immunohistochemically localized in the smaller dense granules rather than the typical large granules present in abundance in the hemocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2087656854,"Detailed kinetic investigations of a catalytic antibody that promotes the hydrolyses of an anilide and phenyl ester show that this catalyst uses a multistep kinetic sequence resembling that found in serine proteases to hydrolyze its substrates, although antibody was elicited to a single transition-state analog. Like the serine proteases the antibody catalyzes the hydrolysis reactions through a putative covalent intermediate, but unlike the enzymes it may use hydroxide ion to cleave the intermediates. Nevertheless, the antibody is a potent catalyst with turnover at higher pH values rivaling that of chymotrypsin. This analysis also reveals that turnover by the antibody is ultimately limited by product desorption, suggesting that improvements in catalytic efficiency may be achieved by judicious changes in the structure of the substrate, so that it is not superimposable on that of the eliciting hapten."
https://openalex.org/W1504341750,"alpha-Bungarotoxin blocks acetylcholine-mediated ion channel opening of peripheral acetylcholine receptors (AChR). A major binding region for alpha-bungarotoxin has been recently identified within parts of the segment 170-204 of the alpha-subunit. We used the Pepscan systematic peptide synthesis system to determine the minimum Torpedo AChR segment required for alpha-bungarotoxin binding and to investigate the role of each residue within this segment. Continuously overlapping decapeptides within alpha 179-203 and several decapeptides covering other alpha-subunit sequences showed that alpha 188-197 and alpha 189-198 exhibited the best 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding activity (KD = 7.3 x 10(-8) and 4.3 x 10(-8) M, respectively). Several continuously overlapping nona-, octa-, hepta-, hexa-, and tetrapeptides showed that the heptapeptide alpha 189-195 was the minimum sequence with high binding activity (KD = 5.6 x 10(-8)M). d-Tubocurarine, but not carbamylcholine, blocked toxin binding. Twenty-six analogs of the alpha 188-197, most having 1 residue substituted by Ala or Gly, showed that Tyr189, Tyr190, and especially Asp195 were indispensable for 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding. Cys192 and Cys193 could be substituted by other amino acids, proving that the disulfide bond between alpha 192-193 was not required for alpha-bungarotoxin binding. The decreased alpha-bungarotoxin binding capacity of the equivalent human muscle AChR alpha 188-197 peptide was the result of substitution of Tyr by Thr at alpha 189."

https://openalex.org/W1637241283,"Due to its extreme insolubility, Fe3+ is not transported as a monoatomic ion. In microbes, iron is bound to low molecular weight carriers, designated siderophores. For uptake into cells of Escherichia coli Fe3+ siderophores have to be translocated across two membranes. Transport across the outer membrane is receptor-dependent and energy-coupled; transport across the cytoplasmic membrane seems to follow a periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport mechanism. In support of this notion we demonstrate specific binding of the Fe3+ hydroxamate compounds ferrichrome, aerobactin, and coprogen, which are transported via the Fhu system, to the periplasmic FhuD protein, and no binding of the transport inactive ferrichrome A, ferric citrate, and iron sulfate. About 10(4) ferrichrome molecules were bound to the FhuD protein of cells which overproduced plasmid-encoded FhuD. Binding depended on transport across the outer membrane mediated by the FhuA receptor and the TonB protein. Binding to FhuD was supported by the exclusive resistance of FhuD to proteinase K in the presence of the transport active hydroxamates. The overproduced precursor form of the FhuD protein was not protected by the Fe3+ hydroxamates indicating a conformation different to the mature form. The FhuD protein apparently serves as a periplasmic carrier for Fe3+ hydroxamates with widely different structures."
https://openalex.org/W1502330032,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) circulates in human plasma as two isoforms, apoB-100 (512 kDa) and apoB-48 (242 kDa). ApoB-48 is generated by a novel RNA editing mechanism which post-transcriptionally modifies apoB mRNA in the intestine by converting cytidine at nucleotide 6666 to uridine. This converts codon 2153 from glutamine (CAA) to a premature stop codon (UAA). To characterize the activity which edits apoB mRNA, extracts were prepared from enterocytes isolated from baboon small intestine. These extracts efficiently edit synthetic apoB RNA in vitro. Editing was detected by primer extension, and the specificity of the reaction was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Extracts prepared from other baboon tissues did not edit apoB RNA in vitro. The editing activity was partially purified by chromatography of the enterocyte extracts on DEAE-cellulose. The activity is sensitive to proteinase K but resistant to micrococcal nuclease and has an average molecular mass of 125 kDa when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W1561330903,"Oscillatory behavior of glycolysis in cell-free extracts of rat skeletal muscle involves bursts of phosphofructokinase activity, due to autocatalytic activation by fructose-1,6-P2. Glucose-1,6-P2 similarly might activate phosphofructokinase in an autocatalytic manner, because it is produced in a side reaction of phosphofructokinase and in a side reaction of phosphoglucomutase using fructose-1,6-P2. When muscle extracts were provided with 1 mM ATP and 10 mM glucose, glucose-1,6-P2 accumulated in a stepwise, but monotonic, manner to 0.7 microM in 1 h. The stepwise increases occurred during the phases when fructose-1,6-P2 was available, consistent with glucose-1,6-P2 synthesis in the phosphoglucomutase side reaction. Addition of 5-20 microM glucose-1,6-P2 increased the frequency of the oscillations in a dose-dependent manner and progressively shortened the time interval before the first burst of phosphofructokinase activity. Addition of 30 microM glucose-1,6-P2 blocked the oscillations. The peak values of the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio were then eliminated, and the average [ATP]/[ADP] ratio was reduced by half. In the presence of higher, near physiological concentrations of ATP and citrate (which reduce the activation of phosphofructokinase by glucose-1,6-P2), high physiological concentrations of glucose-1,6-P2 (50-100 microM) increased the frequency of the oscillations and did not block them. We conclude that autocatalytic activation of phosphofructokinase by fructose-1,6-P2, but not by glucose-1,6-P2, is the mechanism generating the oscillations in muscle extracts. Glucose-1,6-P2 may nevertheless play a role in facilitating the initiation of the oscillations and in modulating their frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1586723866,"The DNA binding domain of the transcription factor LAC9 contains 6 cysteine residues with spacing in the primary peptide sequence identical to that found in the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 transcription factor. In GAL4, the CysX2CysX6CysX6CysX2CysX6Cys motif has been shown to form a Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear cluster (Pan, T. and Coleman, J. E. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 2077-2081), representing a new structure for a Zn(II)-containing transcription factor which differs from the zinc finger motif first described for TFIIIA. LAC9 has been shown to bind two Zn(II) ions (Halvorsen, Y. C., Nandabalan, K., and Dickson, R. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13283-13289). The similarity of the amino acid sequence and the Cys spacing within the DNA binding domain suggest that LAC9 should also be capable of forming the Zn(II)2Cys6 cluster found in GAL4. A fragment of LAC9 consisting of 144 amino acid residues spanning the DNA binding domain has been prepared with 113Cd(II) substituted for the two native Zn(II) ions. 113Cd NMR of this fragment (denoted LAC9(85-228*] has been carried out in an attempt to test the hypothesis that LAC9, like GAL4, forms a binuclear cluster. The chemical shifts of the two bound 113Cd(II) ions, 705 and 692 ppm respectively, are consistent with ligation of each 113Cd(II) ion to 4 sulfur atoms. The best model for such ligation is that two of the cysteine S- form bridges between the two Cd(II) ions. Formation of a Zn(II)-Cd(II) hybrid form of LAC9(85-228*) has also been observed. We conclude that LAC9 contains a Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear cluster as previously reported for GAL4."

https://openalex.org/W1514013447,"Yeast KEX2 protease was examined as a potential model for a human proprotein convertase and, in all respects, mimicked the predicted properties of a proalbumin convertase. The enzyme rapidly cleaved the propeptide Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Arg-Arg from the NH2-terminal end of proalbumin but, unlike trypsin, failed to cleave physiologically unprocessed human proalbumin variants. There was little or no cleavage of proalbumin Lille (Arg-2----His) or Christchurch (Arg-1----Gln), and there was negligible cleavage of proalbumin Blenheim (Asp1----Val), despite the fact that it retains the dibasic processing signal. Proalbumin Kaikoura (Arg-2----Cys), which appears to be partially processed in vivo, was cleaved at about half the rate of normal proalbumin despite the absence of a diarginyl sequence. Restoration of a dibasic site through aminoethylation of the new cysteine increased the rate of cleavage to near that of normal proalbumin. The KEX2-catalyzed cleavage of normal proalbumin was found to be independent of pH between pH 6.0 and 8.0. Antitrypsin Pittsburgh (Met358----Arg), a predicted specific inhibitor of in vivo proalbumin cleavage, inhibited KEX2 in a reversible manner. A molar excess of thrombin over antitrypsin Pittsburgh relieved the inhibition of KEX2, suggesting that a covalent complex is not formed between KEX2 and the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1520979092,"Thioether methyltransferase was previously shown to catalyze the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of dimethyl selenide, dimethyl telluride, and various thioethers to produce the corresponding methyl onium ions. In this paper we show that the following thioethers are also substrates for this enzyme in vitro: 2-hydroxyethyl ethyl sulfide, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, thiodiglycol, t-butyl sulfide, and isopropyl sulfide. To demonstrate thioether methylation in vivo, mice were injected with [methyl-3H]methionine plus different thioethers, and extracts of lungs, livers, kidneys, and urine were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for the presence of [3H]methyl sulfonium ions. The following thioethers were tested, and all were found to be methylated in vivo: dimethyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide, methyl n-propyl sulfide, tetrahydrothiophene, 2-(methylthio)ethylamine, 2-hydroxyethyl ethyl sulfide, and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide. This supports our hypothesis that the physiological role of thioether methyltransferase is to methylate seleno-, telluro-, and thioethers to more water-soluble onium ions suitable for urinary excretion. Conversion of the mustard gas analog, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, to the methyl sulfonium derivative represents a newly discovered mechanism for biochemical detoxification of sulfur mustards, as this conversion blocks formation of the reactive episulfonium ion that is the ultimate alkylating agent for this class of compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1630084798,"Glia maturation factor beta (GMF-beta) is a 17-kDa acidic protein isolated from the brain. When added to cultured cells, GMF-beta promotes the phenotypic expression of glia and neurons and inhibits the proliferation of their respective tumors. Although astrocytes produce GMF-beta and store it inside the cells, they do not secrete the protein into the cultured medium. This poses a question as to how GMF-beta mediates intercellular communication. This paper provides an answer by demonstrating the presence of GMF-beta on the surface of astrocytes, using gold-labeled antibody enhanced with silver. It appears that cell-surface GMF-beta acts on the target cells at close range when cells are in direct contact. In contrast to astrocytes, we failed to detect GMF-beta on the surface of C6 glioma cells, although these cells, like astrocytes, possess endogenous intracellular GMF-beta and are also responsive to GMF-beta added to the medium. The lack of cell-surface expression of GMF-beta in C6 cells may reflect a breakdown in intercellular communication in these malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1578397412,"The x-ray structure of the EcoRI endonuclease-DNA complex (3) suggests that hydrogen bonds between amino acids, glutamic acid 144, arginine 145, and arginine 200, and major groove base moieties are the molecular determinants of specificity. We have investigated residue 144 using aspartate and glutamine substitutions introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution with glutamine results in a null phenotype (at least a 2000-fold reduction in activity). On the other hand, the aspartic acid mutant (ED144) retained in vivo activity. Substrate binding and catalytic studies were done with purified ED144 enzyme. The affinity of the ED144 enzyme for the canonical sequence 5'-GAATTC-3' is about 340-fold less than the wild-type (WT) enzyme, while its affinity for nonspecific DNA is about 50 times greater. The ED144 enzyme cleaves one strand in the EcoRI site in plasmid pBR322 with a kcat/Km similar to WT. In contrast to the WT enzyme, the ED144 enzyme dissociates after the first strand cleavage. Partitioning between cleavage and dissociation at the first and second cleavage steps for the ED144 enzyme is extremely salt-sensitive. The altered partitioning results largely from a destabilization of the enzyme-DNA complex, particularly the enzyme-nicked DNA complex, with only small changes in the respective cleavage rates. The hydrogen bonds of Glu-144 are critical, they appear to act cooperatively with other specificity contacts to stabilize the enzyme-DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1563729281,"Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase) contains two bonds, Met29-Met30 and Tyr92-Pro93 which are representative of sites in the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gag polyprotein precursors that are cleaved by the HIV-1 protease during viral maturation. Nevertheless, neither native nor performic acid-oxidized RNase is a substrate for the protease. However, RNase derivatives obtained by reduction and S-alkylation with iodoacetate or iodoacetamide undergo cleavage by the HIV-1 protease at a single site, Ala109-alkyl-Cys110, that is distinct from either of the two predicted bonds mentioned above. The neutral carboxyamido-methylcysteinyl derivative is cleaved 8 times faster than that containing the negatively charged carboxy-methyl substituent at P1'. Succinylation of these S-alkylated RNase derivatives creates a second site of cleavage by the protease between succinyl-Lys7 and Phe8. Thus, the pattern of cleavage of denatured RNase by the HIV-1 protease can be manipulated by chemical derivatization of the substrate, and the new sites of hydrolysis revealed by these studies add to our understanding of the specificity of this important enzyme."

Both pheAo351 and pheAo352 contained a G:C to A:T base pair transition, at different positions in the 3:4 stem of the pheA attenuator terminator. Since these changes would destabilize the G:C stem of the attenuator terminator we propose that the enhanced expression of pheA observed in the pheAo mutants is due to increased transcription readthrough at the defective attenuator terminator."

This depletion-dependent labeling required live cells. It was not caused by reactive contaminants in the radioactive glucose preparations, by carbohydrate or protein comigration into the DNA band, or by metabolism of glucose into deoxyribose. Labeling levels are similar whether depletion is achieved by oxidation (with the drug diamide) or by inhibition of synthesis (with methionine sulfoximine). A temporal association between GSH repletion and the appearance of D-lactate, the putative unique product of GSH-dependent glyoxylase action on pyruvaldehyde, suggests possible involvement of 3-carbon dicarbonyls."
https://openalex.org/W1488568888,"Abstract The activity of prolyl endopeptidase was markedly decreased during incubation of intact murine erythroleukemia cells at 45 degrees C, but not during incubation of sonicated cells or during incubation at 42 degrees C. The thermal inactivation of prolyl endopeptidase in situ required neither the synthesis of proteins and polynucleotides nor the synergistic activation of inhibitors. Moreover, inhibition of lysosomal proteinases and calpains or depletion of ATP did not affect the thermal inactivation of prolyl endopeptidase. This specific inactivation of prolyl endopeptidase was also observed following the addition to the culture medium of menadione or diamide, compounds known to increase intracellular oxidized glutathione levels. The activity of prolyl endopeptidase in the cell lysate was also dose-dependently decreased by the addition of glutathione disulfide and the decrease of the activity was prevented by coexistence of reduced glutathione. Furthermore, the level of intracellular oxidized glutathione was increased during incubation at 45 degrees C for 15 min, but not at 42 degrees C for 30 min. These results strongly suggest that the activity of prolyl endopeptidase is regulated by changes in the intracellular redox potential."
https://openalex.org/W1512908378,"Two RNA polymerases homologous to bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, bacteriophage Sp6 and T3 RNA polymerases, were screened for crystallization under conditions identical or similar to those reported for the growth of large single crystals of T7 RNA polymerase (Sousa, R., Rose, J. P., Chung, Y. J., Lafer, E. M., and Wang, B.-C. (1989) Proteins 5, 266; Sousa, R., Lafer, E. M., and Wang, B.-C. (1990) J. Crystal Growth, in press; Sousa, R., and Lafer, E. M. (1990) Methods 1, in press). A number of mutant T7 RNAPs were also screened under these conditions as were three chimeric RNA polymerases consisting of T7 RNAP N-terminal and T3 RNAP C-terminal sequences. One chimeric polymerase and two mutant polymerases crystallized readily under T7 RNAP crystallization conditions. The chimeric polymerase crystallized in a space group different from T7 RNA polymerase: orthorombic with unit cell parameters a = 75 A, b = 98 A, c = 159 A; space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and 4 molecules/unit cell. This chimeric enzyme exhibits T3 promoter specificity and will make it possible to investigate how structural differences between the T3 and T7 RNA polymerase promoter recognition domains determine their different promoter specificities. One of the mutant polymerases successfully crystallized was an enzyme which can carry out promoter recognition and abortive transcription but cannot carry out processive transcription. Its structure may provide information on the nature of the conformational changes undergone by T7 RNAP in the abortive-processive switch. Crystals of the second mutant T7 RNA polymerase were unsuitable for x-ray analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1555121060,"To elucidate the role of C-terminal region of chicken adenylate kinase (a single polypeptide consisting of 193 amino acid residues) in the catalysis and stability of the enzyme, a series of mutant proteins truncated in the C-terminal region has been prepared by successive replacements of the sense codons by a termination codon via site-directed mutagenesis. Removal of the three C-terminal residues did not affect the apparent Michaelis constants (Km values) for AMP and ATP, although the Vmax values decreased gradually in parallel with the length of the polypeptide chain. A sudden increase in Km values for substrates, in particular for ATP, was observed on removal of one additional residue (Leu-190), the Vmax value also being less than one-half of that of the mutant enzyme with 3 residues shorter than the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest the importance of the highly conservative Leu-190. Therefore, we further prepared the mutant enzymes through replacement of Leu-190 by a variety of other amino acid residues. They all had substantially lower Vmax values and decreased thermostabilities. Their apparent Km values for ATP also changed, whereas those for AMP were affected to a lesser extent. The hydrophobicity of amino acid residues at position 190 was found to positively correlate with the specificity constants (kcat/Km values) for ATP and also with the thermostability of the enzyme. The fluorescence emission of the Trp-190 mutant enzyme was quenched by the addition of ATP. It is suggested that the C-terminal residues, particularly those around Leu-190, are present in a hydrophobic region which may be involved in binding of ATP."
