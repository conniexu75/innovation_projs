https://openalex.org/W2127841706,"Fluorescence has been observed directly across the band gap of semiconducting carbon nanotubes. We obtained individual nanotubes, each encased in a cylindrical micelle, by ultrasonically agitating an aqueous dispersion of raw single-walled carbon nanotubes in sodium dodecyl sulfate and then centrifuging to remove tube bundles, ropes, and residual catalyst. Aggregation of nanotubes into bundles otherwise quenches the fluorescence through interactions with metallic tubes and substantially broadens the absorption spectra. At pH less than 5, the absorption and emission spectra of individual nanotubes show evidence of band gap-selective protonation of the side walls of the tube. This protonation is readily reversed by treatment with base or ultraviolet light."

Here, we identify sialyl-dimeric-Lewis x glycosphingolipid as a receptor for H . pylori and show that H . pylori infection induced formation of sialyl-Lewis x antigens in gastric epithelium in humans and in a Rhesus monkey. The corresponding sialic acid–binding adhesin (SabA) was isolated with the “retagging” method, and the underlying sabA gene (JHP662/HP0725) was identified. The ability of many H . pylori strains to adhere to sialylated glycoconjugates expressed during chronic inflammation might thus contribute to virulence and the extraordinary chronicity of H . pylori infection."

In yeast, Rad53 kinase protects stalled replication forks from pathological rearrangements. To characterize the mechanisms controlling fork integrity, we analyzed replication intermediates formed in response to replication blocks using electron microscopy. At the forks, wild-type cells accumulate short single-stranded regions, which likely causes checkpoint activation, whereas rad53 mutants exhibit extensive single-stranded gaps and hemi-replicated intermediates, consistent with a lagging-strand synthesis defect. Further, rad53 cells accumulate Holliday junctions through fork reversal. We speculate that, in checkpoint mutants, abnormal replication intermediates begin to form because of uncoordinated replication and are further processed by unscheduled recombination pathways, causing genome instability."
https://openalex.org/W2104818214,"A genetic screen for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with enhanced susceptibility to killing by Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the identification of two genes required for pathogen resistance: sek-1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, and nsy-1, which encodes a MAP kinase kinase kinase. RNA interference assays and biochemical analysis established that a p38 ortholog, pmk-1, functions as the downstream MAP kinase required for pathogen defense. These data suggest that this MAP kinase signaling cassette represents an ancient feature of innate immune responses in evolutionarily diverse species."
https://openalex.org/W2062911534,"We observe spin blockade due to Pauli exclusion in the tunneling characteristics of a coupled quantum dot system when two same-spin electrons occupy the lowest energy state in each dot. Spin blockade only occurs in one bias direction when there is asymmetry in the electron population of the two dots, leading to current rectification. We induce the collapse of the spin blockade by applying a magnetic field to open up a new spin-triplet current-carrying channel."
https://openalex.org/W2016287981,"Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of the high- T c superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ reveals weak, incommensurate, spatial modulations in the tunneling conductance. Images of these energy-dependent modulations are Fourier analyzed to yield the dispersion of their wavevectors. Comparison of the dispersions with photoemission spectroscopy data indicates that quasiparticle interference, due to elastic scattering between characteristic regions of momentum-space, provides a consistent explanation for the conductance modulations, without appeal to another order parameter. These results refocus attention on quasiparticle scattering processes as potential explanations for other incommensurate phenomena in the cuprates. The momentum-resolved tunneling spectroscopy demonstrated here also provides a new technique with which to study quasiparticles in correlated materials."
https://openalex.org/W2127514796,"D-fenfluramine (d-FEN) was once widely prescribed and was among the most effective weight loss drugs, but was withdrawn from clinical use because of reports of cardiac complications in a subset of patients. Discerning the neurobiology underlying the anorexic action of d-FEN may facilitate the development of new drugs to prevent and treat obesity. Through a combination of functional neuroanatomy, feeding, and electrophysiology studies in rodents, we show that d-FEN–induced anorexia requires activation of central nervous system melanocortin pathways. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of d-FEN's anorexic actions and indicate that drugs targeting these downstream melanocortin pathways may prove to be effective and more selective anti-obesity treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1979015046,"Budding yeast Mec1, homolog of mammalian ATR, is an essential protein that mediates S-phase checkpoint responses and meiotic recombination. Elimination of Mec1 function leads to genomewide fork stalling followed by chromosome breakage. Breaks do not result from stochastic collapse of stalled forks or other incidental lesions; instead, they occur in specific regions of the genome during a G 2 chromosomal transition. Break regions are found to be genetically encoded replication slow zones ( RSZ s), a newly discovered yeast chromosomal determinant. Thus, Mec1 has important functions in normal S phase and the genome instability of mec1 (and, analogously, ATR −/− ) mutants stems from defects in these basic roles."
https://openalex.org/W2148700566,"Climate reconstructions reveal unprecedented warming in the past century; however, little is known about trends in aspects such as the monsoon. We reconstructed the monsoon winds for the past 1000 years using fossil Globigerina bulloides abundance in box cores from the Arabian Sea and found that monsoon wind strength increased during the past four centuries as the Northern Hemisphere warmed. We infer that the observed link between Eurasian snow cover and the southwest monsoon persists on a centennial scale. Alternatively, the forcing implicated in the warming trend (volcanic aerosols, solar output, and greenhouse gases) may directly affect the monsoon. Either interpretation is consistent with the hypothesis that the southwest monsoon strength will increase during the coming century as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise and northern latitudes continue to warm."
https://openalex.org/W2033344693,We have discovered two receptors for two different guests from a single dynamic combinatorial library. Each of the two guests amplifies the formation of a tightly binding host at the expense of unfit library members. Small differences in host-guest binding translate into useful differences in amplification. The selected hosts could be readily synthesized using biased dynamic libraries that contain only the right ratio of those building blocks that were selected by the guests. These results establish dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a practical method not only for the discovery but also for the synthesis of new receptors.
https://openalex.org/W2085665189,"Hyaluronan oligosaccharides (molecular weight: ∼2.5 × 103) inhibit growth of several types of tumors in vivo. In vitro, the oligomers inhibit anchorage-independent growth of several tumor cell types. In accordance with this finding, the oligomers also induce apoptosis and stimulate caspase-3 activity under anchorage-independent conditions. Since inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) mimic the action of hyaluronan oligomers and since the PI 3-kinase/Akt (protein kinase B) cell survival pathway has previously been implicated in anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells, we examined the effect of oligomers on PI 3-kinase and its downstream activities in TA3/St murine mammary carcinoma and HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells. We observed that 50–150 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers inhibit PI 3-kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt to approximately the same extent as optimal doses of wortmannin and LY294002, known inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. Similar inhibition of downstream events, i.e.phosphorylation of BAD and FKHR, was also observed. These effects were not observed on treatment with similar concentrations of chitin oligomers, chondroitin sulfate, or hyaluronan polymer. High molecular weight (∼2 × 106) and low molecular weight (∼8 × 104) preparations of hyaluronan polymer were equally ineffective. The effects of hyaluronan oligomers on these parameters were similar in magnitude to the effect of treatment with activity-blocking antibody against CD44. We interpret these results to indicate that the oligomers competitively block binding of endogenous hyaluronan polymer to CD44, consequently giving rise to attenuated signaling. Finally, we observed that hyaluronan oligomers, but not chitin oligomers, chondroitin sulfate, or hyaluronan polymer, stimulate expression of PTEN, a phosphatase that degrades the major signaling product of PI 3-kinase action, phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate. We conclude that perturbation of hyaluronan-CD44 binding leads to suppression of the PI 3-kinase/Akt cell survival pathway and consequently to inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in culture and tumor growth in vivo.

Its tissue distribution is ubiquitous, and in the adult it is known to serve structural and biophysical roles (1Toole B.P. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycans. Marcel Dekker, New York2000: 61-92Google Scholar). However, hyaluronan is especially concentrated in pericellular matrices surrounding proliferating and migrating cells during embryonic development and tissue remodeling, and in this context it influences cell behavior (2Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 3Toole B.P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Of particular significance in this regard is the interaction of hyaluronan with cell surface receptors, e.g.CD44 or RHAMM,1 that transduce intracellular signals leading to alterations in cytoskeletal interactions and gene expression (4Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan is also present at elevated levels in many malignant tumors and, in some cases, is an accurate predictor of patient morbidity (5Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that hyaluronan may play an important role in tumor malignancy. For example, experimental overexpression of hyaluronan synthases in human tumor cells, giving rise to elevated hyaluronan production, causes increased tumor growthin vivo (6Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 7Liu N. Gao F. Han Z., Xu, X. Underhill C.B. Zhang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5207-5214PubMed Google Scholar). Manipulation of hyaluronan levels in mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines also influences metastatic nodule formation (8Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2499-2504PubMed Google Scholar). Perturbation of endogenous hyaluronan-tumor cell interactions by overexpression of soluble hyaluronan-binding proteins inhibits tumor growth, invasion, or metastasis in several tumor typesin vivo (9Bartolazzi A. Peach R. Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 10Mohapatra S. Yang X. Wright J.A. Turley E.A. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1022-1028PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, administration of hyaluronan oligosaccharides inhibits tumor growth (15Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D. Kuo J.W. Stamenkovic I. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These hyaluronan oligomers compete for endogenous polymeric hyaluronan, replacing high affinity, multivalent receptor interactions with low affinity, low valency interactions (16Underhill C.B. Chi-Rosso G. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8086-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these data appear to point clearly to a central role for hyaluronan in tumor progression, other data suggest that its involvement may be complex. For example, in some studies overexpression of intact CD44 promoted tumor progression (18Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zoller M. Haussmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1991; 65: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 19Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) whereas in others it was inhibitory (20Schmits R. Filmus J. Gerwin N. Senaldi G. Kiefer F. Kundig T. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Catzavelos C. Rak J. Furlonger C. Zakarian A. Simard J.J. Ohashi P.S. Paige C.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Mak T.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 2217-2233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Takahashi K. Stamenkovic I. Cutler M. Saya H. Tanabe K.K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2223-2232PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, using a rat pancreatic carcinoma cell line, metastasis appeared to be hyaluronan-independent (22Sleeman J.P. Arming S. Moll J.F. Hekele A. Rudy W. Sherman L.S. Kreil G. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3134-3141PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the organization, amount, alternative splicing, or post-translational modification of CD44, or other hyaluronan receptors such as RHAMM, may be critical in determining the response of tumor cells to hyaluronan (4Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 23Kincade P.W. Zheng Z. Katoh S. Hanson L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms whereby hyaluronan influences tumor cell behavior will facilitate our understanding of these apparent contradictions. One of the fundamental attributes of the malignant phenotype is anchorage-independent growth (24Freedman V.H. Shin S.I. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Normal cells, especially epithelia, undergo apoptosis if they become detached from their underlying or pericellular matrices, a process sometimes termed anoikis (25Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), whereas many tumor and transformed cells have escaped this requirement for survival and growth (26Danen E.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Recent investigations indicate that hyaluronan may be critically involved in anchorage-independent cell survival and growth. Overexpression of the hyaluronan synthase,Has2, in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (6Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar) or Mero-25 mesothelioma cells (27Li Y. Heldin P. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) stimulates anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. On the other hand, perturbation of endogenous hyaluronan interactions by overexpression of soluble CD44 inhibits anchorage-independent growth of TA3/St murine mammary carcinoma cells (12Peterson R.M., Yu, Q. Stamenkovic I. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism whereby hyaluronan influences this potentially malignant growth process would provide much needed insights into the contribution of hyaluronan to the malignant phenotype. In this study we show that perturbation of endogenous hyaluronan polymer-cell interactions by treatment with hyaluronan oligomers inhibits tumor growth in vivo as well as anchorage-independent growthin vitro. We then demonstrate that the oligomers exert their inhibitory action by suppressing the PI3 kinase/Akt cell survival pathway. LX-1 human lung carcinoma cells were obtained as described previously and re-passaged in nude mice before use (28Biswas C. Cancer Lett. 1984; 24: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HCT 116 cells were provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Medical School. TA3/St cells were obtained from Dr. H. F. Dvorak, Harvard Medical School, and maintained in our laboratory (29Yeo T.K. Nagy J.A. Yeo K.T. Dvorak H.F. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1733-1740PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured in DMEM-high glucose medium without phenol red and containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). The cell lines were passaged every 3–4 days and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Hyaluronan oligomers were fractionated from testicular hyaluronidase digests of purified hyaluronan polymer by tangential flow filtration as described previously (15Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D. Kuo J.W. Stamenkovic I. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and were supplied by Anika Therapeutics Inc (Woburn, MA). The oligomers used in this study were a mixed fraction of average molecular weight ∼2.5 × 103 and were composed of 3–10 disaccharide units. The oligomers were analyzed by HPLC and capillary electrophoresis but no contaminants were detected. Specific analyses for other glycosaminoglycans, protein, nucleic acids, and endotoxins were also negative. Hyaluronan polymer, molecular weights ∼8 × 104 and ∼2 × 106, were gifts from Genzyme Inc and Anika Therapeutics Inc, respectively. Chitin oligomers were obtained from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA) and chondroitin sulfate from Sigma. Non-adherent ultra-low cluster plates (Costar 3471) were obtained from Corning Incorporated (Corning, NY). ALZET pumps were from ALZA Corporation (Palo Alto, CA). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; DEVD-p-nitroanilide and all other reagents for the caspase-3 assay from Biovision Research Products (Mountain View, CA); reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA); enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, England); phospho-AKT pathway sampler kit from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibody against PTEN (A2B1), antibodies against PI 3-kinase isoforms, and antibody against human CD44 (DF1485) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against mouse CD44 (KM81) was from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and myeloma IgG2a was from Sigma. All other reagents were the highest grade from Sigma. The effect of hyaluronan oligomers on tumor growth in vivo was assessed in a similar manner to that described previously (15Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D. Kuo J.W. Stamenkovic I. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). 5 to 6 week-old nude mice (Balb/c nu/nu, male; Charles River Breeding Laboratories) or A/Jax mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in groups of five mice per experimental point. ALZET osmotic pumps, containing PBS alone or hyaluronan oligomers dissolved in PBS, were inserted under the skin in the dorsal region of the mice by procedures recommended by ALZA scientific products and approved by the Animal Research Committee. On the day after implantation of the pump, 0.5–1.0 × 106 tumor cells in 0.1 ml of PBS were injected immediately in front of the pump. Mice were euthanized by CO2inhalation after 7 or 14 days of treatment, and growth was determined by weighing the tumor. A modification of previously published techniques was used (30MacPherson J.N. Gillies R.R. J. Med. Microbiol. 1969; 2: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The assay was done in 6-well plates with a base layer containing 0.6% agar in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 1 mm glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin plus 100 μg of streptomycin per ml. This layer was overlaid with a second layer of 1 ml of 0.2% agar (containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 200 units of penicillin plus 200 μg of streptomycin) mixed with 1 ml of a suspension of 2500 cells, with or without addition of 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers, in PBS. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 10–14 days, and the diameter of tumor colonies was determined with a microscope equipped with an ocular scale in the eyepiece. Colonies with diameter greater than 0.2 mm were counted. TA3/St and HCT116 cells were grown for 72 h in 14-cm culture dishes, then harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and suspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Two million cells from these cultures were added to each well of non-adherent, ultra-low cluster plates and incubated in suspension at 37 °C for a further 72 h. The cells from each well were then collected, washed in PBS, suspended in 5 ml of DMEM medium containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Cohn Analog, Sigma), re-plated in the cluster plates, and incubated in suspension at 37 °C for 96 h; similar results were obtained with preincubations of 24–96 h for most measurements. The hyaluronan oligomers or other reagents were then added, and the cells incubated for another 24 h in suspension. The cells treated as above were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature. The pellets were washed twice in PBS, then lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Cell lysis was achieved by vortexing for three cycles of 15 s at high speed followed by cooling on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf 5415R centrifuge. After measuring the protein content of the supernatant, it was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use in the assays below. TA3/St cells, grown as described in the section above, were assayed as described elsewhere (31McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of dye mixture (acridine orange and ethidium bromide, 100 μg each in 1 ml) was mixed with 25 μl of cell suspension containing ∼5 × 105 cells per ml in medium. 10 μl of this suspension was placed on a clean slide and examined with a ×40 objective using a fluorescent microscope with a blue filter. Viable cells (green) and apoptotic cells containing fragmented nuclei (red) were counted, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was then calculated. 200 μg of cell lysate protein were used for each assay. The assay was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions (Biovision Research Products) and is based on spectrophotometric detection of the chromophorep-nitroanilide at 405 nm after cleavage from the labeled substrate, DEVD-p-nitroanilide. For assay of total PI 3-kinase, 250 ng of cell lysate protein were used per assay. Assays were performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.001% Nonidet P-40, 150 μm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 150 μm ATP, 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 125 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated lipids containing phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in a 1:1:1 (v/v/v) ratio in sonication buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA) (32Whitman M.

The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by addition of 100 μl of CH3OH/1m HCl (1:1). Lipids were extracted twice with 100 μl of chloroform. The organic layers were combined, dried under nitrogen, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. 32P-labeled phosphoinositides were resolved in water/acetic acid/n-propyl alcohol (34:1:65), and detected by autoradiography. 32P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of thin layer chromatography spots scraped into and eluted in scintillation fluid. For assay of specific PI 3-kinase isoforms, whole cell lysates were incubated with antibody against the particular isoform plus protein A-Sepharose. PI 3-kinase activity of the enzyme immobilized on beads was then measured as described above. Cell lysate preparations were denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and loaded (15–30 μg of protein per lane) onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed on a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20. Membranes were then washed and probed with the appropriate antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin (for polyclonal antibodies) or 5% nonfat dry milk (for monoclonal antibodies). The secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG (New England Bio-labs) and goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, and the sizes of proteins were estimated using prestained molecular weight standards. Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometry. Membranes were reused after neutralization with 15% H2O2 or stripping at 50 °C (according to the manufacturers' procedures, AmershamBiosciences). In a previous study we showed that administration of hyaluronan oligomers at the site of subcutaneous implantation of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells inhibits their growth by 50–85% depending on timing of exposure (15Zeng C.

To determine whether or not this effect was applicable to other tumor cells, we performed similar experiments with LX-1 human lung carcinoma cells in nude mice and TA3/St murine mammary carcinoma cells in syngeneic mice. In each experiment, tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into groups of 5 control and 5 treated animals. The hyaluronan oligomers, of molecular weight ∼2.5 × 103, were administered from ALZET mini-osmotic pumps implanted adjacent to the site of injection 1 day prior to injection of tumor cells. The oligomers were delivered at a rate of ∼0.5 μg/0.5 μl/h over the course of 7 or 14 days. Control animals received vehicle (PBS) only. The hyaluronan oligomers inhibited LX-1 tumor growth by ∼50–80% (Fig.1 A) and TA3/St tumor growth by ∼60–65% (Fig. 1 B) over these time periods,i.e. to a similar degree to that found for B6-F10 cells (15Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D. Kuo J.W. Stamenkovic I. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In additional experiments, animals injected with LX-1 cells were left untreated for 7 days, and then treated with oligomers for 14 days; in two such experiments, inhibition of growth varied between 40 and 75%. When the opposite was done, i.e. treatment for 14 days followed by no treatment for 7 days, 68% inhibition was obtained. When treated for 7 days followed by no treatment for 14 days, 52% inhibition was obtained (data not shown). In routine monolayer cell culture, i.e. under anchorage-dependent conditions, hyaluronan oligomers at a concentration of 100–150 μg/ml were shown to have little or no effect on proliferation of B16-F10 murine melanoma, TA3/St murine mammary carcinoma, LX-1 human lung carcinoma, and HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells (data not shown). This lack of inhibition of proliferation under standard conditions indicates that the hyaluronan oligomers are not toxic. A hallmark characteristic of tumor cells, however, is their ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner (24Freedman V.H. Shin S.I. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). We show here that hyaluronan oligomers decrease anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells, as assayed by their ability to grow as colonies in soft agar. Inclusion of 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers in the soft agar assay inhibits colony formation by LX-1 human lung carcinoma, HCT116 human colon carcinoma, and TA3/St murine mammary carcinoma cells by 80, 68, and 72%, respectively (Fig.2). To rule out contamination by cytokines we also tested boiled oligomers and found that they have equivalent activity to the unboiled oligomers (not shown). Similar results have been obtained with several other tumor cell types, including human glioma and mammary carcinoma cells. 2J. Ward, A. Zoltan-Jones, S. Ghatak, S. Misra, and B. P. Toole, unpublished results. We then tested whether inhibition of anchorage-independent growth is due to induction of apoptosis. To do this we incubated TA3/St cells in suspension, i.e. anchorage-independent conditions, in the presence or absence of hyaluronan oligomers. The level of apoptosis increased from ∼13% in the absence of hyaluronan oligomers to 70–75% in the presence of 50–150 μg/ml oligomers (Fig.3). We also tested the effect of various reagents related to hyaluronan oligomers. We used chitin oligomers as a negative control since they are similar to the hyaluronan oligomers in size and in chemical composition; they are sufficiently closely related that hyaluronan synthase can produce chitin oligomers (35Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We tested their influence on apoptosis and found that they do not have a significant effect (Fig. 3). Hyaluronan polymer and chondroitin sulfate also do not have significant effects (Fig. 3). Survival of carcinoma cells under anchorage-independent conditions, as opposed to normal epithelia, is often attributed to elevated levels of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (26Danen E.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and so we compared the effect of hyaluronan oligomers with that of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. We found that the level of apoptosis induced by hyaluronan oligomers was equivalent to that caused by wortmannin (Fig. 3). A major effector of apoptosis is caspase-3 (36Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Thus we measured the effect of hyaluronan oligomers on caspase-3 activity and found that they stimulated caspase-3 activity by as much as 7–10-fold in TA3/St (Fig. 4 A) and HCT116 cells (Fig. 4 B). Chondroitin sulfate had no significant effect on caspase-3 activity in either cell type. As with the apoptosis assay, the effect of the hyaluronan oligomers was equal to or greater than that of inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 4, A andB). The activity of the PI 3-kinase/Akt cell survival pathway is elevated in many types of tumor cells (37Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 38Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Physiol. 2001; 189: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,39Amundadottir L.T. Leder P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Moore S.M. Rintoul R.C.

Inhibition of this pathway, e.g. by wortmannin or LY294002, induces apoptosis under anchorage-independent conditions (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus we tested whether hyaluronan oligomers suppress this pathway. We first measured the effect of hyaluronan oligomers on total PI 3-kinase activity in TA3/St and HCT116 cell extracts. We found that addition of 50–150 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers inhibits total PI 3-kinase activity in extracts of these cells by ∼60% and that 10 μg/ml sometimes gave partial inhibition (Fig.5, A and B). We then measured their effect on the activity of individual PI 3-kinase isoforms. We found that the predominant isoform present in TA3/St and HCT116 cells is the α isoform, as is the case in most tumor cells. Again, 50–75% inhibition was observed with 50–150 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers and intermediate effects with 10 μg/ml in both TA3/St cells (Fig. 5 C) and HCT116 cells (not shown). Wortmannin and LY294002 had virtually the same effect as that of the oligomers (TA3: Fig. 5 D; HCT: not shown). In addition, we measured the effect of various reagents related to the hyaluronan oligomers. Neither hyaluronan polymer, nor chondroitin sulfate, nor chitin oligomers had a significant effect on PI 3-kinase-α activity in TA3/St cells (Fig. 5 D) or HCT116 cells (not shown). Since different signaling activities have been reported for different sizes of hyaluronan polymer (4Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 42Noble P.W.

To better understand the ischemic tolerance mechanisms induced by hypoxia, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to examine genomic responses in neonatal rat brain following 3 h of hypoxia (8% O2) and either 0, 6, 18, or 24 h of re-oxygenation. The results showed that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1- but not HIF-2-mediated gene expression may be involved in brain hypoxia-induced tolerance. Among the genes regulated by hypoxia, 12 genes were confirmed by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR as follows: VEGF,EPO, GLUT-1, adrenomedullin,propyl 4-hydroxylaseα, MT-1,MKP-1, CELF, 12-lipoxygenase,t-PA, CAR-1, and an expressed sequence tag. Some genes, for example GLUT-1, MT-1,CELF, MKP-1, and t-PA did not show any hypoxic regulation in either astrocytes or neurons, suggesting that other cells are responsible for the up-regulation of these genes in the hypoxic brain. These genes were expressed in normal and hypoxic brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung, with adrenomedullin,MT-1, and VEGF being prominently induced in brain by hypoxia.

Although hypoxia-ischemia animal models have increased our understanding of the processes leading to cell death, there are still no pharmacological treatments available to reduce cell death in ischemic neonatal brain. Interestingly, cells can be protected when a non-injurious hypoxic stress is performed several hours or days before a lethal hypoxic-ischemic stress (preconditioning). This phenomenon is called tolerance. Ischemic tolerance can be achieved in brain by several preconditioning sublethal stresses such as hypoxia (1Gidday J.M. Fitzgibbons J.C. Shah A.R. Park T.S.

These studies suggested that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)1 could be an important mediator of hypoxia-induced tolerance to ischemia (13Bergeron M. Gidday J.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L.

Fandrey J. Kummer W. Acker H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), also induce tolerance against hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal rat brain (13Bergeron M. Gidday J.M., Yu, A.Y.

HIF-1 is an important transcription factor regulating gene expression in response to hypoxia. Moreover, HIF-1 target genes such aserythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protect the brain against ischemia (11Bernaudin M. Marti H.H. Roussel S. Divoux D. Nouvelot A.

However, it is possible that there are other adaptive mechanisms underlying this protection. Understanding changes in gene expression in brain following exposure to hypoxia could reveal new mechanisms of ischemic tolerance. Accordingly, we exploited DNA microarray technology to investigate the brain genomic response of neonatal rat to hypoxia (3 h, 8% O2). Previous studies have analyzed the gene expression after hypoxia in fish (21Gracey A.Y. Troll J.V. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, this is the first in vivo study of the genomic response to hypoxia in neonatal rat brain and in vertebrates in general. All animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, and animal protocols were approved by the University of Cincinnati Animal Research Committee. Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were acclimated to the animal quarters at least 3 days prior to study. The animals, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, were given food and water ad libitum. In addition, all experimental and control animals were housed in the same room prior to and at the conclusion of the study. Neocortical cultures of neurons from rat embryos at 14–15 days of embryonic development (Sprague-Dawley rats, CERJ, Le Genest Saint-Isle, France) were prepared as described (26Bernaudin M. Bellail A. Marti H.H. Yvon A. Vivien D. Duchatelle I. Mackenzie E.T. Petit E. Glia. 2000; 30: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cultures were allowed to grow in a serum-free, chemically defined medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus N-2 (Invitrogen) for 3 days in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C before use. Neocortical cultures of astrocytes were prepared from neonatal (1–3-day-old) rats (Sprague-Dawley CERJ) as described (26Bernaudin M. Bellail A. Marti H.H. Yvon A. Vivien D. Duchatelle I. Mackenzie E.T. Petit E. Glia. 2000; 30: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cultures were allowed to grow in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C to confluency (15–20 days) before use in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Hypoxia was induced by placing neuron and astrocyte cultures in a modular incubator chamber (Anaerobic Chamber, Plas Labs, Lansing, MI) gassed with a mixture consisting of 4.5% CO2 and 95.5% N2. The growth medium was replaced by the same medium (without serum for astrocytes) that had been equilibrated with a gas mixture consisting of 4.5% CO2 and 95.5% N2for 30 min before bathing the cells. The hypoxia was maintained for 3 h, i.e. the duration known to induce tolerancein vivo (1Gidday J.M. Fitzgibbons J.C. Shah A.R. Park T.S. Neurosci.

Male and female rats at postnatal day 6 (P6) (Sprague-Dawley Harlan) were used. The hypoxia chamber (Reming Bioinstruments, Redfield, NY) consists of four identical Plexiglas chambers, each 16 liters in size, that are arranged adjacent to one another. The inlet O2, CO2, and N2 are fixed using gas tanks of appropriate concentrations and valves to monitor inlet gas concentrations. The exiting gas is continuously monitored for O2, CO2, and N2 as well. These data are monitored and stored for each experiment. Rat pups were placed in cages inside these large Plexiglas chambers through which 8% O2 and 92% N2 were circulated for a period of 3 h. This degree and duration of hypoxia is not known to produce any injury in brain and has been shown to protect the newborn brain from subsequent hypoxic-ischemic injury (1Gidday J.M. Fitzgibbons J.C. Shah A.R. Park T.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 168: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 2Ota A. Ikeda T. Abe K. Sameshima H. Xia X.Y. Xia Y.X. Ikenoue T. Am. J. Obstet.

Control animals from the same littermates were placed in one of the four chambers and exposed to ambient oxygen (approximately 21% O2) for the same duration. After 3 h of hypoxia or normoxia, all animals were returned to their dams for 0, 6, 18, or 24 h (re-oxygenation period). After the different re-oxygenation periods, rat pups (at P6 or P7) were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg), and their brains were removed for RNA or protein isolation (Fig. 1). In addition, total RNA was also prepared from different organs (heart, kidney, liver, and lung) after 3 h of hypoxia and from controls. After 3 h of hypoxia or normoxia followed by different periods of re-oxygenation (0, 6, 18, or 24 h), rat pups were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg), and their brain (whole brain hemisphere), heart, kidney, liver, and lung were removed as rapidly as possible for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the tissue pellets were homogenized in TRIzol Reagent using a syringe. After extraction with chloroform (an additional step of phenol/chloroform extraction is added to the manufacturer's protocol), RNA was precipitated by isopropyl alcohol and subjected to further purification using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The quality and quantity of extracted total RNA samples were examined by loading 5 μg of each sample on a denaturing agarose gel. Microarray expression analysis was performed according to the Affymetrix expression analysis technical manual (Affymetrix GeneChip® Expression Analysis Manual, P/N 700217–700222, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from total RNA. To synthesize the first cDNA strand, a high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligo(dT) primer was annealed to the RNA, and extension by reverse transcriptase was performed in the presence of deoxyoligonucleotides. The second strand was synthesized using DNA polymerase I. Double-stranded cDNA was purified using a modified phenol/chloroform extraction procedure (Eppendorf, 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), followed by ethanol precipitation. An in vitro transcription was performed to produce biotin-labeled cRNA from the cDNA. cRNA was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and biotin-labeled ribonucleotides and purified with affinity columns (Qiagen) followed by ethanol precipitation. No amplification procedure was performed to produce the final cRNA. The amount of product was quantified by spectrophotometric analysis, and the quality of the cRNA was assessed by gel electrophoresis and a test array (Test-2 chip). Once prepared, cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U34A rat arrays (Affymetrix), which contains more than 7000 genes and 1000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs are referred to as genes in the following text). The hybridization mixture, containing the cRNA sample, bovine serum albumin, and herring sperm DNA, was incubated at 99°C, transferred to 45 °C, and then injected into the microarray chamber (Affymetrix). Hybridization was performed automatically in a chamber at 45 °C for 16 h while being rotated at 60 rpm. The hybridized probe array was then automatically washed, dried, and scanned two times at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. For microarray analysis, we used total RNA prepared from 2 animals for each group (6 groups in total) as follows: 4 “hypoxia 3 h groups” with 0, 6, 18, or 24 h of re-oxygenation and 2 “controls groups” (6-day-old rat pups that correspond to the sham-control of the hypoxia 3 h with 0 h of re-oxygenation, and 7-day-old rat pups that correspond to the sham-control of the hypoxia 3 h with 24 h of re-oxygenation) (Fig. 1). Two animals were used for each experimental group; thus 12 arrays were used in total. The Affymetrix rat U34A array contains more than 7000 genes and 1000 ESTs. The Affymetrix Genechip software MAS 4.0 (Affymetrix) was used first to collect and process the original expression data from the 12-rat Affymetrix arrays. Each gene on the array is assessed using 16 probe pairs. Each probe pair consists of an oligomer (25 bases long) that is designed to be perfectly complementary to a particular message (called the perfect match or PM) and a companion oligomer that is identical to the PM probe except for a single base difference in a central position (called the mismatch or MM probe). The mismatch probe serves as a control for hybridization specificity and helps subtract nonspecific hybridization. After hybridization intensity data are captured, the Affymetrix Genechip software automatically calculates intensity values for each probe cell and uses these probe cell intensities to calculate an average intensity for each gene (called average difference), which directly correlates with mRNA abundance. The software also gives each gene a qualitative assessment of “present” or “absent” based on a “voting scheme,” with the number of instances in which the PM signal is significantly larger than the MM signal across the whole probe set. Prior to comparing any two measurements, a scaling procedure is performed so that all signal intensities on an array are multiplied by a factor that makes the mean PM-MM value for each array equal to a preset value of 1500. The scaling corrects for any inter-array differences or small differences in sample concentration, labeling efficiency, or fluorescence detection and makes inter-array more reproducible. In the case of a pairwise comparison of two array results, the patterns of change of the whole probe set (with consistent voting) is used to make a qualitative call (called difference call) of “Increase,” “Decrease,” “Marginally increase,” “Marginally decrease,” or “No change.” The fold change is derived by the ratio of average differences from one experimental array compared with a control array. In order to eliminate possible expression changes related to the development (difference of RNA expression between 6- and 7-day-old rat pups), all groups were compared with both controls at 6 and 7 days old. To obtain differentially expressed genes for each condition, Affymetrix Genechip software was used to compare 2 experimental arrays to the 4 control arrays (P6 and P7). For example, 6 h (array 1) of re-oxygenation was compared with controls P6 (arrays 1 and 2) and controls P7 (arrays 1 and 2), respectively, and then 6 h (array 2) was compared with controls P6 (arrays 1 and 2) and controls P7 (arrays 1 and 2). As a result, there were 8 comparisons for each condition. Absolute calls (present, marginal, and absent) and the average difference (RNA abundance) for each gene on each chip were then imported into Genespring software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) for further analysis. By combining the fold change and the present calls derived from the 8 comparisons, we obtained a list for each condition. Three criteria were used for the lists as follows. 1) The fold change for each of the 8 comparisons was at least 1.5-fold. 2) There were present calls in all the hypoxic groups for increasing gene expression and present calls in both controls for decreasing gene expression. 3) Raw data are greater than 100 in hypoxic samples for up-regulated genes and in control samples for down-regulated genes. To avoid developmental gene expression changes, genes that were increased or decreased more than 1.5-fold between 6- and 7-day-old controls were eliminated from the list of hypoxic changes. To obtain a general view of brain genomic response to hypoxia, genes regulated at different time points following hypoxia were selected by the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software (27Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar). Among those genes, 285 genes with relatively high expression in most samples (raw data at of least 100 in 7 of 12 samples) were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis with Genespring software. A standard correlation coefficient of 0.95 was used as the measure for significant statistical similarity. The branching behavior of the tree was controlled using a separation ration setting of 0.5 and a minimum distance setting of 0.001. To validate the microarray data, TaqMan quantitative one-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) was used to quantitate mRNA levels for selected genes. Two primers and one probe (TaqMan probe) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were designed for each gene using PerkinElmer Life Sciences PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems). Q-RT-PCR was performed for whole brain hemisphere RNA from at least 3 animals for each of the groups (including the same RNA samples from 2 animals employed for microarrays analysis) and from heart, kidney, liver, and lung RNA from 3 animals submitted or not to 3 h of hypoxia with or without re-oxygenation. Primer and probe sequences are listed for forward primers “F,” reverse primers “R,” and TaqMan probes “T” in Table I. TaqMan probes were labeled with VIC on the 5′-nucleotide and TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) on the 3′-nucleotide. Assays were run in triplicate on the PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI 5700 instrument under default conditions (RT, 48 °C for 30 min; AmpliTaqGold activation, 95 °C for 10 min; PCR, 40 cycles of 95 °C, 15 s and 60 °C, 1 min). The Q-RT-PCR protocol was done according to the manufacturer's protocol using the TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) with 50 ng of RNA for each sample. The abundance of each gene was determined relative to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) standard transcript using TaqMan GAPDH RNA control reagents kits (Applied Biosystems). The abundance of each gene was also determined relative to the standard transcript 18 S using TaqMan ribosomal control reagents kits (Applied Biosystems). The data obtained with 18S are not shown because the results were identical to those obtained with GAPDH (data not shown). To verify the presence and the predicted size of amplified fragments, PCR products were separated by electrophoresis and visualized in 3% agarose gels with ethidium bromide.Table IList of primers used for real time RT-PCRGene nameACaAC, GenBank™accession number.PrimersPosition/sizebpAdrenomedullinD15069F, 5′-CAGGACAAGCAGAGCACGTC-3′36182T, 5′-CAAGCCAGCACTCAGAGCACAGCC-3′391R, 5′-TCTGGCGGTAGCGTTTGAC-3′442CAR-1U76714F, 5′-ACCCGCTTCCATAAGGCTTTA-3′52142T, 5′-CAGCTTTGCTGTTCTTTGCCTTAGTTGTCC-3′139R, 5′-CAGCCTTGTGCCGAAAGAC-3′193Casein kinase-1αU77582F, 5′-CGGAAGATCGGATCTGGTTC-3′6199T, 5′-TCTAGCGATCAACATCACCAATGGCG-3′96R, 5′-CCTGGCCTTCTGGGATTCTAG-3′159CELFM65149F, 5′-CACGACCCCTGCCATGTATG-3′142118T, 5′-CTTCAGCGCCTACATTGATTCCATGGC-3′181R, 5′-GAAGAGGTCGGCGAAGATCTC-3′259EPOD10763F, 5′-GAATTGATGTCGCCTCCAGA-3′44991T, 5′-CCAAGCCGCTCCACTCCGAACA-3′475R, 5′-TGGAGTAGACCCGGAAGAGCT-3′539EST 188825AA799328F, 5′-ATTGTCCCAGGTTGTGTCCAA-3′481102T, 5′-TCCTCCTAGCACTCTCCATTGTGAATCGTATC-3′504R, 5′-GGACTTGAGTTGTGGAGAGCAA-3′582GLUT-1S68135F, 5′-GGTGTGCAGCAGCCTGTGTA-3′111278T, 5′-CCATCGGCTCGGGTATCGTCAACAC-3′1137R, 5′-GACGAACAGCGACACCACAGT-3′118912-LipoxygenaseL06040F, 5′-GATGGGTGTCTACCGCATCC-3′1998T, 5′-CTCCAAGTACGCGGGCTCCAACAAC-3′55R, 5′-CCTCTCCATGCTGTCCAACC-3′116Metallothionein-1M11794F, 5′-CAAATGCACCTCCTGCAAGA-3′142120T, 5′-CTGCTCCAAATGTGCCCAGGGCT-3′190R, 5′-TCACTTCAGGCACAGCACGT-3′261MKP-1S81478F, 5′-GCAGTGCTTACCATGCTTCC-3′66578T, 5′-ATATGCTCGACGCCTTGGGTATCACTGC-3′692R, 5′-AATTGGCCGAGACGTTGATC-3′742Prolyl 4-hydroxylase αX78949F, 5′-CTGTTCTGCCGCTACCATGA-3′991133T, 5′-CAAGCCTCGCATCATTCGTTTCCATG-3′1068R, 5′-CGATCTCAATCTCGGCATCTG-3′1123t-PAM23697F, 5′-CGTTGCCTGACCAGGGAATA-3′81120T, 5′-CTACAGAGCGACCTGCAGAGATGAACAGACTC-3′130R, 5′-TGGGACGTAGCCATGACTGA-3′200VEGFM32167F, 5′-GCAATGATGAAGCCCTGGAG-3′26178T, 5′-CACGTCGGAGAGCAACGTCACTATGC-3′289R, 5′-GGTGAGGTTTGATCCGCATG-3′338a AC, GenBank™accession number. Open table in a new tab Total and nuclear protein extracts were prepared from whole brain hemisphere tissue lysates after 3 h of hypoxia or 3 h of hypoxia followed by 24 h of re-oxygenation and controls (Fig. 1) as described previously (16Bernaudin M. Nedelec A.S. Divoux D. MacKenzie E.T. Petit E. Schumann-Bard P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Proteins (150 μg for total extracts and 75 μg for nuclear extracts) were heated at 100 °C for 3 min in the 2× loading buffer (EC-886, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels for 1 h at 150 V. The electrophoresis running buffer contained 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BA-S 85, Schleicher & Schuell) in blotting buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mmglycine, and 20% methanol (v/v)) for 2 h at 300 mA. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to verify equal protein loading and transfer. Membranes are blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies diluted in the blocking solution: mouse monoclonal antibodies for HIF-1α (2 μg/ml, OSA-601; StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), HIF-1β (1 μg/ml, NB 100–124; Novas Biologicals, Littleton, CO), and rabbit polyclonal antibody for HIF-2α (2.2 μg/ml, NB 100–122; Novas Biologicals Inc.). After washing with TBST (4 times, 15 min each), the blots were incubated 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:15,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) or peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) diluted in blocking solution and then washed again in TBST. The blots were developed using the chemiluminescence reagents (RPN 2106, Amersham Biosciences). The same blot was stripped (30 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris base, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and re-stained with a monoclonal β-actin antibody (5441, Sigma) as an internal control. HIF-1 is a heterodimer made of two protein subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β (28Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). Whereas HIF-1β is constitutively expressed, HIF-1α expression is tightly regulated by cellular oxygen concentration (29Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Thus HIF-1α determines HIF-1 DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity during hypoxia. As 3 h of hypoxia 8% O2 is known to induce expression of HIF-1α and its target genes in neonatal brain (13Bergeron M. Gidday J.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L. Ferriero D.M. Sharp F.R. Ann.

Immunological data indicate that both CD44 and TGF-β receptors are expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells and that CD44 is physically linked to the TGF-β receptor I (TGF-βRI) (and to a lesser extent to the TGF-β receptor II (TGF-βRII)) as a complex in vivo. Scatchard plot analyses and in vitro binding experiments show that the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 binds to TGF-βRI at a single site with high affinity (an apparent dissociation constant (K d) of ∼1.78 nm). These findings indicate that TGF-βRI contains a CD44-binding site. Furthermore, we have found that the binding of HA to CD44 in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulates TGF-βRI serine/threonine kinase activity which, in turn, increases Smad2/Smad3 phosphorylation and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) production (well known downstream effector functions of TGF-β signaling). Most importantly, TGF-βRI kinase activated by HA phosphorylates CD44, which enhances its binding interaction with the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin, leading to HA-mediated breast tumor cell migration. Overexpression of TGF-βRI by transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells with TGF-βRIcDNA stimulates formation of the CD44·TGF-βRI complex, the association of ankyrin with membranes, and HA-dependent/CD44-specific breast tumor migration. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that CD44 interaction with the TGF-βRI kinase promotes activation of multiple signaling pathways required for ankyrin-membrane interaction, tumor cell migration, and important oncogenic events (e.g.Smad2/Smad3 phosphorylation and PTH-rP production) during HA and TGF-β-mediated metastatic breast tumor progression.

In fact, the presence of a high level of various CD44 isoform (particularly CD44s (the standard form), CD44v3, and CD44v10) expression is emerging as an important metastatic tumor marker in a number of carcinomas and is also implicated in the unfavorable prognosis for a variety of cancers (7Sy M.S.

CD44 isoforms are also directly involved in the binding of cytoskeletal proteins such as ankyrin (14Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 15Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Deletion mutation analyses indicate that at least two sub-regions within the CD44 cytoplasmic domain contribute to the ankyrin binding: region I (e.g. the high affinity ankyrin-binding region) and region II (e.g. the regulatory region). In particular, the region I ankyrin-binding domain (e.g. NGGNGTVEDRKPSEL between amino acids 306 and 320 in the mouse CD44 (14Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J.

An ankyrin-binding domain of CD44 isoforms has also been shown as necessary for oncogenic signaling and tumor cell transformation (15Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil.

Moreover, certain ankyrin fragments (e.g. the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and/or the subdomain 2 (S2) of ARD)) have been identified as an ankyrin-binding region for both CD44 (16Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Tiam1 (17Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Chen Y.W. J.

Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations support the notion that CD44-ankyrin interaction is not only very important for presenting CD44 properly for hyaluronan binding but is also required for cytoskeleton activation during hyaluronan signaling.

Cheifetz S. Laiho M. Ralph D.A. Weis F.M.B. Zentella A. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 81-103PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β interacts with three surface receptors known as type I (TGF-βRI), type II (TGF-βRII), and type III (TGF-βIII) receptors (18Massague J. Annu. Rev.

TGF-β1 mediates its activity by high affinity binding to the type II (TGF-βII) receptor, which has been identified as a 70–80-kDa transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain (18Massague J.

For cellular signaling, the TGF-βRII requires both its kinase activity and association with members of a series of related 55-kDa TGF-βRIs (designated as activin receptor-like kinase-ALK (1–6 different subtypes)). Of these, only ALK5 has been shown to represent a functional TGF-βRI (18Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar, 19Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P.

Subsequently, the TGF-β signal is propagated from the plasma membranes (via TGF-βRII/TGF-βRI kinases) by phosphorylation of the Smad proteins that belong to a class of intracellular mediators known to regulate transcriptional responses and gene expression in the nucleus (24Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 25Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shi Y. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The type III receptor (TGF-βRIII) also binds TGF-β and may function in capturing TGF-β for presentation to the signaling receptors (27Lopez-Casilla F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 758-795Google Scholar, 28Wang X.-F. Lin H.Y., Ng- Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A.

Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, defective ligand binding to the cell surface caused by the absence of TGF-βRII, or expression of a truncated form or splice variant of TGF-βRII, may account for the resistance to activated TGF-β in cancer cells (30Kalkhoven E.

Werkmeister J.R. Capen C.C. Rosol T.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2424-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PTH-rP shares many, but not all, properties of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Both of these hormones share homology in 8 of the first 13 amino acids and bind to the type 1 PTH receptor (38Goltzman D. Henderson J.E. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A.

PTH-rP, like PTH, is a potent activator of bone resorption but unlike PTH does not appear to stimulate bone formation (38Goltzman D. Henderson J.E. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A.

Thus, cells expressing PTH-rP in bone are likely to gain a foothold thereby stimulating the removal of the calcified matrix (38Goltzman D. Henderson J.E. Bilezekian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A.

However, buried within the matrix of bone are high concentrations of certain cytokines (e.g. TGF-β) that can feed back on the metastases to promote their tumor growth (33Oft M. Heider K.-H. Beug H.

Mice inoculated with breast tumor cells (e.g. MDA-MB-231 cells) engineered to express a dominant-negative form of the TGF-β receptor had fewer and smaller osteolytic metastases (35Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 36Yoneda T. Williams P.J.

Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: S139Google Scholar). The net result in this situation is that PTH-rP production by breast cancers increases metastasis of breast cancer to bone. Because both CD44 and TGF-β-mediated signaling events are important in breast tumor progression, the question of whether the interaction between CD44 and TGF-β receptor(s) plays a significant role in regulating metastatic breast tumor cell-specific behaviors (e.g. Smad activation, PTH-rP production, membrane-cytoskeleton interaction, and tumor cell migration) is the primary focus of this study. The breast tumor cell line (MDA-MB-231 cells) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with Earle's salt solution, essential and non-essential amino acids, vitamins, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Monoclonal rat anti-human CD44 antibody (Clone, 020; isotype, IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., San Francisco) used in this study recognizes a common determinant of the CD44 class of glycoproteins. For the preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody, specific synthetic peptides (∼15–17 amino acids unique for the v3 sequence of CD44) were prepared, respectively, by the Peptide Laboratories using an Advanced Chemtech automatic synthesizer (model ACT350). All CD44 antibodies were prepared using conventional DEAE-cellulose chromatography and tested to be monospecific (by immunoblot assays). Mouse monoclonal anti-ankyrin was prepared as described previously (42Bourguignon L.Y.W. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal mouse anti-HA1 (hemagglutinin epitope) antibody (clone 12 CA5) and rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 (Ser-465/467)/Smad3 IgG were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Both rabbit anti-TGF-βRI IgG (specific for the ALK-5 form of TGF-βRI p55) and rabbit anti-TGF-βRII IgG (specific for TGF-βRII p70) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-phosphothreonine antibody and rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The cytoplasmic domain of human CD44 (CD44cyt) was cloned into pFLAG-AST using the PCR-based cloning strategy. By using human CD44 cDNA as template, one PCR primer pair (left, FLAG-EcoRI; right, FLAG-XbaI) was designed to amplify complete CD44 cytoplasmic domain. The amplified DNA fragments were one-step cloned into a pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. Then the DNA fragments were cut out by double digestion withEcoRI and XbaI and subcloned intoEcoRI/XbaI double-digested pFLAG-AST (Eastman Kodak Co.) to generate FLAG-pCD44cyt construct. The nucleotide sequence of FLAG/CD44cyt junction was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were transformed to BL21-DE3 to produce FLAG-CD44cyt fusion protein. The FLAG-CD44cyt fusion protein was further purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel column (Kodak). The nucleotide sequence of primers used in this cloning protocol is as follows: FLAG-EcoRI, 5′-GAGAATTCGAACAGTCGAAGAAGGTGTCTCTTAAGC-3′; FLAG-XbaI, 5′-AGCTCTAGATTACACCCCAATCTTCAT-3′. The cDNA encoding human TGF-βRI (full-length) (43Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter and preceded by the hemagglutinin epitope (HA1) tag in the expression vector pCGN-Bam, which contains the hygromycin-resistant gene as a selection marker. To establish a transient expression system, cultured cells (e.g. MDA-MB-231 cells or COS-7 cells) were transfected with two plasmid DNAs (e.g. HA1-tagged TGF-βRIcDNA or vector alone) using LipofectAMINE 2000. These transfectants were then analyzed for their protein expression (e.g. TGF-βRI-related proteins) by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot, TGF-βRI kinase activity, TGF-βRI interaction with CD44 and ankyrin, as well as breast tumor cell migration assays as described below. Unlabeled MDA-MB-231 cells (or surface-biotinylated) were solubilized in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The sample was then centrifuged at 14,927 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 5 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Separated polypeptides were then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. After blocking nonspecific sites with 2% bovine serum albumin, the nitrocellulose filters were incubated with each of the specific immuno-reagents (e.g.rat anti-CD44 IgG (5 μg/ml), rabbit anti-CD44v3 IgG (5 μg/ml), rabbit anti-TGF-βRI IgG (5 μg/ml), and rabbit anti-TGF-βRII IgG (5 μg/ml)) followed by incubating with horseradish peroxidase-labeled immunoreagents (e.g.goat anti-rat IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG, or goat anti-mouse IgG) or ExtrAvidin peroxidase (to detect surface-biotinylated proteins). The blots were then developed by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For analyzing the complex formation between endogenous TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, or ankyrin into CD44v3 complex, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with various reagents (e.g. HA (50 μg/ml; Sigma) or TGF-β1 (50 ng/ml; R & D Systems) or pre-treated with anti-CD44 antibody followed by HA (50 μg/ml) or TGF-β1 (50 ng/ml) treatment or without any treatment) were solubilized by 1.0% Nonidet P-40 and immunoprecipitated with rat anti-CD44 antibody followed by anti-TGF-βRI (or anti-TGF-βRII or anti-ankyrin)-mediated immunoblot, or anti-phosphoserine/anti-phosphothreonine-mediated immunoblot, or immunoprecipitated with anti-TGF-βRI antibody followed by anti-CD44-mediated immunoblot or anti-phosphoserine/anti-phosphothreonine-mediated immunoblot, respectively. In some experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells (e.g.untransfected or transfected with HA1-tagged TGF-βRIcDNA or vector only) (either treated with HA (50 μg/ml) or TGF-β1 (50 ng/ml) or without any treatment) were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-CD44v3 IgG followed by immunoblotting with rat anti-CD44 (or mouse anti-HA1 (hemagglutinin epitope) IgG or mouse anti-ankyrin IgG) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (or goat anti-mouse IgG) (1:10,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. In some experiments, Nonidet P-40-solubilized cell lysate (isolated from cells treated with HA (50 μg/ml) or TGF-β1 (50 ng/ml) or pre-treated with anti-CD44 antibody followed by HA (50 μg/ml) or TGF-β1 (50 ng/ml) treatment or without any treatment) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 (50 μg/ml) or immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad3 followed by anti-phosphothreonine, anti-phosphoserine, and anti-Smad3-mediated immunoblot, respectively. These blots were then treated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and ECL chemiluminescence reagent. Aliquots (0.5–1 ng of protein) of HA1-tagged TGF-βRI (isolated from COS-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells)-conjugated Sepharose beads were incubated in 0.5 ml of"

Hrh1 -/- mice are protected from VAASH, which can be restored by genetic complementation with a susceptible Bphs/Hrh1 allele, and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and autoimmune orchitis due to immune deviation.

We found that caffeine inhibits the in vitro lipid kinase of class I PI3Ks (IC50 = 75 μm for p110δ, 400 μm for p110α and p110β, and 1 mm for p110γ), and theophylline has similar effects (IC50 = 75 μm for p110δ, 300 μm for p110α, and 800 μm for p110β and p110γ) and also inhibits the α isoform of class II PI3K (PI3K-C2α) (IC50 ≈ 400 μm). However, four other xanthine derivatives tested (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 3-propylxanthine, alloxazine, and PD116948 (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine)) were an order of magnitude less effective. Surprisingly the triazoloquinazoline CGS15943 (9-chloro-2-(2-furyl)(1,2,d)triazolo(1,5-c)quinazolin-5-amine) also selectively inhibits p110δ (IC50 < 10 μm). Caffeine and theophylline also inhibit the intrinsic protein kinase activity of the class IA PI3Ks and DNA-dependent protein kinase, although with a much lower potency than that for the lipid kinase (IC50 ≈ 10 mm for p110α , 3 mm for p110β, and 10 mm for DNA-dependent protein kinase). In CHO-IR cells and rat soleus muscle, theophylline and caffeine block the ability of insulin to stimulate protein kinase B with IC50 values similar to those for inhibition of PI3K activity, whereas insulin stimulation of ERK1 or ERK2 was not inhibited at concentrations up to 10 mm. Theophylline and caffeine also blocked insulin stimulation of glucose transport in CHO-IR cells. These results demonstrate that these methylxanthines are direct inhibitors of PI3K lipid kinase activity but are distinctly less effective against serine kinase activity and thus could be of potential use in dissecting these two distinct kinase activities. Theophylline, caffeine, and CGS15943 may be of particular use in dissecting the specific role of the p110δ lipid kinase.

Several mechanisms of action have been identified for these methylxanthines, and these can explain some of the pleiotropic effects these compounds have on cells at their physiologically achievable concentrations. These include their abilities to directly inhibit phosphodiesterases and thus increase cellular cAMP levels, to directly antagonize adenosine receptors, and to cause increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels (11Daly J.W. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 81: 44-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). While often overlooked, it has been known for more than 25 years that these methylxanthines also have inhibitory effects on phosphoinositide metabolism (12Buckley J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 498: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Honeyman T.W. Strohsnitter W. Scheid C.R. Schimmel R.J. Biochem.

Exp. Mol. Path. 1990; 53: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although the molecular basis of this effect has not been established. In particular, nothing is known about the role of methylxanthines in regulating phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. PI3Ks1 are a family of enzymes that phosphorylate the D3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, and these enzyme activities are essential in a wide range of cellular processes (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 17Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 18Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). The PI3Ks are subdivided into four classes (IA, IB, II, and III) that possess lipid kinase activity. The class I enzymes are thought to largely produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in vivo, which triggers signaling pathways via pleckstrin homology domain-containing molecules, whereas the class III enzymes exclusively produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which regulates vesicle trafficking via proteins containing FYVE finger domains (19Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The in vivo lipid product of the class II enzymes remains to be defined, but in vitro it is capable of producing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate. Class IA PI3Ks also have a protein kinase activity that has been reported to phosphorylate exogenous substrates including insulin receptor substrate 1 (20Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphodiesterase 3b (21Rondinone C.M. Carvalho E. Rahn T. Manganiello V.C. Degerman E. Smith U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10093-10098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The best established function of this class IA protein kinase activity is an autoregulatory role involving phosphorylation of Ser608 of the p85α adapter subunit, which in turn inhibits the lipid kinase activity of the catalytic subunit (22Beeton C.A. Chance E.M. Foukas L.C. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O.

Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). There is little autophosphorylation on p110α itself, but with p110β, the opposite is observed (it has a greater tendency to autophosphorylate itself, with less phosphorylation of p85). A number of PI3K-related kinases have been identified. These share a high degree of homology in the kinase domain with the lipid kinases, but they only act as protein kinases. Enzymes in the latter group include DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 17Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem.

Recent studies have found that caffeine inhibits ATM (IC50 = 0.2 mm), ATR (IC50 = 1.1 mm), and mTOR (IC50 = 0.4 mm), although DNA-PK is relatively resistant, with an IC50 of ∼10 mm (25Sarkaria J.N.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that 5 mm theophylline inhibits the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (27Scott P.H. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34496-34501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, there have been no studies on the effect of the methylxanthines on members of the PI3K family capable of lipid kinase activity. We have studied this possibility and found that whereas some methylxanthines do not inhibit PI3K activity until millimolar concentrations are used, caffeine and theophylline inhibit the lipid kinase activity of PI3K, particularly that of p110δ, at concentrations that are within the pharmacological and physiological range. Polyclonal anti-p85 antibody, raised against the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain, was provided by Prof. Kenneth Siddle (University of Cambridge). PI3K-C2α antibodies were raised to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 2–337 of the human PI3K-C2α sequence. Purified DNA-PK was from Promega. Recombinant protein kinase CK2 and recombinant 4EBP1 (PHAS-I) were from Calbiochem. Phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-Akt (Thr308), phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) E10, Akt, and p42/44 MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Recombinant baculoviruses were provided by Prof. M. D. Waterfield (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University College London, London, UK). All other chemicals, including xanthine derivatives, were obtained from Sigma, and they were of the highest grade available. Recombinant p110γ was the gift of Dr. Roger Williams. Recombinant p85α/p110α, p85α/p110β, and p85α/p110δ heterodimers were expressed in baculovirally infected Sf9 insect cells and purified using an affinity matrix prepared by coupling the phosphopeptide YpVPMLG (Yp = phosphotyrosine), corresponding to the Tyr751 of human platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, to Actigel ALD (Sterogene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed using Actigel-bound p85α/p110 complexes. For experiments on PI3K expressed in mammalian cells, CHO-IR cells were serum-starved for 16 h before insulin stimulation and then treated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 ng/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Immunoprecipitations were performed from the Triton-soluble fraction using the indicated antibodies diluted 1:100. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-agarose beads, washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by three washes with kinase assay buffer, and then processed for lipid kinase assays. Preparation, incubation, and protein extraction of rat soleus muscles were performed as described previously (28Soos M.A. Jensen J. Brown R.A. O'Rahilly S. Shepherd P.R. Whitehead J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting using the phosphospecific antibodies was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Visualization was performed with ECL. Images were analyzed with a Fuji LAS-1000 Luminescent Image Analyzer and Fuji Image Gauge software. PI3K autophosphorylation assays were performed as described previously (22Beeton C.A. Chance E.M. Foukas L.C. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,23Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). For protein kinase CK2 assays, 2 units of recombinant CK2 were used per assay. For DNA-PK assay, 2 units of purified DNA-PK and 500 ng of linearized double-stranded plasmid DNA were used per assay. Kinase assays were performed in a buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. 1 μg of recombinant 4EBP1 was used as a substrate. Reactions were initiated by adding a mix of ATP (final concentration of 100 μm plus 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/assay) and MgCl2/MnCl2 (final concentration, 10 mm each), incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, and terminated by the addition of 4× electrophoresis sample buffer. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. PI3K lipid kinase assays were performed in a total volume of 50 μl in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 100 μm ATP (plus 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/assay) using 200 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol as a substrate. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1m HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The mixture was vortexed, and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The aqueous phase was discarded, and the lower organic phase was washed with 80 μl of methanol:1 m HCl (1:1). After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was again discarded, and the lower organic phase was evaporated to dryness. Reaction products were resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform:methanol (4:1) and spotted onto thin layer Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) pretreated with 1% oxalic acid and 1 mmEDTA in water:methanol (6:4). TLC plates were developed in chloroform:methanol:4 m ammonia (9:7:4). Images of radiolabeled protein and lipid products were analyzed using a Fuji FLA-2000 phosphorimager and Fuji Image Gauge software. CHO-IR cells were starved overnight on plain Ham's F-12. The cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of either caffeine or theophylline in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer with bovine serum albumin at pH 7.4 (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. After 20 min of stimulation, the assay was initiated by adding 100 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose containing 0.5 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose and stopped 10 min later by washing the cells three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then solubilized in 0.05% SDS, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. To test our hypothesis that methylxanthines may inhibit PI3K lipid kinase activity, we prepared recombinant class I PI3K heterodimers (p85α/p110α, p85α/p110β, and p85α/p110δ) and monomeric p110γ using baculoviral expression in Sf9 cells as described previously (22Beeton C.A. Chance E.M. Foukas L.C. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The PI3Ks were subjected to in vitrokinase assays in the absence or presence of various concentrations of caffeine and theophylline, using [γ-32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol as the substrates. We found that all four class I PI3Ks are sensitive to caffeine (IC50 = 75 μmfor p110δ, 400 μm for p110α and p110β, and 1 mm for p110γ) and theophylline (IC50 = 75 μm for p110δ, 300 μm for p110α, and 800 μm for p110β and p110γ) (Fig.1). To look at the effect of these compounds on endogenous PI3K activities, the effects of caffeine and theophylline were tested on lipid kinase activity in class IA PI3K p85 adapter subunit and PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates from CHO-IR cells. Both caffeine and theophylline inhibited PI3K activity in these immunoprecipitates with a similar potency (Fig. 2). We next wanted to investigate whether the core structure of the xanthines could be useful in deriving more potent and potentially isoform-specific inhibitors of PI3K. None of the four other xanthine derivatives used (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, alloxazine, PD116948, and 3-propylxanthine) were as effective as caffeine and theophylline, showing that there is specificity in the inhibitory effect of methylxanthines toward PI3K (Table I). However, surprisingly, CGS15943, a triazoloquinazoline compound somewhat distantly related to the xanthines, inhibits p110δ in vitro with an IC50 of <10 μm and also inhibits p110α and p110β, albeit with an IC50 in excess of 100 μm. Although this compound has also been described as an inhibitor of the human adenosine A3 receptor (30Kim Y., Ji, X. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4142-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), it does suggest that this compound could be useful in dissecting the specific role of p110δ in cells and in developing even more potent PI3K inhibitors.Table IEffect of various compounds on P13K activity1-aExpressed as a percentage of control.Compoundp110αp110βp110δ0.1 mm1-bConcentration of compound.1 mm0.1 mm1 mm0.1 mm1 mmIBMX97.359.2174.9116.4104.767.5Alloxazine77.975.7191.4142.2n.d.1-cn.d., not determined.n.d.CGS1594348.235.7164.9116.910.46.7PD116948106.771118.971.1n.d.n.d.3-Propyl-xanthine109.9109102.373.1n.d.n.d.The effect of various compounds with structural and functional similarities to methylxanthines on the lipid kinase activity of recombinant PI3K was examined.

Open table in a new tab The effect of various compounds with structural and functional similarities to methylxanthines on the lipid kinase activity of recombinant PI3K was examined.

The reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography. Previous studies have shown that caffeine inhibits the protein kinase activity of the PI3K-related kinases mammalian target of rapamycin, ATM, and ATM- and Rad3-related kinase with a potency similar to that with which it inhibits the lipid kinase activity of the class IA and class II PI3Ks. Therefore, we have investigated whether the protein kinase activity of the class IA PI3Ks is also inhibited by theophylline. We found that the serine kinase activities of p110α and p110β are both inhibited by theophylline, but with a significantly lower potency compared with that observed for the lipid kinase activities (Fig. 3 A). There is also a clear difference in the effect of theophylline on the serine kinase activities of the two class IA isoforms, with p110β autophosphorylation being more sensitive to inhibition (IC50 ≈ 3 mm) than the p110α-mediated phosphorylation of p85α (IC50 ≈ 10 mm) (Fig. 3 A). The fact that there is differential inhibition of the protein and lipid kinases suggests that the mechanism by which the methylxanthines inhibit PI3Ks is likely to differ from that used by the classical PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. We also found that theophylline and caffeine inhibit DNA-PK, but with an IC50of >3 mm. Other PI3K inhibitors have been described as having direct inhibitory effects on some protein kinases. Therefore, the effect of methylxanthines on other protein kinases was also investigated. The ability of insulin to stimulate phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was not inhibited by theophylline at concentrations as high as 10 mm (Fig. 4 A). The protein kinase CK2 is known to be potently inhibited by another PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (31Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), but we found that concentrations of caffeine or theophylline as high as 5 mm had no effect on CK2 activity (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that these methylxanthines are not promiscuous inhibitors of protein kinases. Our findings suggested that the physiological actions of PI3K may be mediated in part by their ability to inhibit PI3K. Activation of PKB/Akt is a very convenient physiological read-out of the activation of the PI3K pathway. PKB is activated by phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation segment and Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif. Phosphorylation of Thr308 is carried out by PDK1, whereas Ser473 is phosphorylated by a distinct yet unidentified kinase termed PDK2 (32Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Full activation of the enzyme requires phosphorylation of both sites, and the molecular mechanism was demonstrated recently by analysis of the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated and Thr308-phosphorylated states of the PKB kinase domain (33Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the effect of caffeine and theophylline on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr308 was found to be inhibited by both caffeine and theophylline (Fig.5 A), and this could correlate with impaired PDK1 activation caused by PI3K inhibition. Ser473 phosphorylation was also inhibited with the same potency as Thr308 by both caffeine and theophylline (Fig.5 B). Both the theophylline and caffeine treatment of CHO-IR cells resulted in strong inhibition of insulin-stimulated PKB Ser473 phosphorylation, with 50% inhibition occurring at 0.5 mm for theophylline and 1 mm for caffeine in CHO-IR cells (Fig. 5 C). The inhibitory effect on PKB activation is not restricted to cell culture models because insulin stimulation of Ser473 PKB phosphorylation was inhibited by theophylline and caffeine in intact rat soleus muscle with even higher potency than that seen in CHO-IR cells, i.e. with an IC50 in the vicinity of 0.1 mm (Fig.6). Insulin stimulation of glucose transport is another cellular process requiring activation of PI3K (17Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), and we found that both caffeine and theophylline block insulin-stimulated glucose transport in CHO-IR cells (Fig.7). However, the inhibitory effects on glucose transport require a higher concentration of theophylline and caffeine than that required for inhibition of PKB activation.Figure 6Both caffeine and theophylline inhibit PKB activation by insulin in soleus muscle. A andB, soleus muscles from rats were treated with various concentrations of either caffeine or theophylline for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a 30-min stimulation with 70 nminsulin. Subsequently, the muscles were homogenized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a phosphorylation state-specific antibody against Ser473 of Akt.

This finding is of direct physiological relevance because methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline are found in a variety of foodstuffs and beverages and have also been widely used as pharmacological agents. Concentrations of the methylxanthines reach relatively high levels in the circulation before their effects are manifest. Caffeine concentrations can reach 50–100 μm in humans, whereas in the case of theophylline, an effective pharmacological concentration in humans is around 100 μm,and concentrations can reach 500 μm before being highly toxic (2Weinberger M. Hendeles L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 7Greer F. Hudson R. Ross R. Graham T. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Daly J.W. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 81: 44-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, these agents have also been used extensively as experimental reagents for in vitroexperiments on cells and tissues. Therefore, there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the mechanisms by which these agents are exerting their effects in this micromolar concentration range. The most potent effect described for methylxanthines is the ability to antagonize adenosine receptors because the K i for this effect is in the low micromolar range (11Daly J.W. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 81: 44-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Inhibition of phosphodiesterases and regulation of calcium metabolism are two other properties widely implicated in the effects of caffeine and theophylline. However, the inhibitory effects of methylxanthines on phosphodiesterases have an IC50 in the high micromolar range, whereas the effects on calcium metabolism have an IC50 in the low millimolar range (11Daly J.W. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 81: 44-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This means that the inhibitory effects of caffeine and theophylline on PI3Ks described here are at least as potent as the effects on phosphodiesterases and ryanodine receptors, and the effect on p110δ is in the same range as the antagonistic effect on adenosine receptors. Therefore, the results of the current study suggest that inhibition of PI3K is likely to contribute to the effects of the methylxanthines observed at physiological concentrations. For example, inhibition of PI3K would be expected to block insulin-mediated glucose metabolism (17Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), and a severely insulin-resistant state has been found in cases of pharmacological toxicity of theophylline (2Weinberger M. Hendeles L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PI3K by methylxanthines could have beneficial therapeutic effects in at least three scenarios. Firstly, it has been reported that knockout of class IB PI3K activity reduces ADP-induced platelet aggregation (34Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montruchchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), indicating that inhibition of PI3K may be useful in treating thrombosis. Secondly, caffeine has been reported to sensitize cells to apoptosis, and theophylline has been described to promote apoptosis (9Yasui K. Komiyama A. Int. J. Hematol. 2001; 73: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Basu S. Mitra R. Haematologia. 2000; 30: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C.

In part, the proapoptotic effects are likely to work through inhibition of ATM- and Rad3-related kinase and ATM (25Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

However, our finding that methylxanthines also inhibit class IA PI3Ks with a similar potency identifies a mechanism that could act directly to increase the rate of apoptosis because class IA PI3Ks play an important role in preventing apoptosis (19Vanhaesebroeck B.

In this context, promiscuous inhibitors affecting PI3K, ATM, and ATM- and Rad3-related kinase could be useful in treating cancer (35Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Finally, the p110δ isoform of class IA PI3Ks is found in a limited subpopulation of cells such as leukocytes and melanoma cells (36Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and a specific inhibitor of this isoform might prevent inflammation or cell migration (37Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, long-term inhibition of p110δ is likely to be undesirable because animals in which the p110δ gene is deleted show reduced B- and T-cell function and also develop inflammatory bowel disease (38Okkenhaug K. Bilancio A. Farjot G. Priddle H. Sancho S. Peskett E. Pearce W. Meek S.E. Salpekar A. Waterfield M.D. Smith A.J.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Science. 2002; 297: 1031-1034PubMed Google Scholar). There are currently only a limited number of suitably specific inhibitors available for the study of PI3K, and these are lacking in isoform selectivity. Isoform-selective inhibitors are useful in a range of ways. For example, these would allow quantitation of the relative contribution of the different class IA isoforms in signaling complexes and dissection of the role of the different isoforms in particular cellular processes, and ultimately, once the role of different isoforms is clearly understood, isoform-selective inhibitors are likely to be of use as therapeutic agents for treating diseases such as cancer and thrombosis. Two PI3K inhibitors have been widely used: LY294002, derived from quercetin (39Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the fungal metabolite wortmannin (40Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). These are relatively specific inhibitors of lipid kinase because in a test of a panel of over 25 protein kinases, wortmannin only cross-reacted with smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase at concentrations required to inhibit PI3K, whereas LY294002 shows some inhibition of protein kinase CK2 and glycogen synthase kinase-3 at low doses (31Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). However, LY294002 and wortmannin in general lack selectivity against different classes and/or isoforms of PI3K, with only the α isoform of the class II PI3K being resistant to wortmannin and LY294002 (41Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 42Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This means that methylxanthines may be of use due to the fact that compared with traditional PI3K inhibitors, the methylxanthines differ in their inhibitory profile toward different classes of PI3K. For example, it is notable that the α isoform of the class II PI3K and class IA PI3Ks are inhibited by theophylline and caffeine at similar concentrations. Furthermore, DNA-PK is relatively resistant to inhibition by these methylxanthines, whereas the class IA PI3Ks and DNA-PK are similarly sensitive to inhibition by classical class IA PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin (43Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, caffeine, theophylline and, in particular, CGS15943 show selectivity toward p110δ. It was reported previously that p110α, p110β, and p110δ are all equally sensitive to wortmannin and LY294002 (36Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), so the methylxanthines are likely to be of use in dissecting the role of p110δ in the limited range of cell types (e.g. leukocytes) in which it is expressed (36Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Finally, the protein kinase activities of class IA PI3K are less sensitive than the lipid kinase activity to inhibition by caffeine and theophylline. Therefore the differential inhibitory properties of the methylxanthines are likely to be of use in ongoing studies to define the roles of the different PI3K family members. Our results also indicate that inhibition of PI3K is not a general property of all xanthines or all molecules containing the purine ring because at least four other xanthines tested were significantly less effective at inhibiting PI3K, and it is known that adenosine has little effect on PI3K activity, although it does potently inhibit some forms of phosphoinositide 4-kinase (44Stephens L. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Jackson T. Volinia S. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects of caffeine and theophylline on systems, including the antagonistic effects on adenosine receptors, inhibition of phosphodiesterases, and stimulation of calcium mobilization, mean that it is more difficult to prove that these compounds are acting to inhibit PI3Ks in vivo. However, our findings that both theophylline and caffeine block insulin-induced activation of PKB and glucose uptake at concentrations similar to those required to inhibit PI3K in vitro provide strong evidence that these methylxanthines are able to inhibit PI3K in cells at physiologically relevant concentrations. It seems unlikely that that these effects are mediated by the other known activities of these compounds. For example, the effect of methylxanthines to raise intracellular calcium levels, as seen most dramatically in muscle (1Youn J.H. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C555-C561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), would actually increase glucose transport rather than inhibiting it and in fact may explain why stimulation of glucose transport is slightly less sensitive to attenuation by the methylxanthines in our experiments. Methylxanthines also inhibit phosphodiesterases, causing a rise in cAMP, but it has previously been shown that such a rise would not inhibit insulin stimulation of PKB or glucose transport (27Scott P.H. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34496-34501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in adipocytes, the concentrations of theophylline required to inhibit glucose transport differ significantly from the concentrations required to stimulate the cAMP-mediated increase in lipolysis via increases in cAMP (3Joost H.G. Steinfelder H.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 57: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Finally, the effect of methylxanthines to antagonize adenosine actions could potentially have effects on insulin signaling because adenosine can potentiate insulin-induced activation of PKB and stimulation of glucose transport in a range of tissues (45Han D. Hansen P.A. Nolte L.A. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 46Takasuga S. Katada T., Ui, M. Hazeki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19545-19550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of glucose transport by theophylline is not fully mimicked by the 8-phenyltheophylline, which is a pure adenosine receptor antagonist (6Steinfelder H.J. Petho-Schramm S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1154-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin still stimulates PKB and glucose transport in the absence of adenosine (45Han D. Hansen P.A. Nolte L.A. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 46Takasuga S. Katada T., Ui, M. Hazeki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19545-19550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), so the adenosine receptor antagonism could only explain part of the inhibitory effects of theophylline and caffeine on insulin stimulation of cellular events. In conclusion, we find that caffeine and theophylline inhibit both class I and class II PI3Ks, with the most potent effects seen against p110δ. The finding that these methylxanthines are less effective against the protein kinase activity of the class IA PI3Ks provides a novel mechanism for dissecting the roles of the protein and lipid kinase activities of these enzymes. The finding that the inhibitory effects of theophylline are within a physiologically achievable concentration range suggests that methylxanthines or more potent derivatives of them could be used to treat conditions such as inflammation, cancer, and thrombosis in which suppression of PI3K would be predicted to have therapeutic benefit, but long-term administration may also contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease. We thank Ada Ingvaldsen and Jorid T. Stuenæs for technical assistance, Prof. M. Waterfield for providing class IA PI3K vectors and antibodies to class II PI3K, Dr. Roger Williams for providing p110γ, and Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2061848287,"BRCA1 mutation carriers have an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Excision of exon 11 of Brca1 in the mouse, using a conditional knockout (Cre-loxP) approach, results in mammary tumor formation after long latency. To characterize the genomic instability observed in these tumors, to establish a comparative map of chromosomal imbalances and to contribute to the validation of this mouse model of breast cancer, we have characterized chromosomal imbalances and aberrations using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and spectral karyotyping (SKY). We found that all tumors exhibit chromosome instability as evidenced by structural chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy, yet they display a pattern of chromosomal gain and loss that is similar to the pattern in human breast carcinomas. Of note, nine of 15 tumors exhibited a gain of distal chromosome 11, a region that is orthologous to human chromosome 17q11-qter, the mapping position of Erbb2. However, our analysis suggests that genes distal to Erbb2 are the main targets of amplification. Four of the tumors also exhibited a copy number loss of proximal chromosome 11 (11A-B), a region orthologous to human 17p. In eight of the tumors we observed whole or partial gain of chromosome 15 centering on 15D2-D3 (orthologous to human chromosome 8q24), the map location of the c-Myc gene, and six of the tumors exhibited copy number loss of whole or partial chromosome 14, including 14D3, the map location of Rb1. We conclude that despite the tremendous shuffling of chromosomes during the course of mammalian evolution, the pattern of genomic imbalances is conserved between BRCA1-associated mammary gland tumors in mice and humans. Western blot analysis showed that while p53 is absent or mutated in some tumors, at least two tumors revealed wild-type protein, suggesting that other genetic events may lead to tumorigenesis. Similar to BRCA1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the tumor cells contained supernumerary functional centrosomes with intact centrioles whose presence results in multipolar mitoses and aneuploidy."

We observe that already in the second excited state of the O-H stretch vibration, the hydrogen atom becomes delocalized between the oxygen atoms of two neighboring water molecules. The energy required for this delocalization is unexpectedly low and corresponds to less than 20% of the dissociation energy of the O-H bond of the water molecule in the gas phase."
https://openalex.org/W2023066846,"The c-myc proto-oncogene can direct a diverse array of biological activities, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation. It is believed that Myc can affect this wide variety of activities by functioning as a regulator of gene transcription, although few targets have been identified to date. To delineate the molecular program regulated downstream of Myc, we used a cDNA microarray approach and identified 52 putative targets out of >6000 cDNAs analyzed. To further distinguish the subset of genes whose regulation was dependent upon Myc per se from those regulated in response to activation of general mitogenic or apoptotic programs, the putative cDNA targets were then screened by a series of assays. By this approach 37 putative targets were ruled out and 15 Myc target genes were uncovered. Interestingly, comparing our results with other high throughput screens reveals that certain putative Myc targets previously reported are shown not to be regulated downstream of Myc (e.g. ribosomal proteins, HSP90β), whereas others are further supported by our analyses (e.g. pdgfβr, nucleolin). The identity of genes specifically regulated downstream of Myc provides the critical tools required to understand the role Myc holds in the transformation process and to delineate how Myc functions as a regulator of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2054846759,"Overexpression of cathepsin-D in primary breast cancer has been associated with rapid development of clinical metastasis. To investigate the role of this protease in breast cancer growth and progression to metastasis, we stably transfected a highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, with a plasmid containing either the full-length cDNA for cathepsin-D or a 535 bp antisense cathepsin-D cDNA fragment. Clones expressing antisense cathepsin-D cDNA that exhibited a 70–80% reduction in cathepsin-D protein, both intra- and extracellularly compared to controls, were selected for further experiments. These antisense-transfected cells displayed a reduced outgrowth rate when embedded in a Matrigel matrix, formed smaller colonies in soft agar and presented a significantly decreased tumor growth and experimental lung metastasis in nude mice compared with controls. However, manipulating the cathepsin-D level in the antisense cells has no effect on their in vitro invasiveness. These studies demonstrate that cathepsin-D enhances anchorage-independent cell proliferation and subsequently facilitates tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Our overall results provide the first evidence on the essential role of cathepsin-D in breast cancer, and support the development of a new cathepsin-D-targeted therapy."

Because the carriers comprise a small fraction of the total charge density and may be rapidly fluctuating, modulations are difficult to detect directly. We demonstrate that in anomalous x-ray scattering at the oxygen K edge of the cuprates, the contribution of carriers to the scattering amplitude is selectively magnified 82 times. This enhances diffraction from the doped holes by more than 10(3), permitting direct structural analysis of the superconducting ground state. Scattering from thin films of La2CuO4+delta (superconducting transition temperature = 39 K) at temperature = 50 +/- 5 kelvin on the reciprocal space intervals (0,0,0.21) --> (0,0,1.21) and (0,0,0.6) --> (0.3,0,0.6) shows a rounding of the carrier density near the substrate suggestive of a depletion zone or similar effect. The structure factor for off-specular scattering was less than 3 x 10(-7) electrons, suggesting an absence of in-plane hole ordering in this material."

We have previously shown that nuclear accumulation of NFATc3 is induced in ileal smooth muscle by platelet-derived growth factor in a manner that depends on Ca2+ influx through L-type, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Here we show that NFATc3 is also the predominant NFAT isoform expressed in cerebral artery smooth muscle and is induced to accumulate in the nucleus by UTP and other Gq/11-coupled receptor agonists. This induction is mediated by calcineurin and is dependent on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and extracellular Ca2+ influx through L-type, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Consistent with results obtained in ileal smooth muscle, depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx fails to induce NFAT nuclear accumulation in cerebral arteries. We also provide evidence that Ca2+release by ryanodine receptors in the form of Ca2+ sparks may exert an inhibitory influence on UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation and further suggest that UTP may act, in part, by inhibiting Ca2+ sparks. These results are consistent with a multifactorial regulation of NFAT nuclear accumulation in smooth muscle that is likely to involve several intracellular signaling pathways, including local effects of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+release and effects attributable to global elevations in intracellular Ca2+.

NFAT represents a family of transcription factors composed of four well characterized members, designated NFATc1 (NFAT2/c), NFATc2 (NFAT1/p), NFATc3 (NFAT4/x), and NFATc4 (NFAT3). A fifth putative member of the family (NFAT5) is a calcineurin-insensitive, constitutively nuclear phosphoprotein that has limited sequence similarity to other members of the NFAT family (13Lopez-Rodriguez C.

In the nucleus, NFAT associates with a transcriptional co-activator, an interaction that is required for significant NFAT-mediated transcriptional activity. NFAT family members have been shown to cooperatively bind to DNA with variety of cofactors, including AP-1 (24Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A.

A sustained, global increase in intracellular Ca2+ has generally been considered a defining feature of NFAT-activating stimuli (35Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A., Ho, S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R.

More recent evidence has shown that temporal modulation of Ca2+ signals in the form of Ca2+ oscillations or waves increases the coupling efficiency of Ca2+ signals to NFAT activation in nonexcitable cells (39Li W. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 40Dolmetsch R.E., Xu, K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ induced by a depolarizing stimulus and mediated by flux through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC), have also been shown to effectively stimulate a sustained increase in NFAT activity in hippocampal neurons (3Graef I.A.

In contrast, and counter to expectations, sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+induced by depolarization fail to induce nuclear accumulation of the NFATc3 isoform in ileal smooth muscle, although PDGF, which activates multiple intracellular pathways, is a potent stimulus for NFATc3 nuclear translocation in this tissue (10Stevenson A.S. Gomez M.F. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15018-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle exhibits a diverse array of Ca2+ signals, including Ca2+ waves that traverse the length of the cell and display distinctive frequency and amplitude properties (41Jaggar J.H. Nelson M.T.

The role that various Ca2+ signals and Ca2+-dependent transcription factors may play in the physiological or pathological regulation of gene expression in this phenotypically plastic tissue is largely unknown. Here we show that, in native cerebral artery smooth muscle cells, UTP and other Gq/11-coupled receptor agonists induce a calcineurin-mediated nuclear accumulation of NFATc3. This induction is dependent on SR Ca2+ release through IP3 receptors (IP3R) and further depends on extracellular Ca2+ influx through L-type VDCC. We also show that UTP may act to induce NFATc3 nuclear accumulation, at least in part, by suppressing Ca2+ sparks, suggesting a novel inhibitory role for Ca2+ sparks in the regulation of Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), pinacidil was from RBI (Research Biochemical Inc.), fluo-4 and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), ryanodine was from LC Laboratories, xestospongin C was from Calbiochem, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) was from Tocris. FK506 was kindly provided by Fujisawa. All other drugs and chemical reagents were from Sigma. Adult female CD-1 mice (20–25 g; Charles River Laboratories) were euthanized by peritoneal injection of pentobarbital solution (200 mg/kg). Cerebral arteries were dissected from the brain in ice-cold physiological saline solution (containing 135 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.9 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 11.6 mmol/liter Hepes, 11.5 mmol/liter glucose, pH 7.4) and cleaned of connective tissue. Endothelium-denuded vessels were prepared by passing an air bubble through the lumen of the artery. Total RNA was prepared from cerebral vessels using the Trizol-LS Reagent (Invitrogen), followed by DNase treatment and reverse transcription using oligo(dT) primers and the Sensiscript RT Kit (Qiagen), as described by the manufacturers. PCRs were performed using the AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the following sets of primer pairs: for NFATc2, F (5′-ACATCCGCGTGCCCGTGAAAGT-3′) and R (5′-CTCGGGGCAGTCTGTTGTTGGATG-3′); for NFATc1, F (5′-CATGCGCCCTCTGTGGCCCTCAAA-3′) and R (5′-GGAGCCTTCTCCACGAAAATG-3′); for NFATc4, F (5′-GAAGCTACCCTCCGGTACAGAG-3′) and R (5′-GCTTCATAGCTGGCTGTAGCC-3′); for NFATc3, F (5′-CTACTGGTGGCCATCCTGTTGT-3′) and R (AGCTCGTGGGCAGAGCGCTGAGAGCACTC-3′); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH). Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 10 min, 30–45 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Cerebral arteries (midcerebral, posterior, cerebellar, and basilar) from 2–4 mice were pooled and homogenized in sample preparation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Aliquots of cerebral artery and control tissue extracts, prepared in a similar manner, were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels using the Laemmli buffering system. Proteins were transferred to immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked by rocking for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk). Blots were exposed to primary antibodies for 1 h, multiply washed with TBST, and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min, followed by a final series of washes with TBST. Primary (rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and secondary (donkey anti-rabbit IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were prepared in blocking buffer, and all steps were performed at room temperature. Blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Dura; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Arteries were treated at room temperature as specified and then mounted onto glass slides. After air-drying for 5 min, the arteries were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and blocked for 2 h with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibody (rabbit anti-NFATc3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:250 in 2% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline) was applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody (Cy5 anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories), 1:500 dilution) was applied for 1 h at 25 °C. Nuclei were identified using the fluorescent nucleic acid dye YOYO-1 (1:30,000 dilution). After washing, the vessels were mounted (Aqua Polymount mounting medium; Polysciences) and examined at ×40 magnification using a Bio-Rad 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope. NFATc3 was detected by monitoring Cy5 fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 650 nm and an emission wavelength of 670 nm. Specificity of immune staining was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence in arteries incubated with primary or secondary antibodies alone. For scoring of NFATc3-positive nuclei, multiple fields for each vessel were imaged and counted by two independent observers under double-blind conditions. For quantification, a cell was considered positive if co-localization (yellow) was observed in the nucleus, whereas a cell was considered negative if no co-localization (green only) was visualized. All imaging experiments were performed at room temperature. Arteries were loaded with 10 μm fluo-4-AM in physiological saline solution and 0.05% pluronic acid for 60 min and then kept in physiological saline solution for 30 min to allow fluo-4 de-esterification. The vessel ends were anchored beneath two stainless steel hooks to maintain the artery at the bottom of the chamber and provide a fixed imaging area. Arteries were illuminated with a krypton/argon laser at 488 nm and imaged using a Noran Oz laser-scanning confocal microscope and a ×60 water immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.2). For Ca2+sparks detection, images of 58.1 × 54.5-μm (256 × 240 pixels) sections of the vessel wall were recorded every 16.7 ms (60 images/s). Under each condition, at least two different representative areas of the same artery were scanned for 10 s. Ca2+sparks were analyzed using custom software written in our laboratory by Dr. Adrian Bonev (using IDL 5.2; Research Systems Inc., Boulder, CO), which allows for off-line quantification of fluorescence changes in selected regions of a sample corresponding to boxes of defined dimensions positioned by eye within the sample. Ca2+ spark amplitude (F/F 0) was obtained by determining the fluorescence intensity within a 2.37-μm2(1.54 μm (7 pixels) × 1.54 μm (7 pixels)) area corresponding to a detected spark event (F), and dividing by a base line (F 0) that was determined by averaging 30 images without Ca2+ spark activity. Ca2+ spark frequency under a given condition was calculated by measuring the number of sparks that occurred in a 58.1 × 54.5-μm area (∼20 cells) scanned for 10 s. For detection of Ca2+ waves, images of the vessel wall (116.2 × 108.0 μm, or 512 × 480 pixels) were recorded every 531.9 ms (1.88 images/s). Under each condition, at least two different representative areas of the same artery were scanned for 213 s. Ca2+ waves were determined by analyzing recurrent changes in fluorescence intensity occurring in 2.2 × 2.2-μm (10 × 10 pixels) regions of individual myocytes and defined as a change inF/F 0 > 1.3 that remained elevated for >200 ms. Changes in global F/F 0were calculated by measuring the mean pixel value of images acquired at 1.88 images/s, before and after application of each drug. The same area was not scanned more than once to avoid introducing Ca2+signaling artifacts due to laser-induced cell damage. Results are expressed as means ± S.E., where applicable. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software (Prism 3.0). Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance analysis followed by Bonferroni or Tukey-Kramer tests (for comparisons between up to five groups or at least six groups, respectively). We have used RT-PCR analysis and immunoblotting to identify NFAT isoforms expressed in native cerebral artery smooth muscle. Previous results from experiments employing the rat A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cell line suggested that the NFATc2 and NFATc1 isoforms are expressed in smooth muscle (9Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although expression of additional isoforms could not be ruled out in this study. In an RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from cerebral arteries, we find no evidence for NFATc2 expression using primer pairs that efficiently amplify NFATc2 from spleen (Fig.1 A). Instead, we find that NFATc3 and, to a lesser extent, NFATc4, are expressed in cerebral arteries (Fig. 1 B). NFATc1 expression is generally very low to undetectable in unstimulated mouse cerebral arteries (Fig.1 B). The presence of NFATc3 protein in cerebral arteries was confirmed by Western analysis, which showed the presence of major bands corresponding to those identified in thymus (Fig. 1 C), a tissue that expresses predominantly the NFATc3 isoform (46Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The predominant expression of NFATc3 in smooth muscle has led us to focus on this isoform, although it is likely that other NFAT isoforms may play important roles in smooth muscle, as suggested by others (9Boss V.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). UTP is an important vasoactive substance in the cerebral vasculature and has been previously shown to activate the NFATc1 isoform in cultured smooth muscle cells (47Abbott K.L. Loss 2nd, J.R. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In intact cerebral arteries, treatment with UTP induces nuclear translocation of NFATc3 as evidenced by colocalization of NFATc3 with the fluorescent nucleic acid dye, YOYO-1 (Fig.2 A). These results are summarized in Fig. 2 B, which shows that the number of NFATc3-positive nuclei in intact cerebral arteries is increased from 7.9% in untreated vessels to 43.2% in UTP-treated arteries. Similar results for control (5.8%) and UTP-treated conditions (50.7%) were obtained for endothelium-denuded arteries, indicating that this action of UTP on NFATc3 subcellular distribution is a direct effect on smooth muscle. Other Gq/11-coupled vasoconstrictors and peptide ligands for certain tyrosine kinase-linked growth factor receptors are capable of inducing NFATc3 translocation in cerebral artery smooth muscle, although the robustness of the response varies with the agonist used. Endothelin-1 is as effective as UTP in inducing NFATc3 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 2 C), whereas angiotensin II and the peptide ligand EGF are much less effective. Prostaglandin F2α induces a small, but significant, increase in NFAT nuclear accumulation that is comparable in magnitude with that induced by angiotensin II and EGF. PDGF, which is a smooth muscle mitogen and potent activator of NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in ileal smooth muscle (10Stevenson A.S. Gomez M.F. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15018-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), is ineffective in cerebral artery smooth muscle. Calcineurin activity is sensitive to inhibition by the chemically unrelated immunosuppressive agents FK506 and cyclosporin A, which inhibit calcineurin by distinct mechanisms (48Ho S. Clipstone N. Timmermann L. Northrop J. Graef I. Fiorentino D. Nourse J. Crabtree G.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: S40-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). To determine whether UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation is calcineurin-dependent, we treated intact cerebral arteries with each of these agents prior to and/or concurrent with UTP treatment. Inhibition of calcineurin activity with either of these compounds completely abrogates UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 3), indicating that this process is calcineurin-dependent. Calcineurin activity is strictly dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin (49Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In intact cerebral arteries, UTP induces an increase in global intracellular Ca2+characterized by an initial Ca2+ spike followed by a sustained elevated plateau phase (Fig.4 A; see also Ref. 41Jaggar J.H. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1528-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the magnitude of each phase is somewhat variable between and within vessels, this biphasic response is a consistent property of UTP-induced Ca2+ elevation. To determine whether SR-mediated Ca2+ release is involved in UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation, we pretreated cerebral arteries with the SR Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, to deplete SR luminal Ca2+. This treatment prevents the increase in global Ca2+ induced by UTP (Fig. 4 B), indicating that intracellular calcium stores are required for this effect. To determine whether this calcium release from the SR induced by UTP contributes to UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation, NFATc3 subcellular distribution was monitored immunohistochemically in cerebral arteries pretreated with thapsigargin. In these experiments, we employed cerebral arteries that had first been denuded of endothelium, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In endothelium-denuded cerebral arteries, prior depletion of Ca2+ stores completely prevents UTP-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation (Fig.4 C). Under these conditions, thapsigargin alone has no effect on NFATc3 subcellular distribution. These data indicate that UTP mediates its effects on NFATc3 subcellular distribution, at least in part, through release of SR Ca2+. In nonexcitable cells, the sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ required to maintain NFAT in the nucleus is provided by a capacitative mechanism by which depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores is coupled to extracellular Ca2+ influx (50Serafini A.T.

Although previous studies have suggested that the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene locus is involved in human essential hypertension, the molecular mechanisms involved in hypertension in African-Americans remain unknown. We show that an A/G polymorphism at −217 in the promoter of the AGT gene plays a significant role in hypertension in African-Americans. The frequency of the −217A allele was increased significantly in African-American hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive controls. We also show that the nucleotide sequence of this region of the AGT gene promoter bound strongly to CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family transcription factors when nucleoside A was present at −217. In addition, we show that reporter constructs containing the human AGT gene promoter with nucleoside A at −217 had increased basal transcriptional activity upon transient transfection in HepG2 cells compared with reporter constructs with nucleoside G at −217. Finally, we show that interleukin-6 treatment in the presence or absence of overexpressed C/EBPβ increased the promoter activities of reporter constructs containing nucleoside A at −217 compared with reporter constructs containing nucleoside G at −217.

It is estimated that hypertension affects 50 million Americans with a prevalence rate of 25–30% in the adult Caucasian population, and the incidence of hypertension is even greater in the African-American population. Hypertension is a polygenic disease, and it has been estimated by segregation analysis and twin studies that ∼45% of the interindividual differences in blood pressure can be accounted for by genetic differences. However, molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of human hypertension remain unknown. The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure, and the octapeptide angiotensin II is one of the most active vasopressor agents (4Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X.

Angiotensin II is obtained from its precursor molecule, angiotensinogen (AGT),1 which is synthesized primarily in liver and adipose tissue and to a lesser extent in kidney, brain, heart, adrenal gland, and vascular walls (6Campbell D.J.

AGT is first converted by renin to produce a decapeptide, angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by the removal of a C-terminal dipeptide by angiotensin-converting enzyme. In experimental as well as clinical studies, administration of renin-angiotensin inhibitors is effective in reducing blood pressure and ending organ damage (8Carson P. Giles T. Higginbotham M.

However, because amino acid 235 is located far away from the renin cleavage site, this polymorphism does not explain the mechanism involved in the increased plasma AGT levels. The human AGT gene also has an A/G polymorphism at −6. It has been shown recently that (a) molecular variants 235T and −6A are in complete linkage disequilibrium and (b) reporter constructs containing the human AGT gene promoter with nucleoside A at −6 have increased promoter activity upon transient transfection in human liver-derived HepG2 cells compared with reporter constructs containing nucleoside G at −6 (14Inoue I. Nakajima T. Williams C.S. Quackenbush J. Puryear R. Powers M. Cheng T. Ludwig E.H. Sharma A.M. Hata A. Jeunemaitre X. Lalouel J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1786-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments suggest that the increased plasma AGT levels by the 235T allele may be due to increased transcriptional activity of the human AGT gene by nucleoside A at −6. Although hypertension is more prevalent in the black population, and complication rates, particularly for renal failure, are many times higher in blacks than in whites, relatively little work has been done to understand the molecular mechanism involved in hypertension in this population. Plasma AGT levels are generally higher in the black population (15Cooper R. Forrester T. Ogunbiyi O. Muffinda J. J. Hypertens. 1998; 16: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been shown that (a) plasma AGT levels are ∼19% higher in black children compared with white children, (b) blood pressure is normally higher and increases faster over time in black children compared with white children, and (c) plasma AGT levels are associated with the AGT gene in black children (16Manatunga A.K.

However, these workers could not find an association between variants M235T and A/G at −6 and hypertension in the African-American population. Other studies have also suggested that, although the frequency of the −6A allele is increased in the African-American population, there is no association between the −6A allele and hypertension in this population (20Rotimi C. Morrison L. Cooper R. Oyejide C. Effiong E. Ladipo M. Osotemihen B. Ward R. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our laboratory is interested in understanding the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the AGT gene in human hypertension. The nucleotide sequence of the human AGT gene promoter contains an A/G polymorphic site at −217. In this work, we show that the −217A allele of the AGT gene is associated with hypertension in the African-American population (p = 0.0017), but not in the Caucasian population (p = 0.12). The nucleotide sequence of the human AGT gene containing an A/G polymorphic site at −217 has partial homology to the consensus C/EBP-binding site. We show that an oligonucleotide containing the human AGT gene promoter with nucleoside A at −217 binds more strongly to recombinant C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and DBP. In addition, we show that reporter constructs containing the human AGT gene promoter with nucleoside A at −217 have increased basal promoter activity upon transient transfection in HepG2 cells compared with reporter constructs containing nucleoside G at −217. Furthermore, we show that IL-6 treatment in the presence or absence of overexpressed C/EBPβ increases the promoter activities of reporter constructs containing nucleoside A at −217 compared with reporter constructs containing nucleoside G at −217. The reporter construct pHAGT1.3luc was constructed by PCR amplification of the human AGT gene (21Fukamizu A. Takahashi S. Seo M.S. Tada M. Tanimoto K. Uehara S. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7576-7582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gaillard I. Clauser E. Corvol P. DNA (N.

The amplified fragment contained nucleotides −1206 to +70 and was subcloned in the pGL3-basic vector lacking eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences (Promega, Madison, WI). The reporter construct pHAGT303luc was constructed by PCR amplification of the human AGT gene (22Gaillard I. Clauser E. Corvol P. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) using ACACACCTAGGGAGATGCTCCCGTTTCTGG as the forward primer and CAAGTACCAGTAAGTGAGTCTGAGTGGGGCCCCGCTTA as the reverse primer. The amplified fragment contained nucleotides −303 to +70 and was subcloned in the pGL3-basic vector. These reporter constructs had nucleoside A at −6 and −217. Nucleoside A at −217 in these reporter constructs was mutated to G by site-specific mutagenesis using CCTGCACCAGTCTCACTCTGTTCAGTCAGTG and its complementary oligonucleotide using a Stratagene kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequences of the mutated reporter constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. The reporter constructs (223A)2-lucand (223G)2-luc were constructed by dimerization of oligonucleotides CCTGCACCAGTCTCACTCTGTTCAGTCAGTG and CCTGCACCGGCTCACTCTGTTCAGTCAGTG (the position of the A/G polymorphic site is underlined) and blunt-end ligation of dimers in theSmaI site of the pGL3 promoter vector. The pGL3 promoter vector contains the SV40 promoter, but not the enhancer sequence upstream of the luciferase gene. The Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression vector was obtained from Promega. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Plasmid DNAs for transient transfection were prepared using QIAGEN midi or maxi plasmid kits following the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. PolyFect transfection reagent was also purchased from QIAGEN Inc. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For transient transfections, reporter DNA (1.0 μg) and Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase DNA (0.1 μg) were mixed with pBluescript DNA to a final weight of 3 μg of DNA. Transient transfections were performed following the manufacturer's protocol. For cotransfection experiments, expression vectors containing MSV-C/EBPβ and MSV-C/EBPδ (0.25 μg) were added to the reporter constructs. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated for an additional 24 h with recombinant human IL-6 (10 ng/ml of medium). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspension in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega) followed by freeze-thawing in dry ice/ethanol. An aliquot of the cell extract was used to measure luciferase activity in a Turners Design TD 20/20 luminometer using a luciferase assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (23Narayanan C.S. Cui Y. Kumar A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were chemically synthesized, annealed, and radiolabeled at the 5′-ends by polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. DNA fragments (20,000–50,000 cpm), poly(dI-dC) (1–2 μg), and nuclear extract (5–10 μg) or recombinant proteins (10–20 ng) were incubated in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 12.5% glycerol in ice for 30 min and separated on a 5–8% polyacrylamide gel in a cold room. After 2–3 h, the gel was dried under vacuum, and protein-nucleic acid complexes were identified by autoradiography. For supershift assay, 1 μl of antibody was added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for 30 min and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Radioactive oligonucleotides were purified by PAGE followed by electroelution for quantitative gel shift assay. Nuclear extracts for gel mobility shift assays were prepared by modification of a previously described method (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Recombinant C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were obtained through bacterial expression of histidine-tagged proteins as described previously (25Lee Y.H. Williams S.C. Baer M. Sterneck E. Gonzalez F.J. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant DBP was obtained using an in vitro coupled transcription-translation system obtained from rabbit reticulocytes as described previously (23Narayanan C.S. Cui Y. Kumar A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Antibodies against C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides 223A and 223G were obtained by annealing CGACCCTGCACCAGCTCACTCT and CGACCCTGCACCGGCTCACTCT with their respective complementary oligonucleotides. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus C/EBP-, NF-1-, and HNF-3-binding sites were obtained by annealing AGTATTGTGCAATGT, CCTTTGGCATGCTGCCAATATG, and TATTATTGACTTAGTGATC with their respective complementary oligonucleotides. We studied 186 African-American and 127 Caucasian subjects with hypertension (mean age of 59 ± 10 years) and 156 African-American and 135 Caucasian normotensive controls (mean age of 58 ± 10 years). All of these subjects were recruited from the outpatient department of the State University of New York Health Science Center (Brooklyn, NY) and the Westchester Medical Center (Valhalla, NY). All cases were diagnosed as having essential hypertension. The criteria for hypertension were defined as a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg or under antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure was measured twice with the subject seated with a 5-min interval between measurements. The normotensive subjects (with systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg) without a history of hypertension were recruited from the same population and matched for sex and age. All participants completed a standard questionnaire on personal medical history and family history of hypertension. The genomic DNAs from hypertensive and control subjects were amplified using CTCAGTGCTGTCACACACCTA as the forward primer and AAGTGACACCACCTCCAGTCTTTAGT as the reverse primer. The amplification product (233 bp) contained nucleotides −314 to −82 of the human AGT gene promoter, including the A/G polymorphic site at −217. These amplified fragments were treated with either AluI orHpaII to identify the A/G polymorphic site at −217. The restriction enzyme AluI (restriction site AGCT) cuts the amplified sequence if nucleoside A is present at −217 and produces 134- and 99-bp fragments. On the other hand, the restriction enzymeHpaII (restriction site CCGG) cuts the amplified fragment if nucleoside G is present at −217 and produces 136- and 97-bp fragments. After restriction analysis, the resulting fragments were separated by 3.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified products were determined by sequence analysis to confirm the results of restriction analysis. The GraphPAD statistical software package (GraphPAD Version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA) was used for analysis of the clinical characteristics, differences in allele frequency between case and control subjects, and comparison of promoter activities of different reporter constructs in transient transfection assays. Base-line characteristics between hypertensive and normotensive subjects were compared using unpairedt tests or Fisher's exact test for contingency table where appropriate. Genetic data were analyzed for allele frequency by a gene-counting method. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the computer program GDA (46Lewis P.O. Zaykin D. Genetic Data Analysis: Computer Program for the Analysis of Allelic Data, Version 1.0 d16c. Lewis Lab Software, Storrs, CT2001Google Scholar). 2Available at lewis.eeb.uconn.edu/lewishome/software.html. Genotype distribution and differences in allele frequencies between case and control subjects were compared using Fisher's exact test for contingency table because all the variants are dichotomous. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals estimated the relative risk for hypertension associated with the −217A allele carrier. Unpaired t tests were performed to compare relative luciferase activities of reporter constructs containing nucleoside A or G at position −217 of the AGT gene promoter in transfection experiments. All experiments were conducted in sextuplicate in four independent transfection experiments as described recently (26Farzaneh-Far A. Davies J.D. Braam L.A. Spronk H.M. Proudfoot D. Chan S.W. O'Shaughnessy K.M. Weissberg P.L. Vermeer C. Shanahan C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32466-32473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the A/G polymorphism at −217 in the promoter of the AGT gene in hypertension, we have analyzed genomic DNAs from 186 hypertensive and 156 normotensive African-American subjects. All patients and control subjects were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genomic DNA was amplified by PCR, and the product was analyzed for the A/G polymorphic site at −217 by restriction analysis (Fig.1). The frequency of the −217A allele in hypertensive patients was 0.29 compared with 0.19 in the normotensive population, which is highly significant (p = 0.0017 and OR = 1.792) (Table I). To compare the role of this polymorphic site in hypertension in the African-American and Caucasian populations, we also analyzed genomic DNAs from 127 Caucasian hypertensive subjects and 135 normotensive controls. The frequency of the −217A allele in Caucasian hypertensive subjects was 0.15, and that in normotensive controls was 0.11, which is not significant (p = 0.12) (Table I). Statistical analysis based on the A/G genotype at −217 (using the A allele as a dominant model) also suggested a significant role of the −217A allele in hypertension in African-Americans (p = 0.0021 and OR = 2.015), but not in Caucasians (TableII). Because an A/G polymorphism at −6 has been previously associated with hypertension, we also analyzed genomic DNAs from the African-American and Caucasian populations for this polymorphism. The frequency of the −6A allele was 0.87 in African-American hypertensive subjects and 0.85 in normotensive controls, which is not significant (p = 0.58) (TableIII). However, the frequency of the −6A allele was marginally significant in Caucasian subjects (p = 0.06). These experiments suggest that −217A allele of the human AGT gene plays a significant role in essential hypertension in African-Americans, but not in Caucasians.Table IStatistical analysis of the A/G polymorphism at −217 of human angiotensinogen based on allele frequency−217A allele−217G allelep valueAfrican-AmericanHypertensive (n = 186)0.290.71p = 0.0017 (OR = 1.792)Normotensive (n = 156)0.190.81CaucasianHypertensive (n = 127)0.150.85p = 0.1208 (OR = 1.507)Normotensive (n = 135)0.110.89 Open table in a new tab Table IIStatistical analysis of the A/G polymorphism at −217 of the angiotensinogen gene based on the genotype distribution using the A allele dominant modelAA + AGGGpvalueAfrican-AmericanHypertensive (n = 186)128490p = 0.0021 (OR = 2.015)Normotensive (n = 156)450102CaucasianHypertensive (n = 127)43192p = 0.1433 (OR = 1.595)Normotensive (n = 135)323109 Open table in a new tab Table IIIStatistical analysis of the A/G polymorphism at −6 of the human angiotensinogen gene based on allele frequencyAGp valueCaucasianHypertensive (n = 127)0.550.45p = 0.0670 (O Ratio = 1.383)Normotensive (n = 135)0.470.53African-AmericanHypertensive (n = 186)0.8680.1317p = 0.5800 (OR = 1.140)Normotensive (n = 156)0.8530.147 Open table in a new tab To understand the role of the A/G polymorphism at −217 in transcriptional regulation of the human AGT gene, we performed transient transfection of reporter constructs pHAGT1.3luc and pHAGT303luc containing either nucleoside A or G at −217 in HepG2 cells. Promoter activity was analyzed after 48 h of transfection and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The results of this experiment show that pHAGT1.3luc with nucleoside A at −217 had 28% increased basal promoter activity compared with pHAGT1.3luc with nucleoside G at −217 (p < 0.001) (Fig.2). On the other hand, pHAGT303luc with nucleoside A at −217 had 37% increased basal promoter activity compared with pHAGT303luc with nucleoside G at −217 (p < 0.001) (data not shown). We also synthesized reporter constructs in which two copies of an oligonucleotide containing nucleotides −225 to −196 of the human AGT gene promoter with either nucleoside A or G at −217 were ligated in front of the luciferase gene in the pGL3 promoter vector. These reporter constructs were then used in transient transfection assay in HepG2 cells. The results of this experiment show that the reporter construct with nucleoside A at −217 had 84% increased basal promoter activity compared with the reporter construct containing nucleoside G at this position. Taken together, these experiments show that nucleoside A at −217 increases the basal promoter activities of reporter constructs containing the human AGT gene promoter upon transient transfection in HepG2 cells compared with nucleoside G at −217. The nucleotide sequence of the human AGT gene promoter (located between nucleotides −217 and −225) has partial homology to the C/EBP-binding site (Fig. 3 A). The consensus C/EBP-binding site T(T/G)NNGCAA(T/G) (shown in reverse orientation in the first line in Fig. 3 A) has one mismatch when nucleoside A is present at −217 and two mismatches when nucleoside G is present at −217. To examine whether this region of the human AGT gene binds to C/EBP family transcription factors, we performed gel shift assays using oligonucleotides 223A and 223G in the presence of recombinant C/EBPα that was synthesized as a His-tagged protein. The results of this experiment are presented in Fig.3 B. Lane 1 shows the results from a gel shift assay in the presence of recombinant C/EBPα in the absence of competitor DNA, and lane 2 shows the results from the same assay in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide 223A. Lane 3 shows the results from an assay in the presence of a nonspecific unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus NF-1-binding site. Lane 4 shows the results from an assay in the presence of anti-C/EBPα antibody, and lane 5 shows the results from an assay in the presence of preimmune serum. Lanes 6–10 show the same reactions in the presence of oligonucleotide 223G. The results of this experiment show that oligonucleotide 223A (containing nucleoside A at −217) formed a specific complex with recombinant C/EBPα and that the intensity of this complex was at least 10-fold greater compared with the that of the complex formed with oligonucleotide 223G (containing nucleoside G at −217). We next performed a gel shift assay using oligonucleotides 223A and 223G and an oligonucleotide with the consensus C/EBP-binding site in the presence of recombinant C/EBPβ (which was synthesized as a His-tagged protein). The results of this experiment show that oligonucleotide 223A formed a complex with recombinant C/EBPβ (Fig.4, lane 1) which was supershifted in the presence of anti-C/EBPβ antibody (lane 2). An oligonucleotide containing the consensus C/EBP-binding site also formed a similar complex with recombinant C/EBPβ (lane 3), which was partially supershifted in the presence of anti-C/EBPβ antibody (lane 4). To compare the binding of recombinant C/EBPβ to oligonucleotides 223A and 223G, we performed a gel shift assay in the presence of equal amounts of purified radioactive oligonucleotides using two concentrations of recombinant C/EBPβ. The results of this experiment show that recombinant C/EBPβ formed a much stronger complex with oligonucleotide 223A compared with oligonucleotide 223G (compare lanes 5 and 6 withlanes 7 and 8). As a control, we also performed a gel shift assay with oligonucleotides 223A and 223G using two concentrations of recombinant C/EBPα (compare lanes 9 and10 with lanes 11 and 12). The results of this experiment confirmed our previous observation that oligonucleotide 223A formed a stronger complex with recombinant C/EBPα compared with oligonucleotide 223G. Because DBP also plays an important role in transcriptional regulation of liver-specific genes especially in the circadian rhythm and binds to C/EBP-binding sites (27Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 63: 1257-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether DBP also binds to this region of the human AGT gene promoter. To answer this question, recombinant DBP was synthesized by in vitrocoupled transcription-translation using a rabbit reticulocyte system. Recombinant DBP was then used in a gel shift assay with equal amounts of purified radioactive oligonucleotides 223A and 223G. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 5"
https://openalex.org/W1980223730,"Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) has been shown to play a key role in prostate carcinogenesis. It was initially cloned as an androgen induced protein in mouse mammary cancer SC3 cells. In this study, we examined if FGF8 was also regulated by the androgen receptor in human prostate cancer. FGF8b protein expression in resected clinical prostate cancer correlated closely with expression of the androgen receptor (AR). In the androgen sensitive CWR22 prostate xenograft, we observed up-regulation of FGF8b immunoreactivity in testosterone supplemented mice while castration markedly reduced its signal. Furthermore, FGF8b protein expression in AR positive LNCaP cells was similarly enhanced by androgens. The proximal promoter of the human FGF8 gene was cloned into a luciferase reporter construct (FGF8.luc). FGF8.luc activity in AR positive LNCaP and SC3 cells was increased 2.5-fold by androgens. In AR negative DU145 cells, maximal induction of FGF8.luc required both co-transfection of the AR and the presence of androgens. The anti-androgen bicalutamide completely abolished AR mediated FGF8.luc induction. Deletion constructs from FGF8.luc have further defined an active promoter region and an androgen responsive region. Nucleotide analysis of this androgen responsive region has revealed putative androgen response elements. Finally, using ChIP assays we confirmed in vivo interaction between the AR and the androgen responsive region of the FGF8 promoter. Taken together these data provide first evidence that expression of the mitogen FGF8 in prostate cancer is, at least in part, regulated by the androgen receptor at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1966516812,"Members of the four-and-a-half-LIM domain (FHL) protein family, which are expressed in a tissue- and stage-specific manner, have been reported previously to function as transcriptional coactivators.

This structural interference results in a downstream disruption of crucial regulatory pathways such as may be involved in the control of growth, differentiation, and survival of normal cells. Regulation of such transcription factors often occurs via chromatin remodeling in that these proteins can themselves interact with components of the transcription complex such as the corepressors (NCoR/SMRT)1 or with histone deacetylases (HDACs). In a variant form of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) is fused to the retinoic acid receptor-α as a result of a chromosomal translocation, t(11,17)(q23;q21); this form is refractory to retinoic acid treatment as a result of the association of PLZF with HDAC and the corepressors NCoR/SMRT (1Grignani F., De Matteis S.

PLZF is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, bearing nine Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers at the C terminus. The N terminus contains a POZ domain, which allows self-association as well as heterodimerization with other proteins. A second repression domain, RD2, is located downstream of the POZ domain (3Li J.Y. English M.A. Ball H.J. Yeyati P.L. Waxman S. Licht J.D. J. Biol.

Several subclasses of LIM domain proteins are recognized and designated according to the presence or absence of additional motifs such as homeodomains or kinase domains (6Bach I. Mech.

One of these subgroups is the LIM-only family, which possess only LIM domains. A number of LIM-only proteins are clearly implicated in transcriptional regulation: LMO2, which interacts with GATA-1 and Tal1 and plays a definitive role in angiogenesis (17Yamada Y. Pannell R.

Within this subgroup is a cohesive family of LIM-only proteins, which are highly homologous, are characterized by a specific arrangement of domains, bearing four complete and one N-terminal half LIM domain (FHL family), and are expressed tissue-specifically and in distinct cellular compartments. Recently, members of the FHL family were also shown to behave as transcriptional coactivators. ACT functions as a coactivator of CREM (21Fimia G.M., De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Fimia G.M., De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8613-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and DRAL/FHL2 has been reported to enhance the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (23Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Additionally, an isoform of FHL1 known as KyoT2 interacts with RBP-J, a DNA-binding transcription factor, thus negatively regulating transcription (24Taniguchi Y. Furukawa T. Tun T. Han H. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is tenable that this family of FHL proteins may perform a function in transcriptional modulation. DRAL/FHL2, the first FHL protein described, was isolated in our laboratory by virtue of its being down-regulated in rhabdomyosarcoma cells as compared with their non-malignant equivalent, normal human myoblasts (25Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M.G. Schafer B.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have since shown that DRAL/FHL2 expression is regulated by p53 since mRNA levels are augmented by transient expression of functional p53 in rhabdomyosarcoma cells, as well as by endogenous p53 stimulated by ionizing radiation treatment. Moreover, overexpression of DRAL/FHL2 in both normal and tumor-derived cell lines efficiently induces an apoptotic program (26Scholl F.A. McLoughlin P. Ehler E. de Giovanni C. Schafer B.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that DRAL/FHL2 has a role in tumor development. In this work we present the results of a yeast two-hybrid screen with DRAL/FHL2, performed to further delineate the molecular purpose of this protein. It is noteworthy that DRAL/FHL2 was isolated in several two-hybrid screens and is an interaction partner for the androgen receptor (23Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A.

Here we demonstrate a physical and functional interaction between DRAL/FHL2 and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). DRAL/FHL2 acts as a corepressor for PLZF-mediated transcriptional repression, supporting the notion that DRAL/FHL2 is a tissue-specific transcriptional modulator. The full-length cDNA for human DRAL/FHL2 was cloned in-frame into the inducible yeast expression vector pGILDA (LexA Matchmaker Two-hybrid System, CLONTECH), as a fusion to the LexA DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD) by PCR using primers with a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ NotI site. The following DRAL/FHL2 deletion constructs were generated by PCR also with a 5′ BamHI site and 3′ NotI site, as well as containing a Kozak consensus start and a C-terminal FLAG tag, and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen): LIM(1–4) eliminating the N-terminal half LIM domain; LIM(0.5–2) the two and a half N-terminal LIM domains; LIM(3–4) the two C-terminal LIM domains; LIM1, LIM2, LIM3, and LIM4, each complete single LIM domain numbered from the N to C terminus. A similar construct was designed using the full-length DRAL/FHL2 cDNA. The primers used to manufacture these constructs were designed such that they were compatible with the mammalian two-hybrid system expression vector pBIND (Checkmate, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and so could be used to generate in-frame fusions of DRAL and deletion constructs thereof, with the GAL4 DNA-BD of pBIND. The full-length PLZF cDNA was amplified from pSG5-PLZF (32Chen Z. Guidez F. Rousselot P. Agadir A. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Degos L. Zelent A. Waxman S. Chomienne C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Westendorf J.J. Polinger A. Carlile G.W. Arai S. Ball H.J. Lutterbach B. Hiebert S.W. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). pGEX-3X-DRAL was described previously (25Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M.G. Schafer B.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as were the IL3R-tk-luc and tk-luc reporters (33Ball H.J. Melnick A. Shaknovich R. Kohanski R.A. Licht J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4106-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). IMAGE clones corresponding to human FHL1, FHL3, ACT, CRP2, and PINCH were obtained from the UK HGMP Resource Centre and transferred into pcDNA3. The integrity of all constructs was confirmed before use. Specific details of cloning and PCR primers are available upon request. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS (all from Invitrogen), and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 293T, NIH3T3, and HT1080 cells were obtained from ATCC. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). A human adult cardiac cDNA library in the LexA system-inducible B42-activation domain (pB42-AD) yeast expression vector was acquired from CLONTECH and amplified according to the manufacturer's directives. The library was transformed into yeast strain EGY48 to screen for interaction partners with pGILDA-DRAL, as per the manufacturer's protocols. Yeast plasmids were prepared from colonies sustaining growth on leucine-deficient medium and that were positive for β-galactosidase activity. By using primers designed to target the pB42-AD plasmid inserts, relevant inserts were amplified and partially sequenced. Approximately 200 putative positive clones were selected and sequenced.Escherichia coli KC8 was then transformed with chosen yeast plasmids, and the library plasmid was nutritionally selected. Isolation of the correct plasmid clone was confirmed by re-sequencing. To confirm specific two-hybrid interactions, small scale transformations were performed and assayed as per instructions. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed using O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate, as described by the manufacturer. Expression of full-length DRAL/FHL2 as a GST fusion protein from pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences) was performed as described previously (25Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M.G. Schafer B.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proteins were produced using Promega's TNT coupled in vitrotranscription-translation (IVT) system, using the following constructs all in pcDNA3.1-myc/his: full-length PLZF, delPOZ, delRD2, and delPOZ/delRD2. 5 μl of the IVT reactions were incubated with 1 μg of GST-DRAL bound to glutathione-Sepharose in NET-80 buffer (80 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) and mixed for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed extensively in NET-80, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer, and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. 293T cells were transfected with 2 μg each of the following expression plasmids: pcDNA3-DRAL together with pSG5-PLZF, or pcDNA3.1-ΔPOZ, pcDNA3.1-ΔRD2, or pcDNA3.1-ΔPOZ/ ΔRD2. After 48 h, cells were washed twice, harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Antibodies (rabbit anti-DRAL/FHL2 (25Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M.G. Schafer B.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), anti-PLZF (Calbiochem)) were covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads at a ratio of 1 mg/ml. Following 30 min of incubation, beads were washed 3 times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. They were then added to 0.3 ml of cell lysates, and incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively (Wash 1: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl; Wash 2: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS; Wash 3: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100) prior to eluting the coupled proteins by boiling in 30 μl of SDS gel loading buffer, which were then resolved on either a 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PALL Fluorotrans Transfer Membranes). Immunoblotting was carried out using the Tropix Western Light kit (Applied Biosystems) and anti-PLZF at 1 μg/ml or anti-DRAL/FHL2 at 1:1000, followed by 1:7500 anti-mouse or 1:10,000 anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (both Sigma), as appropriate. A U937 monocytic cell line expressing PLZF under the control of the tetracycline repressor (34Ward J.O. McConnell M.J. Carlile G.W. Pandolfi P.P. Licht J.D. Freedman L.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 3290-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline. These cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and exposed to lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, Tween 20, plus protease inhibitors) on ice for 15 min. This suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was pre-cleared by exposure to beads bound to a nonspecific rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco) and mixed for approximately 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted and exposed to PLZF antibodies (IgG2a isotype) (35Licht J.D. Shaknovich R. English M.A. Melnick A., Li, J.Y. Reddy J.C. Dong S. Chen S.J. Zelent A. Waxman S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 323-336PubMed Google Scholar) covalently bound to protein A-Sepharose and mixed on a rotator overnight. The pellets were washed in fresh cold lysis buffer six times, the last three times using Nonidet P-40 instead of Tween 20 in the lysis buffer. The beads were then placed in Laemmli buffer and the precipitated proteins released by boiling. This was followed by electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transfer to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blot was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-DRAL/FHL2 antibody followed by a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Autoradiography was performed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blotting and hybridization were carried out as described previously (26Scholl F.A. McLoughlin P. Ehler E. de Giovanni C. Schafer B.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) on total RNA isolated from normal human tissues from autopsy material. cDNAs of DRAL/FHL2, PLZF, and β-actin were used as probes. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and immunostained as described previously (36Auerbach D. Bantle S. Keller S. Hinderling V. Leu M. Ehler E. Perriard J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Endogenous proteins were localized with the monoclonal antibody to PLZF (Calbiochem) at 1:10 dilution and the polyclonal antibody to DRAL/FHL2 (25Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M.G. Schafer B.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) at 1:100. NIH3T3 cells were fixed and permeabilized as described (26Scholl F.A. McLoughlin P. Ehler E. de Giovanni C. Schafer B.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), prior to staining with anti-DRAL/FHL2 at 1:100 dilution, followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:400 dilution. Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst staining. The full-length cDNA for PLZF was cloned in-frame into pACT, the mammalian two-hybrid system VP16 activation domain expression vector (Promega Checkmate System). 293T cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105cells/60-mm dish. The following day 1 μg each of pBIND-DRAL and pACT-PLZF were transfected, together with 1 μg of the GAL4-responsive reporter pG5luc. pRSV-β-Gal was included in all transfections at a concentration of 100 ng/dish to correct for transfection efficiency. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (Promega β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System) and luciferase activity (Promega Luciferase Assay System). Similar experiments were performed using the DRAL/FHL2 and PLZF deletion constructs as described under “Results.” Results are presented as fold activation of normalized luciferase activity in the presence of DRAL/FHL2 and/or PLZF compared with normalized activity in the presence of empty vectors and are the average of at least four independent experiments. Western blotting of cell extracts was performed using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at 1:1500 dilution, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), and developed using Tropix Western Light kit (Applied Biosystems). A reporter construct containing four high affinity PLZF-binding sites found in the IL3Rα chain promoter was used to measure transcriptional activity (IL3Rα-tk-luc), and a tk-luc construct without the specific PLZF-binding sites was used as negative control. 3 × 105 293T cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and transfected the following day. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h. Transfection efficiency was normalized using β-galactosidase activity produced by pRSV-β-gal included in all transfections. Total DNA transfected was the same for all samples using empty vector DNA. Results are presented as fold repression of normalized luciferase activity in the presence of PLZF and/or effectors compared with normalized activity in the presence of empty expression vectors. Results are the average of four individual experiments. For inhibition of histone deacetylase, cells were transfected as described in the presence of 6 mm sodium butyrate. For repression assays in NIH3T3 cells, 6 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% FCS and transfected 20 h later with pcDNA3-DRAL; post-transfection cells were maintained in 0.5% FCS. 24 h later pSG5-PLZF and the IL3Rα-tk-luc reporter were transfected. Following this second transfection cells were given either 10 or 0.5% FCS for 3 h as indicated in the figure legend and were thereafter assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Western blotting of cell extracts was performed using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at 1:1500 dilution, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), and developed using Tropix Western Light kit (Applied Biosystems). In order to identify potential binding partners for DRAL/FHL2 as well as to further delineate its molecular role, we have exploited the yeast two-hybrid system. A human adult cardiac cDNA library was selected for screening since we and others have shown previously (23Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C.

McLoughlin P. Ehler E. de Giovanni C. Schafer B.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An inducible LexA-based two-hybrid system was used, and ∼1 × 107independent clones were screened yielding a large number of putative positive clones upon selection for interacting transformants. Based on its described growth-suppressive properties, one of these was selected for further characterization, namely the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein, PLZF (41Shaknovich R. Yeyati P.L.

To confirm the DRAL/FHL2-PLZF interaction, LexA-DRAL/FHL2 and B42-PLZF yeast plasmids were tested for their in vivo interaction in a liquid β-galactosidase assay (Table I). PLZF fused to the B42-activation domain interacts with DRAL/FHL2 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain, thus increasing β-galactosidase reporter activity to a level comparable with that of the positive control LexA DNA-BD-p53 and B42 AD-SV40 large T antigen, whereas either plasmid alone or in combination with SV40 large T antigen or p53, respectively, did not result in β-galactosidase activity (Table I).Table IYeast two-hybrid interactionsLexA DNA-BD constructLexA AD constructRelative β-galactosidase activity1-aβ-Galactosidase activity was measured in liquid assay using O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside and is representative of three independent experiments.DRALPLZF690DRALSV40 large T antigen0.2p53PLZF0.3p53SV40 large T antigen10401-a β-Galactosidase activity was measured in liquid assay using O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside and is representative of three independent experiments.

Blood. 2001; 98: 3290-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); only when PLZF expression is induced can DRAL/FHL2 also be precipitated by the anti-PLZF antibody (Fig. 1, IP −tet), suggesting an interaction between DRAL/FHL2 and PLZF both in the yeast two-hybrid system as well as in mammalian cells. At this juncture, having demonstrated an interaction between the two proteins, it was instructive to attempt to define the domains required for the interaction. Therefore we first performed an in vitroprotein binding assay. 35S-Labeled in vitrotranslated PLZF or deletion constructs thereof (Fig.2 A) were incubated with GST-DRAL/FHL2 recombinant protein (25Genini M.

https://openalex.org/W2154762758,"We found a novel human gene (GenBankTM accession number AB037823, Kazusa DNA Research Institute KIAA1402) that possesses homology with chondroitin synthase. The full-length open reading frame consists of 772 amino acids and encodes a typical type II membrane protein. This enzyme had a domain containing β3-glycosyltransferase motifs, which might be a β3-glucuronyltransferase domain, but no domain with β4-glycosyltransferase motifs, although both are found in chondroitin synthase. The putative catalytic domain was expressed in COS-7 cells as a soluble enzyme. Its glucuronyltransferase activity was observed when chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate polysaccharides and oligosaccharides were used as acceptor substrates. However, it was not detected when dermatan sulfate, hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, heparin,N-acetylheparosan, lactosamine tetrasaccharide, and linkage tri- and tetrasaccharide acceptors were employed. The reaction product, which was speculated to exhibit a GlcAβ1–3GalNAc linkage structure at its non-reducing terminus, showed the following characteristics. 1) It was catabolized by β-glucuronidase. 2) It was an acceptor for Escherichia coli K4 chondroitin polymerase (K4 chondroitin polymerase). 3) The product of K4 chondroitin polymerase was cleaved by chondroitinase ACII. On the other hand, noN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity was detected toward any acceptors. Quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed that its transcripts were highly expressed in the placenta, small intestine, and pancreas, although they were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and cell lines. This enzyme could play a role in the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate as a glucuronyltransferase. We found a novel human gene (GenBankTM accession number AB037823, Kazusa DNA Research Institute KIAA1402) that possesses homology with chondroitin synthase.

They consist of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and core proteins. Chondroitin has repeating disaccharide units of (GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4)n following a linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-protein) that is bound to serine residues in the core proteins. CS is sulfated at both GlcA and GalNAc (1Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The C-2 and C-3 positions of GlcA and the C-4 and C-6 positions of GalNAc are the sites possibly sulfated by the respective sulfotransferases. The CS proteoglycans are distributed in various tissues, especially the brain, tendon, skin, muscle, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells, contributing to the physical strength of tissues, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and so on (2Oohira A.

The diversity of chain length and sulfation is related to the biological roles of CS. The sulfation profiles of CS vary with aging in the cartilage (6Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C.

Disulfated disaccharide units, CS-D (GlcA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S)) and CS-E (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)) promote the outgrowth of neurites in rat brain (1Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The sulfation is also related to chondroitin chain elongation and termination (8Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the presence of bovine serum, UDP-GalNAc and various kinds of sulfated (GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4)n and 6-O- or 4-O-sulfated GalNAc in the acceptor stimulate GalNAc-T activity, whereas terminal 3-O-sulfated GlcA or penultimate 4,6-O-disulfated GalNAc inhibits it. Heparan sulfate (HS), which also has the GAG structure, consists of repeating units of (GlcAβ1–4GlcNAcα1–4)n on the same linkage tetrasaccharide as that of CS. The molecular cloning of glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of HS has progressed further than that of the counterparts in CS synthesis. For the synthesis of the linkage tetrasaccharide, four glycosyltransferases, namely glucuronyltransferase-I (GlcAT-I), β1,3-galactosyltransferase-VI (β3Gal-T6), β1,4-galactosyltransferase-VII (β4Gal-T7), and a xylosyltransferase, are required, and they have been cloned and identified (9Almeida R.

Five glycosyltransferases, EXT1, EXT2, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3, are known to participate in the synthesis of heparan in addition to the four enzymes involved in formation of the linkage tetrasaccharide. EXT1 and EXT2 are heparan synthases that have both α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (α4Gn-T) and β1,4-glucuronyltransferase (β4GlcA-T) activity and elongate the heparan units for polymerization (14Lind T.

Three enzymes, EXTL1, EXTL2 and EXT3, have α4Gn-T activity but no β4GlcA-T activity. EXTL2 and EXTL3 initiate the synthesis of heparan (17Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) by adding GlcNAc with an α1,4-linkage to the linkage tetrasaccharide. EXTL1 and EXTL3 can transfer a GlcNAc residue to heparan polymers (18Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). An enzyme having only β4GlcA-T activity has not been identified in the synthesis of HS. The five enzymes known to be involved in the synthesis possess conserved amino acid sequences as motifs in their putative catalytic domains. If the mechanism of synthesis for CS is similar to that for HS, the many enzymes responsible for the process may form a family. Very recently, two glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of CS have been cloned and identified. Chondroitin synthase (CSS) shows two types of activity, i.e. β1,3-glucuronyltransferase (β3GlcA-T) and β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β4GalNAc-T) activity, each of which was detected separately in vitro, and did not show activity for chondroitin chain polymerization (19Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). CSS exhibited relatively high levels of activity toward chondroitin polymer but lower levels toward chondroitin oligosaccharide or CS. It was ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and highly expressed in the placenta. The other glycosyltransferase is a CS-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CSGalNAc-T) which exhibits β4GalNAc-T but not β3GlcA-T activity (20Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura Ji J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The progress made with the human genome project and other data bases, such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNAs, has enabled us to search for novel genes that are homologous to known genes. We searched the data bases utilizing the amino acid sequences of β3-glycosyltransferase (β3GT) family paying particular attention to the existence of a transmembrane domain and the conserved motif regions. We found a novel gene with homology to CSS. In the present study, we cloned and analyzed a third enzyme involved in the synthesis of CS. This enzyme, named CSGlcA-T, shows β3GlcA-T but not β4GalNAc-T activity toward the GalNAc residue of CS. UDP-[14C]GlcA (313 mCi/mmol) and UDP-[3H]GalNAc (7.0 Ci/mmol) were from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Chondroitin (a chemically desulfated derivative of shark cartilage CS-C,M r 20,000), CS (type C, shark cartilage,M r 20,000), hyaluronan (rooster comb,M r 800,000), dermatan sulfate (pig skin,M r 15,000), HS (pig aorta,M r 47,000), and chondroitinase ACII were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Testicular hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35, H6254, type V, from sheep testes), β-glucuronidase (EC3.2.1.31, G0501, type B-10, from bovine liver), heparin (bovine intestine, M r 10,000), Galβ1–3GalNAcα-O-benzyl, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads were from Sigma. A SuperdexTMpeptide HR10/30 column, HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30-pg column, Fast Desalting column HR10/10, and PD10 desalting columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-methoxyphenyl, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-methoxyphenyl, and Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc were provided by Seikagaku Corp. We performed a BLAST search of the EST data bases and identified two cDNAs (GenBankTM accession numberAB037823 and Kazusa DNA Research Institute number KIAA1402), homologous in amino acid sequence to the open reading frame of CSS (AB023207 and KIAA0990) (19Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). pBluescript II SK(+) containing the CSGlcA-T cDNA was purchased from Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The 5.4-kbNarI-BamHI fragment from the plasmid was blunted, attached with HindIII linkers on both sides, and circularized using T4 DNA ligase. The deleted plasmid was digested with HindIII and NotI, and the 2.3-kb fragment was inserted into pFLAG-CMV-3 (Sigma) (pFLAG-CSGlcA-T). By using this recombination, the first 33 amino acids of the putative CSGlcA-T were replaced with a preprotrypsin secretion signal and a FLAG peptide. COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were transfected with the expression plasmid using TransFastTM (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pFLAG-CMV-3 with no insert was used in the preparation of control transfectants. Stable transfectants were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G and then cloned by limiting dilution. Cloned cell lines were tested for the synthesis and secretion of recombinant protein by immunoprecipitation and following Western blotting using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). The secreted enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography using anti-FLAG M2-agarose gel (Sigma). The conditioned medium and gel mixed overnight at 4 °C were centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The gel was washed twice with 10 ml of 20% (v/v) glycerol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A) to obtain a 50% slurry. The immobilized enzyme was stable at 4 °C for at least 4 weeks. Glycosaminoglycan polymers were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. For GlcA-T assay, chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin, hyaluronan, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and N-acetylheparosan were digested with β-glucuronidase prior to the assay. Briefly, 1 mg of each polymer was digested with 100 units of β-glucuronidase in a total volume of 1 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for overnight. The digests were then boiled for 20 min, followed by extraction of the denatured enzyme by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Glycosaminoglycan polymers were recovered by ethanol precipitation from the resultant supernatants that were neutralized with sodium hydroxide. Oligosaccharides of CS, chondroitin, and hyaluronan were prepared as described previously (21Gundlach M.W. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the preparation of oligosaccharides with even numbers (4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-saccharides), each polymer (10 mg) was partially digested with 1,000 turbidity reducing units of testicular hyaluronidase in 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl at 37 °C for the appropriate periods. For the preparation of oligosaccharides with odd numbers (5-, 7-, 9-, 11-, and 13-saccharides), the hyaluronidase digests were boiled for 10 min and further digested with 1,000 units of β-glucuronidase at 37 °C for 24 h. After inactivation of the enzyme by boiling for 10 min and centrifugation at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant of the digests was fractionated on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30-pg column (16 × 600 mm) with 0.2 mNH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 2 ml per min, whereas absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. The peak fractions were pooled, desalted on a PD10 desalting column with distilled water as an eluent, and measured for uronic acid content by the Bitter-Muir method usingd-glucuronolactone as a standard (22Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). The desalted solution was lyophilized and redissolved with distilled water at a concentration of 1 mm for each oligosaccharide. FLAG-tagged CSGlcA-T fusion protein in the medium of stable transfectants was purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 agarose gel (Sigma) as described in previous study (23Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The amount of recombinant protein recovered was estimated by immunoblotting. It was separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore), and probed with an anti-FLAG peptide antibody BioM2 (Sigma). The FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Met-FLAG-BAP, molecular mass of 49.2 kDa) was used as a standard to estimate the relative amount, as described previously (23Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Blotting and probing were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Immune complexes and the positive bands were detected using the ECL detection system (AmershamBiosciences) with 10-s exposures. The CSGlcA-T and BAP protein bands were quantified by densitometric scanning of the digitized image using NIH image (version 1.61) software on a Macintosh computer (Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, CA). The standard curve for each substrate was plotted by increasing the amount of FLAG-tagged BAP protein on the same blotting membrane as the CSGlcA-T samples. As the band intensity and the concentration of the recombinant CSGlcA-T protein (90 kDa) in the medium exhibited a linear correlation, the amounts of recombinant CSGlcA-T protein were estimated from the standard curve, using known amounts of FLAG-tagged BAP protein (49.2 kDa). The amount of recombinant CSGlcA-T protein is expressed in arbitrary units, with each unit of intensity equivalent to 10 ng of FLAG-tagged BAP protein. The glycosyltransferase activity was investigated with radioactive forms of UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalNAc, and various acceptor saccharide substrates, including polymer chondroitin (1 and 100 μg), various CS variants (1 and 100 μg each), hyaluronan (1 and 100 μg), HS (1 and 100 μg), heparin (1 and 100 μg), β-glucuronidase-catabolized polymers, oligosaccharides of chondroitin, CS, and hyaluronan (1 nmol each). The reaction mixture for GalNAc-T contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads and acceptor substrate, 0.036 nmol of UDP-[3H]GalNAc (5.55 × 105 dpm), 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 171 μm sodium salt of ATP in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction mixture for GlcA-T contained 10 μl of the resuspended gel and the acceptor substrate, 0.432 nmol of UDP-[14C]GlcA (3.00 × 105 dpm), 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, and 10 mmMnCl2 in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then radiolabeled products were separated from free UDP-[3H]GalNAc or UDP-[14C]GlcA by gel filtration using a SuperdexTM Peptide HR10/30 column (10 × 300 mm) with 0.2 m NaCl as an eluent or a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30-pg column (16 × 600 mm) with 0.2 mNH4HCO3 as an eluent. The recovered labeled products were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For the acceptor substrates of oligosaccharides with an aromatic residue (methoxyphenyl- or benzyl-) at the reducing terminus, reaction products were diluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (100 mg; Waters Associates, Milford, MA). After the cartridge had been washed with 3 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and then 3 ml of water, the product was eluted with 50% methanol, and the radioactivity of all fractions was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The GlcA-T activity was determined by calculating the amounts of GlcA incorporated, using the known specific radioactivity. K m values for the chondroitin sulfate undecasaccharide (CS11) and UDP-GlcA were obtained by measuring the GlcA-T activity as a function of substrate concentration. The Michaelis-Menten equation was applied to initial rate data using a non-linear least square regression program (24Kubota T. Yoshikawa S. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The products of the CSGlcA-T reaction with GalNAcβ1–4(GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4)4 were isolated by gel filtration column chromatography using a Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and desalted with Fast Desalting column HR10/10 using distilled water as an eluent, and 10 nmol of (GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4)5 was added and lyophilized. The dried sample (about 20 pmol of radiolabeled material) was incubated with 100 milliunits of chondroitinase ACII in a total volume of 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm sodium acetate at 37 °C for 1 h or 1 unit of β-glucuronidase in a total volume of 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzyme digests were analyzed again using the same Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column as described above. In order to identify the linkage structure, we determined whether the product could serve as an acceptor for K4 chondroitin polymerase that can synthesize chondroitin (25Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 20 pmol of radiolabeled materials were lyophilized in the absence of cold CS10, and served as substrates for K4 chondroitin polymerase. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in a 50-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm MnCl2, 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4, 1 methyleneglycol, 20 pmol of radiolabeled [14C]CS10, 30 nmol each of UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc, and 0.8 μg of the enzyme preparation, followed by boiling for 1 min to stop the reaction. The reaction products were analyzed using the Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column described above. For quantification of CSGlcA-T and CSS transcripts, we employed the real time PCR method, as described in detail previously (26Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M.

Marathon ReadyTM cDNAs derived from various human tissues and cells were purchased from CLONTECH. Standard curves for the CSGlcA-T, CSS cDNAs, and the endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs, were generated by serial dilution of a pBluescript II SK(+) vector containing the CSGlcA-T gene andCSS, and a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) containing theGAPDH gene. The primer sets and the probes for CSGlcA-T and CSS are as follows: the forward primer for CSGlcA-T was 5′-GTGAAATAGAACAACTGCAGGCTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAGAAGGTGTGCTGCTCTGTGA-3′; the probe for CSGlcA-T was 5′-CGGAACCTGACCGTGC-3′ with a minor groove binder (29Kutyavin I.V. Afonina I.A. Mills A. Gorn V.V. Lukhtanov E.A. Belousov E.S. Singer M.J. Walburger D.K. Lokhov S.G. Gall A.A. Dempcy R. Reed M.W. Meyer R.B. Hedgpeth J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar); the forward primer for CSS was 5′-AGTGTGTCTGGTCTTATGAGATGCA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AGCTGTGGAGCCTGTACTGGTAG-3′; and the probe for CSS was 5′-ATGAGAATTACGAGCAGAAC-3′ with a minor groove binder. A BLAST search was performed with amino acid sequences of β3GT family, as query sequences. Two cDNA matches (GenBankTM accession number AB037823 and Kazusa DNA Research Institute number KIAA1402) were found. The putative amino acid sequences are shown in Fig.1 A. They contained an open reading frame of 2316 bp, 772 amino acids, encoding a typical type II membrane protein with three possible N-glycosylation sites. A comparison of the cDNA with the genomic sequence on chromosome 7 revealed that the CSGlcA-T gene consisted of at least four exons (Fig. 1 B), whereas the gene for CSS was found to consist of at least three exons located on chromosome 15. This enzyme had homology with CSS in the putative catalytic domain as shown in Fig.1 A. However, a clear difference was observed in their domain structures. As shown in Fig.2 A, CSS has two domains, β3 and β4, besides the transmembrane domain.

Although structural comparison among HCV NS5B, poliovirus 3D-pol, and human immunodeficiency virus-reverse transcriptase RNA-dependent polymerase reveals the canonical palm, fingers, and thumb domains, the crystal structure of HCV NS5B highlights the presence of a unique A1-loop, which extends from the fingers to the thumb domain (amino acids 12–46), providing many contact points for the proposed “closed” conformation of the enzyme. The polymerase also possesses a tunnel, which starts at the active site and terminates on the back surface of the enzyme. This tunnel of 19 Å contains five basic amino acids, which may be engaged in NTP trafficking. In the present study, we exploited the crystal structure of the enzyme to elucidate the involvement of these two structural motifs in enzyme activity by site-directed mutagenesis. As predicted, the replacement of leucine 30 located in the Λ1-loop is detrimental to the NS5B activity. Heparin-Sepharose column chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments strongly suggest a local alteration in the structure of the Leu-30 mutant. An analysis of amino acid substitutions in Arg-222 and Lys-151 within the putative NTP tunnel indicates that Arg-222 was critical in delivering NTPs to the active site, whereas Lys-151 was dispensable. Interestingly, the substitution of lysine 151 for a glutamic acid resulted in an enzyme that was consistently more active in de novo synthesis as well as by “copy-back” mechanism of a self-primed substrate when compared with the wild type NS5B enzyme. Burst kinetic analyses indicate that the gain in function of K151E enzyme was primarily the result of the formation of more productive pre-initiation complexes that were used for the elongation reaction.

J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2000; 30: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Approximately 80% of the infected individuals will remain chronically infected for decades and may eventually develop severe liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (2World Health Organization. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1415Google Scholar). In the absence of a prophylactic vaccine or a specific antiviral agent, the best treatment currently available for HCV infection is the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin (3Reichard O. Norkrans G. Fryden A. Bracanier J.H. Sonnerborg A. Weiland O. Swedish Study Group Lancet. 1998; 351: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). HCV is an enveloped virus belonging to the hepacivirus gender in the Flaviviridae family, which also includes the flavivirus and pestivirus (4Murphy F.A. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Ghabrial S.A. Jarvis A.W. Martelli G.P. Mayo M.A. Summers M.D. Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses: Sixth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Springer-Verlag, Vienna1995: 424-426Google Scholar). The single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome is ∼9.5 kb in length and produces a single polyprotein of 3010–3040 amino acids (5Clarke B. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2397-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The polyprotein is processed by a combination of viral and cellular proteases, giving rise to at least 10 individual proteins (6Bartenschlager R. Antiviral. Chem. Chemother. 1997; 8: 281-301Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the absence of a permissive cell culture replication system, the knowledge of HCV replication has been derived mainly from alternative in vitro systems or from the biochemical characterization of individual viral proteins (7Bartenschlager R. Ahlborn-Laake L. Mous J. Jacobsen H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Baumert T.F. Ito S. Wong D.T. Liang T.J. J.

Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). Among these viral proteins, the HCV polymerase (NS5B), which is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), has been investigated extensively because it is the prime-target for the development of antiviral drug (12Ferrari E. Wright-Minogue J. Fang J.W.S. Baroudy B.M. Lau J.Y.N. Hong Z. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lohmann V. Körner K. Herian U. Bartenschlager R. J.

Commun. 1997; 232: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). HCV polymerase activity was first reported using self-priming mechanism (copy-back) in which the RNA folds back intramolecularly. However, copy-back replication is rather nonspecific and is unlikely to be used by the virus in vivo (16Oh J.W. Ito T. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, RNA replication by HCV NS5B has been reported by de novo synthesis (17Kao C.C. Yang X. Kline A. Wang Q.M. Barket D. Heinz B.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Luo G. Hamatake R.K. Mathis D.M. Racela J. Rigat K.L. Lemm J. Colonno R.J. J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Kao C.C. Del Vecchio A.M. Zhong W. Virology. 1999; 253: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Kao C.C. Sun J.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6826-6830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kim M.J. Zhong W. Hong Z. Kao C.C. J.

Virology. 1996; 226: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). De novo RNA synthesis appears to be an attractive model for viral RNA replication because no genetic information is lost during the replication. Furthermore, no additional enzymes are needed to generate the primer or to cleave the region between template and newly synthesized RNA. However, de novoinitiation of RNA synthesis is relatively inefficient in vitro and requires very high concentrations of GTP, which is the initiating nucleotide incorporated into the template. With the recent resolution of the NS5B crystal structure (26Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M., De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 27Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), certain unique structural elements of the enzyme have been highlighted (see Fig. 1). Although the canonical palm, fingers and thumb domains as well as the putative NTP tunnel are well conserved among HCV NS5B, poliovirus 3D-pol, and human immunodeficiency virus-reverse transcriptase enzymes, the space between the fingers and the thumb domains of NS5B is unexpectedly small, giving rise to a proposed “closed” conformation, which has also been identified for the double-stranded RNA polymerase of φ6 (28Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Based on their crystal structures, both enzymes possess a loop that connects the fingers with the thumb. This loop, previously called Λ1 on the HCV NS5B structure, could be the major element responsible for the closed conformation of HCV NS5B and φ6 polymerase and might play a key role in the “clamping” motion of these enzymes. Another interesting feature of the HCV polymerase is the presence of a β-hairpin that hangs over the active site. Although the function of this unique structure is unclear, it has been suggested that the β-hairpin may function as a gate to position the very 3′-end of the RNA at the active site (29Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y.N. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of the enzyme indicates that the space underneath the β-hairpin is not sufficient to allow the passage of a double stranded-RNA structure. Therefore, the β-hairpin should exhibit the flexibility to move to accommodate the elongation of the nascent double-stranded RNA. The NTP tunnel is a common structural motif observed for RNA-dependent polymerases. Although it is logical to hypothesize that the negatively charged incoming NTPs interact sequentially with positively charged amino acids to reach the active site within the NTP tunnel, systematic analysis of the nucleotide involvement in such trafficking has not been examined. In this study, we exploited the crystal structure of the HCV NS5B polymerase to analyze the involvement of specific residues on the overall RdRP activity. To delineate whether the Λ1-loop is involved in keeping the enzyme in a “closed” conformation, we mutated leucine 30, which exhibits strong hydrophobic interaction with the thumb domain to polar residues (an arginine or a serine). Furthermore, the role of the basic amino acids in NTP trafficking was analyzed by mutating the last positively charged amino acid (arginine 222) in close proximity to the active site and the first amino acid (lysine 151) located at the beginning of the NTP tunnel. Our data indicate that most of these point mutations modulate the NS5B activity and the Λ1-loop is a critical element in determining the activity of the enzyme. More interestingly, real-time analytical ultracentrifugation analyses demonstrated that both the wild type and mutant enzymes are monomeric in solution, whereas oligomeric forms of the enzymes can be induced by short RNA template binding. The HCV NS5B protein (HCV-BK) lacking the 21 C-terminal amino acids was expressed in pET-24b containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. All single point mutations were derived from the pET-24b/NS5B plasmid using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Protein production from Escherichia coli, BL21(DE3) was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm imidazole, 2.5% glycerol, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and passed through a French press apparatus (25,000 p.s.i.; three times). The cytosolic fraction after centrifugation (35,000 rpm for 30 min; SA600 rotor) was applied to a nickel column (Superflow, Qiagen). After washing with lysis buffer, the protein was eluted from the column with a lysis buffer containing 350 mm NaCl and 200 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was then applied to a HiTrapTM heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently washed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 350 mmNaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 2.5% glycerol. Protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl (350–900 mm). After an overnight dialysis against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mmNaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol, the protein was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Stock enzyme was tested for the presence of contaminating RNase using RNaseAlertTM(Ambion). To analyze the biophysical state of the wild type enzyme and some of the substitution variants, 6 μg of NS5B enzyme or 20 μg of BSA were loaded on top of a sucrose step gradient (2 ml) containing 10, 20, 25, 30, and 35% of sucrose in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Gradients were centrifuged at 85,000 ×g for 24 h. Fractions were collected using the Auto Densi-FlowTM IIC collector (Buchler Instruments) and subsequently analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by the Silver Stain Plus detection kit (Bio-Rad). The sucrose concentration of each fraction was determined using the ABBE-3L refractometer (Milton Roy). Samples were prepared in 20 mm Trizma (Tris base), 500 mm sodium chloride, and 3% glycerol at pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 1 μm protein. Samples containing RNA were adjusted to 500 mm in sodium chloride to reduce nonspecific RNA-protein interactions. The partial specific volume of the proteins was calculated based on the amino acid composition, and the density of the solvent was calculated from the chemical composition of the buffer using the computer program SEDNTERP and adjusted for temperature. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman model XLI/XLA analytical ultracentrifuge operating at a rotor speed of 35,000 rpm and 20 °C using 390 μl loaded into two-channel carbon-Epon centerpieces in an An-Ti 60 rotor. Data were collected in continuous mode, at a single wavelength (280 nm) with a step size of 0.006 cm without signal averaging. Multiple scans at different time points were fitted to a continuous size distribution using the program SEDFIT (30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). To measure the polymerase activity of the NS5B mutants, a 369-nucleotide RNA called pOF was used as a template.

The standard nucleotide incorporation reaction was performed as described below unless indicated otherwise in the figure legend. Reactions were performed in a volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 nm NS5B enzyme, 20 nmpOF, 20 units of RNasin, 50 μg/ml BSA, 100 μm UTP, CTP, and ATP, 5 μm GTP, and 2.5 μCi of [α-33P]GTP. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min and stopped by addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The reaction mixture was filtered through a 96-well plate DEAE filter paper (Millipore) and washed (five times) with 200 μl of 0.5 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The plates were air-dried for 10 min, and 50 μl of Scintisafe PlusTM 50% (Fisher Scientific) was added for scintillation counting using a β-counter (Wallac). The pOF RNA was used as a template for the burst experiment. Briefly, 40 nm enzyme was pre-incubated with 40 nm pOF RNA for 4 h at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 20 units of RNasin (final volume: 25 μl). At the end of the pre-incubation period, the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and subsequently initiated by the addition of 25 μl of a pre-heated buffer (37 °C) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 800 ng/ml heparin, 100 μm CTP, ATP, and UTP, 5 μm GTP, and 2.5 μCi of [α-33P]GTP. At each end point, the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 0.5m EDTA. For gel analysis of the burst experiment, the same procedure was performed except that the reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of phenol:chloroform (1:1). After protein extraction, the labeled RNA was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 20 μg of glycogen. RNA was resuspended in 20 μl of glyoxal loading buffer (Ambion) and resolved in a 2.5% agarose gel. All four homopolymeric templates (poly(U), -(A), -(C), and -(G)) were purchased from Sigma. The dinucleotide primers synthesized with a 5′-phosphate (pGG, pCC, pUU, and pAA) were purchased from Oligo Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). For standard experiments, a 50-μl reaction was performed using 20 nm enzyme, 20 nm homopolymeric template, and 15 μmcomplementary dinucleotide primer pGG, pAA, or pCC or 80 μm pUU. The reaction was performed essentially in the same reaction condition as for the copy-back RNA synthesis, except that the respective nucleotides were used at 100 μm. Under our conditions, the initiation of de novo synthesis by the NS5B mutants was observed only for poly(C) homopolymeric template but not poly(A), poly(U), or poly(G). To determine the K m and V maxvalues, reactions were performed in quadruplicate using 20 nm enzyme, 20 nm poly(C), and 0–2.0 mm GTP under the same reaction conditions as for the copy-back RNA synthesis. To examine the incorporation of the third and fourth nucleotides following a de novo initiation, a 23-mer RNA (5′-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAGUCC-3′) was used as a template. The reaction was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 250 nm NS5B enzyme, 250 nm 23-mer template, 20 units of RNasin, 50 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm GTP, and 25 μCi of [α-33P]ATP or 100 μm ATP and 25 μCi of [α-33P]CTP. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 0–10 min and stopped by addition of an equal volume of phenol chloroform. After protein extraction, the labeled RNA was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 3.0 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 20 μg of glycogen. RNA was resuspended in 4 μl of TBE-urea sample buffer (Novex) and resolved on a 25% TBE-urea acrylamide gel. The wild type and amino acid substituted variants of NS5B enzyme were purified to near homogeneity (>90%) by sequential chromatography using a nickel and a heparin-Sepharose (HS) column, respectively, as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig.2 A). Analysis of these preparations showed that they did not contain any contaminating protease or RNase activities (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Tracing of the salt elution profile of the enzyme from HS column indicated that the wild type enzyme and most of the variant NS5B proteins eluted at ∼400 mm sodium chloride (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, two point mutants containing the L30R and L30S substitutions, respectively, were eluted at a higher salt concentration (600 mm NaCl) from the HS column. The biophysical state of the NS5B wild type and point mutant proteins was analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, which indicated that the sedimentation profiles were similar to that of the bovine serum albumin protein (data not shown). This observation suggests that the proteins were likely monomeric in solution. These preparations were subsequently used for biochemical characterization of the enzyme. As described previously, NS5B can utilize an RNA molecule that folds back intramolecularly at the 3′-OH end as a substrate to catalyze complementary strand synthesis resulting in a copy-back double-stranded RNA product (9Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). For the experiments described herein, the copy-back substrate was a 369-nucleotide RNA derived from the poliovirus 3′-end, pOF. This RNA contains two uridines at the 3′-OH end that can fold back to pair with adenosine residues in an adjoining polyadenosine stretch, which is located four nucleotides upstream of the uridine residues. To optimize the reaction condition, the effects of temperature and divalent cations on the enzyme activity were examined. The enzyme activity was 20-fold higher at 37 °C when compared with 21 °C (data not shown). In contrast to previous reports, the enzyme activity was 4 times higher when magnesium was used as a divalent cation rather than manganese (Fig.3 A) (12Ferrari E. Wright-Minogue J. Fang J.W.S.

Using these optimal conditions (37 °C and 5 mm MgCl2), a titration of each enzyme preparation using 20 nm RNA substrate showed that an enzyme concentration of 20 nm(data not shown) and 90 min of incubation defined the upper linear range for the enzyme (Fig. 3 B). The resolved crystal structure of the NS5B enzyme exhibits a “closed” conformation (26Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M., De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 27Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we hypothesized that the unique Λ1-loop shown in Fig.1 A is likely engaged in coordinating the movement of the thumb and fingers domains. Within this loop, leucine 30 has multiple interactions with a hydrophobic pocket of the thumb domain (Fig.1 A). Perturbation of this hydrophobic pocket could result in local alteration of the loop at the contact sites with the thumb, which might subsequently lead to an “open” conformation of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, two point mutations were introduced at this location, i.e. L30R and L30S. During the chromatography process, these point mutants containing the L30R or L30S substitutions bound to the HS column with higher affinity when compared with the other proteins as reflected by their elution maxima (600 mmNaCl) (see Fig. 2 B). This altered chromatographic behavior is highly suggestive of a conformational change, which in turn may modify the numbers of charge of these mutants available to interact with the resin (Fig. 2 B). More importantly, both of these mutant enzymes were inactive in the polymerase assay using pOF as a template and [α-33P]GTP as a label (Fig.3 B). Nevertheless, very low enzyme activity could be detected when an enzyme titration using [α-33P]UTP as the only source of nucleotide triphosphate was performed (Fig.4). The basal level of nucleotide incorporation was observed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A) and was NS5B-specific because a “dead” enzyme (GDD/GAA), in which the essential GDD motif had been replaced by GAA did not exhibit any nucleotide incorporation under the same assay conditions (Fig. 4 B). However, the L30S and L30R mutants incorporated 60 and 66 times less UMP, respectively, when compared with the wt-NS5B (data not shown). To determine whether there is a structural change in the mutant enzyme, the global shape of L30S was compared with that of the wt-enzyme by analytical ultracentrifugation. The results shown in Fig. 5 Asuggest that the global shapes of both enzymes where similar (see below). Taken together, this biophysical analysis and the chromatographic behavior of the L30S mutant support the notion that a rather local structural modification had occurred at the contact sites between the Λ1-loop and the thumb. Because these single amino acid substitutions were detrimental to NS5B activity, we attempted to restore the structure and function of the L30S mutant by inserting compensatory mutations. To this end, serine 29 in the Λ1-loop was replaced by an aspartic acid in an attempt to create an ionic interaction with the arginine 503 of the thumb domain. For the same reason, histidine 428 was replaced by an asparagine to favor the creation of a hydrogen bond with serine 30 of the L30S mutant. Unfortunately, neither of these double mutants (L30S/S29D and L30S/H428N) were compensatory. Indeed, both of these mutants had chromatographic behavior and enzyme activity similar to that of the L30S mutant (data not shown).Figure 5Continuous size distribution analysis (analytical ultracentrifugation) of wild type and L30S mutant NS5B polymerase in the absence of RNA template (A), or in the presence of RNA template (B).

To define the quarternary structure of the wild type and mutant enzymes in the present study, analytical ultracentrifugation was employed to examine these proteins in solution in the presence or absence of RNA substrate. As shown in Fig. 5 A, both wt-NS5B and L30S enzymes had sedimentation coefficients of 3.9 and 3.6 S, respectively, under high ionic strength, consistent with monomeric molecular masses (see Table I). Similar S (Svedberg) values were obtained at low and physiological ionic strength (data not shown). Our data contradict the oligomeric interaction observed in the reported glycerol gradient fractionation (32Qin W. Luo H. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Yamashita T. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2132-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although the current study was conducted at low glycerol content (4%). Because the oligomeric state of the enzyme in the presence of an RNA template reflects a more biological phenomenon in the context of directing RNA synthesis, we examined the sedimentation coefficients of the proteins in the presence of a short hairpin RNA template (see Fig.5 C). Very similar hairpin loops have been utilized by NS5B enzyme to initiate de novo synthesis (17Kao C.C. Yang X. Kline A. Wang Q.M. Barket D. Heinz B.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). High ionic strength conditions were employed to reduce nonspecific binding of the RNA with the polymerase. To our surprise, a shift in the S values was observed for both the wt-NS5B and L30S mutant (Fig. 5 B). In the case of the wt-NS5B, the sedimentation velocity profiles fit well for two species of 5.2 and 8.0 S (Fig. 5 B). Analysis of the boundary spreading yielded molar masses of 74.9 and 145 kDa, consistent with RNA complexed with monomeric protein (74.9 kDa) or dimeric protein (145 kDa) (Table I). For the L30S mutant, three distinct peaks were observed with S values of 4.0, 6.5, and 9.4 corresponding to monomer, dimer, and potentially tetramer binding to the RNA. Small quantities of 14"

Here we demonstrate that menin interacts with a putative tumor metastasis suppressor nm23H1/nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase A in mammalian cells. Given the roles of nm23 as a multi-functional protein, we searched for the possible function of menin. Menin has no effect on the known activities of nm23; that is, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, protein kinase, or GTPase-activating protein for Ras-related GTPase Rad. However, we found that menin hydrolyzes GTP to GDP efficiently in the presence of nm23, whereas nm23 or menin alone shows little or no detectable GTPase activity. Furthermore, menin contains sequence motifs similar to those found in all known GTPases or GTP-binding proteins and shows low affinity but specific binding to GTP/GDP. These results suggest that menin is an atypical GTPase stimulated by nm23.

The responsible gene,MEN1, was localized to chromosome 11q13 (3Larsson C. Skogseid B. Oberg K. Nakamura Y. Nordenskjold M. Nature. 1988; 332: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and identified by positional cloning (4Chandrasekharappa S.C. Guru S.C. Manickam P. Olufemi S.E. Collins F.S. Emmert-Buck M.R.

Science. 1997; 276: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). More than 400 independent germ line or somatic mutations distributed over the entire MEN1 coding region have been identified (5Guo S.S. Sawicki M.P. Mol.

The majority are nonsense or frameshifts predicting a truncated product, but missense mutations have also been identified. The nature of the mutations, which are consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism, and the observation that the loss of both MEN1 alleles leads to tumor development support the prediction that MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene. Menin, the protein encoded by the MEN1 gene, contains 610 amino acids (4Chandrasekharappa S.C. Guru S.C. Manickam P. Olufemi S.E. Collins F.S. Emmert-Buck M.R. Debelenko L.V. Zhuang Z. Lubensky I.A.

Data base analysis of the menin protein sequence does not reveal homology to any other known proteins or any apparent conserved motifs, providing no clues as to its function. However, menin is found predominantly in the nucleus (12Guru S.C. Goldsmith P.K. Burns A.L. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Collins F.S. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the expression of menin increases as GH4 cells entered S phase (14Kaji H. Canaff L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5097-5101PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that menin expression may be cell cycle-regulated. Even so, little is known about the biological role of menin in tumorigenesis or normal cellular functions. We have recently identified a putative tumor metastasis suppressor nm23H1 as a menin-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (15Ohkura N. Kishi M. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1206-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nm23, a putative metastasis suppressor, was originally identified by subtraction cloning in murine melanomas of differing metastatic potential (16Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Talmadge J.E. Liotta L.A. Sobel M.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Transfection of nm23 cDNA into some tumor cell lines is associated with reduced metastatic potential (17Leone A. Flatow U. King C.R. Sandeen M.A. Margulies I.M.K. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and cell motility (18Kantor J.D. McCormick B. Steeg P.S. Zetter B.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1971-1973PubMed Google Scholar). It is also thought to be involved in development, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (19de la Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Nm23 belongs to a family of structurally and functionally conserved proteins of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP)1kinases that are major suppliers of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), where ATP is the phosphate donor (20Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In human tissue the two major isoforms are nm23H1 and nm23H2, which are identical to the NDP kinases A and B, respectively (16Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Talmadge J.E. Liotta L.A. Sobel M.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 21Stahl J.A. Leone A. Rosengard A.M. Porter L. King C.R. Steeg P.S. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 445-449PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, NDP kinase activity was the only known function of nm23, but nm23 has been shown to be a multi-functional protein with other possible roles. It can also function as a protein kinase and undergo autophosphorylation on histidine and serine residues (20Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22MacDonald N.J., De la Rosa A. Benedict M.A. Freije J.M. Krutsch H. Steeg P.S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nm23H1 has been shown to interact with Ras-related GTPase Rad and act as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rad, promoting the conversion of GTP associated with Rad to GDP (24Zhu J. Tseng Y.-H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we show that menin interacts with nm23 in mammalian cells, and the menin-nm23 interaction allowed us to find an unexpected activity of menin. Menin binds GTP with a low affinity and hydrolyzes GTP efficiently in the presence of nm23. Our data indicate that menin is an atypical GTPase stimulated by nm23. HEK293 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293 and COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Edge BioSystems) and with Polyfect transfection reagents (Qiagen), respectively. The cells were used in experiments 30 h after transfection. The FLAG-tagged expression vector pCMV-Tag2 or Myc-tagged expression vector pCMV-Tag3 (Stratagene) was used to express tagged proteins in the cultured mammalian cells. HEK293 cells in 100-mm dishes at 4 × 106 cells/dish were co-transfected with 10 μg of pCMV-Tag2-FLAG expression construct and 20 μg of pCMV-Tag3-Myc expression construct. The cells were lysed with 1.2 ml of low stringent lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and one Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/25 ml of buffer) and sonicated briefly. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-Myc-agarose affinity gel (Clontech) or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After washing four times with phosphate-buffered saline, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or anti-Myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (25Ohkura N. Yaguchi H. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the preparation of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, pGEX-5X-1 vectors were used (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion proteins were affinity-purified from the soluble fraction of cell extract with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NDP kinase activity was measured with [γ-32P]ATP as a phosphate donor and dCDP as an acceptor nucleotide. GST-nm23 (5 ng) was incubated with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and dCDP (10 μm) in 20 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) at room temperature for 20 min in the presence of 20 ng of either GST-menin or GST. At each time point, 1-μl aliquots were removed and directly spotted on the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate to resolve radioactive ATP and dCTP in 0.85 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.4). The labeled nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography and quantified with a bio- imaging analyzer (BAS2500; Fuji film). For in vivophosphorylation of menin, COS-7 cells plated at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish were transfected with 2 μg of FLAG-tagged menin expression construct. Metabolic labeling was carried out in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was performed as described above. Immunoprecipitated protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For in vitro kinase assay, ∼0.1 μg of GST-menin and 0.1 μg of GST-nm23 were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm DTT) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer, the samples were boiled, and the reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The Rad-GAP activity was assessed based on the method of Zhu et al. (24Zhu J. Tseng Y.-H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of GST-Rad bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was loaded with 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences) in assay buffer A consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 10 min, then washed 3 times with the same buffer at 4 °C. The [α-32P]GTP-Rad was incubated with 10 ng of GST-nm23 in the presence of 50 ng of GST-menin or GST in a final volume of 100 μl at room temperature, and at each time point, the bound nucleotides were eluted in 20 μl of elution buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 50 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 5 min. The labeled nucleotides were resolved by TLC and analyzed as described above. GST-menin (∼0.5 μg: 5 pmol) was incubated with or without GST-nm23 (0.5 ng) in 30 μl of assay buffer A at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.6 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. GST-Rad (5 pmol) and GST (5 pmol) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. At each time point, 1-μl aliquots were removed and directly spotted on TLC plates to resolve radioactive GDP and GTP and analyzed as described above. GTP hydrolysis assays were also performed using immunoprecipitates of FLAG-tagged proteins. HEK293 cells (4 × 106cells/dish) transfected with 30 μg of pCMV-Tag2-FLAG-expression constructs were lysed with either low-stringent lysis buffer described above or stringent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and one Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablet) and sonicated briefly. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins was performed as described above. After washing four times with phosphate-buffered saline, agarose beads were incubated with assay buffer A in a final volume of 100 μl, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.6 μCi of [α-32P]GTP at room temperature. The immunoprecipitates each contained ∼1 μg of protein. At each time point, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of elution buffer and heating at 65 °C for 5 min. The labeled nucleotides were resolved by TLC and analyzed as described above. For GTP hydrolysis assay of menin mutants, since the expression level of the mutants was lower than that of wild-type menin, cells were transfected with 30 μg of mutant plasmids or a smaller amount of wild-type plasmid (5 μg). The immunoprecipitates, each containing ∼0.2 μg of protein, were used. The positions of GTP, GDP, and GMP on the plates were visualized under UV light by using unlabeled standards. The GTP binding to menin was assessed with a modification of filter binding assay (26Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). GST-menin, GST-Rad, or GST (40 pmol) were incubated with [α-32P]GTP (1.5 μCi) in 30 μl of an exchange buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing the indicated concentrations of MgCl2 at room temperature. At given time points, aliquots of 8 μl were spotted in duplicate on BA 85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and then the filters were washed 3 times for 5-min with 10 ml of cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm DTT) containing the same concentrations of MgCl2 as used in the binding assay. The radioactivity remaining on the filters was quantified with a bio-imaging analyzer. GST-Rad and GST were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. To determine the relative GTP binding affinity, GST-menin or GST-Rad were incubated with 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in an exchange buffer in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled GTP for 60 min. To assess the specificity of GTP binding, GST-menin was incubated with 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in an exchange buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 as described above in the absence or presence of various nucleotides at various concentrations. Incubation was continued at room temperature for 60 min, after which 8-μl aliquots were spotted on filters, the filters were washed 3 times with cold washing buffer containing 20 mm MgCl2, and the radioactivity was determined as described above. Menin mutant constructs P12L, H139D, and P320L were generated by a PCR-based technique and cloned into pCMV-Tag2B expression vectors. All the constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. To study the expression levels, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors of one of the FLAG-tagged menin variants (15 μg) and FLAG-luciferase (15 μg) as a co-transfection marker to monitor transfection efficiency; the total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was equalized by adding empty vector. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the supernatant. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody as described above. We previously identified nm23 as a potential menin binding partner in a yeast two-hybrid screening system and confirmed this association in vitro by GST pull-down assays (15Ohkura N. Kishi M. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1206-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To further confirm this association, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation analysis in mammalian cells. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-menin or FLAG-luciferase and Myc-nm23 or Myc-luciferase, lysed with low-stringent buffer, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies. An anti-Myc monoclonal antibody co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-menin along with Myc-nm23 (Fig.1, lane 6) but did not co-immunoprecipitate FLAG-menin along with Myc-luciferase or FLAG-luciferase along with Myc-nm23 (lanes 4 and5). In the reciprocal immunoprecipitation, an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody co-immunoprecipitated Myc-nm23 along with FLAG-menin (Fig. 1, lane 9) but did not co-immunoprecipitate Myc-luciferase along with FLAG-menin or Myc-nm23 along with FLAG-luciferase (lanes 7and8). These results indicate that menin associated with nm23 in mammalian cells. To assess the functional implications of the binding of menin to nm23, we studied the effects of menin on the activities of nm23. Nm23 has been shown to be a multi-functional protein possessing a variety of enzymatic activities including NDP kinase, protein kinase, and GAP activities. First, to determine whether menin alters the NDP kinase activity of nm23, both proteins were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins, purified, and subjected to a NDP kinase assay. As shown in Fig.2 A, GST-nm23 was able to transfer γ-phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP to dCDP, forming [γ-32P]dCTP. GST-menin had little effect on the NDP kinase activity of nm23, although there was a slight decrease in the activity. GST alone as a negative control had no effect on NDP kinase activity. Next, we examined the possibility that menin is phosphorylated by nm23. There are 28 putative phosphorylation sites in menin (5Guo S.S. Sawicki M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but it has not yet been confirmed if menin is phosphorylated. To analyze the phosphorylation of menin, COS-7 cells transfected with plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged menin were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. We found that FLAG-menin was phosphorylated (Fig.2 B, lane 2). Then, to determine whether nm23 can phosphorylate menin, GST- menin and GST-nm23 were co-incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at room temperature. The phosphorylation of GST-menin was not detected on the addition of GST-nm23 (lane 3). In addition, autophosphorylation of nm23 (22MacDonald N.J., De la Rosa A. Benedict M.A. Freije J.M. Krutsch H. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25780-25789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not altered by the co-incubation with menin (lane 3). Nm23H1 was also shown to act as a specific GAP of the Ras-related GTPase Rad (24Zhu J. Tseng Y.-H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether menin affected the Rad-GAP activity of nm23. GST-Rad-Sepharose was loaded with [α-32P]GTP and incubated with or without GST-nm23 in the presence of GST-menin or GST. In the absence of nm23, we could not observe any detectable GTPase activity of Rad within 20 min (Fig.2 C). In contrast, as shown by Zhu et al. (24Zhu J. Tseng Y.-H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), in the presence of GST-nm23 there was a marked increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis. However, the Rad-GAP activity of nm23 was not altered by the co-incubation with GST-menin. As shown above, menin did not affect the Rad-GAP activity of nm23, which could promote the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rad; however, menin-nm23 interaction might be involved in Rad-independent GTP hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, GST-menin (0.5 μg) and GST-nm23 (0.5 ng) alone or together were incubated with [α-32P]GTP. GST-menin alone did not show GTP-hydrolyzing activity, and GST-nm23 hydrolyzed only a small amount of GTP to GDP (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, when both nm23 and menin were present, a much greater amount of GTP was converted to GDP, reaching 20% by 5 min and 45% by 20 min. This finding suggests one possibility in which menin may enhance the catalytic activity of nm23 as a NDP kinase that transfers the terminal phosphate from any NTP to any NDP. However, the observation in this assay that GST-Rad with undetectable intrinsic GTPase activity displayed high GTPase activity in the presence of Rad-GAP nm23 (Fig. 3,lower panel) suggests an alternative possibility that menin, like Rad, may be a GTPase stimulated by nm23. Based on the possibility that menin is a GTPase like Rad, we examined if menin has a structure similar to that of known GTPases or GTP-binding proteins including the Ras-related small GTPases and the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Although data base searching has not shown any homology to previously known proteins including GTPases, we found that menin contains within its N-terminal region several sequence motifs similar to those found in all known GTPases (G1 to G4) (27Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the consensus sequences for these motifs, which are known to be involved in GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis, and the corresponding amino acids in menin. The predicted G1 region (consensus GXXXXGK(S/T)), the phosphate binding motif, begins at position 2 in the amino acid sequence of menin, but the highly conserved second glycine is replaced by glutamine (GLKAAQKT). The G2 region, a conserved threonine, which is usually conserved within each GTPase family but not between different subfamilies, cannot unambiguously be identified in the sequence of menin, but a candidate threonine is found at positions 56 and 62. The DXXG Mg2+ binding motif (G3) and the (N/T)KXD guanine binding motif (G4) are found at positions 70–73 and 150–153, respectively. In addition, a motif similar to the sequence G5 (consensus E(A/C/S/T)SA(K/L)) conserved in the small GTPases (27Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar), was also found in a non-canonical form (IASAK) at positions 306–310. The presence of similar motifs to those found in all known GTPases suggests that menin could similarly exhibit GTP binding activity as well as GTP-hydrolyzing activity. To test this, we examined whether menin directly bound GTP by filter binding assay. Although GST alone did not bind [α-32P]GTP, GST-menin bound GTP in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum by 20 min (Fig. 5 A). However, the relative binding affinity of GST-menin was much lower than that of GST-Rad (Fig. 5, A and B). We next examined whether the binding of menin to GTP is affected by the concentration of Mg2+, as observed with many GTPases (28Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, in the absence of Mg2+, menin bound GTP only poorly. However, the binding activity was increased in the presence of Mg2+, and maximum activation was obtained at 10 mm Mg2+, indicating that, like many GTPases, menin requires Mg2+ for GTP binding. GST alone had no activity to bind the guanine nucleotide at any concentration of Mg2+ from 0–20 mm(data not shown). To further characterize the binding of GTP, we carried out competition experiments with a number of nucleotides and determined whether menin is a specific guanine nucleotide-binding protein. Binding of [α-32P]GTP was almost completely blocked by GTP and GDP at higher concentrations than 0.01 mm, whereas GMP did not compete (Fig. 5 D). ATP, UTP, and CTP also competed to some extent at high concentrations, but weakly when compared with GTP and GDP. We found that menin expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein hydrolyzed GTP in the presence of nm23 and bound GTP. To further confirm this, we investigated whether menin expressed in mammalian cells exhibited GTP-hydrolyzing activity. We immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged proteins from transiently transfected HEK293 cells lysed with a low-stringent buffer and then subjected the immunoprecipitates to a GTP hydrolysis assay. As shown in Fig.6, A and B,left panels, immunoprecipitates from empty vector-transfected cells showed no activity, and immunoprecipitates from Rad-transfected cells hydrolyzed a small amount of GTP to GDP. However, immunoprecipitates from menin-transfected cells showed strong GTP-hydrolyzing activity and converted a large amount of GTP to GDP, reaching 20% by 5 min. Unexpectedly, menin also produced a small amount of GMP, whereas Rad or empty vector did not (Fig. 6,A, left panel, and C). We found that menin immunoprecipitates hydrolyzed GTP to both GDP and GMP; however, we have not determined whether the detected activity is derived from menin itself or menin protein complexed with associated proteins. To examine whether menin itself can hydrolyze GTP, we further purified FLAG-menin by immunoprecipitation using a stringent lysis buffer with an ionic detergent to free the menin from most, if not all, interacting proteins. Under the stringent conditions, no association between FLAG-menin and Myc-nm23 was detected (data not shown), whereas this association was confirmed under the low-stringent conditions (Fig. 1). Even when purified under stringent conditions, menin immunoprecipitates were able to convert GTP to GDP (Fig. 6,A and B, right panels), although the level of conversion was lower than that shown by menin purified under the low-stringent conditions (Fig. 6 B), and GMP was not detected (Fig. 6 A, right panel). There was no increased GTP hydrolysis by Rad immunoprecipitated under low-stringent conditions when compared with Rad immunoprecipitated under stringent conditions, probably due to any detectable association between FLAG-Rad and Myc-nm23 under low-stringent conditions in this assay (data not shown). In addition, as observed with GST-menin, the menin immunoprecipitates bound GTP with a 10-fold lower affinity than Rad immunoprecipitates, whereas empty vector did not (data not shown). From these results, we confirmed that menin expressed in mammalian cells bound and hydrolyzed GTP. To examine whether the GTP-hydrolyzing activity of menin is involved in the pathogenesis of MEN1 tumors, we constructed FLAG-tagged menin mutants with missense mutations identified in MEN1 patients, P12L, H139D, and P320L, and tried to perform a GTP hydrolysis assay using the immunoprecipitates of these mutants. Immunoprecipitates of these mutants still retained the ability to hydrolyze GTP (Fig.7 A), but we had difficulty in comparing the GTPase activity because the expression of these mutants was marked decreased"
https://openalex.org/W1973470288,"We have described transgenic mice expressing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) in B-cells which show a predisposition to lymphoma. To investigate the underlying oncogenic mechanisms, we have cross bred transgenic strains of mice, examined the pre-tumour B-cell phenotype and investigated the expression levels of selected cellular genes as a response to EBNA-1 expression. We have found that bcl-xL and the recombination activating genes (RAG) 1 and 2 are induced in pre-neoplastic samples of EBNA-1 expressing mice. Induction of bcl-xL may explain the observed redundancy in lymphomagenesis between transgenic EBNA-1 and bcl-2. In addition, bone marrow cells derived from the EmuEBNA-1 mice show a greater capacity for cultured growth compared to controls, particularly in the presence of IL-2. Notably, bcl-xL expression is responsive to IL-2. These data shed new light on the potential contribution of EBNA-1 to EBV associated tumorigenicity as well as to the viral life cycle and open a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2003106200,"The homeodomain protein HoxA10 interacts with negative cis elements to repress gene transcription in undifferentiated myeloid cells. The CYBB and NCF2 genes, which encode the gp91PHOX and p67PHOX proteins, are two such HoxA10 target genes. During interferon γ-induced myeloid differentiation, tyrosine phosphorylation decreases HoxA10 DNA binding affinity and transcriptional repression. Therefore, decreased HoxA10 repression contributes to increased CYBB andNCF2 transcription in differentiating myeloid cells. The current studies investigate modulation of HoxA10 repression activity during myelopoiesis. We determine that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the conserved homeodomain decreases HoxA10-DNA binding. We also determine that interaction of the homeodomain phosphotyrosine residues with an adjacent domain in the HoxA10 protein is necessary for decreased DNA binding affinity. Since SHP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase antagonizes myeloid differentiation and decreases CYBB andNCF2 transcription, we investigated the influence of SHP1-protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) on HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation. We find that SHP1-PTP activity increases HoxA10 target gene repression in undifferentiated myeloid cells. Consistent with this, SHP1-PTP interacts with HoxA10 and decreases homeodomain-tyrosine phosphorylation. These investigations suggest that SHP1-PTP activity, in undifferentiated myeloid cells, influences HoxA10 repression of myeloid-specific genes. Therefore, increased HoxA10 repression of myeloid gene transcription is a molecular mechanism for SHP1 inhibition of myeloid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2079219843,"In this study a replica cDNA screening (RCS) approach to identify genes differentially expressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) was used, as compared to non-neoplastic thyroid tissues. RCS is based on hybridization of radioactively labeled cDNA probes made from the biopsies to replica membranes with 15 000 clones from a PTC cDNA library. Among the genes overexpressed in PTC, and especially in clinically aggressive tumors with histologic evidence of poorly differentiated or undifferentiated areas, a novel gene named NATH was found. NATH has two mRNA species, 4.6 and 5.8 kb, both harboring the same open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 866 amino acids. The NATH protein is homologous to yeast N-acetyltransferase (NAT)1 and to mouse NARG1 (mNAT1) and contains four tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, suggesting that NATH may be part of a multiprotein complex. Overlapping RT-PCR fragments from several PTC biopsies confirmed the NATH mRNA sequence. Northern blots, semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments, TaqMan real-time RT-PCR experiments, and in situ hybridization verified the overexpression of NATH mRNA localized to tumor cells in PTC biopsies. NATH was expressed at a low level in most human adult tissues, including the normal thyroid gland. Increased NATH expression was seen especially in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line and in adult human testis. Recombinant in vitro expression showed that NATH protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm, and was present as a single protein band of the expected 105 kDa molecular weight. Heterologous expression of NATH in the papillary carcinoma cell line (NPA) and 293 cells did not alter the cellular proliferation rate. The biological function of NATH remains to be elucidated, but the overexpression in classic PTC and especially in poorly differentiated or undifferentiated components may indicate a function in the progression of papillary thyroid carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1975854261,"Somatic frameshift mutations in some genes containing coding mononucleotide repeats (cMNRs) are well known characteristics of tumors with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). We identified 22 novel and 11 known target genes containing cMNRs with a length of 10 or more nucleotides by using a systematic database search. Frameshift mutation analysis was performed with these 33 genes in 39 MSI-H and 24 microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinomas by assessing the mobility shifts of PCR products in gel electrophoresis and by sequencing. All the 39 MSI-H colorectal carcinomas, except one, showed mutations in more than one gene, while no mutations were found in 24 MSS colorectal carcinomas. Of these MSI-H tumors, 11 genes were mutated in more than 40%. The most frequently mutated novel genes were MARCKS (72%), FLJ11383 (74%) and TAF1B (82%). Biallelic inactivation in MARCKS and FLJ11383 was also frequent in MSI-H tumors. The observed mutation frequency of the 11 known target genes was compatible with that found by previous studies. The very high frequency of mutations, biallelic mutations and the predicted truncation of protein products suggests that mutations of MARCKS, FLJ11383 and TAF1B are selected, and play a role in the tumorigenesis of MSI-H colorectal carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2112188231,"Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are the most extensively used animal model for genetic hypertension, increased stroke damage, and insulin resistance syndromes; however, the identification of target genes has proved difficult. SHR show elevated sympathetic nerve activity, and stimulation of the central blood pressure control centers with glutamate or nicotine results in exaggerated blood pressure responses, effects that appear to be genetically determined. Kynurenic acid, a competitive glutamate antagonist and a non-competitive nicotinic antagonist, can be synthesized in the brain by the enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase-1 (KAT-1). We have previously shown that KAT-1 activity is significantly reduced in SHR compared with normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Here we show that KAT-1 contains a missense mutation, E61G, in all the strains of SHR examined but not in any of the WKY or outbred strains. Previous studies on F2 rats from a cross of stroke-prone SHR and WKY have shown a suggestive level of linkage between elevated blood pressure and the KAT-1 locus on chromosome 3.

Increased sympathetic outflow is a key factor contributing to some types of hypertension in humans and in many animal models of hypertension (4Colombari E. Sato M.A. Cravo S.L. Bergamaschi C.T. Campos R.R. Lopes O.U. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major sympathetic output pathway for the tonic and reflex control of blood pressure, which uses glutamate as the transmitter, arises from the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) (5Dampney R.A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 323-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition the RVLM receives numerous cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs, making this pathway especially sensitive to altered receptor activity (4Colombari E. Sato M.A. Cravo S.L. Bergamaschi C.T. Campos R.R. Lopes O.U. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dampney R.A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 323-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Enhanced excitation of the RVLM has been implicated in human and in animal models of hypertension (4Colombari E. Sato M.A. Cravo S.L. Bergamaschi C.T. Campos R.R. Lopes O.U. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that alterations of the levels of the endogenous antagonist kynurenic acid, which shows highest affinity for the “glycine site” of theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors (6Stone T.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 185-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), can affect glutamate receptor function (7Erhart S. Oberg H. Engberg G. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In SHR, microinjection of glutamate or NMDA into the caudal ventrolateral medulla results in exaggerated depressor responses; however, the responses to the “NMDA glycine site” agonist d-serine are diminished (8Kapoor V. Kapoor R. Chalmers J.P. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1409-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Kynurenic acid injection into the RVLM reduces basal blood pressure in SHR but not in normotensive WKY (9Ito S. Komatsu K. Tsukamoto K. Sved A.F. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 413-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there is enhanced sensitivity to glutamate in SHR, possibly due to reduced levels of the endogenous NMDA glycine site antagonist kynurenic acid. Recently evidence has emerged that kynurenic acid can also block nicotinic (α7) receptors in a non-competitive fashion (10Hilmas C. Pereira E.F.R. Alkondon M. Rassoulpour A. Schwarcz R. Albuquerque E.X. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7463-7473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the finding that kynurenic acid levels are reduced in SHR, nicotinic receptor agonists have also been demonstrated to show augmented blood pressure and other responses in SHR (11Khan I.M. Stanislaus S. Zhang L.M. Vaughn D. Printz M.P. Yaksh T.L. Taylor P. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. 2001; 23: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These exaggerated responses to both glutamate and nicotinic agonists are independent of the presence of high blood pressure and appear be genetically determined (11Khan I.M. Stanislaus S. Zhang L.M. Vaughn D. Printz M.P. Yaksh T.L. Taylor P. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. 2001; 23: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 12Tsuchihashi T. Kagiyama S. Ohya Y. Abe I. Fujishima M. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have previously provided evidence that the activity of kynurenine aminotransferase-1 (KAT-1), which converts kynurenine to kynurenic acid, and kynurenic acid levels are reduced in SHR (13Kapoor V. Kapoor R. Chalmers J.P. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1994; 21: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KAT-1-immunoreactive neurons can be demonstrated in all the blood pressure control regions of the medulla and spinal cord. However, we were unable to detect a difference in the number or intensity KAT-1-immunoreactive cells between SHR and WKY (14Kapoor R. Okuno E. Kido R. Kapoor V. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using an enzymatic activity stain for KAT-1 on native (non-denaturing) gel separations, specific KAT-1 enzyme activity could be demonstrated in homogenates from WKY kidney but not in those from SHR kidney (15Kapoor V. Thuruthyil S.J. Human B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To extend these observations and to clarify the discrepancy between the immunochemistry data and the physiological and biochemical studies, we hypothesized that the KAT-1 gene in SHR may be mutated. In this report we present evidence for a missense mutation in the KAT-1 gene in SHR. The mutation, which could be demonstrated in all strains of SHR examined, appears to account for the reduced activity of KAT-1 observed in SHR. SHR, stroke-prone SHR, WKY, and Wistar rats were provided by the Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia and the Baker Medical Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia. Sources of DNA from other SHR and WKY substrains have been reported previously (2Gotoda T. Iizuka Y. Kato N. Osuga J. Bihoreau M.T. Murakami T. Yamori Y. Shimano H. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Native gel enzyme activity stain protocols have been published previously (15Kapoor V. Thuruthyil S.J. Human B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Western blots were carried out on the native gels using a polyclonal antibody directed against rat kidney KAT-1 kindly provided to us by Prof. R. Kido (Wakayama University, Japan). Whole brains of the SHR, stroke-prone SHR, WKY, and Wistar rats were used for isolation of total RNA, which was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript II RT kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RIN 2A cell line, a subclone of the rat pancreatic cell line RINm5F, served as an internal control. TheKAT-1/GTK gene (GenBankTM accession number Z49696) was screened for nucleotide substitutions using five overlapping pairs of PCR primers covering the entire coding sequence of the gene. Following PCR amplification and purification, the cDNA was sequenced directly using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems). A 267-bp fragment comprising exon 3 of the rat KAT-1 gene, using the primer pair rKat-ex3F (5′-ggggctgactttctacttgttg-3′) and rKat-ex3R (5′-ggatgctaatctgtgctctgtc-3′) (GenBankTM accession numberAF100154, nucleotides 13103–13369), was amplified from leukocyte DNA by PCR, and the resulting DNA was sequenced. SHR and WKY KAT-1 cDNA from the sequencing work was ligated into a pET vector that was then used to transfect competent B21 Escherichia coli cells. The resulting ampicillin-resistant colonies were grown to log phase in the presence of ampicillin, and the expression of KAT-1 was induced using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight (16 h). Expression was verified by Western slot-blot (as above). Analysis of enzyme activity in partially purified extracts was carried out as described previously using kynurenine (0.25–2 mm) and pyruvate (1.0–7.5 mm) as substrates (8Kapoor V. Kapoor R. Chalmers J.P. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1409-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The chromosomal localization of the rat KAT-1 gene was determined by radiation hybrid mapping analysis using a whole genome rat/hamster radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics). The result was analyzed by two-point placement mapping (MultiMap) with a radiation hybrid mapping server (ratmap.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp). Using partially purified kidney homogenates, KAT-1 activity stains in native gel separations were carried out as described previously (15Kapoor V. Thuruthyil S.J. Human B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Omission of each substrate in turn allowed us to demonstrate that there was only one band specific for KAT-1 activity (Fig.1), the other band being ascribed to amino acid oxidase activity (data not presented) (17Abharam D.G. Patel P.P. Cooper A.J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 180-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The specific KAT-1 activity band was apparent only in the homogenate from WKY kidney. Western blots of the same native gels, however, showed KAT-1-immunoreactive bands in homogenates from both rat strains (Fig.1). Only the immunoreactive band from WKY corresponded to the KAT-1 activity seen in the gels from these rats. The immunoreactive band from the SHR homogenates migrated more slowly under native conditions than that from the WKY, although under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE Western blots) the immunoreactive bands were coincident (data not shown). This helped reconcile our previous data that, compared with WKY, KAT-1 in SHR shows reduced enzyme activity but similar immunohistochemistry (13Kapoor V. Kapoor R. Chalmers J.P. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1994; 21: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Kapoor R. Okuno E. Kido R. Kapoor V. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and led us to predict the presence of a mutation in SHR KAT-1 that would alter the charge and activity of the protein without greatly affecting its molecular weight. To investigate this further, RNA was isolated from SHR, stroke-prone SHR, WKY, and Wistar rat brains, and KAT-1 cDNA was generated for DNA sequence analysis. The DNA sequence analysis of KAT-1 cDNA from WKY and Wistar rats matches the published sequence (18Malherbe P. Alberatigiani D. Kohler C. Cesura A.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, in the SHR and stroke-prone SHR sequences we found an A to G point mutation corresponding to amino acid 61 (numbered from the predicted amino acid sequence from GenBankTM accession numberZ49696). This would result in the substitution of glutamate 61 to glycine (GAG to GGG), which could affect the surface charge of the protein (Fig. 2). Since the genetic heterogeneity of the SHR strain is well documented, we also examined the KAT-1 genomic DNA from other sources. The original SHR/lzm (Kyoto, Japan), the SHR NCrj (Charles River), and the SHR/Tac (Taconic Farms) strains and their genetic controls, the WKY strains, were used. The mutation was not present in any of the WKY strains examined but was confirmed in all the SHR strains examined, including the original SHR/lzm strain, indicating that the E61G mutation is an authentic mutation common to SHR strains. Using standard protein expression protocols, full-length KAT-1 cDNA was cloned into an E. coli expression vector. Low levels of KAT-1 were found in the soluble fraction, which were verified by Western slot-blots, and partially purified homogenates used for enzyme analysis. Kinetic analysis of the mutant SHR and wild type WKY forms of the enzyme expressed in E. coli was carried out using different concentrations of both substrates (kynurenine and pyruvate) for this “ping-pong bi-bi” reaction. The apparentK m values for kynurenine (1.4 mm) and pyruvate (1.2 mm) for the WKY KAT-1 were found to be similar to values reported in the literature (18Malherbe P. Alberatigiani D. Kohler C. Cesura A.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). KAT-1 from SHR, however, showed much more variability and a markedly lowerK m for kynurenine of 0.2 mm (Fig.3). The K m for pyruvate for KAT-1 from SHR was also lower (0.1 mm), and the initial velocity (at 1 h) was between 40–60% lower at all the concentrations of substrate tested. The chromosomal localization of the rat KAT-1 gene was determined by mapping with a radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics) and showed that the gene was located on the proximal end of rat chromosome 3 with D3Rat54 as the closest microsatellite marker. Initial ψ-BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) of the KAT-1 amino acid sequence revealed KAT-1 to be an unusual aminotransferase, possibly a subset of the 1γ family, showing a close relationship with HB8 aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) from Thermus thermophilus. The structure of HB8 AAT (Protein Data Bank code1BKG) was used as a template to model KAT-1 using the Homology module in Insight-II (Molecular Simulations Inc.) and also using SwissModel (www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html). As shown in Fig.4, both theoretical models placed the mutation site (Glu-61) at the hinge of the first α-helix of the small domain (N-terminal α-helix), the movement and flexibility of which is critical to the mechanism of action of HB8 AAT (19Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Azzariti A. Vacca R.A. Giannattasio S. Merafina R.S. Marra E. Doonan S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Selective breeding of rat strains for high blood pressure has led to the identification of at least 24 quantitative trait loci associated with hypertension and highlighting the genetic complexity of the disease (21Rapp J.P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Our demonstration of a novel missense mutation (E61G) in the KAT-1 gene of all the SHR strains examined, but not in any of the control WKY and outbred normotensive strains, is among the most extensive characterization of a mutation in SHR to date. This study provides evidence that the KAT-1 mutation may underlie, at least in part, the development of hypertension and other abnormalities seen in SHR. We have previously shown that KAT-1 activity and associated glutamine transaminase K activities are reduced in SHR rats (15Kapoor V. Thuruthyil S.J. Human B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The present study extends these findings to show that the electrophoretic movement of KAT-1 from SHR tissue is slower under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 1), suggesting that the SHR enzyme may be altered. Sequence analysis of the KAT-1 gene from WKY and outbred Wistar rats confirmed previously published data (18Malherbe P. Alberatigiani D. Kohler C. Cesura A.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and revealed a single missense mutation in the codon for position 61, E61G, of the cDNA from SHR. Since the genetic variability of the SHR is well known, KAT-1 genomic DNA from several different strains of SHR was also sequenced. The same missense mutation, E61G, was confirmed in all strains of SHR examined but was not found in any of the respective WKY controls. Recently genotype analysis by single strand conformation polymorphism of SHR, stroke-prone SHR, and their WKY controls (lzm, NCrj, and Tac strains) has confirmed the presence of the mutation in all SHR strains but not in any of the WKY strains (data not presented). WKY-derived KAT-1 expressed in E. coli showed apparentK m and V max values that are similar to published results (18Malherbe P. Alberatigiani D. Kohler C. Cesura A.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the SHR mutant enzyme, however, showed markedly altered kinetics and reduced activity. This is consistent with literature reports that the binding of the dicarboxylic acid induces a rotational movement of the small (N-terminal) domain of aminotransferases, alteration of which leads to a large reduction of substrate K m andV max in related enzymes with a similar kinetic mechanism (19Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Azzariti A. Vacca R.A. Giannattasio S. Merafina R.S. Marra E. Doonan S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A critical difference between aminotransferases, like HB8 AAT, that belong to the 1b classification of Nakai et al. (19Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and other aminotransferases is that in this group substrate binding leads to movement only of the N-terminal region of the small domain (shadedred in Fig. 4) toward the substrate binding site. The presence and location of glycine residues in the hinge region of the N terminus is likely to be critical to the movement, and hence the activity of this subclass of enzymes (classified as 1γ according to Jensen et al. (22Jensen R.A. Wei G.U. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 4, homology models of KAT-1 built with HB8 AAT as the template placed the mutation site (Glu-61) at the hinge of the first α-helix of the small domain (N-terminal α-helix), the movement and flexibility of which is central to the mechanism of action of HB8 AAT (19Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The location and accessibility of the mutation site indicate that the E61G mutation has the potential to alter both the surface charge and the activity of the enzyme. Consistent with these observations, since a Glu to Gly substitution is likely to result in increased flexibility, N-terminal deletion mutants of related aminotransferases result in similar changes in enzyme kinetics (20Azzariti A. Vacca R.A. Giannattasio S. Merafina R.S. Marra E. Doonan S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The KAT-1 gene was mapped to the proximal end of chromosome 3 in the rat (homology with mouse chromosome 2). Quantitative trait loci for hypertension in stroke-prone SHR have previously been mapped on the proximal end of rat chromosome 3 (suggestive logarithm of the odds score of about 3) and thus very close to theKAT-1 locus at D3Rat54 (near D3Mgh16) (16Mashimo T.

Lindpaintner K. Dominiczak A.F. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our preliminary studies on F2 crosses between SHR and WKY show a significant correlation of the inheritance of the SHRKAT-1 allele not only to elevated blood pressures but also to reduced body weights and altered adipocyte metabolism. 2Y. Iizuka, T. Gotoda, and N. Yamada, unpublished results. The human homologue of the rat KAT-1 gene (89% protein identity), which codes for the cysteine conjugate β-lyase enzyme (CCBL1), maps to chromosome 9q34 (25Perry S. Harries H. Scholfield C. Lock T. King L. Gibson G. Goldfarb P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Examining whether alleles of theKAT-1/CCBL1 gene confer susceptibility for human hypertension and insulin resistance is now a high priority. The identification of a KAT-1 mutation and its role in enhancing sensitivity to glutamate and nicotine highlights a possible mechanism of genetic predisposition to hypertension associated with insulin resistance and identifies a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of this major health problem."

https://openalex.org/W2323060246,"The BRCA2 tumor suppressor has been implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity through a function in cellular responses to DNA damage. The BRCA2 protein directly associates with Rad51, that is essential for repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR). In this report, we study the BRCA2-defective Chinese hamster cell mutant V-C8 for its ability to perform homology-directed repair (HDR) between repeated sequences. V-C8 cells were recently shown to be defective in Rad51 foci formation in response to DNA damage. Strikingly, we find that these BRCA2 mutant cells exhibit a strong stimulation of HDR activity compared to the V79 parental cells, which harbor a wild-type BRCA2. Furthermore, molecular characterization of the HDR products shows that loss of BRCA2 in V-C8 cells leads to significant reduction in Rad51-dependent gene conversion but strong enhancement of Rad51-independent single-strand annealing (SSA) events frequency. These data imply that, when HDR by conservative gene conversion is impaired, DSBs usually repaired by this pathway are instead resolved by other non-conservative HDR subpathways. Therefore, high chromosomal instability in BRCA2-deficient cells presumably results from enhancement of error-prone repair mechanisms, such as SSA."
https://openalex.org/W1990310122,"One of the long-standing problems in modern astronomy is the curious division of Galactic globular clusters, the ""Oosterhoff dichotomy,"" according to the properties of their RR Lyrae stars. Here, we find that most of the lowest metallicity ([Fe/H] < -2.0) clusters, which are essential to an understanding of this phenomenon, display a planar alignment in the outer halo. This alignment, combined with evidence from kinematics and stellar population, indicates a captured origin from a satellite galaxy. We show that, together with the horizontal-branch evolutionary effect, the factor producing the dichotomy could be a small time gap between the cluster-formation epochs in the Milky Way and the satellite. The results oppose the traditional view that the metal-poorest clusters represent the indigenous and oldest population of the Galaxy."

These polypeptides were localized by immunoblotting of inner and outer mitochondrial membrane fractions, as well as by immunogold labeling in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In addition, a novel creatine uptake via a mitochondrial creatine transport activity was demonstrated by [14C]creatine uptake studies with isolated mitochondria from rat liver, heart, and kidney showing a saturable low affinity creatine transporter, which was largely inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent NEM, as well as by the addition of the above anti-creatine transporter antibodies to partially permeabilized mitochondria. Mitochondrial creatine transport was to a significant part dependent on the energetic state of mitochondria and was inhibited by arginine, and to some extent also by lysine, but not by other creatine analogues and related compounds.

The CRT sequences (Protein Data Bank accession number for rat CRT = P28570and for human CRT = P48029) are most closely related to the γ-aminobutyric acid, taurine/betaine transporter subfamily (46–53% amino acid sequence identity), while the homology to the glycine, proline, catecholamine, and serotonin transporters is less pronounced (38–34%). Computational analysis revealed that these CRTs, like other neurotransmitter transporters, are integral membrane proteins containing 12 putative transmembrane domains (8Nash S.R. Giros B.

The presence of two different gene products expressed in various tissues corresponding to two major polypeptides of ∼55 and ∼70 kDa has been described. The two polypeptides are most likely generated by alternative splicing (12Guerrero-Ontiveros M.L. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 427-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assumption is supported by the fact that antipeptide antibodies generated against the N- and C-terminal region of the cDNA-derived CRT polypeptide sequence, all recognize the same two proteins with molecular masses of ∼55 and ∼70 kDa on Western blots (11Tran T.T. Dai W. Sarkar H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35708-35714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Guerrero-Ontiveros M.L. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell.

Physiol. 2001; 280: C415-C422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the existence of CRT splice variants has recently been suggested, based on genetics studies using rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods (17Henry H., O. Speer O. Braissant B. Eilers C. Bachmann A. Wallimann T. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 940Google Scholar). Recent immunofluorescence studies have indicated a high degree of intracellular CRT localization (16Murphy R. McConell G. Cameron-Smith D. Watt K. Ackland L. Walzel B. Wallimann T. Snow R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C415-C422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with a mainly mitochondrial localization (15Walzel B. Speer O. Boehm E. Kristiansen S. Chan S. Clarke K. Magyar J. Richter E.A. Wallimann T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E390-E401PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is in contrast to the general view that CRT, represented here by two major ∼55- and ∼70-kDa CRT-related proteins, is localized exclusively in the plasma membrane. Instead, it was also recently reported that only a minor CRT protein species with an intermediate apparent molecular mass of ∼58 kDa is located in the plasma membrane (15Walzel B. Speer O. Boehm E. Kristiansen S. Chan S. Clarke K. Magyar J. Richter E.A. Wallimann T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E390-E401PubMed Google Scholar). This ∼58-kDa polypeptide has been identified by surface biotinylation of intact cardiomyocytes, followed by Western blotting with anti-CRT antibodies, or alternatively by Western blotting of highly enriched plasma membrane fractions (15Walzel B. Speer O. Boehm E. Kristiansen S. Chan S. Clarke K. Magyar J. Richter E.A. Wallimann T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E390-E401PubMed Google Scholar). Also in contrast to the prevailing view that mitochondria do not contain Cr, PCr uptake into isolated rat heart mitochondria had been reported earlier (18Soboll S. Conrad A. Eistert A. Herick K. Kramer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and was attributed, however, to the activity of adenine nucleotide translocase. The same authors also studied changes in the subcellular distribution of ATP, ADP, Cr, and PCr depending on the physiological state in rat fast twitch gastrocnemius and slow twitch soleus muscles by fractionation of freeze-clamped and freeze-dried tissue in non-aqueous solvents (19Hebisch S. Sies H. Soboll S. Pfluegers Arch. 1986; 406: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It was found that during isotonic contraction of gastrocnemius muscles, the mitochondrial content of total Cr and PCr decreased with a parallel increase in extramitochondrial total Cr, indicating a net transfer of Cr across the mitochondrial membranes. In line with the above observation, in vivo isotope tracing studies with labeled Cr have shown that creatine kinase does not have access to the entire cellular Cr and PCr pool(s) (20Hochachka P.W. Mossey M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R868-R872PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that intracellular Cr and PCr pools may exist that are not in immediate equilibrium with one another. Such interpretations are in agreement with a number of 31P NMR magnetization transfer studies (21Joubert F. Gillet B. Mazet J.L. Mateo P. Beloeil J. Hoerter J.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Joubert F. Vrezas I. Mateo P. Gillet B. Beloeil J.C. Soboll S. Hoerter J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), as well as with recent1H NMR spectroscopy data (23Kreis R. Jung B. Slotboom J. Felblinger J. Boesch C. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 137: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), where monitoring the Cr and PCr levels in human muscle pointed to the existence of a pool of Cr that is not NMR “visible” in resting muscle, but appears in NMR spectra of muscle in ischemic fatigue or post mortem (23Kreis R. Jung B. Slotboom J. Felblinger J. Boesch C. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 137: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). From these studies, it was also concluded that the total PCr/Cr pool must be divided into physical compartments, or chemical entities, without fast exchange, and the authors even mentioned that increased flux through mitochondria could provide an explanation for their experimental results (23Kreis R. Jung B. Slotboom J. Felblinger J. Boesch C. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 137: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is, however, important to emphasize that by the above experimental approaches, no specific information neither on the nature or the direction of Cr shuttling pathways nor on the identity of such putative Cr compartments could be inferred. These findings led us to search for a potential mitochondrial Cr transport activity in muscle and non-muscle tissues, which would be associated with corresponding CRT protein(s), by using cell fractionation techniques, confocal immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, as well as substrate transport studies. Here we show that the mitochondrial inner membrane possesses active CRT activity, which seems to be associated with distinct CRT-related polypeptides. If not otherwise stated all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were purchased from Invitrogen BRL, (Füllinsdorf, Switzerland). The characterization of our rabbit anti-CRT peptide antibodies has been described earlier (12Guerrero-Ontiveros M.L. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 427-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly excised rat ventricles were fixed for 3 h at room temperature in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin by standard techniques. Ten-μm slices were cut with a microtome, paraffin was removed with xylene, and sections were washed with 70% ethanol and stored in PBS. For immunofluorescence staining, tissue sections were permeabilized first with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min, then with 0.1% SDS for 30 s and subsequently washed in PBS for 30 min. The sections were blocked in 5% goat serum albumin and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary antibodies (rabbit anti-CRT peptide antibody 1:200, mouse anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COX, Molecular Probes) 1:200, both diluted in PBS containing 2% fat-free dry milk powder), were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the tissue sections were washed extensively six times. Secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse-anti-rabbit IgG 1:500 and Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG, both diluted 1:500 in PBS), were incubated 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The stained sections were washed again extensively in PBS, followed by embedding in an antifading medium containing 70% glycerol, 240 mm N-propylgallate, 30 mm Tris/HCl at pH 9.5. Sections were analyzed with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot, equipped with an argon/krypton mixed gas laser), a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal scanner unit and a Silicon Graphics Iris 4D/25 work station, using Imaris (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland) software. Images were recorded with oil immersion objectives (Zeiss). Rat heart ventricles were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde/PBS by immersion fixation at room temperature for 3 h. Tissue was washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and fixed again in the presence of 1% OsO4 for 2 h at room temperature. Tissues were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, stained en bloc with 2% uranyl acetate, and embedded in Epon-Araldite. Sections of 80–100 nm were cut with an Ultra-microtome (Reichert, München, Germany), adsorbed onto copper electron microscope grids, incubated for etching of the plastic on drops of saturated sodium perjodate for 1 h, rinsed with double distilled H2O, incubated in boiling 10 mmcitric acid NaOH, pH 6, for 20 min and rinsed again extensively. Subsequently, the sections were blocked in buffer 1 (PBS containing 0.1% acetylated bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween) for 20 min, followed by incubation with anti-CRT peptide antibody in buffer 1 for 70 min, washed, incubated for 45 min with goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 10 nm colloidal gold, washed with buffer 1 again, and finally with double distilled H2O. After contrasting sections with 2% uranyl acetate and 2% lead citrate, pictures were taken by a transmission electron microscope JEOL200 at 100 kV. Male Wistar Rats (3–4 month of age) were anesthetized with diethyl ether and killed by cervical dislocation. Tissue of liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle, kidney, and brain were taken and immediately transferred to ice-cold buffer. Liver, brain, and kidney tissues were homogenized by a Teflon/glass potter (Braun, Melsungen, Germany), whereas skeletal and heart muscle was homogenized by a Polytron mixer in 40 ml HEPES-sucrose buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (essentially free of fatty acids) and 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 700 × g to remove heavy debris as platelets and nuclei. An aliquot from the supernatant was taken for further analysis as the total tissue extract. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 7,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was stored for subsequent analysis as the soluble cytosolic fraction, while the pellet containing mitochondria was resuspended in 60 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μm EGTA, 25% PercollTM (AmershamBiosciences) and centrifuged for 35 min at 100,000 ×g. PercollTM fractions containing highly purified mitochondria were washed twice with 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μm EGTA by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min. Washed mitochondria were then recovered from the pellet and resuspended in 200 μl of the washing buffer. Extracts were separated in 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels and trans-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Bottmingen, Germany). The membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk powder in TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing for 30 min, membranes were incubated with 1:5,000 diluted anti-CRT peptide antibodies in TBS buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS buffer, the blot was incubated again with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (AmershamBiosciences). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using the Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The isolation of the mitochondrial membranes was done according to Ref. 41Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with diethyl ether and killed by cervical dislocation. The liver was taken and immediately transferred to ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mmsucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA) and freed from fat and connective tissue. The tissue was homogenized using a glass-Teflon potter in homogenization buffer at 0 °C. Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min, and crude mitochondria were pelleted from the post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min. Enriched mitochondria were resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA and purified in a 25% PercollTM density gradient. Highly enriched mitochondria were carefully collected from the gradient and washed twice in sucrose/HEPES buffer. Protein determination was performed with the BCL Kit from Pierce. Fifty mg of mitochondria were then resuspended in 6 ml of 10 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.5, at 0 °C. After 15 min to allow swelling, 6 ml of 10 mm KH2PO4 containing 30% sucrose, 30% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mmATP were added. After 60 min of incubation at 0 °C to allow shrinking (turbidity appears) the mitochondrial suspension was treated with sonic oscillation using a Brandson device at position 3A for three times (cycles of 15 s each with 60 s between each cycle for cooling). A first crude inner membrane fraction was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 10 mm KH2PO4 buffer. Pellet and supernatant were layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting out of 51%, 37 and 25% sucrose and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (SW 40) at 100,000 × g for at least 12 h at 4 °C. The clear top of the gradient contained the soluble protein fraction, the 25–37% interphase contained the light outer membrane subfraction, and the 37–51% interphase contained the pure inner membrane subfraction. The membrane fractions were collected carefully from the gradient, diluted 1:10 in sucrose/HEPES buffer, and pelleted at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. The pellets were solubilized in sucrose/HEPES containing 0.01% SDS and analyzed. Mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-CRT peptide antibody under a variety of osmotic conditions (between 50 and 250 mosmol/kg). Subsequently, these mitochondria were washed with buffer containing 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 μm EGTA and incubated with protein A-10 nm colloidal gold. After several washing steps, a drop of the mitochondrial suspension was transferred onto a carbon-coated electron microscope grid and washed with 2% ammonium molybdate as negative stain (250 mosmol, pH 7.4). The grid was blotted with Whatman Filter #1 and air-dried (42Munn E.A. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1968; 25: 362-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 43Muscatello U. Horne R.W. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1968; 25: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pictures of negatively stained mitochondria were then taken in a transmission electron microscope JEOL100 at 80 kV. Counting of gold grains was automated with the NIH-image program. Analysis of variance statistics was done with Origin 4.1 software. All Cr uptake assays were performed at room temperature using highly enriched, PercollTMgradient-purified mitochondrial preparations (adjusted to 10 mg × ml−1 protein concentration). The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of the mitochondria suspension to 90 μl of transport buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Cr, and 5 μCi × ml−1 [14C]Cr (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), 10 μCi × ml−1[3H]sucrose, 5 mm succinate/Tris, 2 μm rotenone, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Pi/Tris, 100 μm EGTA, and 2 mm ADP). Cr uptake was stopped after 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 6, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 min, respectively, and the amount of Cr taken up was plotted against time (Fig. 6 A). Cr uptake was determined as a function of Cr concentration at room temperature for 3 min at 0.53, 1, 2, 10, and 20 mm Cr, respectively, and fitted to an Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 6 B). Mitochondria were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations of NEM, DTNB, or DNFB followed by uptake measurements for 15 min under standard conditions. Cr transport assays were performed under standard conditions but without succinate and ADP. Mitochondrial substrates (5 mm succinate, 1 mmADP) and uncoupler (100 nm FCCP) were added sequentially (Fig. 7). Mitochondria (100 μg/mg mitochondrial protein) were preincubated for 1h at 22 °C either in 250 mm or 50 mm sucrose alone or in 250 mm or 50 mm sucrose together with anti-CRT or preimmune serum (at 1:100 final dilution). Subsequently, mitochondria were washed three times in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and uptake was measured under standard conditions. Transport was measured in buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 250 mm sucrose and 5 μCi × ml−1[14C]Cr, 10 μCi × ml−1[3H]sucrose, 2 μm rotenone, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmPi/Tris, and 100 μm EGTA (serving as control), and in the additional presence of 1 mmconcentration of each of either PCr, Cr analogues, other guanidino compounds, amino acids, or related compounds added as potential competitors or inhibitors (see Table I). In all cases, Cr uptake was stopped by a quick centrifugation step at 16,000 × gfor 1 min and removal of the supernatant. The mitochondrial pellets were solubilized in 100 μl of 1% SDS and counted in 4 ml of scintillation mixture “Ultima Gold XR” (Packard) in a Packard 1500 Tri-CarbTM liquid scintillation counter. Double isotope measurement settings were 0–18 eV for the [3H]isotope and 18–256 eV for the [14C]isotope. The amount of Cr uptake was calculated as the difference of total Cr measured, subtracted by the Cr present in the sucrose-accessible space.Table IInhibition of Cr uptake by structurally related compoundsCompoundAverage± S.E.Significancennmol Cr × mg −1Control19.0± 4.914PCr17.1± 6.6p> 0.38Creatinine22.2± 7.9p > 0.33Cyclo-creatine17.7± 1.0p > 0.33β-GPA19.9± 2.2p > 0.35Arginine14.4± 4.4p < 0.0314Lysine15.2± 3.8p < 0.0413Proline21.6± 2.9p > 0.311Glutamine18.6± 6.3p > 0.310Ornithine16.7± 2.0p > 0.33Citrulline20.0± 1.7p > 0.33GABA16.2± 5.8p > 0.34Inhibition of uptake of radioactive creatine into mitochondria by various creatine analogues, related guanidino compounds, and amino acids was measured.

Indirect immunofluorescence staining of rat heart sections with anti-CRT antibodies directed against a 15-mer C-terminal peptide of CRT revealed a predominantly intracellular localization of CRT-related protein (Fig.1, α-CRT). The spotted pattern of the immunofluorescence signal suggests that the distribution of the protein within the cell is not homogeneous and might be associated to intracellular organelles. The remarkably ordered and regular alignment of small, anti-CRT-positive spots along the contractile apparatus suggests a periodic association with regular structures of the myofibrillar apparatus that is typical for mitochondria in muscle. Co-staining with the mitochondrial marker COX, a mitochondrial trans-membrane protein and thus a marker for mitochondria (24Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar), indeed displayed an identical immunofluorescence pattern (Fig. 1, α-COX), as indicated by the co-localization of anti-CRT and anti-COX staining (Fig. 1,merge). Essentially the same immunolocalization was obtained also with antibodies directed against a 15-mer N-terminal synthetic peptide of CRT (12Guerrero-Ontiveros M.L. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 427-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). To precisely identify the site(s) of intracellular CRT localization, we performed immunoelectron microscopy studies on sections of the adult rat myocardium, treated with anti-CRT antibodies followed by colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fig. 2 A clearly demonstrates specific labeling of mitochondria by anti-CRT antibodies that are evenly distributed within the muscle fibers, with some non-mitochondrial and otherwise very low background staining, as compared with staining with preimmune serum (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Intracellular localization of CRT-related protein in rat heart by immunoelectron microscopy. Rat left ventricles were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Epon. Sections of 80–100 nm were cut and adsorbed onto carbon-coated electron microscope grids, treated with saturated sodium per-jodate, and boiled in 10 mm citric acid NaOH at pH 6 and subsequently labeled for 1 h at room temperature with polyclonal rabbit anti-CRT peptide antibodies (A) or preimmune serum (B), followed by a 1-h incubation with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold.

We investigated functional differences in the control of the ARF (alternative reading frame) protein that acts upstream of p53 and is encoded along with p16INK4a at a major tumor suppressor locus in both the human and mouse genomes. The mouse and human ARF proteins are substantially divergent at their carboxyl termini. We have shown that the mouse ARF protein (p19ARF) interacts with Pex19p in the cell cytoplasm leading to its nuclear exclusion and repression of its p53 activation function. The human ARF protein (p14ARF) is substantially smaller than its mouse counterpart and is not subject to this functional inactivation by Pex19p. In an identical cellular background, ribozymes directed against Pex19p enhanced p19ARF- but not p14ARF-activated p53 function. This is the first demonstration of a functional difference between the mouse and human ARF proteins. In view of the major role of ARF in tumor suppression, this distinction may contribute to the different levels of tumor proneness of these species.

This effect on p53 is in accord with the proposed involvement of nuclear p19ARF-MDM2 interactions in restraining MDM2-mediated degradation of p53.Recent studies have shown that ARF function involves complex feedback mechanisms (41Lloyd A.C.

Its expression is regulated by E2F, and thus binding of hypophosphorylated pRB to E2F inhibits ARF expression and its downstream p53 activation. This pathway thus provides a regulatory link between pRb and p53 pathways; inactivation of pRb by phosphorylation and release of E2F from pRb-E2F complexes leads to an activation of ARF expression resulting in the stabilization and functional activation of p53 (5Carnero A.

Activation of the ARF-p53-p21WAF1 pathway can in turn restrict phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of pRB function by inhibiting cyclin-cyclin D-dependent kinase activity.Functional regulation of ARF is critical for cell cycle control in response to a variety of cellular and environmental signals. The mouse and human ARF proteins share only a limited homology at the cDNA and protein levels (1Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

We report here that a result of this difference is that the human ARF protein is not inactivated by Pex19p. This may contribute to the more stringent control of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in human cells.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo elucidate the Pex19p binding domain of p19ARF, β-galactosidase reporter assay (dependent on the interactions of two proteins) was performed on yeast cells transformed with Pex19p and full-length p19ARF and its various deletion mutants or p14ARF. The full p19ARF protein and deletion mutants that retain the carboxyl-terminal 41 amino acid residues were positive for interactions with Pex19p. Based on these data, the Pex19p binding domain of p19ARF was assigned to its carboxyl-terminal 41 amino acid residues (Fig.1 A, 129–169 a.a.). The human ARF protein p14ARF is shorter than the mouse ARF protein, p19ARF, by 40 amino acids (43Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Notably, p14ARF-Pex19p interactions were negative in the yeast two-hybrid system. The mouse and human ARF proteins were also tested for interaction with Pex19p by a mammalian two-hybrid reporter assay (Fig. 1 B). The ARF cDNAs were cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and were expressed in cells along with the DNA activation domain-Pex19p fusion protein. In this assay system, luciferase reporter activity is dependent on the interactions of the DNA binding and activation domains. It detected interaction of Pex19p with p19ARF but not with p14ARF (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays both suggested that p14ARF does not interact with Pex19p. These findings were confirmed by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2). Whereas immunoprecipitation of p19ARF pulled down Pex19p, an equivalent immunoprecipitation of p14ARF did not (Fig. 2). It was noted that (i) p14ARF runs very close to the dye front on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and (ii) although the amount of immunoprecipitated p14ARF was greater than that of p19ARF from an equal quantity of lysate (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2), there was no coimmunoprecipitation of Pex19p with p14ARF. This result strongly supported the two-hybrid assays. We therefore concluded that in contrast to p19ARF, p14ARF does not interact with Pex19p.Figure 2In vivo coimmunoprecipitation of Pex19p and p19ARF but not p14ARF. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged ARF proteins or Myc-tagged mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MPD) (an irrelevant control) and GFP-tagged Pex19p or GFP (control). ARF proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and coimmunoprecipitation of Pex19p was detected by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody. Note that the immunoprecipitation of p14ARF was greater than p19ARF (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, GFP-Pex19p co-precipitated with Myc-tagged p19ARF (panel b, lane 2) but not with p14ARF (panel b, lane 1) or with MPD (panel b, lane 3). A faint band (close to the size of Pex19p) cross-reacting to GFP antibody was detected in lanes 1–3. GFP by itself showed no coimmunoprecipitation with p19ARF-Myc (panel b, lanes 4–6). Input signals (from 10% of the lysates) for GFP-Pex19p (panel a, lanes 1–3) and GFP (panel a, lanes 4–6) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because Pex19p was shown to sequester p19ARF in the cytoplasm, we compared the subcellular localization of exogenous Myc-tagged mouse and human ARF proteins in an identical cellular background (HeLa cells). In time course experiments, p19ARF (as detected by staining with anti-Myc antibody) localized first in the cytoplasm (Fig.3 A, a) and subsequently moved to the nucleus and then to the nucleolus (Fig.3 A, b–d). In contrast, p14ARF was visible in the nucleus even at the earliest time point (6 h) (Fig. 3 B, b), and as expected, p19ARF, but not p14ARF, colocalized with Pex19p in the cytoplasm (Ref. 36Sugihara T.

The cellular background (HeLa cells), the exogenous promoter driving the ARF expression construct, and the level of expression of the two proteins as detected by Western blotting of the transfected cells with anti-Myc antibody (Fig.3 C) were identical in these experiments. Therefore the most likely reason for the different behavior of the mouse and human ARF proteins is their genetic/structural diversity.Figure 3Immunolocalization of p19ARF and p14ARF.HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged p19ARF (A) or p14ARF (B). Subcellular localizations of the proteins were visualized by staining with anti-Myc antibody at indicated time points after transfections. p19ARF (A) but not p14ARF (B) was detected in the cytoplasm at early time points. An equal level of expression of the two proteins was detected by Western blotting with the anti-Myc tag antibody after 24 h of transfection (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was shown previously that p19ARF-Pex19p interactions result in the dampening of p19ARF function (36Sugihara T.

We next compared the biological effects of p19ARF, p14ARF, and p19ARF(d-C41) (a deletion mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 41 amino acids) on colony-forming assays. NIH 3T3 cells (which lack endogenous ARF protein (54Kamijo T. Weber J.D. Zambetti G. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8292-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar)) were stably transfected with metal-inducible expression plasmids encoding the above ARF proteins. The selected colonies were analyzed for protein expression by Western blotting, and it was found that there were equal levels of expression of the transfected proteins (similar to the data shown in Fig. 3 C). The G418-selected cells were assayed for colony-forming efficiency with or without ARF expression (induced by the addition of 100 μm ZnSO4 into the medium). Expression of p14ARF resulted in 84–87% reduction in the colony-forming efficiency. The expression of p19ARF caused 45–50% reduction (Fig. 4). These results showed that the growth suppressor activity of p14ARF is much stronger than p19ARF. Interestingly, p19ARF(d-C41) had a stronger effect than full-length p19ARF. These results, together with the finding that Pex19p binds to the carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acids of p19ARF and retains it, but not p14ARF, in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3), suggest that p14ARF and p19ARF(d-C41) translocate more rapidly into the nucleus (Fig. 3) resulting in stronger growth suppressor activity.Figure 4Colony-forming assay of NIH 3T3 cells expressing inducible mouse and human ARF proteins. NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with metal-inducible expression plasmids encoding p19ARF, p14ARF, or p19ARF(d-C41)(a deletion mutant of p19ARF lacking the carboxyl-terminal 41 amino acids). Transfected cells were selected in G418-supplemented medium, plated in a 10-cm dish (500 cells/dish), induced for ARF proteins by addition of 100 μm ZnSO4, and examined for colony formation for 2 weeks. Note that p14ARF and p19ARF (d-C41) were stronger growth suppressors than the p19ARF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next constructed hammerhead ribozymes to target Pex19p expression in NIH 3T3 cells. Target sites flanking the 10 putative ribozyme cleavage sites (GUC, GUA, CUC, and CUA) in the 5′ terminus of Pex19p cDNA sequence were selected. Putative structures of each of the target sites along with the ribozyme and the tRNA sequence (155 nucleotides) were predicted using a RNA software (Mulfold2 and LoopViewer) as shown in Fig. 5 A. Four target sites (with cleavage sites at nucleotides 40, 108, 122, or 168) that showed at least 60% open structure when embedded in ribozyme and tRNA sequences (Fig. 5 A) were selected for construction in the pPUR-KE vector as described (49Koseki S.

These were transfected with Pex19p target ribozymes (Fig.5 A). Expression of ribozymes was analyzed by RT-PCR (data not shown), and their effectiveness against Pex19p was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Xpress antibody (Fig. 5 B). Two of the four ribozymes (Rz-40 and Rz-122) reduced Pex19p expression level to nearly one-tenth of the control cells (Fig. 5 B). Inactive versions of these ribozymes (change of nucleotide G5 to A5 within the catalytic domain of the ribozyme (51Fujita S. Koguma T. Ohkawa J. Mori K. Kohda T. Kise H. Nishikawa S. Iwakura M. Taira K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) were made to analyze their specificity; these did not affect Pex19p expression (Fig. 5 B). To elucidate the effect of Pex19p targeting on p19ARF or p14ARF activity, we performed p53-dependent luciferase reporter assays. NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with a p53-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid and metal-inducible expression of p19ARF or p14ARF were used. Cells transfected with ribozymes were selected with puromycin, induced for ARF expression for 48 h, and analyzed by luciferase assay. As expected, p19ARF or p14ARF resulted in up-regulation of p53-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 5 C). Coexpression of Pex19p ribozymes (Rz-40 and Rz-122) resulted in further enhancement of p19ARF-induced p53 activity by 40%; the inactive versions of these ribozymes were neutral (Fig. 5 C). These ribozymes had no effect in the absence of p19ARF. Most notably, these ribozymes did not affect p14ARF-dependent p53 transcriptional activation function (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, the results showed that Pex19p interacts with mouse ARF protein and inactivates its function; human ARF by lacking a Pex19p binding region escapes from such inactivation.Figure 5Targeting of Pex19p expression by ribozymes resulted in an activation of p19ARF but not p14ARF function. A, schematic presentation of target sites for Pex19p hammerhead ribozymes. Four target sites flanking the ribozyme cleavage site on Pex19p cDNA sequence and their predicted structures when embedded in tRNA and ribozyme target sequence are shown. B, selection of Pex19p-effective ribozymes. NIH 3T3 cells expressing His-Max-tagged Pex19p were transfected with the indicated Pex19p ribozymes and their inactive (G5A) version. Transfected cells were selected in puromycin-supplemented medium and were assayed for His-Max-tagged Pex19p expression by Western blotting with anti-Xpress antibody. Note that Rz-40 and Rz-122 but not their inactive versions effectively reduced the expression level of Pex19p. C, NIH 3T3 cells stably harboring a p53-dependent luciferase reporter and expressing Myc-tagged p19ARF or p14ARF proteins driven by a metal-inducible promoter were transfected with an equal amount (2 μg total) of active or inactive versions of Pex19p ribozymes as indicated. Cells were selected in growth medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days, induced for p19ARF/p14ARF expression by the addition of 100 μmZnSO4 for 24 h, and assayed for luciferase activity. Note that p19ARF activity was enhanced (about 35–40%) in the presence of Pex19p ribozymes. These ribozymes were neutral in the absence of p19ARF and there was no effect on p14ARF activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ARF is a major tumor suppressor and is involved in cellular senescence (6Sharpless N.E.

It has long been known that there are substantial differences in regulation of cellular senescence in mouse and human cells and that mouse cells become immortalized much more readily than human cells. The underlying reasons and mechanisms for these differences are not yet understood. We have shown that the ARF protein, a major player in cellular senescence and tumor suppression, is controlled differently in mouse and human cells. Its activity is decreased because of its interactions with Pex19p in the cytoplasm of mouse but not of human cells. This difference may provide a mechanistic explanation of the more stringent imposition of senescence in human cells and their resistance to immortalization. The INK4a (MTS1, CDKN2) locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes two unrelated tumor suppressor proteins: p16INK4a, an inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent kinase that acts upstream of the retinoblastoma protein, pRb, and p19ARF, an alternative reading frame protein that acts upstream of p53 (1Quelle D.E.

Thus, depending on the predominant metabolic pathway for arginine present in cells, products of arginine metabolism can cause either cell proliferation or cytostasis followed by apoptosis. We (11Singh R. Pervin S. Karimi A. Cederbaum S. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3305-3312PubMed Google Scholar) and others (12Thomas T. Balabhadrapathruni S. Gardner C.R. Hong J. Faaland C.A.

Pervin S. Karimi A. Cederbaum S. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3305-3312PubMed Google Scholar). The polyamine biosynthesis occurs from arginine, which initially is converted by arginase to ornithine. Ornithine is then converted to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (13Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), which converts S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to decarboxylated SAM, is required for the conversion of putrescine to spermidine (13Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu.

Inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase and SAMDC have been shown to reduce proliferation of various types of malignant cells (14Regenass U. Mett H. Stanek J. Mueller M. Kramer D. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3210-3217PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dorhout B. te Velde R.J. Ferwerda H. Kingma A.W. de Hoog E. Muskiet F.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) including breast cancer cells (16Kaneko H. Hibasami H. Mori K. Kawarada Y. Nakashima K. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar), and this was accompanied by a reduction in intracellular polyamine levels. We have previously demonstrated that breast cancer cell lines that predominately expressed arginase had a higher rate of proliferation when compared with cell lines that predominately expressed NOS (11Singh R. Pervin S. Karimi A. Cederbaum S. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3305-3312PubMed Google Scholar), thereby demonstrating how products of arginine metabolism may modulate cell proliferation. NOHA inhibited arginase in MDA-MB-468 cells, and this initially led to cytostasis followed by activation of caspase-3. This was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular polyamine levels. As this action of NOHA was abolished in the presence of exogenousl-ornithine, we speculated that the action of NOHA in inducing apoptosis in this cell line was most likely due to a reduction in intracellular polyamine levels (11Singh R. Pervin S. Karimi A. Cederbaum S. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3305-3312PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this cell line, when we added difluromethyl ornithine, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, or SAM-486A, an inhibitor of SAMDC, either alone or in combination, there was a reduction in intracellular polyamine content, but only cytostasis was observed, not apoptosis (17Singh R. Pervin S., Wu, G. Chaudhuri G. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On this basis, we concluded that the apoptotic action of NOHA in MDA-MB-468 cells cannot be explained solely on the basis of a reduction in intracellular polyamine levels and that other mechanisms must also be considered. The present work was, therefore, undertaken to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved by which NOHA induced apoptosis in this cell line. MDA-MB-468 cells were selected for our study as this cell line expresses high arginase activity with very little NOS (11Singh R. Pervin S. Karimi A. Cederbaum S. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3305-3312PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of NOHA can be studied without any confounding influence of endogenous NOHA and NO produced by these cells.

Valinomycin and gramicidin were purchased from Sigma. Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MD-468 (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For experimental purposes, cells were grown in 5% fetal bovine serum, allowed to seed overnight, and treated with drugs for various durations. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer as previously described (7Pervin S. Singh R. Gau C.L. Edamatsu H. Tamanoi F. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4701-4706PubMed Google Scholar). The lysates were used for caspase-3 (3 μg), caspase-9 (6 μg), and caspase-8 (15 μg) assays using respective substrates. The released AMC (for caspase-3 and caspase-9) and AFC (for caspase-8) after specific cleavage of respective substrates becomes fluorescent were quantified using a fluorometer (Versa FluroTM, Bio-Rad) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm for AMC substrates (7Pervin S. Singh R. Gau C.L. Edamatsu H. Tamanoi F. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4701-4706PubMed Google Scholar) and at excitation 410 nm and emission at 510 nm for AFC substrate (34De Nadai C. Sestili P. Cantoni O. Lievremont J-P. Sciorati C. Barsacchi R. Moncada S. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5480-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), respectively. Cells were lysed as described previously (7Pervin S. Singh R. Gau C.L. Edamatsu H. Tamanoi F. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4701-4706PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates (30 μg) were resolved electrophoretically on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a tank blot procedure (Bio-Rad Mini Protean II). The membranes were incubated with anti-caspase-8 antibody (1:200), anti-caspase-3 antibody (1:3000), anti-BID antibody (1:1000), and anti- PARP antibody (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature and anti-caspase-9 antibody (1:1000) overnight followed by subsequent incubation with 1:1000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab) fragment secondary antibody (AmershamBiosciences) for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Cytochrome c release into the cytosol was detected as described previously with minor modifications (7Pervin S. Singh R. Gau C.L. Edamatsu H. Tamanoi F. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4701-4706PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 106 cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were suspended in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) and homogenized by Dounce homogenizer; unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was saved as a cytosolic fraction while the precipitate was suspended in Buffer A containing 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and was saved as the mitochondrial fraction. The mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody or with an anti-cytochrome c oxidase antibody. 1 × 106 cells were harvested, washed twice with cold 1× PBS and incubated with 100 nmMitoTracker Red CMX-Ros dye at 37 °C for 15 min in the dark, washed twice with cold PBS, and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Valinomycin (10 μm), a potassium ionophore, which serves as a hyperpolarization control, and gramicidin (10 μm), a relatively non-selective ionophore, which serves as a depolarization control (18Shapiro H.M. Current Protocols in Cytometry. Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 9.6.1-9.6.10Google Scholar), were also included in our experiments in order to validate our results for mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay. We have shown previously that NOHA when used alone induced significant caspase-3 activity in MDA-MB-468 cells after 48 h, which was blocked in the presence of exogenous l-ornithine. To understand the precise mechanism(s) by which NOHA induced apoptosis in this cell line, we studied the time course of caspase-3 induction after NOHA treatment. We observed a 4-fold induction of caspase-3 with NOHA (1 mm) at 32 h, which increased subsequently by 10-fold at 48 h (Fig. 1 A). Exogenous l-ornithine (1 mm) added along with NOHA was able to block this NOHA-induced caspase-3 induction. We also assessed caspase-3 activation by Western blot analysis by observing its proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 1 B). We observed a 17-kDa band corresponding to cleaved caspase-3 as early as 32 h, the intensity of which increased further at 48 h of NOHA treatment. This cleaved band (17 kDa) was undetectable in samples that received exogenous l-ornithine along with NOHA. We observed that PARP, a caspase-3 substrate, was cleaved as early as 32 h, generating a cleaved 85-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 C). At 48 h, there was complete fragmentation of 117-kDa PARP into cleaved fragment (85 kDa). l-Ornithine (1 mm) was able to efficiently block this cleavage of PARP (Fig.1 C). Activation of caspase-3 could be either via death receptor signaling or due to caspase-9 activation through mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. We observed that caspase-9 was activated during NOHA-induced apoptosis. There was a 2-fold induction of caspase-9 at 24 h followed by a 4-fold induction at 32 h, and it increased further to ∼9-fold at 48 h (Fig. 2 A). Western blot analysis further indicated that at 32 h there was a proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9 that further increased at 48 h (Fig. 2 B). l-Ornithine was able to block this NOHA-induced activation as well as proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9. To further confirm the role of caspase-9 and -3 in NOHA-induced apoptosis, we studied the effect of their inhibitors. We used Z-DEVD-fmk and Z-LEHD-fmk as caspase-3 and -9 inhibitors, respectively. These inhibitors at 25 μmconcentration completely inhibited the NOHA-induced activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 2 C) and thus apoptosis suggesting a distinct involvement of the caspase-9/-3 pathway. To study the upstream sequence of events during NOHA-induced apoptosis, we assessed the time course of cytochrome c release into the cytosol and correlated this with the time course of caspase-9 and -3 activation. We isolated mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from cells after different treatments as described under “Materials and Methods.” We observed the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol as early as 32 h, which further increased by 4-fold after 48 h of NOHA treatment. However, simultaneous treatment of cells withl-ornithine blocked this release of cytochrome cinto the cytosol (Fig. 3 A). We also confirmed that our cytosolic fractions had no mitochondrial contamination by probing the membrane with anti-cytochrome-coxidase antibody (data not shown). Disruptions in MMP are measured with a number of cationic lipophilic fluorochromes including MitoTracker Red CMX-Ros and flow cytometry (18Shapiro H.M. Current Protocols in Cytometry. Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 9.6.1-9.6.10Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B(top panel) shows the validation of the method using a negative control. Addition of dye, CMX-Ros (100 nm), caused a shift in the fluorescence compared with the negative control. Valinomycin, a control for hyperpolarization, further shifted the fluorescence to the right, an indication of hyperpolarization of the MMP. Gramicidin, a control for depolarization, shifted the intensity of fluorescence to the left indicative of depolarized MMP. NOHA induced hyperpolarization of the MMP as early as 3 h, and this hyperpolarization persisted until 48 h, andl-ornithine did not change this NOHA-induced hyperpolarization (Fig 3 B). Similar results were found when we used other dyes like dihexyloxacarbocyanine or rhodamine 123 (data not shown). Thus our results show that release of cytochromec into the cytosol was not due to the decrease in the MMP. We studied the time course of activation of caspase-8, an upstream caspase, usually known to act upstream of mitochondrial events. Recent reports have suggested that activation of caspase-8 followed by truncation of BID leads to release of cytochromec that is independent of decrease in MMP. Fig.4 A shows that caspase-8 activity was induced by 2-fold at 8 h of NOHA treatment and reached a maximum of 7-fold after 32 h. Exogenousl-ornithine had no direct effect on the NOHA-induced activation of caspase-8 (data not shown). We observed a similar pattern of caspase-8 proteolytic cleavage by NOHA in Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 4 B. We studied the time course of BID cleavage in order to correlate the sequence of events during NOHA-induced apoptosis. Fig. 4 C shows a slight cleavage of BID at 4 h, and maximum cleavage was observed at 32 h. A cleaved band could be observed at 15 kDa (p15 BID) corresponding to the truncated BID (tBID). Again, exogenous l-ornithine did not inhibit the NOHA-induced BID cleavage, and the time course of caspase-8 activation was correlated with the time course of BID cleavage. To confirm that caspase-8 activation works upstream of the mitochondrial events leading to cytochrome c release, we performed experiments where inhibitors of different caspases were incubated along with NOHA at concentrations reported in different cell lines to block their activation after 48 h. Fig.5 A shows that NOHA-induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol could be prevented by the caspase-8 inhibitor or a pan-caspase inhibitor but not by caspase-3 or caspase-9 inhibitors. Caspase-8 is activated in many cell lines after activation of the TNF-R1/Fas pathway. We therefore assessed the role of TNF-α during NOHA-mediated caspase-8 activation. TNF-α was not able to activate the caspase-8 or -3 in MDA-MB-468 cells. However, when combined with NOHA (1 mm), we observed that TNF-α potentiated the action of NOHA in inducing caspase-8 (and caspase-3) activity at a much earlier time point. Fig. 5 B shows that after 4 h there was a 2-fold induction in the caspase-8 activation with a combination of TNF-α and NOHA compared with the caspase-8 activation with NOHA alone, which further increased to ∼3.5-fold after 8 h of NOHA treatment. The primary objective of our study was to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which NOHA led to apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 cells and to assess the specific site of action and mechanism(s) by whichl-ornithine prevented NOHA-induced apoptosis (Fig.6). Mitochondria play a central role in the commitment of cells to apoptosis (19Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 20Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most studies indicate that the initial event observed following application of the apoptotic stimulus is a decrease in the inner transmembrane potential followed by an increase in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming the permeability transition pores and subsequent release of cytochrome c from the intermembranous space into the cytosol (21Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). This released cytochrome c then forms a complex with the apoptosis activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9 called “apoptosome” to activate caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3, a downstream caspase (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar, 23Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Once activated, caspase-3 cleaves its substrate PARP and, subsequently, leads to fragmentation of DNA (24Decker P. Isenberg D. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9043-9046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In our flow cytometry analysis using the mitochondria-sensitive dye CMX-Ros during NOHA-induced apoptosis, we did not observe any decrease in MMP. Rather, we observed release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria during NOHA-induced hyperpolarization of the MMP. Our method for assessing changes in transmembrane potential was validated using valinomycin, which causes hyperpolarization of MMP and which increased the fluorescence, whereas gramicidin, which causes depolarization of MMP, decreased the fluorescence. The hyperpolarization of MMP caused by NOHA was further confirmed using other dyes like dihexyloxacarbocyanine and rhodamine 123 that showed similar results (data not shown). Our results indicate that the collapse of the inner MMP is not a universal early event that triggers cytochrome c release leading to apoptosis and moreover is not always an essential part of the central apoptotic machinery. In this regard, our results are similar to those reported by other investigators who observed that HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis in response to the cytotoxic insults of actinomycin D, etoposide, and staurosporine without showing significant loss of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (25Finucane D.M. Waterhouse N.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Cotter T.G. Green D.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We therefore considered other potential mechanisms by which NOHA may affect the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane and thereby lead to cytochrome crelease into the cytosol independent of a depolarization of the MMP. In this regard two major mechanisms have been proposed (26Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A., Xi, X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). One mechanism proposed is that BID, a cytosolic BH3interacting domain only member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, is a substrate for caspase-8, which is activated by the FAS/TNF-R1 pathway and cleaves BID at the C-terminal to generate tBID. This tBID then translocates to the mitochondria and induces cytochrome crelease either in a Bax-dependent or independent manner (26Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). More recently, caspase-8-mediated cleavage of BID was also shown to induce N-myristoylation of tBID, and this modification enhanced its targeting to lipid membranes and mitochondria (29Zha J. Weiler S., Oh, K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). One possible reason for the targeting of tBID to mitochondria has been attributed to its propensity for binding to cardiolipin (30Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), a membrane lipid unique to mitochondria (31Hatch G.M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). Another mechanism suggested is that after apoptotic insult, Bax, another multidomain pro-apoptotic cytosolic protein, integrates to the outer mitochondrial membrane and causes cytochrome c release (27Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A., Xi, X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) in a BID-independent manner. We, therefore, assessed the possibility as to whether NOHA-induced activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis occurred by a BID-dependent or BID-independent mechanism. As caspase-8 activation is required for truncation of BID, we initially assessed the time course of activation of caspase-8, its proteolytic cleavage, and the appearance of tBID and how this correlated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. In this regard, we observed that activation of caspase-8 was significantly increased after 8 h following NOHA treatment, and peak activation occurred at 32 h (Fig. 4 A). Slight truncation of BID was seen as early as 4 h that peaked between 24 and 32 h. Following exposure of the cells to NOHA, the peak release of cytochromec release coincided with the peak caspase-8 activation and significant truncation of BID. We then considered the possibility as to whether the early and late release of cytochrome c may have been due to BID-mediated integration of Bax at the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, this does not appear to be the case as we were not able to demonstrate Bax integration into the mitochondrial membrane at any time point, and therefore the release of cytochrome c by tBID must have occurred by a Bax-independent mechanism. Activation of caspase-3 started around 32 h and peaked at 48 h following treatment of cells with NOHA. This activation of caspase-3, therefore, was initiated only following caspase-8 activation and truncation of BID, which then induced a massive release of cytochrome cand ultimately was responsible for the activation of caspase-3, thereby committing the cells to the apoptotic pathway. We next assessed the mechanism by which NOHA induced activation of caspase-8. We observed that NOHA along with TNF-α led to a significant activation of caspase-8 activity when compared with cells treated with NOHA or TNF-α alone (Fig. 5 B). This action of NOHA therefore may have contributed to the apoptosis as TNF-α is released by this cell line. 2R. Singh, S. Pervin, and G. Chaudhuri, unpublished observation. We have demonstrated previously that l-ornithine inhibited NOHA-induced apoptosis. We, therefore, elected to usel-ornithine as a tool to further identify the sequence of events during NOHA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). l-Ornithine did not inhibit the NOHA-induced activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of BID, suggesting that the action of l-ornithine must have occurred further downstream. NOHA-induced hyperpolarization of MMP was not changed by l-ornithine indicating that hyperpolarization was not the triggering event that led to cytochromec release. On the other hand, l-ornithine antagonized the effect of NOHA in releasing cytochrome cfrom the mitochondria and all subsequent steps downstream leading to apoptosis. It, therefore, appears that the antagonistic effect ofl-ornithine during NOHA-induced apoptosis was most likely at the level of the mitochondria where it prevented the release of cytochrome c. In this regard, it is interesting that other investigators have demonstrated (32Esch F. Lin K.I. Hills A. Zaman K. Baraban J.M. Chatterjee S. Rubin L. Ash D.E. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4083-4095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that extracellularly applied arginase inhibited neuronal apoptosis induced by multiple stimuli. Furthermore, arginase was identified by mass spectrometry as one of the proteins released from the mitochondria during apoptosis (33Patterson S.D. Spahr C.S. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Irinopoulou T. Koehler C. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). On this basis, it was speculated that the protective effect of arginine in inhibiting neuronal apoptosis was dependent on depletion of arginine metabolized by arginase. As arginase converts arginine to ornithine, it would be interesting to speculate whether l-ornithine was the anti-apoptotic factor in these studies similar to our observation in studies related to NOHA-induced apoptosis. Macrophages as well as myoepithelial cells at the site of breast cancer express NOS (35Thomsen L.L. Lawton F.G. Knowles R.G. Beesley J.E. Riveros-Moreno V. Moncada S. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and therefore have the capacity to generate both NOHA and NO. Thus NOHA and NO by independent mechanisms may induce apoptosis and therefore complement each other. In conclusion, our studies indicate that NOHA-induced apoptosis occurs upstream of the mitochondria, most likely by activation of caspase-8 followed by cleavage of BID to tBID. Our studies also indicate that l-ornithine has anti-apoptotic action and acts at the level of the mitochondria to inhibit NOHA-induced release of cytochrome c and thereby apoptosis. Further studies are in progress to assess the precise mechanism(s) by whichl-ornithine acts at the level of the mitochondria as an anti-apoptotic factor and whether this is specific to NOHA or whether it may be applicable to some other apoptotic agents that act by activating caspase-8.

https://openalex.org/W2047588262,"We report here that expression of proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine protease, is down-regulated in the HL60/ADR multidrug resistant variant of the human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60, and that down-regulation of PR3 is associated with doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in these cells. To determine whether PR3 is involved in DOX-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, and whether its loss causes resistance to DOX, we inhibited PR3 expression by an anti-sense PR3 oligodeoxynucleotide and showed that inhibition of PR3 expression results in a significant reduction in DOX-induced DNA fragmentation and increased resistance to DOX-induced apoptosis. Our results revealed that PR3-mediated DOX-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells is independent of the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) and activation of the caspase-8 and -9 pathways. Moreover, while PR3 is involved in the cleavage of caspase-3, PR3-mediated DOX-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis were not prevented by a specific inhibitor of caspase-3. These data suggest that activation of caspase-3 alone is not sufficient to trigger PR3-mediated DOX-induced apoptosis. Treatment with an anti-PR3 oligomer significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells treated with low concentrations of DOX, revealing a role for PR3 in enhancing production of DOX-induced ROS. Moreover, DOX-induced apoptosis at 0.001-0.01 microM was only inhibited in HL-60 cells pre-treated with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine in the absence of anti-PR3, revealing that DOX-induced apoptosis in these cells is PR3- and ROS-dependent. Our results show that PR3 is involved in DOX-induced ROS-dependent apoptosis and that its loss is associated with resistance to DOX in HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526032728,"Space missions currently on the drawing boards are expected to gather data at rates exceeding the transmission capabilities of today's telemetry systems by many orders of magnitude. Even on current missions, onboard data compression techniques are being implemented to compensate for lack of transmission speed. But while data compression can minimize the loss of data, it is no substitute for transmitting all of the data through a faster communications link. The transmission problem will soon reach crisis proportions and will affect astronomical, Earth resources, geophysical, meteorological, planetary and other space science missions. To overcome this communications bottleneck, the authors advocate the implementation of telemetry systems based on near-infrared laser transmission techniques. The fiber-optics communications industry has developed most of the basic components required for signal transmission in this wavelength band, which should make such a system affordable on scales relevant to the cost of anticipated space science missions."

During these studies we observed the specific co-immunoprecipitation of a 20-kDa protein with CaMK II. Purification and sequence analysis indicate that this protein is the S18 protein of the 40 S ribosome. S18 was found to be abundantly phosphorylated in response to serum treatment, and this effect was strongly inhibited by heparin. In addition, KN-93, a specific CaMK II inhibitor, blocks S18 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells; a concomitant 24% reduction in protein synthesis was observed. Taken together these data support the idea that S18 could be a novel substrate for CaMK II, thus providing a potential link between Ca2+-mobilizing agents and protein translation.

In addition, KN-93, a specific CaMK II inhibitor, blocks S18 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells; a concomitant 24% reduction in protein synthesis was observed. Taken together these data support the idea that S18 could be a novel substrate for CaMK II, thus providing a potential link between Ca2+-mobilizing agents and protein translation. Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein kinase II vascular smooth muscle cell fetal calf serum 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid CaMK II1 is found in virtually all tissues examined and is thought to play a role in diverse cellular processes such as neurotransmitter release (1Sumi M.

Recent evidence also suggests that CaMK II regulates the induction of VSMC contraction by regulating the phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase. Caldesmon and calponin, two other proteins involved in contraction, are also postulated to be substrates for CaMK II. Both these proteins can inhibit actin-activated myosin ATPase; however, when phosphorylated by CaMK II they lose their ability to inhibit actomyosin ATPase (7Bronstein J.M. Farber D.B. Wasterlain C.G. Brain Res. Rev. 1993; 18: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite the potentially important role of CaMK II in VSMC contraction, there is minimal information available about its regulation in vivo. Furthermore, the relative abundance of this enzyme implies a role in other cellular functions, but the lack of other physiologically relevant substrates (besides calponin and caldesmon) for CaMK II in VSMCs has blunted the analysis of other putative functions. Here we report that the S18 protein of the 40 S ribosome is a potential substrate of CaMK II. While almost nothing is known about the function of S18 in animal cells, it is a highly basic protein showing high homology to the Escherichia coli ribosomal protein rpS13. rpS13 plays important roles in both initiation and elongation during protein translation and is thought to help regulate translational efficiency. Hence, the identification of S18 as a putative substrate for CaMK II may provide a novel link between Ca2+-mobilizing agents and protein translation control. All tissue culture plasticware was obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA) and Falcon (BD PharMingen). Fetal calf serum was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT). RPMI base medium, trypsin-EDTA, glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Heparin, obtained from Glycomed (Alameda, CA), was derived from porcine mucosa (sodium salt) (molecular mass, 12–18 kDa). Chondroitin sulfate and reagents for buffers, cell extraction, and SDS-gel electrophoresis were from Sigma. Platelet-derived growth factor was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and lysophosphatidic acid was from Sigma. Acrylamide solution (Protogel) was from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Invitrogen; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sodium orthovanadate was from Sigma; okadaic acid, calyculin, tautomycin, and KN-93 were from Calbiochem. [3H]Leucine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc.) were isolated, cultured, and characterized as described previously (8Castellot J.J., Jr. Choay J. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Sache E. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1979-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, the abdominal segment of the aorta was removed, and the fascia was cleaned away under a dissecting microscope. The aorta was cut longitudinally, and small pieces of the media were carefully stripped from the vessel wall. Two or three such strips were placed in 60-mm dishes. Within 1–2 weeks, VSMCs migrated from the explants; they were capable of being passaged approximately 1 week after the first appearance of cells. They were identified as smooth muscle cells by their “hill and valley” growth pattern and indirect immunofluorescence staining for VSMC-specific α-actin. VSMC cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Primary cultures were used at or before passage 9. Cells were counted using a Coulter Counter (Coulter Counter Corp., Hialeah, Fl). Cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). SV40 large T antigen-transformed heparin-resistant and -sensitive cells (9Caleb B.L. Hardenbrook M. Cherington P.V. Castellot J.J., Jr. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were grown and maintained under similar conditions. Cells were routinely plated at 5–6 × 105/100-cm2 dish, washed with RPMI, and placed in RPMI containing 0.2–0.4% FCS for 72 h (10Castellot J.J., Jr. Pukac L.A. Caleb B.L. Wright T.C., Jr. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3147-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Flow microfluorometry and determination of [3H]thymidine-labeled nuclei indicated that greater than 95% of the cells were arrested in G0(G1). Cells were released from quiescence by replacing the low serum medium with normal growth medium (i.e. RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS). The cells were ∼40–60% confluent at the time of harvest. Quiescent cells were treated with 10% FCS, RPMI with or without the indicated concentrations of heparin or chondroitin sulfate for various time intervals. The proteins were then harvested as follows with all procedures performed at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with cold TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl) and lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (TBS + 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). The extracts were rocked for 20 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (Eppendorf microcentrifuge) for 10 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was stored at −20 °C until use. Protein estimations were done by the Pierce BCA method adapted for microtiter plates. Extracts containing 50 μg of protein were boiled with 1× SDS sample loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (11Ausebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, New York1996: 286-289Google Scholar), and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schu¨ll) in Towbin buffer (25 mm Trizma (Tris base), 192 mmglycine, 20% methanol) at 250 mA overnight. The blots were stained with Ponceau stain to confirm equal loading and transfer of proteins to the membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in 1× TBS (20 mm Tris base, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6), and Western blots were performed using anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-phosphoserine antibodies (1:1000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) in 1× TBST (TBS + 0.2% Tween 20). The proteins were visualized using the DuPont Renaissance Enhanced ChemiLuminescence detection reagents and autoradiography as described by the manufacturer. Prestained protein standard markers (Invitrogen) were used as molecular weight markers. Densitometric analysis on the autoradiograms was performed using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) Eagle Eye II system and the Scanalytics (Billerica, MA) ONE D-scan software. Protein synthesis was measured as described previously for smooth muscle cells (12Cochran D.L. Castellot J.J., Jr. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104 VSMCs were plated into 24-well microplates. 2 days later, 2 μCi/ml [3H]leucine was added to the culture medium in the presence or absence of 30 μm KN-93, a specific inhibitor of CaMK II (1Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). After 2 h, cells were washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 1.0 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) was added to each well. The cells were incubated on ice for 1 h and washed five times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. 1.0 ml of 1.0 m NaOH was added to each well overnight at 37 °C, pH was neutralized with 10 m HCL, and a small portion was counted using liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Replicate wells within the same multiwell plate were harvested for both protein determination and cell counting (12Cochran D.L. Castellot J.J., Jr. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To ensure that intracellular and extracellular leucine pools were completely equilibrated and that the specific radioactivity of leucyl-tRNA was unchanged by KN-93, the methods outlined by Gulves and Dice were followed (13Gulves E.A. Dice J.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used in our experiments, these parameters were found not to contribute to the changes in protein synthesis rates observed in the presence of KN-93. Quiescent cells were rinsed in phosphate-free RPMI and incubated in this medium for 2 h in the presence of 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (14Hardie D.G. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Haystead T.A.J. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 113-118Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with 10% FCS, RPMI + heparin or with 1 μm ionomycin, RPMI + heparin. Proteins were harvested in Buffer A (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.4 unit/ml aprotinin) and allowed to sit on ice for 5 min, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-CaMK II antibodies (90 min at 4 °C) and protein A + G-agarose beads (Oncogene Science) (60 min at 4 °C). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose, and differential phosphorylation was analyzed after overnight exposure on a PhosphorImager. Quiescent VSMCs were stimulated with 10% FCS, RPMI, and the cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with the anti-CaMK II δ-isoform-specific antibodies as described above. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were visualized by Colloidal Coomassie Blue staining. The p20 band was excised from the gel and submitted for sequence analysis to the Harvard microsequencing facility. Quiescent VSMCs were radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described above. 90 min into the incubation, KN-93 was added to a final concentration of 30 μm. After 30 min the cells were stimulated with 10% FCS for 5 min. The proteins were then harvested and used for immunoprecipitation as described above. We have reported that heparin inhibits CaMK II phosphorylation and activation (15Mishra-Gorur K. Castellot J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8 (abstr.): 401aGoogle Scholar, 34Mishra-Gorur, K., Singer, H. A., and Castellot, J. J., Jr. (2002)Am. J. Pathol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In these experiments, growth-arrested VSMCs were radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP followed by stimulation with 10% FCS, RPMI + heparin for 5 min. The cell lysates were then used for immunoprecipitation with anti-CaMK II δ-isoform-specific antibodies. This antibody was chosen because the δ-isoform is the predominant form found in VSMCs (16Schworer C.M. Rothblum L.I. Thekkumkara T.J. Singer H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the antibody is highly specific as it is made against the NFSGGTSLWQNI peptide unique to the C terminus of the δ2-isoform (16Schworer C.M. Rothblum L.I. Thekkumkara T.J. Singer H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Abraham S.T. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A single protein (Mr ∼ 20,000; p20) was found to co-immunoprecipitate with CaMK II (Fig.1). In addition, p20 was abundantly phosphorylated upon serum stimulation, and this effect was potently inhibited by heparin. Control immunoprecipitations with the agarose beads alone were performed to ensure that p20 was not simply interacting with the beads. Based on the observations that 1) the phosphorylation of both CaMK II and p20 was inhibited by heparin and 2) p20 co-immunoprecipitated with CaMK II, we considered the possibility that p20 might be a novel substrate of CaMK II. To identify this protein, we performed a large scale immunoprecipitation with anti-CaMK II antibodies on serum-treated VSMC lysates. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Colloidal Coomassie Blue stain. The p20 protein band was excised from the gel and submitted for sequence analysis. Two peptides were sequenced, and both peptides exhibited 100% homology to the corresponding sequence of the rat ribosomal protein S18 of the 40 S ribosome (Fig. 2). To test whether cellular S18 was phosphorylated by CaMK II, we used KN-93, a specific inhibitor of CaMK II (1Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Quiescent VSMCs were radioactively labeled for 2 h with [γ-32P]ATP. 90 minutes into the incubation, KN-93 was added to the medium at a final concentration of 30 μm. After 30 min of incubation with KN-93 the cells were treated with 10% FCS or 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min. Cells were harvested, and the lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-CaMK II δ-isoform-specific antibodies. Quiescent cells and cells treated with KN-93 alone were used as controls. Immunoprecipitation with beads alone was done to confirm the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation. KN-93 treatment resulted in a reduction of CaMK II phosphorylation due to either FCS or ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 3). A concomitant reduction in the phosphorylation of the S18 protein was observed, suggesting that S18 is phosphorylated by CaMK II (Fig. 3). If S18 phosphorylation by CaMK II plays a role in regulating translational efficiency, then inhibiting S18 phosphorylation with KN-93 should reduce protein synthesis rates in VSMCs. To test this hypothesis, we added [3H]leucine to exponentially growing VSMCs in the presence or absence of 30 μm KN-93 (Table I), a concentration that reduces S18 phosphorylation by ∼74% (Fig. 3). Using two independently isolated VMSC cultures, KN-93 reduced protein synthesis rates by an average of 24%. Control experiments (12Cochran D.L. Castellot J.J., Jr. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Gulves E.A. Dice J.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) indicate that the intracellular leucine pool is fully equilibrated, that the leucyl-tRNA fraction is unchanged in the presence of KN-93, and that >95% of the cell protein is collected by the methods used (data not shown).Table IS18 phosphorylation affects protein synthesis rates in VSMCsCulturedpm/105cells% ChangeVSMC-3A − KN-9323,656 ± 1,922 + KN-9318,869 ± 840−21VSMC-8A − KN-9319,813 ± 2,047 + KN-9314,462 ± 1,115−27Two independently isolated VSMC cultures (designated 3A and 8A) were used to measure protein synthesis rates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells in quadruplicate wells were exposed to [3H]leucine for 2 h in the presence or absence of 30 μm KN-93, a concentration that blocks S18 phosphorylation by 74% (Fig. 3).

This study provides evidence that the S18 protein of the 40 S ribosome can be phosphorylated by CaMK II, thus identifying a putative substrate for CaMK II in VSMCs. The evidence includes 1) a physical association of S18 with CaMK II as determined by co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins and 2) pharmacologic suppression of S18 phosphorylation by two inhibitors of CaMK II, heparin and KN-93. Furthermore, inhibiting phosphorylation of S18 with KN-93 also produced a reduction in protein translation rates. Although the initial observation of a putative CaMK II/S18 interaction was made using heparin, work in our laboratory (10Castellot J.J., Jr. Pukac L.A. Caleb B.L. Wright T.C., Jr. Karnovsky M.J. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19173-19176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly indicates that heparin inhibits kinases other than CaMK II. We therefore used the highly specific CaMK II inhibitor KN-93 to confirm this interaction. KN-93 is a more hydrophilic analogue of the isoquinolinyl sulfonamide KN-62. Both these inhibitors prevent the activation of CaMK II by interacting with the calmodulin binding domain of the kinase (1Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). KN-93 has no significant effects on myosin light chain kinase, protein kinase C, or protein kinase A at the concentrations used in the current study (17Abraham S.T. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). KN-93 pretreatment resulted in an attenuation of CaMK II phosphorylation upon FCS stimulation. A concomitant reduction in S18 phosphorylation as well as the reproducible co-immunoprecipitation of S18 with CaMK II may provide a link between calcium-mobilizing agents and protein translation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the inhibition of S18 phosphorylation is accompanied by a 24% reduction in protein synthesis. Little is known about the eukaryotic S18 protein except for its sequence. However, its prokaryotic homolog, the E. colirpS13, has been studied more extensively, and the available data may provide insights into the role of S18 protein in eukaryotes, especially since there are many conserved domains between the two. Both S18 and rpS13 are very basic proteins (21Chan Y.-L. Paz V. Wool I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Garwood J. Lepesant J.-A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The E. coli rpS13 is thought to be involved in the initiation of translation as it is a surface protein at the interface of the ribosomal subunits that cross-links to all three initiation factors (23Boileau G. Butler P. Hershey J.W. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3162-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It interacts strongly with the 20 S rRNA and has been cross-linked to the 3′ major domain of the 16 S rRNA (24Powers T. Stern S. Changchien L.M. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 697-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Osswald M. Doring T. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4635-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Heilik G.M. Noller H.F. RNA. 1996; 2: 597-602PubMed Google Scholar), to ribosomal protein S19 (27Pohl T. Wittman-Liebold B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4293-4301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to tRNA in both the P and A sites (25Osswald M. Doring T. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4635-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Wower J. Malloy T.A. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that rpS13 is important for both translation initiation and elongation. rpS13 can be phosphorylated by a eukaryotic protein kinase (29Issinger O.G. Kiefer M.C. Traut R.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and there are a number of phosphorylation sites in the eukaryotic S18 protein for phosphorylation by casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and a tyrosine kinase. Based on the high degree of homology between S18 and rpS13, it is possible that S18 plays an important role in ribosome assembly as well as in translational efficiency. In support of this idea, a mutant of the E. coli rpS13 protein lacking the C-terminal 19 amino acids shows a 20–30% reduction in translation rate (30Faxen M.A. Granberg W. Isaksson L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) in agreement with the 24% drop in protein synthesis rates observed when S18 phosphorylation is blocked in VSMCs. Interestingly the C-terminal portion is required for 16 S rRNA recognition (31Schwarzbauer J. Craven G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6767-6786Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the consensus motif for CaMK II phosphorylation is present within the C-terminal 19 residues of the protein sequence of S18. The notion that phosphorylation of S18 regulates the rate of translation becomes even more interesting in light of the ability of heparin to inhibit both CaMK II and protein kinase C, both of which can phosphorylate the S18 protein (22Garwood J. Lepesant J.-A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), implying that heparin may alter translation rates. Although previous studies have indicated that heparin blocks proliferation of VSMC, this glycosaminoglycan alters the overall rate of protein synthesis in VSMCs by 20% or less (12Cochran D.L. Castellot J.J., Jr. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When one considers that growth regulatory proteins are very labile and comprise a very small percentage of the total protein in a cell while housekeeping proteins are generally much more stable, even large fluctuations in the levels of growth regulatory proteins would not be detected when measuring overall protein synthesis. In addition, mRNA encoding growth regulatory proteins has a very short half-life; thus, even a modest reduction in translation rate such as the 20–30% decrease seen in rpS13 mutants and the 23% reduction observed with underphosphorylated S18 would result in the rapid degradation/reduction of these nascent message levels in the cell. The co-immunoprecipitation of a 20-kDa protein with CaMK II only in the presence of mitogenic stimulation has been reported earlier (32Tazi K.A. Bonnafous M. Favre G. Soula G. Le Gaillard F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, further studies to identify the protein were not reported. There is one prior observation of differential phosphorylation of a ribosomal protein (33Fawell E.H. Boyer I.J. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1650-1655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this effect was independent of the cytosolic free Ca2+ pool and thus was not a result of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases; instead, it is a reflection of the sequestered pool of intracellular Ca2+. In contrast, serum treatment causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, a key factor in proliferative responses. Exploring the connection between CaMK II and S18 should provide a better understanding of the antiproliferative mechanism of heparin and may shed new light on the relationship between Ca2+-mobilizing agents and protein translation."
https://openalex.org/W2077711339,"In this study we show that the naturally occurring C-terminally alternative spliced p53 (referred to as AS-p53) is active as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein as well as a 3'-5'-exonuclease in the presence of Mg2+ ions. The two activities are positively correlated as the sequence-specific DNA target is more efficiently degraded than a non-specific target. In contrast, a mutated AS-p53 protein that is deficient in DNA binding lacks exonuclease activity. The use of modified p53 binding sites, where the 3'-phosphate is replaced by a phosphorothioate group, enabled the inhibition of DNA degradation under the binding conditions. We demonstrate that AS-p53 interacts with its specific DNA target by two distinct binding modes: a high-affinity mode characterized by a low-mobility protein-DNA complex at the nanomolar range, and a low-affinity mode shown by a high-mobility complex at the micromolar range. Comparison of the data on the natural and the modified p53 binding sites suggests that the high-affinity mode is related to AS-p53 function as a transcription factor and that the low-affinity mode is associated with its exonuclease activity. The implications of these findings to a specific cellular role of AS-p53 are discussed."
