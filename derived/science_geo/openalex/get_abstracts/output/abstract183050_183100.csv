Further analysis of the bovine striatal extract from which NADA was isolated indicated the existence of substances corresponding in molecular mass to N-oleoyldopamine (OLDA),N-palmitoyldopamine (PALDA), andN-stearoyldopamine (STEARDA). Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis of bovine striatal extracts revealed the existence of OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA as endogenous compounds in the mammalian brain. PALDA and STEARDA failed to affect calcium influx in VR1-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or paw withdrawal latencies from a radiant heat source, and there was no evidence of spontaneous pain behavior. By contrast, OLDA induced calcium influx (EC50 = 36 nm), reduced the latency of paw withdrawal from a radiant heat source in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 0.72 μg), and produced nocifensive behavior. These effects were blocked by co-administration of the VR1 antagonist iodo-resiniferatoxin (10 nm for HEK cells and 1 μg/50 μl for pain behavior). These findings demonstrate the existence of an endogenous compound in the brain that is similar to capsaicin and NADA in its chemical structure and activity on VR1. Unlike NADA, OLDA was only a weak ligand for rat CB1 receptors; but like NADA, it was recognized by the anandamide membrane transporter while being a poor substrate for fatty-acid amide hydrolase. Analysis of the activity of six additional synthetic and potentially endogenousN-acyldopamine indicated the requirement of a long unsaturated fatty acid chain for an optimal functional interaction with VR1 receptors.

Previous studies indicated that anandamide and the lipoxygenase product 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid also possess affinity for VR1 (4Hwang S.W. Cho H. Kwak J. Lee S. Kang C. Jung J. Cho S.

However, whereas NADA is similar in potency to capsaicin in a variety of assays of VR1 activity, anandamide and 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid are at least 20-fold less potent than capsaicin (4Hwang S.W. Cho H. Kwak J. Lee S. Kang C. Jung J. Cho S. Min K.H. Suh Y. Kim D. Oh U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6155-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar).

Research on the structure-activity relationship for VR1 has shown that a vanillylamine moiety and a long unsaturated acyl chain are required for optimal interaction with the receptor (6Walpole C.S.J. Wrigglesworth R. Wood J. Structural Requirements for Capsaicin Agonists and Antagonists. Academic Press Ltd., London1993: 63-81Google Scholar, 7De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. Davis J.B. Pertwee R.G. Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although anandamide and lipoxygenase products contain the long unsaturated acyl chain, they lack the vanillyl group, which probably accounts for their decreased affinity for and efficacy on VR1 compared with NADA. Because dopamine is a naturally occurring aromatic amine structurally similar to vanillylamine, it was hypothesized that certain unsaturated N-acyldopamines may exist in mammalian tissues and function as VR1 ligands (see Fig. 1). NADA, the first such compound to be isolated and identified, produces calcium influx in cultured dorsal root ganglion cells and VR1-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells in addition to VR1-mediated thermal hyperalgesia. Proposed mechanisms of NADA biosynthesis include the condensation of arachidonic acid with tyrosine and the subsequent conversion ofN-arachidonoyltyrosine to NADA by tyrosine hydroxylase andl-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase. NADA is found in multiple regions of the mammalian nervous system, with the highest levels in the striatum, cerebellum, and hippocampus and low levels in the dorsal root ganglion (1Huang S.M. Bisogno T. Trevisani M. Al-Hayani A. De Petrocellis L. Fezza F. Tognetto M. Petros T.J. Krey J.F. Chu C.J. Miller J.D. Davies S.N. Geppetti P. Walker J.M. Di Marzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8400-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Finally, NADA has been previously described to activate cannabinoid CB1 receptors, but not dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (2Bisogno T. Melck D. Bobrov M.Y. Gretskaya N.M. Bezuglov V.V.

Hence, NADA is the first endogenous vanilloid identified with a structure and potency similar to those of capsaicin, and it is the fifth endocannabinoid to be discovered, the other four (in order of discovery) being anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, noladin ether, and virodhamine (8Devane W.A.

Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry precursor ion scans of the brain extract in which NADA was identified provided preliminary evidence for the existence of at least three additionalN-acyldopamines: N-oleoyldopamine (OLDA),N-palmitoyldopamine (PALDA), andN-stearoyldopamine (STEARDA) (Fig.1). Therefore, we investigated whether these compounds are endogenous to the mammalian brain, their ability to induce VR1-mediated thermal hyperalgesia and to produce calcium influx in VR1-transfected HEK cells, and their binding affinity for cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Here we report that OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA occur in the mammalian brain and that OLDA is a selective VR1 agonist capable of inducing significant VR1-mediated thermal hyperalgesia with a potency greater than that of NADA while exhibiting affinity for the anandamide transporter, but lacking interaction with fatty-acid amide hydrolase. We also report the efficacy on VR1 of six additional compounds of similar structure. The extraction and purification of OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA were similar to those described by Huang et al. (1Huang S.M. Bisogno T. Trevisani M. Al-Hayani A. De Petrocellis L. Fezza F. Tognetto M. Petros T.J. Krey J.F. Chu C.J. Miller J.D. Davies S.N. Geppetti P. Walker J.M. Di Marzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8400-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) for NADA. Striata were removed from fresh bovine brains and stored at −80 °C until extraction. The tissue was homogenized with a Brinkmann homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY) in 20 volumes of methanol for 1–1.5 min and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 30 min. Acetone and basified water (20 mm ammonium hydroxide, adjusted to pH 9.1 with acetic acid) were added to the supernatant at a ratio of 1:2:1, and the mixture was centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (80–120 ml) was loaded onto 500-mg phenyl boronic acid Bond-Elut cartridges (Varian, Harbor City, CA) preconditioned with 5 ml of 10% acetic acid in methanol, 5 ml of water, and 2 ml of basified water. Each cartridge was washed with 3 ml of methanol/basified water (75:25), 3 ml of water, 1 ml of acetone, 1 ml of methanol, 1 ml of methanol/basified water (50:50), and 1 ml of water and eluted with 3 ml of 10% acetic acid in methanol. Fractions eluted from multiple cartridges were combined, and ammonium hydroxide (0.125 volumes) was added to the eluant for neutralization, followed by evaporation in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Inc., Halbrook, NY). The extract was desalted following reconstitution first in 0.5 ml of water, which was loaded onto a 100-mg C18 Bond-Elut cartridge preconditioned with 0.5 ml of methanol and 0.5 ml of water. The cartridge was washed with 0.5 ml of water, and the remaining extract was reconstituted in 1.6 ml of methanol. 1 ml of water was loaded onto the cartridge reservoir, and the methanol-reconstituted extract was added to the reservoir to form a methanol/water mixture. The cartridge was washed with 1 ml of water and 1 ml of methanol/water (70:30) and eluted with 0.5 ml of methanol. Fractions eluted from multiple samples were combined and evaporated in the SpeedVac, stored at −80 °C, and reconstituted prior to analysis. Structural analysis was accomplished with an MDS Sciex/Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (qqTOF, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in negative ion, product ion scanning, and time-of-flight modes. For analysis of chemical behavior of the extract and the synthesized standard, derivatization was performed by addition of equal volumes of anhydrous pyridine and acetic anhydride (Alltech Associates Inc.) to the extract and standard to formN-oleoyl-3,4-diacetoxyphenylethylamine. Structural analysis of the derivatized compounds was accomplished using liquid chromatography in tandem with an MDS Sciex/Applied Biosystems API3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive ion and multiple reaction monitoring modes. OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA were synthesized from the condensation of the corresponding fatty acyl chlorides with dopamine as previously described (3Bezuglov V. Bobrov M. Gretskaya N. Gonchar A.

The other homologs investigated here were synthesized as follows using the dopamide of ricinoleic acid as an example. To a solution of ricinoleic acid (200 mg, 0.67 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (3 ml) were added triethylamine (383 ml, 270 mg, 2.68 mmol, 4 molar eq), dopamine hydrochloride (127 mg, 0.67 mmol, 1 molar eq), and propylphosphonic acid anhydride (50% EtOAc solution, 511 ml, 0.80 mmol, 1.2 molar eq). After stirring for 2 h at room temperature, the reaction was worked up by evaporation, and the residue was purified by column chromatography (5 g of silica gel) using petroleum ether/EtOAc (6:4) as eluant. 217 mg of the dopamide (75%) was obtained as a colorless oil. The same procedure was employed for retinoic acid (55%), erucic acid (59%), arachidic acid (68%), nonenoic acid (57%), and phenylacetylricinoleic acid (69%). All compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic techniques (1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry, and IR). Overexpression of human VR1 cDNA in HEK293 cells was carried out as described previously (12Hayes P. Meadows H.J. Gunthorpe M.J. Harries M.H. Duckworth D.M. Cairns W. Harrison D.C. Clarke C.E.

Cells were grown in monolayers in minimal essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.2 mm glutamine and maintained under 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The effect of the substances on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was determined using Fluo-3, a selective intracellular fluorescent probe for Ca2+ (7De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. Davis J.B. Pertwee R.G. Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). 1 day prior to experiments, cells were transferred to six-well dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and grown in the culture medium described above. On the day of the experiment, the cells (50,000–60,000/well) were loaded for 2 h at 25 °C with 4 μm Fluo-3 methyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in Me2SO containing 0.04% Pluronic. After loading, cells were washed with Tyrode's solution (pH 7.4), trypsinized, resuspended in Tyrode's solution, and transferred to the cuvette of a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence detector under continuous stirring. Due to the rapidity of the calcium response, experiments were carried out by measuring the cell fluorescence at 25 °C (λex = 488 nm and λem = 540 nm) before and immediately after addition of the test compounds at various concentrations. Data are expressed as the concentration exerting a half-maximal effect (EC50). The efficacy of the effect was determined by comparing it with the analogous effect observed with 4 μm ionomycin. The effect of compounds on the uptake ofN-[14C]arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) by rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) was studied using 3.6 μm [14C]AEA (10,000 cpm) as described previously (13Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with [14C]AEA for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of varying concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 25 μm) of the inhibitors. Residual [14C]AEA in the incubation medium after extraction with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, by volume), determined by scintillation counting of the lyophilized organic phase, was used as a measure of the AEA that was taken up by cells. Previous studies had shown that, after a 5-min incubation, the amount of [14C]AEA that disappears from the medium of RBL-2H3 cells is found mostly (>90%) as unmetabolized [14C]AEA in the cell extract (13Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of [14C]AEA to cells and plastic dishes was determined in the presence of 100 μm AEA and was never >30%. Data are expressed as the concentration exerting 50% inhibition of AEA uptake (IC50) calculated by GraphPAD. Displacement assays for CB1 receptors were carried out using [3H]SR141716A (0.4 nm, 55 Ci/mm; Amersham Biosciences) as the high affinity ligand and the filtration technique described previously (2Bisogno T. Melck D. Bobrov M.Y. Gretskaya N.M. Bezuglov V.V. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. Biochem.

Specific binding was calculated with 1 μmSR141716A and was 84.0%. The effect of compounds on the enzymatic hydrolysis of AEA was studied as described previously (13Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) using membranes prepared from mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells incubated with varying concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 25 μm) of the test compounds and [14C]AEA (9 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9) for 30 min at 37 °C. [14C]Ethanolamine produced from [14C]AEA hydrolysis was measured by scintillation counting of the aqueous phase after extraction of the incubation mixture with 2 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, by volume). Data are expressed as the concentration exerting 50% inhibition of AEA uptake (IC50) calculated by GraphPAD. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–250 g served as subjects. They were housed in metal cages in a temperature-regulated (22–23 °C) room with free access to food and water for at least 24 h prior to testing. Artificial lighting was provided from 0600 to 1800 h. On the day of the experiment, each animal was placed in plastic chambers and allowed to acclimate for a 25–30-min period. Following the determination of base-line withdrawal latencies of the hind paw from a radiant heat source, OLDA, PALDA, or STEARDA (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 μg) or 50 μl of vehicle (1:1:18 ethanol/emulphor/saline) was injected subcutaneously over a 5–10-s interval into the plantar surface of the left paw of each animal (n = 8–13 per dose). Capsaicin (n = 5–15 per dose: 1, 10, 30, and 50 μg in 50 μl of vehicle) was also tested for comparison purposes. Care was taken to deliver each injection to the center of the paw superficially under the skin so as to minimize tissue injury. Withdrawal latencies were observed at 30, 60, and 90 min after injection. The paw was tested once per time point, and a 20-s cutoff was imposed to prevent tissue damage. The mediation of the effects of these compounds by VR1 receptors was assessed by the intraplantar co-administration of 1 μg of iodo-resiniferatoxin (I-RTX). All dose-response data are expressed as means ± S.E. The effect of various doses of OLDA and capsaicin on hyperalgesia across time and the effect of the VR1 antagonist I-RTX on hyperalgesia were analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (BMDP Statistical Software, Los Angeles, CA). ED50 values from the dose-response data were calculated using the mean change from the base line in the drug- and vehicle-treated animals and analyzed by nonlinear regression with PRIZM (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The identification of OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA in the bovine striatal extract was performed with an ultrasensitive quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (qqTOF). Time-of-flight analysis in negative ion mode yielded high precision estimates of the mass of the M–H+ ions for OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA as 416.3161, 390.3012, and 418.3330, respectively, at the high pressure liquid chromatography retention time specific to each compound. The estimated exact masses permitted the elucidation of the chemical formulas of the compounds in the extract that matched those of OLDA-H (C26H42NO3), PALDA-H (C24H40NO3), and STEARDA-H (C28H44NO3) within 2.2 ppm error. Product ion scans in negative ion mode of the material in the bovine striatal methanol extract and synthetic standards yielded mass spectra with matching precursor and fragment ions (Fig.2, left panel; and Table I). The exact masses of the fragment ions permitted the reconstruction of OLDA (Fig. 2, center panel), PALDA, and STEARDA (Table I).Table IMass measurement of M–H+ and the product ions and structural assignments from bovine striatal extract determined using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometerCommon fragmentsProposed formulaeCommentsPutative PALDA 390.3064m/z (5.5 ppm)C24H40NO3M–H+ 254.2494 m/z (1.8 ppm)C16H32NOM–H+ − C8H8O2 135m/zaC7H7O2M–H+− C16H33NO 123.0446 m/z(4.5 ppm)C7H7O2M–H+ − C17H33NOPutative OLDA 416.3160m/z (2.4 ppm)C26H42NO3M–H+ 280m/z1-aDue to low signal level, exact mass measurements were not performed.C18H34NOM–H+− C8H8O2 135.0444m/z (5.5 ppm)C8H7O2M–H+ − C18H35NO 123.0445 m/z (5.3 ppm)C7H7O2M–H+ − C19H35NOalign=“left”>Putative STEARDA 418.3342m/z (3.6 ppm)C26H44NO3M–H+ 282m/z1-aDue to low signal level, exact mass measurements were not performed.C18H36NOM–H+− C8H8O2 135.0464m/z (9.2 ppm)C8H7O2M–H+ − C18H37NOalign=“left”> 123.0445 m/z (5.3 ppm)C7H7O2M–H+ − C19H37NO1-a Due to low signal level, exact mass measurements were not performed. Open table in a new tab The synthetic standards and bovine striatal extract were treated with acetic anhydride and anhydrous pyridine to examine whether they would undergo the same chemical reaction (acetylation). Multiple reaction monitoring in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer revealed coeluting peaks at the expected precursor/fragment masses of [M + H]+m/z 502/196, 476/196, and 504/196, showing that treatment of the synthetic standards and bovine striatal extract led to the formation ofN-oleoyl-3,4-diacetoxyphenylethylamine,N-palmitoyl-3,4-diacetoxyphenylethylamine, andN-stearoyl-3,4-diacetoxyphenylethylamine, respectively (Fig.2, right panel). Coeluting peaks were not observed in the untreated extract or reagent controls (data not shown). Therefore, molecules endogenous to the bovine brain with chromatographic behavior, fragmentation pattern, exact masses, and chemical behavior identical to those of OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA were identified in this study. The effects of several N-acyldopamines and capsaicin on intracellular Ca2+ in HEK cells overexpressing human VR1 were examined (Fig. 3 and Table II). Whereas OLDA was as potent as capsaicin and slightly more potent than NADA in this functional assay of VR1 activity, PALDA and STEARDA were nearly inactive. The effect of OLDA was blocked by co-incubation of cells with 10 nmI-RTX, a potent vanilloid receptor antagonist (14Wahl P. Foged C. Tullin S. Thomsen C. Mol.

Open table in a new tab The effect of subcutaneous injections of OLDA, PALDA, STEARDA, or capsaicin into the rat hind paw on withdrawal latencies from a radiant heat source was tested. A significant dose-dependent thermal hyperalgesia was observed after administration of OLDA (F5,62 = 13.02,p < 0.0001, EC50 = 0.72 ± 0.36 μg) (Fig. 4), but not PALDA (F4,47 = 2.46, not significant), STEARDA (F4,47 = 2.06, not significant), capsaicin (F4,46 = 0.94, not significant), or vehicle (F1,40 = 0.57, not significant). The duration of hyperalgesia lasted over 3 h for OLDA. Co-administration of OLDA (F1,13 = 29.12, p < 0.0001) with 1 μg of I-RTX blocked the thermal hyperalgesia (Fig.5).Figure 5Reversal of OLDA-induced thermal hyperalgesia by I-RTX. I-RTX (1 μg), a highly potent VR1 antagonist, was co-administered with OLDA (10 μg) into the rat hind paw (intraplantar), and withdrawal latency from a radiant heat source was measured. I-RTX completely blocked the thermal hyperalgesia produced by OLDA. Each point represents the mean withdrawal latency (±S.E.,n = 10 for OLDA and n = 5 for OLDA + I-RTX). p < 0.0001 (OLDA versus OLDA + I-RTX; analysis of variance).

However, 10–15 min following OLDA administration, animals periodically licked and lifted their paws, which ceased by the time of behavioral testing (30 min after injection). Co-administration of OLDA with 1 μg of I-RTX prevented the occurrence of any nocifensive behavior. Because NADA was originally found to be a full cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist (2Bisogno T.

None of the three compounds exhibited a strong potency in a binding assay carried out with rat brain membranes and [3H]SR141716A as the high affinity CB1 ligand (TableII). Whereas PALDA and STEARDA were inactive at concentrations ≤5 μm, OLDA exhibited some activity, withKi = 1.6 ± 0.4 μm. Under the same conditions, NADA displayed the highest affinity (Ki = 0.5 ± 0.2 μm), comparable to that previously described for this compound (2Bisogno T. Melck D. Bobrov M.Y. Gretskaya N.M.

https://openalex.org/W2058034672,"Prostaglandin E2(PGE2) mediates its physiological effects by interactions with a subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors known as EP receptors. These receptors consist of four primary subtypes named EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. The EP2 and EP4 subtypes are known to couple to Gαs and stimulate intracellular cyclic 3,5- adenosine monophosphate formation, whereas the EP1 and EP3 receptors are known to couple to Gαq and Gαi, respectively. Recently we found that EP2 and EP4 receptors can activate T-cell factor signaling; however, EP2 receptors did this primarily through a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent pathway, whereas EP4 receptors primarily utilized a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway (Fujino, H., West, K. A., and Regan, J. W. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 2614–2619). We now report that PGE2 stimulation of EP4 receptors, but not EP2 receptors, leads to phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) through a PI3K-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, this activation of PI3K/ERK signaling by the EP4 receptors induces the functional expression of early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1). Under the same conditions induction of EGR-1 protein expression was not observed following PGE2 stimulation of EP2 receptors. These findings point to important differences in the signaling potential of the EP2 and EP4 receptors, which could be significant with respect to the potential involvement of EP4 receptors in inflammation and cancer.

Prior to the molecular cloning of these receptors it was thought that the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by PGE2 was mediated by a single receptor subtype that was defined pharmacologically as the EP2 subtype (1Bastien L. Sawyer N. Grygorczyk R. Metters K.M. Adams M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11873-11877Google Scholar). Thus, the first adenylyl cyclase stimulatory EP receptor to be cloned was thought to be the EP2 subtype, but it was subsequently redefined as the EP4 subtype (2Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Honda A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 339-341Google Scholar) when a second adenylyl cyclase stimulatory EP receptor was cloned, which had the expected pharmacology of the EP2 subtype (3Regan J.W. Bailey T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M. Donello J.E. Fairbairn C.E. Kedzie K.M. Woodward D.F. Gil D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 213-220Google Scholar). Surprisingly the EP2and EP4 receptors encoded by these cDNAs only shared ∼307 amino acid homology and were really no more related to each other than to other prostanoid receptor subtypes (4Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1479-1483Google Scholar). In fact, the EP2 receptor shows a closer phylogenetic relationship to the DP and IP receptors than it does to the EP4 receptor. The human EP4 receptor is larger than the human EP2 (488 amino acids versus 358), which is almost entirely due to a significantly longer carboxyl-terminal domain (155 versus 34 amino acids). Recently we have shown that PGE2 stimulation of the EP2 receptors activates a T-cell factor (Tcf) signaling pathway by a mechanism that mainly involves the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). PGE2stimulation of the EP4 receptors also activates Tcf signaling, but the mechanism is more complex and involves the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). The involvement of PI3K with EP4 receptor signaling has also been suggested in studies of human colorectal carcinoma cells (6Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Google Scholar). Thus, PGE2 stimulation of endogenous EP4 receptors in LS-174 cells increased cellular proliferation and motility through a PI3K-dependent pathway. Given the known role of PI3K in carcinogenesis, it is interesting that a recent study of knockout mice suggested the potential involvement of EP4 receptors in colon cancer (7Mutoh M. Watanabe K. Kitamura T. Shoji Y. Takahashi M. Kawamori T. Tani K. Kobayashi M. Maruyama T. Kobayashi K. Ohuchida S. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 28-32Google Scholar). Early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1) is a member of the zinc finger family of transcription factors and plays a key role in cell growth and differentiation. It is recognized as an immediate early gene product that regulates the expression of a number of downstream genes, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-2, and p53 (8Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Google Scholar). The induction of EGR-1 expression is known to involve members of the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). For example, the induction of EGR-1 expression by growth hormone was shown to depend on the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), but not on the activation of either Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or p38 MAPK (9Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Google Scholar). Similarly the calmodulin antagonist, trifluoroperazine, induced EGR-1 expression through the activation of ERKs and the downstream transcription factor, Elk-1 (10Shin S.Y. Kim S.-Y. Kim J.-H. Min D.S. Ko J. Kang U.-G. Kim Y.S. Kwon T.K. Han M.Y. Kim Y.H. Lee Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7797-7805Google Scholar). Previous studies have also shown regulation of EGR-1 expression by protein kinase C (PKC), possibly involving members of the family of prostanoid receptors. For example, in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts increases in PGE2 were associated with a PKC-dependent increase in EGR-1 mRNA expression (11Danesch U. Weber P.C. Sellmayer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27258-27263Google Scholar). Likewise, in mouse MC3T3 osteoblastic cell lines PGE2 was found to increase EGR-1 mRNA expression. This increase was also PKC-dependent, but did not appear to involve PKA since the induction of EGR-1 mRNA expression was not observed following stimulation with forskolin, an agent which increases the formation of intracellular cAMP (12Fang M.A. Noguchi G.M. McDougall S. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essen. Fatty Acids. 1996; 54: 109-114Google Scholar). These findings would appear to exclude the participation of the adenylyl cyclase stimulatory EP2 and EP4 receptors in the induction of EGR-1 mRNA expression. However, because neither of these studies included pharmacological characterizations, the conclusions that can be drawn are limited with respect to the specific prostanoid receptor subtypes mediating these effects. We now show that the EP4 prostanoid receptor, but not the EP2, can induce the functional expression of EGR-1 through a signaling pathway involving the sequential activation of PI3K and the ERKs. These results further strengthen the involvement of PI3K with EP4receptor signaling and clearly differentiate the signaling potential of the EP2 and EP4 receptors. Cell lines stably expressing the EP2 or EP4 receptors were prepared using HEK-293 EBNA cells and the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) as previously described (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 107 fetal bovine serum, 250 ॖg/ml geneticin, 100 ॖg/ml gentamicin, and 200 ॖg/ml hygromycin B. Sixteen hours prior to the immunoblotting experiments, cells were switched from their regular culture medium to Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 250 ॖg/ml geneticin and 100 ॖg/ml gentamicin. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with this same media containing 1 ॖm PGE2 for the times indicated in the figures. In some cases cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.17 Me2SO) or 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma) for 15 min or 10 ॖm PD98059 (Calbiochem) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were scraped into a lysis buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 17 Nonidet P-40, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmdisodium pyrophosphate, 0.17 SDS, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Aliquots of the supernatants containing 20∼100 ॖg of protein were electrophoresed on 7.5 or 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in 57 nonfat milk for 1 h and were then washed and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies using the following conditions, which varied according to the antibody being used. For the ERKs, incubations were done in 37 nonfat milk containing either a 1:1,000 dilution of antiphospho-ERK1/2 antibody (9106, Cell Signaling); or mixture of a 1:500 dilution of anti-ERK1 antibody and a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-ERK2 antibody (sc-93 and sc-154, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For JNK, incubations were done in 37 nonfat milk containing a 1:1,000 dilution of antiphospho-JNK antibody (9255, Cell Signaling) or 0.17 nonfat milk containing a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-JNK antibody (9252, Cell Signaling). For p38 MAPK, incubations were done in 57 bovine serum albumin containing a 1:1,000 dilution of antiphospho-p38 MAPK antibody (9211, Cell Signaling); or 17 nonfat milk containing a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-p38 MAPK antibody (sc-535-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For EGR-1, incubations were done in 37 nonfat milk containing a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-EGR-1 antibody (sc-110, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubating with the primary antibody, membranes were washed three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:10,000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase using the same conditions as described above for each of the primary antibodies. After washing three times, immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence as described previously (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). To ensure equal loading of proteins, the membranes were stripped and re-probed with appropriate antibodies under the same conditions as described above. Cells, grown in 10-cm plates, were pretreated with either vehicle (0.17 Me2SO) or 10 ॖm PD98059 for 10 min at 37 °C followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 ॖm PGE2for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed, trypsinized, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in approximately three times the original pellet volume using buffer A, containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The sample was transferred into a new tube, placed on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in ∼2 volumes of buffer A with seven rapid strokes of a 1-ml syringe with a 25-gauge needle. The sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to another tube (S100 fraction). The pellet was rinsed with buffer A and resuspended with buffer C, consisting of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 257 glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was dialyzed for 2 h using a 3,000 molecular weight cutoff membrane (Pierce) against buffer D containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 207 glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. A double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probe was designed corresponding to the GC box-1 and GC box-2 sequences in the human prostaglandin E2 synthase gene promoter (13Naraba H. Yokoyama C. Tago N. Murakami M. Kudo I. Fueki M. Oh-ishi S. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28601-28608Google Scholar). The sense strand of this oligonucleotide sequence is 5′-GTGGGGCGGGGCGTGGGCGGTGCT-3′, where the underlined sequence represents the consensus binding site for EGR-1 (8Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Google Scholar). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 kinase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was applied to a spin column to remove free [γ-32P]ATP and run on an 87 native polyacrylamide gel to separate any single-stranded DNA from the double-stranded probe. The binding reaction was performed for 15 min at room temperature using ∼10,000 cpm of the probe and 10 ॖg of nuclear extract in 15 ॖl of a buffer containing 47 Ficoll 400, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.1), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m KCl, and 2 ॖg of poly-(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic) (Sigma). The mobility shift assay was done with a 57 native polyacrylamide gel followed by drying and visualization by autoradiography using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). The supershift assay was performed using 3 ॖg of the anti-EGR-1 antibody in which the antibody was incubated with the probe and the nuclear extract for an additional 15 min following the initial binding reaction. We have previously reported that EP4 prostanoid receptor can activate Tcf signaling by a mechanism involving PI3K (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). Further characterization of this interaction between the EP4 receptor and PI3K was of interest given the important role of PI3K in both normal and aberrant cell signaling pathways. One of the downstream effectors of PI3K signaling is the activation of members of the MAPKs. To determine if EP4 receptors could potentially activate MAPK signaling, we examined the ability of PGE2 to stimulate the phosphorylation of three MAPKs in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the human EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors. For these experiments untransfected HEK cells and cells stably expressing the EP2 and EP4 receptors were incubated with 1 ॖm PGE2 for various times and were then immunoblotted with antibodies to the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2, p54 JNK, and p38 MAPK. As shown in panel A of Fig. 1, treatment with PGE2 resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2 in EP4-expressing cells, but not in EP2-expressing cells or the control HEK cells. The PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of ERKs in EP4 cells was maximal at 5–10 min and by 60 min had nearly returned to the original, unstimulated, levels (0 min). These same blots were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to the nonphosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2, and as shown in panel B of Fig. 1 nearly identical amounts of ERKs 1 and 2 were present throughout the time course of treatment and among the three cell lines. Panels C–F of Fig. 1 show the corresponding results for p54 JNK and p38 MAPK, respectively. In contrast to the results obtained with the ERKs, there were no substantive differences between the EP2- and EP4-expressing cells with respect to the phosphorylation of either p54 JNK (panel C) or p38 MAPK (panel E). In both EP2- and EP4-expressing cells there was significant phosphorylation of p54 JNK even at the 0 time point, which was not observed in the control HEK cells (panel C). This appears to suggest some constitutive effect of EP2 and EP4 receptors on the phosphorylation of p54 JNK. In both EP2- and EP4-expressing cells there was a PGE2-dependent induction of the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which was maximal at ∼15 min and which nearly returned to the original, unstimulated, levels by 60 min (panel E). As with the ERKs, nearly identical amounts of p54 JNK (panel D) and p38 MAPK (panel F) were present throughout the time course of treatment and among the three cell lines. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, was used to examine the potential involvement of PI3K on the phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2 following PGE2 stimulation of the EP4 receptor. For these experiments EP2- and EP4-expressing cells were pretreated with either vehicle or 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 ॖmPGE2 for 10 min. The cells were then subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies to the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the ERKs. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 stimulation with PGE2 in the absence of wortmannin pretreatment resulted in the phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2 in EP4 expressing cells, but not in EP2-expressing cells. However, following pretreatment with wortmannin there was a complete blockade of PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2 in EP4-expressing cells, suggesting the direct involvement of PI3K in this process. The lower panel of Fig. 2 shows that nearly identical amounts of ERKs 1 and 2 were present under all conditions in both cell lines. Given the phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2 following PGE2 stimulation of the human EP4 prostanoid receptor, it was of interest to explore the possible modulation of downstream of effectors that could reflect this selective activation of the ERK signaling pathway. One such effector that is known to be induced following the activation of ERKs is the early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1). Immunoblot analysis was, therefore, used to examine the time course of expression of EGR-1 following treatment of EP2- and EP4-expressing cells with 1 ॖm PGE2. As shown in the upper panels of Fig. 3, there was a modest induction of EGR-1 expression in EP4-expressing cells following 30 min of incubation with PGE2, which was markedly increased at the 60-min time point. On the other hand, in EP2-expressing cells the expression of EGR-1 was barely detectable even at the 60-min time point. To check for the equal loading of protein these blots were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to ERKs 1 and 2. As shown in the lower panels of Fig. 3 nearly identical amounts of ERKs 1 and 2 were present in both cell lines and throughout the time course of treatment with PGE2. Pretreatment of EP2- and EP4-expressing cells with either the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, or the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, PD98059, was used to examine the potential involvement of these kinases on the PGE2 induced expression of EGR-1. As shown in theupper panel of Fig.4A, the robust induction of EGR-1 expression in EP4-expressing cells following 60 min of exposure to 1 ॖm PGE2 was completely blocked by pretreatment with wortmannin. EGR-1 expression in EP2-expressing cells was not detectable either before or after treatment with PGE2, or following pretreatment with wortmannin. The lower panel of Fig. 4A shows that nearly equal amounts of ERKs 1 and 2 were present under all conditions and indicates that the observed differences in EGR-1 expression are not because of differences in overall protein expression or in the amount of protein loaded on the gels. The MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, PD98059, was then used to explore whether this specific induction of EGR-1 expression in EP4-expressing cells involved the sequential activation of PI3K and the ERKs. For these experiments EP2- and EP4-expressing cell lines were pretreated with either vehicle or 10 ॖm PD98059 for 10 min followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 ॖm PGE2 for 60 min. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4B, in the absence of pretreatment with PD98059 there was a strong PGE2-mediated induction of EGR-1 expression in EP4-expressing cells that was completely absent in EP2-expressing cells. Following pretreatment with PD98059, however, there was a complete block of PGE2-mediated EGR-1 expression in EP4-expressing cells. To confirm equal loading of protein, this blot was stripped and re-probed with antibodies to ERKs 1 and 2. The lower panel of Fig.4B shows that nearly identical amounts of ERKs 1 and 2 were present under all conditions in both cell lines. Together these results strongly suggest that the sequential activation of PI3K and the ERKs is required for the induction of EGR-1 expression by PGE2 in EP4-expressing cells. The potential for PGE2 to stimulate EGR-1 mediated transcriptional activation was examined in EP2- and EP4-expressing cells using electrophoresis mobility shift assays. The probe used for these experiments consisted of an oligonucleotide designed from the promoter region of the human gene for prostaglandin E2 synthase containing a consensus binding site for EGR-1 (13Naraba H. Yokoyama C. Tago N. Murakami M. Kudo I. Fueki M. Oh-ishi S. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28601-28608Google Scholar). EP2- and EP4-expressing cells were pretreated with either vehicle or 10 ॖm PD98059 for 10 min followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 ॖm PGE2 for 60 min. In Fig. 5 a comparison of the 舠free舡 lane with the other lanes shows that the probe migrated with relative mobilities of 0.26 and 0.40 under all conditions in which a nuclear extract was present. Following treatment with PGE2, however, there was a selective shift in the mobility of the probe in EP4-expressing cells, but not in EP2-expressing cells, yielding a unique band with a relative mobility of 0.16. The identity of the protein causing this shift was investigated in a supershift assay by an additional incubation with antibodies to EGR-1. As shown in the last two lanes of Fig. 5, incubation with the antibodies to EGR-1 diminished the intensity of the 0.16-band following treatment with PGE2 and resulted in the appearance of a new band with a mobility of 0.08. This supershift confirms the interaction of the probe with the EGR-1 following the treatment of EP4expressing cells with PGE2. Fig. 5 also shows that pretreatment of EP4-expressing cells with the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, PD98059, prevented the PGE2 induced mobility shift and appearance of 0.16 band. Thus, as predicted from our previous experiments with PD98059, the PGE2-induced functional expression of EGR-1 involves the activation of a MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. We have previously shown that stimulation of EP2prostanoid receptors by PGE2 can activate a Tcf signaling pathway by a mechanism that mainly involves the activation of PKA (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). PGE2 stimulation of EP4 prostanoid receptors can also activate a Tcf signaling pathway, but the mechanism is more complex and involves the activation of PI3K (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). We now show that PGE2 stimulation of the EP4 receptor activates an additional signaling pathway involving PI3K. Thus, PGE2treatment of cells expressing EP4 receptor, leads to a PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2 followed by a de novo increase in the functional expression of EGR-1. The activation of this PI3K signaling cascade was unique for the EP4 receptor and was not observed in cells expressing EP2 receptors. One of the ways in which the EP2 and EP4receptors are known to differ is in the characteristics of their agonist induced desensitization and internalization. Thus, EP4 receptors undergo rapid, PGE2-mediated desensitization (14Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1031-1037Google Scholar) and internalization (15Desai S. April H. Nwaneshiudu C. Ashby B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1279-1286Google Scholar); whereas EP2receptors do not. Since the internalization of some G-protein-coupled receptors is associated with a transactivation of the MAPK pathway (16Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Google Scholar,17Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S. Rapacciuolo A. Caron M.G. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18953-18959Google Scholar), it may be supposed that such a mechanism could explain the present findings of selective activation of ERK signaling by the EP4 receptors. However, in a previous study using human EP4 receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells, it was found that the phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2 was independent of PGE2-mediated receptor internalization (18Desai S. Ashby B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 156-160Google Scholar). Another way in which the EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors appear to differ is in their ability to stimulate intracellular cAMP formation. Thus, despite nearly identical levels of receptor expression, the maximal levels of PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation in EP4-expressing cells was only 207 of the level obtained in EP2-expressing cells (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). However, under the same conditions the ability of PGE2 to stimulate Tcf signaling was ∼507 greater in EP4-expressing cells as compared with EP2-expressing cells (5Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Google Scholar). This indicates that the lower amounts of PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation in EP4-expressing cells is because of less efficient coupling to this pathway and not because of an overall impairment in the signaling potential of these receptors. The more efficient coupling of the EP2 receptor to intracellular cAMP formation; however, may be significant with respect to the present findings. Thus, it has been reported that the phosphorylation of Raf kinase by PKA inhibits the activity of Raf kinase and subsequently decreases Raf mediated MAPK signaling (19Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Google Scholar, 20Sidovar M.F. Kozlowski P. Lee J.W. Collins M.A. He Y. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28688-28694Google Scholar). In EP2-expressing cells, therefore, a robust activation of PKA may inhibit Raf kinase and block the phosphorylation and activation of ERKs. Our findings of a PGE2-mediated induction of EGR-1 expression by the EP4 receptor is interesting light of recent studies with knockout mice that show a potential involvement of the EP4 receptor with colon cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. For example EP4 knockout mice, but not EP2 knockout or control mice, show a reduced formation of preneoplastic lesions following treatment with azoxymethane, a known colon carcinogen (7Mutoh M. Watanabe K. Kitamura T. Shoji Y. Takahashi M. Kawamori T. Tani K. Kobayashi M. Maruyama T. Kobayashi K. Ohuchida S. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 28-32Google Scholar). EP4 knockout mice, but not EP2 knockout or control mice, also show a significantly decreased incidence and severity of collagen antibody induced arthritis, an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (21McCoy J.M. Wicks J.R. Audoly L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 651-658Google Scholar). In addition, in both colon cancer and rheumatoid arthritis prostaglandin levels are elevated and both conditions benefit to some extent by treatment with inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases. In colon cancer, the expression of cyclin D1, a key regulator of cell cycle progression, is known to be regulated by Tcf signaling (22Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that the expression of cyclin D1 is regulated by EGR-1 through a PI3K- and ERK-dependent pathway (23Guillemot L. Levy A. Raymondjean M. Rothhut B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39394-39403Google Scholar). Furthermore it has been shown that PGE2 synthase is up-regulated by the binding of EGR-1 to the promoter region of the mouse gene encoding PGE2 synthase (13Naraba H. Yokoyama C. Tago N. Murakami M. Kudo I. Fueki M. Oh-ishi S. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28601-28608Google Scholar). Signaling through an EP4receptor would have the potential, therefore, to increase the expression of cyclin D1 and PGE2 synthase through a PGE2-mediated induction of EGR-1 expression. Since the product of PGE2 synthase is PGE2 itself, the potential for a positive feedback loop is obvious. A similar situation could also explain the increased levels of PGE2 observed in rheumatoid arthritis. However, in this disease in addition to an up-regulation of the expression of PGE2 synthase, signaling through EP4 receptors could also potentially up regulate levels of TNF-α (21McCoy J.M. Wicks J.R. Audoly L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 651-658Google Scholar) whose expression is under the control of EGR-1 (24Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Google Scholar). Inhibitors of TNF-α, such as etancercept and infliximab, are used therapeutically in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis because they slow the progression of this disease (25Aeberli D. Oertle S. Mauron H. Reichenbach S. Fordi B. Villiger P.M. Swiss Med. Wkly. 2002; 132: 414-422Google Scholar). It is possible that the reduced incidence and severity of collagen antibody induced arthritis in EP4knockout mice (21McCoy J.M. Wicks J.R. Audoly L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 651-658Google Scholar) is related to the loss of EP4receptor-mediated signaling through a PI3K/ERKs/EGR-1 pathway. Recently we have shown that the FPB prostanoid receptor can signal through a ॆ-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway (26Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Google Scholar) and interact with PI3K (27Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48786-48795Google Scholar); and thus, has potential to be involved in the pathophysiology of colon cancer. It has also been reported that EP1 receptors (28Watanabe K. Kawamori T. Nakatsugi S. Ohta T. Ohuchida S. Yamamoto H. Maruyama T. Kondo K. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5093-5096Google Scholar) and EP2 receptors (29Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Google Scholar) may have roles in colon cancer. In addition, gene knockout studies with the cyclooxygenases indicate that the synthesis of prostaglandins by these enzymes contributes to the pathophysiology of colon cancer (30Chulada P.C. Thompson M.B. Mahler J.F. Doyle C.M. Gaul B.W. Lee C. Tiano H.F. Morham S.G. Smithies O. Langenbach R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4705-4708Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in intestinal polyps appears to be under a positive feedback through the EP2receptor (29Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is clear from the findings of Sonoshitaet al. (29Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Google Scholar) that the effects of the cyclooxygenase-2 knockout on the number and size of intestinal polyps was greater than the effects of the EP2 knockout and appear to require the involvement of another prostanoid receptor. Potential involvement of the EP4 receptor could work in concert with the EP2 receptor to increase PGE2 levels by increased expression of both cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE2synthase. Our present findings with the EP4 receptors further strengthen an association of the prostaglandins and their receptors with cancer and inflammation; further knowledge of which could have practical therapeutic benefits."

Despite their importance, little is known about the structure of Group 3 LEA proteins, although computer modeling and secondary structure algorithms predict a largely α-helical monomer that forms coiled coil oligomers. We have therefore investigated the structure of the nematode protein, AavLEA1, in the first such analysis of a well characterized Group 3 LEA-like protein. Immunoblotting and subunit cross-linking experiments demonstrate limited oligomerization of AavLEA1, but analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration show that the vast majority of the protein is monomeric. Moreover, CD, fluorescence emission, and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy indicate an unstructured conformation for the nematode protein. Therefore, in solution, no evidence was found to support structure predictions; instead, AavLEA1 seems to be natively unfolded with a high degree of hydration and low compactness. Such proteins can, however, be induced to fold into more rigid structures by partner molecules or by altered physiological conditions. Because AavLEA1 is associated with desiccation stress, its Fourier transform-infrared spectrum in the dehydrated state was examined. A dramatic but reversible increase in α-helix and, possibly, coiled coil formation was observed on drying, indicating that computer predictions of secondary structure may be correct for the solid state. This unusual finding offers the possibility that structural shifts in Group 3 LEA proteins occur on dehydration, perhaps consistent with their role in anhydrobiosis.

This remarkable ability, called anhydrobiosis, is found across all biological kingdoms, including bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. Examples among higher eukaryotes include some nematode worms, such as Aphelenchus avenae, a soil-dwelling fungivore amenable to laboratory culture, “resurrection” plants like Craterostigma plantagineum, and orthodox plant seeds and pollen (1Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 2Oliver M.J. Tuba Z. Mishler B.D.

The molecular mechanisms governing anhydrobiosis are not fully characterized, but several hypotheses emphasize a major role for non-reducing disaccharides. Trehalose, in animals, or sucrose, in plants, accumulates to high concentrations in many anhydrobiotic species prior to dehydration (2Oliver M.J. Tuba Z. Mishler B.D. Plant Ecol. 2000; 15: 85-100Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 4Perry R.N. Parasitology. 1999; 119: S19-S30Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In vitro these sugars have been shown to preserve enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, some viruses, liposomes, and other membrane systems during and after drying (5Crowe J.H. Crowe L.M. Carpenter J.F. Wistrom C.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 6Colaco C. Sen S. Thangavelu M. Pinder S. Roser B. Bio-Technol. 1992; 10: 1007-1011Google Scholar). Largely on the basis of the in vitro data, these sugars are proposed to act as water replacement molecules and as thermodynamic and kinetic stabilizers of biomolecules and membranes (7Crowe J.H. Carpenter J.F. Crowe L.M. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 73-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar,8Bolen D.W. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, there is remarkably little evidence from living systems in support of these hypotheses (9Tunnacliffe A. Lapinski J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. (B Biol. Sci.). 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is increasingly apparent that, if disaccharides do play an important role in vivo, they are insufficient to confer anhydrobiosis by themselves; other adaptations are required (9Tunnacliffe A. Lapinski J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. (B Biol. Sci.). 2003; (in press)Google Scholar, 10Higa L.M. Womersley C.Z. J. Exp.

Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 431-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In desiccation-tolerant plants, a number of genes have been identified that are induced by water stress (13Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 14Bartels D. Salamini F. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), but there is little information on equivalent genes in anhydrobiotic animals. We have therefore begun to characterize the genes involved in the desiccation stress response in A. avenae and recently described a dehydration-responsive gene,Aavlea1, whose cognate amino acid sequence is related to plant Group 3 late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)1 proteins (15Browne J. Tunnacliffe A. Burnell A. Nature. 2002; 416: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). LEA proteins were first identified 20 years ago in cotton and wheat (16Dure III, L. Greenway S.C. Galau G.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 17Grzelczak Z.F. Sattolo M.H. Hanley-Bowdoin L.K. Kennedy T.D. Lane B.G. Can. J.

Steele C. Dure III, L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and are produced in abundance during seed development, comprising up to 4% of cellular protein (20Roberts J.K. DeSimone N.A. Lingle W.L. Dure III, L. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since then, up to five different groups of LEA proteins have been defined on the basis of expression pattern and sequence (21Bray E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 22Cuming A. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1999: 753-780Crossref Google Scholar). Precise functions of the LEA proteins have yet to be elucidated, but expression is linked to water stress and the acquisition of desiccation tolerance in orthodox seeds, pollen, and anhydrobiotic plants (13Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 14Bartels D. Salamini F. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Cuming A. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1999: 753-780Crossref Google Scholar). They have been variously proposed to protect cellular structures from the effects of water loss by action as a hydration buffer, by sequestration of ions, by direct protection of other proteins or membranes, or by renaturation of unfolded proteins, although supporting evidence is limited (21Bray E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 22Cuming A. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1999: 753-780Crossref Google Scholar). The Group 3 LEA proteins, comprising subgroups D-7 and D-29, are characterized by a repeating 11-mer amino acid motif whose consensus has been defined for plant proteins as TAE/QAAKE/QKAXE for the D-7 family, or more broadly as ΦΦE/QXΦKE/QKΦXE/D/Q (where Φ represents a hydrophobic residue) for the D-29 family (23Dure III, L. Plant J. 1993; 3: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 24Dure III, L. Protein Peptide Lett. 2001; 8: 115-122Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent genome sequencing projects have brought to light sequences related to Group 3 LEA proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and also in the prokaryotes Haemophilus influenzae and Deinococcus radiodurans (24Dure III, L. Protein Peptide Lett. 2001; 8: 115-122Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that this type of LEA protein at least is not restricted to plant species. The D. radiodurans genome also contains sequences related to other LEA proteins (25Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The function of non-plant LEA proteins may also relate to water stress; mutation of two D. radioduransgenes encoding LEA-like sequences resulted in reduced desiccation tolerance (26Battista J.R. Park M.-J. McLemore A.E. Cryobiology. 2001; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and an LEA-like protein was induced by dehydration in the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema feltiae (27Solomon A. Salomon R. Paperna I. Glazer I. Parasitology. 2000; 121: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as was the Aavlea1 gene in A. avenae (15Browne J. Tunnacliffe A. Burnell A. Nature. 2002; 416: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). TheA. avenae protein sequence, named AavLEA1, is very similar to the plant Group 3 LEA proteins, as shown by data base comparisons, and includes several 11-mer motifs (15Browne J. Tunnacliffe A. Burnell A. Nature. 2002; 416: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These motifs differ slightly from the plant consensus, e.g. the first amino acid is often a positively charged lysine instead of a hydrophobic residue, but they are clearly related. It is therefore expected that AavLEA1 will adopt a conformation similar to that of plant Group 3 LEA proteins. Structural studies on a number of LEA proteins have been performed to attempt to gain insight into function, but surprisingly little information is available for Group 3 members. No crystal structures have been reported, but secondary structure predictions can be derived from a number of algorithms available as online computer programs. Fig.1 shows secondary structure predictions from seven such programs together with a “winner takes all” summary for the A. avenae Group 3 LEA protein, suggesting that it is largely α-helical throughout its length. Dure (23Dure III, L. Plant J. 1993; 3: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) used computer modeling to predict that Group 3 LEA proteins adopt amphiphilic α-helices that dimerize in an unusual right-handed coiled coil arrangement, with a periodicity defined by the 11-mer motif. Right-handed coiled coils based on an 11-mer repeat were later found in a surface layer protein from Staphylothermus marinus (28Stetefeld J. Jenny M. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Engel J. Kammerer R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this conformation is found in nature. Larger complexes might also arise (29NDong C. Danyluk J. Wilson K.E. Pocock T. Huner N.P.A. Sarhan F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1368-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), because a Group 3 LEA-like wheat protein is predicted by the MultiCoil program (30Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) to form trimeric coiled coils. Indeed, MultiCoil also predicts a 40% probability of coiled coils in AavLEA1, although these would be, more conventionally, left-handed. Because the structure of AavLEA1 might offer clues to its function, we decided to test the various hypotheses resulting from computer predictions to assess (a) whether oligomers are formed, (b) whether an α-helical polypeptide structure can be detected, and (c) whether drying has any significant effect on structure in a recombinant form of the protein. The A. avenae LEA cDNA sequence reported in our earlier study (15Browne J. Tunnacliffe A. Burnell A. Nature. 2002; 416: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) was reamplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers containing engineered NdeI (5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCCTCTCAGCAG) and BamHI (5′-CGGGATCCTTAGTCGCGGCCCTT) sites (underlined) and cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The pET15b vector (Novagen) was used to express the protein with an N-terminal His6 tag after cloning the engineered cDNA sequence at the NdeI and BamHI sites; the construct was verified by DNA sequence determination. The pET15b vector encodes the protein sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH at the N terminus, additional to the native AavLEA1 sequence shown in Fig. 1. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and a single bacterial colony was inoculated in 100 ml of Luria Bertani broth (LB) containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. 10 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB plus antibiotic, and at an absorbance (A600) of 0.6, gene expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.5). The cell suspension was sonicated, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was applied to a 5-ml nickel chelation column pre-equilibrated with 50 mmphosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole. The bound protein was eluted batchwise using increasing concentrations of imidazole, as described in the QIAexpressionistTM (Qiagen, Germany). Protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in 5 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.5) and applied to a HiLoad Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.5). The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 mNaCl using an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions with AavLEA1 protein eluted as a single peak, and the purity of protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 8250m−1 cm−1, calculated using the ProtParam program on the ExPASy server (ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Mass cultures ofA. avenae were grown at 20–25 °C in the dark in Duran bottles containing wheat grains that had been autoclaved and then sub-cultured with the fungus Rhizoctonia solani (31Evans A.A.F. J. Nematol. 1970; 2: 99-100PubMed Google Scholar). To allow aeration, holes (∼3 cm) had been made in bottle caps and covered with sterile filter paper. After sufficient growth (10–20 days), nematodes were isolated, washed with water, and filtered through 0.2-μm membranes (PALL Life Sciences). Filtered nematode samples were resuspended in protein lysate buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science cat. no. 1836153), and sonicated. Insoluble cellular material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min (18,000 × g at 4 °C), leaving a cleared lysate. For SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), 11% SDS slab gels were run in Bio-Rad mini-Protean 3 electrophoresis cells; gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Apparent molecular weight was determined relative to molecular weight standards (Sigma). For blotting, proteins were first separated by SDS-PAGE on 11% slab gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot transfer medium; Bio-Rad) using a Trans-Blot S.D. electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was performed using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against purified AavLEA1 by Harlan Seralab. A donkey anti-rabbit IgG peroxide-linked conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection, and bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and Biomax ML (Kodak) autoradiography film. Molecular weight markers used were MagicMark Western standards (Invitrogen), which comprise recombinant proteins containing an IgG binding site from protein G and are therefore revealed by the donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. Reactions based on Davies and Stark (33Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and Coggins et al. (34Coggins J.R. Lumsden J. Malcolm A.D.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were carried out at room temperature in 0.2 m triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.5) for 3 h with a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml AavLEA1 and dimethyl suberimidate concentration between 0.5 and 3 mg/ml in a volume of 100 μl. At higher suberimidate concentrations, pH was adjusted with NaOH prior to addition of protein. Proteins were then denatured in SDS sample buffer for 2 h at 37 °C and appropriate amounts run on 11% SDS-slab gels, which were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. A Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge was used with the temperature of the 4-hole rotor maintained at 20 °C and an operating speed of 18,000 rpm (equilibrium runs) or 50,000 rpm (velocity runs). Optical scanning of the cells was performed at a wavelength of 280 nm and the output logged to disk for subsequent analysis. For the equilibrium runs the attainment of the equilibrium state was verified by confirming that successive scans at 1 h intervals were identical other than for random noise. Standard software was used (35Cole J.L. Hansen J.C. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar): SVEDBERG for velocity analysis, NONLIN for equilibrium analysis, and SEDNTERP and BIOMOLS for estimation of partial specific volume, frictional ratios, and other routine calculations. ProFit (Quantum Soft) was used for curve fitting and graph plotting. A Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl was used with an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) and calibrated with proteins from the LMW and HMW gel filtration calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences). Protein samples (50–500 μg) in appropriate buffers were run on the column, pre-equilibrated in the same buffer, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The apparent size and Stokes' radius (Rs gel) of the protein was determined relative to the standards using described methods (36Siegal L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length for wavelengths between 190 and 250 nm. Temperature was controlled using a Peltier system, and data were acquired at different temperatures with 0.1 and 2 mg/ml of AavLEA1 in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The buffer spectrum at each temperature set point was subtracted from the sample spectrum. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer, fitted with a temperature controlling device. Data were obtained at different temperatures using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, slit widths of 2.5 nm, and a scan rate of 60 nm/min. The concentrations of AavLEA1 used were 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml. Fluorescence intensity and maximum emission wavelength (λmax) were determined from emission spectra acquired in the 310–400 nm range. Infrared spectra were recorded in a Bruker Equinox 55 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a deuterated lanthanum triglycine sulfate (DLATGS) detector and a KBr beam-splitter and purged with a continuous flow of N2 gas. Lyophilized protein samples were reconstituted in2H2O at a concentration of 15 mg/ml and incubated at room temperature for about 10 min before measurements. Protein solutions were then passed through 0.22-μm pore syringe filters to remove any undissolved or aggregated material, and the supernatants were transferred to a clean tube. Samples were then placed between a pair of CaF2 windows separated by a 50-μm Mylar spacer. Dehydrated samples were obtained by placing 50 μl of a 15 mg/ml solution of protein (prepared and filtered as described above) on a CaF2 window and drying under vacuum for about 30 min. In all cases transmission spectra were collected at room temperature. For each sample 64 interferograms were collected at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1, using a scanner velocity of 10 kHz. Water vapor subtraction and baseline correction as well as additional spectra processing as indicated below were performed using GRAMS/AI (Thermo Galactic) software. Second derivatives of the Amide I band spectra were produced to determine the localization of the different spectral components. A peak fitting for each individual spectrum was performed using the spectral frequencies obtained by second derivative analysis and trough successive iterations using a variable mixture of Gaussian and Lorentzian bandshapes. A recombinant form of AavLEA1 with a predicted molecular mass of 18,175 Da was produced in E. coli after cloning in the pET15b expression vector. The protein was purified by nickel chelation and ion exchange chromatography and had approximately the expected mass on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2A). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed the mass as 18,060.1 ± 0.9 Da (data not shown), which indicated that the N-terminal methionine had been cleaved during synthesis but which otherwise agreed with predictions. To facilitate analysis of AavLEA1, a polyclonal antiserum against the purified protein was produced that recognizes it in Western blotting experiments. Intriguingly, although in some experiments AavLEA1 is visualized by the antiserum as a single band (Fig. 2B), oligomeric forms are also frequently observed; monomer (N) and dimer (2N) are clearly seen in Fig. 2C. Higher order oligomers, at least of trimer (3N), are also faintly visible. A similar degree of oligomerization also occursin vivo because dimers can be visualized in Western blots of nematode protein extracts; both monomer and dimer of the native form run slightly ahead of the equivalent recombinant species due to the lack of an N-terminal His tag (Fig. 2D). Small quantities of dimeric AavLEA1 can also be seen on SDS-PAGE gels simply stained with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). This indicates a tight association between subunits because protein samples were boiled in SDS, strongly denaturing conditions, prior to electrophoresis. To demonstrate the presence of oligomers in solution, cross-linking of purified AavLEA1 using dimethyl suberimidate was performed. Conditions were used that allow cross-links to form between the subunits of protein complexes but not between different complexes. In Fig. 2E, three bands are observed after incubation in dimethyl suberimidate, corresponding to monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of the protein. The intensity of the bands representing oligomeric forms is lower than that of the monomer, but because cross-linking does not proceed to completion, this does not indicate the relative proportions of the oligomers observed. Larger forms were not seen, suggesting that tetramers and higher order oligomers were not present at significant levels in the protein sample used. These experiments confirm the existence of homo-oligomers of AavLEA1 in solution and are consistent with a dimeric or trimeric coiled coil model, similar to those proposed by Dure (23Dure III, L. Plant J. 1993; 3: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and NDong et al. (29NDong C. Danyluk J. Wilson K.E. Pocock T. Huner N.P.A. Sarhan F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1368-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These models imply that most of the protein should adopt a oligomeric, coiled coil conformation, but the proportion of oligomeric forms is difficult to determine using denaturing gel electrophoresis because protein complexes are likely to be underestimated. Conversely, Western blotting can overemphasize weak bands in relatively long film exposures. Preliminary electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicated that AavLEA1 was present mostly as the monomer; the presence of dimer and possibly higher order oligomers was detected but in small quantities, suggesting incomplete oligomerization (data not shown). However, although these experiments were performed under conditions designed to minimize subunit separation, it could not be ruled out that oligomeric complexes of AavLEA1 were largely disrupted by the procedure. If AavLEA1 is mainly oligomeric, though, this should be demonstrable unequivocally by analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed for a range of protein concentrations, and an apparently single boundary was observed in all cases, consistent with one predominant species being present. The plot of the inverse of sedimentation coefficient,s, against corrected concentration, c, was fitted using a linear regression routine (Fig.3), and a value ofs020,w = 1.20 S was obtained after extrapolation to infinite dilution. The relatively low value for the sedimentation coefficient of AavLEA1 is indicative of unusually high drag forces for a molecule of this molecular mass. The frictional ratio (f/f0), derived froms020,w, is given as 2.28, indicating either a highly extended structure (typical globular proteins have a frictional ratio close to 1.1 (36Siegal L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar)) or an unstructured, swollen protein with a high degree of hydration, or some combination of both. The negative regression of s with protein concentration (Fig. 3) is most consistent with a species that is either all monomer or mostly monomer in rapid equilibrium with a proportion of dimer. Using the concentration dependence of the s value, deductions on the degree of dimerization can be made from sedimentation velocity data (37Rowe A.J. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 2595-2611Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 38Rowe A.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 394-406Google Scholar). This analysis suggests, for the two structural forms postulated, that if AavLEA1 is an extended rod then very little dimer is needed to account for the data of Fig. 3, whereas for an unstructured model a significant fraction of dimer (7% dimer at a protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml) is present. Because gel electrophoresis experiments demonstrate that monomeric and oligomeric forms co-exist, the latter model is more likely. Other possibilities, including the smallest species being a dimer, can effectively be excluded. An unequivocal value for the molecular mass of the nematode LEA protein in solution, and hence the degree of oligomerization, can be obtained from sedimentation equilibrium experiments. These were performed at a range of protein concentrations and the data fit to single-species or two-species models using the NONLIN program. Again, the best fit was observed for a single, i.e. monomeric species but with a small quantity of dimer present (data not shown). Higher order oligomers were not excluded by this analysis, but they must be present at a level of ≤2% total protein. The Stokes' radius (Rs sed) of AavLEA1 was calculated from sedimentation analysis to be 3.91 nm. This is larger than expected if AavLEA1 were globular in structure but is consistent with it being an extend"

Rhodopsin (Rh) 1The abbreviations used are: RhrhodopsinDMn-dodecyl-β-maltosideGPCRG protein-coupled receptorWTwild typePBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyICMInterdisciplinary Center of Modeling is the visual pigment protein of the rod cell and belongs to a large family of transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, which are involved in numerous physiological functions (1Okada T.

Drug Discovery Dev. 2001; 4: 561-574PubMed Google Scholar). This superfamily of membrane glycoprotein receptors is characterized by seven transmembrane α-helices that are anchored within the lipid bilayer. In contrast to other G protein-coupled receptors, which respond to diffusible ligands, Rh (∼40,000 daltons) has a covalently bound reverse agonist, 11-cis-retinal, which yields a distinct UV-visible spectrum with a λmax of ∼500 nm (3Filipek S. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 851-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Rh has been previously elucidated (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Retinitis pigmentosa leads to photoreceptor death and subsequent severe loss of peripheral and night vision (5Rattner A. Sun H. Nathans J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Dryja T.P. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 2000; 130: 547-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These mutants account for nearly 50% of all the autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa cases with the most frequent mutation being P23H, which accounts for ∼10% of all cases (7Chapple J.P.

Although they display distinct biochemical features, the mutant phenotypes fall mainly into three basic classes (8Sung C.H. Davenport C.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26645-26649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Sung C.H.

Class I mutants are expressed at nearly WT levels and form stable pigment with 11-cis-retinal in the dark. These mutations cluster at the C terminus of Rh and disrupt vectorial transport to the rod outer segment. Some mutations also inefficiently activate transducin (5Rattner A. Sun H. Nathans J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Papermaster D.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1300-1309PubMed Google Scholar). Class II mutants do not bind 11-cis-retinal and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Class III mutants, like P23H, form small amounts of pigment and mainly remain in the endoplasmic reticulum or form aggresomes (12Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The results obtained from the heterologous expression of the opsin mutants in mammalian cells correlate well with the findings using transgenic Rh animals (14Frederick J. Bronson J.D. Baehr W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 515-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other phenotypic properties acquired as a result of a mutation may include the destabilization of the structure formed within the rod outer segment by mutated Rh molecules (15Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) or the disruption of other biological processes unique to the rod outer segment. Patients with the P23H mutation (Fig.1A) usually have milder disease progression than those harboring other Rh mutations. Based on the crystal structure of Rh, Pro23 is located in the N-terminal tail within one of the β-strands that make up an integral part of the N-terminal plug (16Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The plug keeps the chromophore in its proper position (3Filipek S. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 851-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and mutations within this region result in improper folding of opsin and poor binding of the chromophore (5Rattner A. Sun H. Nathans J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that P23H-opsin (opsin with proline at position 23 mutated to histidine) forms the pigment poorly, does not acquire the Golgi-related glycosylation, and is retained within the cell, collectively providing evidence that it is misfolded (9Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that P23H-opsin can be induced to properly fold by providing cells with a seven-membered ring variant of 11-cis-retinal during opsin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the remarkable affinity and selectivity of mutant opsin for 11-cis-7-ring retinal can be explained based on the crystal structure of Rh. These findings open the possibility for pharmacological intervention of this otherwise incurable retinal degenerative disease. Synthesis of 11-cis-7-ring retinals was performed as described previously with some modifications (17Fujimoto Y. Xie R. Tully S.E. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Chirality. 2002; 14: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Akito H. Tanis S.P. Adams M. Balogh-Nair V. Nakajima K. J. Am. Chem.

All of the reactions were performed in a dried nitrogen atmosphere unless otherwise specified. 2-Cycloheptenone was first converted into allyl acetate byN-bromosuccinimide bromination in CCl4followed by treatment with KOAc in hexamethylphosphoramide. Purified 4-acetoxy-2-cycloheptenone (46% from 2-cycloheptenone) was subjected to a Horner-Emmons reaction with diethyl (2-cyanoethyl)phosphonate, which gave an isomeric mixture of two trans/cis(E/Z) cyanoacetates in a 2:1 ratio. The mixture was hydrolyzed with K2CO3 in MeOH:H2O (5:1), and then the hydroxy group of the resulting allylic alcohol was protected with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in pyridine (80% from cycloheptenonyl acetate). The resulting cyano compound was reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride in CH2Cl2 to an aldehyde and purified by flash chromatography on a silica gel (63%). β-Cyclocitral was reduced with NaBH4 to β-cyclogeraniol and then reacted with triphenylphosphine hydrobromide in MeOH over 3 days to afford β-cyclogeranyltriphenylphosphonium bromide after the removal of solvent and drying of the residue in vacuum. Wittig reaction of the silylated aldehyde with an excess of phosphonium salt in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide and a catalytic amount of 18-crown-6 in methylene chloride at ambient temperature afforded protected cyclic alcohol in 75% yield. Thetert-butyldimethylsilyl protecting group was removed by treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in dry THF, and the resulting alcohol was oxidized with MnO2 in CH2Cl2 to a mixture of two (E/Z) cyclic ketones (2:1 ratio) in 96% yield. This mixture was condensed with triethyl phosphonoacetate under Horner-Emmons conditions, followed by lithium aluminum hydride reduction of the resulting isomeric mixture of ethyl 7-ring retinoates and oxidation of retinols with MnO2(86%) in CH2Cl2.

Briefly, wild type opsin and the P23H mutant were excised as EcoRI-NotI fragments from pMT4 and then cloned into the EcoRI-NotI site within the polylinker of pcDNA4. Using opsin-specific forward and reverse primers, the entire gene was sequenced for verification. These plasmids were then separately transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation into T-RExTM-293 cells that already stably expressed the tetracycline repressor; these cells were routinely grown under blasticidin selection. After transfection, zeocin was added to the culture medium, and surviving colonies of cells were isolated and subsequently expanded into larger 6-well plates. Each of these clones was exposed to tetracycline, and 48 h after induction, the cells were harvested and solubilized with 1% DM. Separately, uninduced cells were also solubilized. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the monoclonal antibody 1D4. Cell lines were chosen on the basis of production of the least amount of opsin (i.e. nondetectable opsin levels on immunoblots) in the absence of tetracycline and moderate amounts of opsin in the presence of the drug. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in the presence of 5.0% CO2. In all of the experiments, the cells were harvested after 48 h of induction with tetracycline (1 μg/ml). The cells were washed three times with PBS, harvested, and incubated with different analogs of 11-cis-retinal (50 μm) for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were then lysed with 1.0% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DM) (Anatrace) in the presence of protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman ultracentrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 1D4-coupled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Corp.) beads overnight. The beads were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% DM. Bound pigments were eluted off the beads using 0.1 mm synthetic peptide (last 9 amino acid residues of the C terminus of Rh) in 0.1% DM. In experiments when retinoids (50 μm) were added during biosynthesis, a Me2SO solution of retinoids (10 μl of 100 mm) was added directly to the cell culture medium after 2 and 24 h of induction. The cells were harvested at 48 h and lysed with 1.0% DM. Pigment was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The UV-visible spectra of the eluted pigment samples were then recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 800 UV-visible spectrophotometer in the range of 250–650 nm. The samples were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-NC membrane (Millipore) according to established protocols. The membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (Licor) for 1 h and incubated at room temperature with 1D4 antibody (1:1000) for 1 h. The membranes were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with IRDye800TM-conjugated affinity purified goat anti-mouse IgG (Licor), diluted 1:5000. The membranes were then washed with PBS containing Tween 20 and scanned using an Odyssey Infrared imager (Licor). Purified 7-Rh and 7-P23H-Rh (Rh and P23H-Rh regenerated with 11-cis-7-ring retinal, respectively) were treated with N-glycanase according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Glyko). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The immunoblots were developed as described above. Whole cells expressing WT and P23H-opsin treated with 11-cis-7-ring retinals were harvested and exposed for 20 min to light emitted from a Fiber-Lite, MI 150, High Intensity Illuminator (Dolan-Jenner). The cells were then washed and then lysed with 1.0% DM as described above. In a separate experiment, immunoaffinity purified 7-Rh and 7-P23H-Rh samples were exposed to light from Fiber-Lite, and UV-visible spectra were recorded at different times. Whole cells expressing WT and P23H-opsin treated with 11-cis-7-ring retinals were harvested and treated with 500 mm neutral solution of hydroxylamine for 45 min. The cells were thoroughly washed with PBS to remove all traces of hydroxylamine. Rh was then purified, and spectra were taken. In a separate experiment, purified 7-Rh and 7-P23H-Rh were treated with 20 mm neutral hydroxylamine, and UV-visible spectra were recorded at different times. Purified 7-Rh and 7-P23H-Rh were incubated at 37 °C, and the spectra were recorded at indicated times. In acid treatment experiments, purified 7-Rh and 7-P23H-Rh were treated with 100 mm sulfuric acid, and spectra were recorded. A 450-μl aliquot of either purified 7-Rh, purified 7-P23H-Rh, or cell medium were treated with 50 μl of 10% SDS and 100 μl of 1 m NH2OH (freshly prepared, pH 7.5). The mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min, and then 400 μl of MeOH and 400 μl of hexane were added. The mixture was shaken on a vortex for 5 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to separate layers. The hexane layer was collected. Another 400 μl of hexane was added to the aqueous layer, and extraction was repeated. Combined hexane layers were dried down and redissolved in 120 μl of hexane, and 100-μl fractions were analyzed by normal phase HPLC as previously described (21Van Hooser J.P. Liang Y. Maeda T. Kuksa V. Jang G.F. He Y.G. Rieke F. Fong H.K. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19173-19182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells expressing WT Rh or P23H-opsin under a tetracycline-inducible promoter were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). The cells were attached to glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp.) with Cell-Tak (Becton Dickinson Labware). Expression of opsin or P23H-opsin was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The cells were treated with 50 μm 11-cis-7-ring retinal 2 h after induction. The cells were harvested after 24 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher) in PBS (136 mm NaCl, 11.4 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) for 10 min and washed by PBS. To block nonspecific labeling, the cells were incubated in 1.5% normal goat serum (Vector Lab., Inc.) in PBST (136 mm NaCl, 11.4 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in purified 1D4 antibody diluted with PBST. The sections were rinsed in PBST and incubated with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab., Inc.) and Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes). The cells were rinsed in PBST and mounted in 50 μl of 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) in 90% glycerol to retard photobleaching. For confocal imaging, the cells were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Coordinates for Rh were taken from the Protein Data Bank (1HZX) (22Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The addition of hydrogen atoms and all of the optimizations were done in Insight II (InsightII release 2000, Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). Crystallographic water was removed, and water molecules were introduced based on the accessible space in the extracellular region. No minimization was performed before water was added. A water layer (5 Å thick) was used to coat the extracellular part of Rh as well as residues in contact with polar phospholipids heads. All of the water molecules were allowed to move freely, as was the extracellular half of Rh, which contains P23H and retinal. Because no water cap was put on the cytoplasmic part of Rh, this part of the molecule was frozen to prevent degradation of the model. The chromophore of Rh, 11-cis-retinal, plays a central role in the photoactivation process (28Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is also important for the stabilization of the receptor. For example, Rh is stable for months in mild detergents, although opsin precipitates in a few hours (29Okada T. Le Trong I. Fox B.A. Behnke C.A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The chromophore may also induce a proper folding of Rh mutants (12Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Li T. Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Rosner B. Hayes K.C. Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The P23H mutation may destabilize the native chromophore-accepting conformation of opsin, leading to aberrant folding and subsequent aggregation (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, an analog of 11-cis-retinal may facilitate native-like folding of P23H-opsin and therefore play the role of pharmacological chaperone. Recently, we demonstrated that WT opsin regenerated with 11-cis-7-ring retinal (7-Rh), containing a chromophore with a seven-membered ring to prevent isomerization around the C11=C12 double bond (Fig. 1B), is very stable in vivo and in vitro (31Kuksa V. Bartl F. Maeda T. Jang G.F. Ritter E. Heck M. Van Hooser J.P. Liang Y. Filipek S. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42315-42324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, bleaching of the WT opsin regenerated with 11-cis-6-ring retinal (6-Rh), which contains a more rigid chromophore, produces multiple isomers with modest changes in protein conformations (28Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results reveal that 11-cis-7-ring retinals, particularly isomer 3 (Fig. 1B), are easily accepted into the binding site of opsin and provide additional contact sites by virtue of the seven-membered ring and the 9-methyl group with the protein moiety (31Kuksa V. Bartl F. Maeda T. Jang G.F. Ritter E. Heck M. Van Hooser J.P. Liang Y. Filipek S. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42315-42324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because of its intrinsic flexibility, this analog could potentially influence/affect protein folding during biosynthesis, which is particularly important for those mutant proteins that fold less efficiently. Clearly, the binding pocket of WT opsin, and possibly that of the P23H mutant as well, adopt specific conformations that allow it to bind preferentially certain retinoids (32Lou J. Tan Q. Karnaukhova E. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Crouch R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 219-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation provided the impetus to pursue the experiments described below. Rh is regenerated with 11-cis-7-ring retinals in the harvested membranes (Fig.2B), whereas only a small amount of pigment was formed when membranes containing P23H-opsin were treated with 11-cis-retinal (9Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), 11-cis-6-ring retinal, or 11-cis-7-ring retinal after the cells were harvested (Fig. 2B). If the mutant proteins are structurally unstable, we reasoned that addition of retinalduring the course of protein biosynthesis might induce a more native-like folding of the protein and its subsequent stabilization. Our first attempts utilized 11-cis-locked versions of 11-cis-retinal in stable cell lines expressing WT and P23H-opsin. The UV-visible spectra of the immunoaffinity purified samples from 11-cis-6- or 11-cis-7-ring retinals provided to the cells during biosynthesis showed that both retinals recombined with WT opsin (Fig. 2C). Supporting our prediction, P23H-opsin formed significant amounts of pigment when 11-cis-7-ring retinal was added during biosynthesis (Fig.2D). The λmax of the pigment was ∼490 ± 3 nm, unlike the WT protein (λmax = ∼500 ± 3 nm) (Fig. 2, C and D). The UV-visible spectra with a λmax of ∼440 nm of acid-denatured purified 7-P23H-Rh (Fig. 2D, inset) provided evidence that the chromophore forms a Schiff base with rescued P23H-opsin. Importantly, no significant pigment was seen when 11-cis-6-ring retinal, which is photoisomerable along C9- and C13-C=C double bonds (28Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was added to P23H-opsin-expressing cells (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, 11-cis-9-demethyl-7-ring retinal was also ineffective in pigment formation with P23H-opsin (data not shown). These experiments illustrate unique specificity of the binding interaction between 11-cis-7-ring retinal and P23H-opsin. Immunoblots showed that the rescued P23H-opsin had a high molecular weight and a Golgi-associated glycosylation pattern (Fig.3B, lane 5) similar to the WT protein (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the protein is sufficiently folded to proceed along the secretory pathway. This is in striking contrast to P23H-opsin that was not treated with 11-cis-7-ring retinal during P23H-opsin biosynthesis (Fig.3B, lanes 1–4). Purified 7-Rh and 7-P23H-Rh were efficiently deglycosylated by N-glycanase, and the mutant protein spontaneously aggregated, forming high molecular weight aggregates (Fig. 3, C and D). In control experiments, we tested 9-cis-retinal and 11-cis-retinal for proper folding of P23H-opsin. It should also be noted that 9-cis-retinal promoted transport of P23H-opsin to the cell surface as previously shown by another group of investigators (12Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that 11-cis-retinal also induced the in vivo folding and stabilization of P23H-opsin forming visual pigments (λ499 nm and λ492 nm, for Rh and P23H-Rh, respectively) (Fig. 2,C and D). Moreover, these pigments also acquired a mature state of glycosylation. 2S. M. Noorwez, R. Malhotra, and S. Kaushal, manuscript in preparation.11-cis-retinoids are unstable in vitro andin vivo and rapidly undergo “reverse isomerization” (33McBee J.K. Van Hooser J.P. Jang G.F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48483-48493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, locked analogs were used throughout the rest of this study. When the mixture of the four 7-ring retinal isomers (Fig. 1B) was added to cells expressing opsin and P23H-opsin during biosynthesis, both WT opsin and P23H-opsin selectively bound only isomer 3 (Fig.4, A and D). These observations further support the extraordinary specificity of WT and P23H-opsin for binding this 11-cis-retinal isomer (spectrum in Fig. 4D). Addition of 11-cis-retinal to cell membranes containing either WT or P23H-opsin that were already treated with the 11-cis-7-ring retinal during their biosynthesis did not lead to its substitution after photobleaching, as measured spectrophotometrically and by retinoid analysis of the bound chromophores (data not shown). 7-Rh, purified in the detergent, is stable to light (Fig. 5A), whereas purified 7-P23H-Rh undergoes bleaching under the same conditions (Fig. 5B). In contrast, both Rhs are stable in the membranes of HEK293 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). This result suggests that, in detergent, the chromophore in 7-P23H-Rh is more flexible, thus allowing photoisomerization. The mechanism by which 7-P23H-Rh undergoes bleaching in detergent most likely involves isomerization of isomer 3 to three other isomers and its subsequent hydrolysis (Fig. 4F). The membranes apparently stabilized 7-P23H-Rh, thus preventing isomerization of its bound chromophore (Figs. 4E and 5D). In tissue culture samples, small amounts of non-Rh-bound retinals eluted between 30 and 40 min and remained in equilibrium with the vast majority of retinols, governed by the redox potential of the cells (Fig. 4A,inset).Figure 5Photosensitivity of 7-Rh and 7-P23H-Rh in detergent and in cell membrane.

Rad51 and Rad54 proteins are two key components of the homologous recombination machinery in eukaryotes. In vitro, Rad51 protein assembles with single-stranded DNA to form the helical nucleoprotein filament that promotes DNA strand exchange, a basic step of homologous recombination. Rad54 protein interacts with this Rad51 nucleoprotein filament and stimulates its DNA pairing activity, suggesting that Rad54 protein is a component of the nucleoprotein complex involved in the DNA homology search. Here, using physical criteria, we demonstrate directly the formation of Rad54-Rad51-DNA nucleoprotein co-complexes that contain equimolar amounts of each protein. The binding of Rad54 protein significantly stabilizes the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament formed on either single-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA. The Rad54-stabilized nucleoprotein filament is more competent in DNA strand exchange and acts over a broader range of solution conditions. Thus, the co-assembly of an interacting partner with the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament represents a novel means of stabilizing the biochemical entity central to homologous recombination, and reveals a new function of Rad54 protein.

More recently, it was demonstrated that Rad52 protein, Rad54 protein, and the Rad55/Rad57 heterodimer stimulate DNA pairing promoted by Rad51 protein. The mechanistic studies revealed that stimulation by Rad52 protein and the Rad55/Rad57 proteins is at the early (presynaptic) stage of DNA strand exchange.

It was found that, in contrast to other proteins that stimulate the DNA pairing activity of Rad51 protein, Rad54 protein acts at a later (synaptic) stage of DNA strand exchange (24Mazin A.V.

Rad54 protein belongs to the Snf2/Swi2 group of proteins, which are involved in ATP-dependent remodeling of protein complexes, including mainly chromatin complexes (30Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 2001; 106: 523-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Rad54 protein was discovered to have a dsDNA topology-modifying activity, and this activity was implicated in the mechanism of stimulation of DNA strand exchange (23Tan T.L. Essers J. Citterio E.

Previously, we inferred from the analysis of joint molecule formation by Rad51 protein that Rad54 protein binds to the assembled Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament (24Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J.

We suggested that Rad54 protein is a component of a nucleoprotein filament that is involved in the search for DNA homology, and, in that capacity, Rad54 protein modifies the topology of dsDNA-target, thereby making it more readily accessible for DNA pairing. Here, in experiments with DNA attached to polystyrene beads, we provide direct evidence for a stoichiometric complex of Rad54 protein bound to the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. We discovered that the binding of Rad54 protein to the filament increased the stability of the Rad51 nucleoprotein complex substantially. We suggest that this stabilization of the filament represents a novel presynaptic and, possibly, synaptic function of Rad54 protein that, in addition to its dsDNA unwinding activity, contributes to its stimulation of DNA strand exchange. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 protein, RPA, and Rad54 protein were purified as described (18New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C.

The Rad54 protein is a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that is fully active both in vivo (31Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol.

The oligonucleotides used in this study were as follows: number 2, 63-mer (TCCTTTTGATAAGAGGTCATTTTTGCGGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTGCTGAATCTGGTGCTGT); 5, 32-mer (CCATCCGCAAAAATGACCTCTTATCAAAAGGA); 6, 32-mer (TCCTTTTGATAAGAGGTCATTTTTGCGGATGG); 26, 48-mer (TCCT TTTGATAAGAGGTCATTTTTGCGGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTGC); 48, 48-mer (GCAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCGCAAAAATGACCTCT TATCAAAAGGA-biotin); 77, 100-mer (biotin-GGGCTACGTCTTGCTG GCGTTCGCGACGCGAGGCTGGTGGCCTTCCCCATTATGATTCTTC TCGCTTCCGGCGGCATCGGGATGCCCGCGTTGCAGGCCA); 78, 100-mer (TGGCCTGCAACGCGGGCATCCCGATGCCGCCGGAAGCG AGAAGAATCATAATGGGGAAGGCCACCAGCCTCGCGTCGCGAAC GCCAGCAAGACGTAGCCC); 109, 63-mer (GTCGACGACGTCTGAGTACTCATCTAGTGTGACATCATCGCATCGAGAACAGCACCAGATT CA); and 111, 63-mer (TGAATCTGGTGCTGTTCTCGATGCGATGAT GTCACACTAGATGAGTACTCAGACGTCGTCGAC). All oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoroamidite chemistry and were purified by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel containing 50% urea (33Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the oligonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient ε260 = 9833m−1·cm−1 (1A260 = 33 μg/ml). Oligonucleotide dsDNA preparations were as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.46Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were stored at −20 °C. Covalently closed circular pUC19 DNA was purified using alkaline lysis, followed by precipitation with LiCl and by CsCl-ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.46Google Scholar). Relaxed circular DNA was produced by treating pUC19 supercoiled DNA (50 μg/ml) with topoisomerase I from wheat germ (0.75 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by phenol deproteinization and repeated ethanol precipitations. All DNA concentrations are expressed as molar in nucleotide concentration. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP in the buffer containing 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h. To inactivate the T4 polynucleotide kinase, the reaction mixture was heated for 10 min at 75 °C. Labeled oligonucleotides were stored at −20 °C. A tube containing a 1% (w/v) stock of beads (0.95-μm mean diameter; Bang Laboratories, Inc.) was stirred vigorously for 2 min. Aliquots of 20–40 μl of a bead suspension were withdrawn from the stock and pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min using a bench top centrifuge (2000 × g). The pellet was resuspended (2 min of intense stirring) in an original volume of 0.1 mNaHCO3 and mixed with 32P-labeled biotinylated DNA. Prior to the immobilization, the radioactivity (cpm) of the biotinylated DNA was determined using a scintillation counter LS6500 (Beckman) and its specific activity (cpm per mg) was calculated. The immobilization was carried out for 15 min at 37 °C. Non-immobilized DNA was removed by centrifugation for 4 min. After immobilization, the beads with attached DNA were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed in the original volume of NaHCO3 and pelleted again by centrifugation. The washing procedure was repeated twice. The amount of DNA attached to beads was determined by measuring the radioactivity of the bead, supernatant, and wash fractions and by calculating it as a fraction relative to total DNA with known specific activity. Fig. 1illustrates our procedure for measuring the binding of Rad51 and Rad54 proteins to the DNA-beads. Rad51 and Rad54 proteins were bound to DNA-beads in standard binding buffer containing 33 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 20 mm (or 25 mm) magnesium acetate, and 2 mm ATP. Previously, we established that these conditions are optimal for DNA strand exchange promoted by the yeast Rad51 protein (32Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 35Mazin A.V. Zaitseva E. Sung P. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Typically, the reaction volumes were in multiples of 10 μl; 10 μl represented the smallest volume unit of the reaction mixture. Where indicated, the mixture was supplemented with an ATP regeneration system containing either 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate and 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase or 20 mm phosphocreatine and 30 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase. Rad51 protein was incubated with beads for 15 min at 37 °C. Rad54 protein was incubated with dsDNA-beads or Rad51-dsDNA-beads for 10 min at 37 °C, unless indicated otherwise. When longer periods of incubation were applied, the Rad51-dsDNA filaments were formed at 37 °C and then cooled to room temperature (23 °C) prior to the addition of Rad54 protein. After completion of protein binding, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures, and beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min. Where indicated, pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of standard buffer and pelleted again. Finally, beads were resuspended in 10 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel running buffer and mixed with 2 μl of 6× SDS loading buffer (350 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 36% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). Typically, we analyzed both the bound and free protein fractions and determined the relative amounts of proteins in these fractions using high resolution cooled CCD digital camera and GelPro 3.0 software. To determine the salt titration midpoint (STMP) of the Rad51-DNA complexes, the preformed Rad51-DNA or Rad54-Rad51-DNA nucleoprotein complexes were incubated in reaction mixtures of 11.9 μl in the presence of various concentrations (0–880 mm) of NaCl for 5 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the amounts of DNA-bound proteins were determined as described above. Salt that was added along with Rad54 or Rad54 K341R protein, whose stocks contained 1m NaCl, was taken into account in all STMP calculations. To form Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments, Rad51 protein (0.575 or 0.85 μm) was incubated with dsDNA (3.45 μm, nucleotides) (63 base pairs, oligonucleotides 109–111) in buffer containing 33 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 15 min. For ATP regeneration, 15 mm phosphocreatine and 20 units/ml of phosphocreatine kinase were included in the reaction. Aliquots of 9 μl containing the Rad51-dsDNA complexes were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and mixed with 1 μl of Rad54 protein at various concentrations. DNA cleavage was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of RsaI (10 units) endonuclease. The reactions were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C. DNA products were deproteinized by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm, SDS to 1%, and proteinase K to 700 mg/ml, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and analyzed in 10% polyacrylamide gels. To form Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments, Rad51 protein (1 μm) was incubated with ssDNA (63-mer, oligonucleotide 2) (3 μm) in buffer containing 33 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction temperature was decreased to 30 °C, and, where indicated, Rad54 protein (0.125 μm) was added to the reaction. Aliquots (8 μl) were mixed with the indicated amounts of NaCl (1 μl), and pairing reactions were initiated immediately by the addition of 1 μl of dsDNA (32 base pairs, oligonucleotides 5 and 6) (3 μm, nucleotides) and continued for 15 min. DNA products were deproteinized by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm, SDS to 1%, and proteinase K to 500 μg/ml followed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were mixed with one-tenth volume of loading buffer (20% Ficoll, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The extent of DNA strand exchange was quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Previously, we found that a stoichiometric amount (1:1) of Rad54 protein relative to Rad51 protein is required for maximal stimulation of joint molecule formation by the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament (24Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This finding implied that a co-complex with the nucleoprotein filament, containing equimolar amounts of Rad54 and Rad51 proteins, is the functional species. To obtain physical evidence for this complex, we quantified the binding of Rad54 protein to Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments assembled on biotinylated DNA, which was attached to streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (Fig.1). First, we confirmed the stoichiometry of Rad51 protein binding to ssDNA (48-mer). For this purpose, we incubated a fixed amount of ssDNA-beads with increasing amounts of Rad51 protein and then analyzed the amount of Rad51 protein bound to the DNA-beads by SDS-gel electrophoresis. As expected, Rad51 protein binds to the ssDNA with a stoichiometry that is ∼1 protein monomer per 3 nucleotides of ssDNA, based on the amount of Rad51 protein (∼0.6 μm) bound to DNA (1.93 μm, total concentration) at saturation (Fig.2, A and B). Then, in a similar experiment, we examined the binding of Rad51 protein to dsDNA (100 base pairs) immobilized on beads at two different concentrations. As with ssDNA, the stoichiometry of Rad51 protein binding to the dsDNA is ∼1 protein monomer per 3 base pairs of dsDNA at two different DNA concentrations (Fig. 2C). In these experiments, the level of nonspecific Rad51 protein binding to the polystyrene beads lacking DNA never exceeded 10% of Rad51 protein binding to either dsDNA-beads or ssDNA-beads (Fig. 2). Therefore, Rad51 protein binds to ssDNA and dsDNA that is immobilized on beads with the same binding stoichiometry that was observed previously (10Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 36Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Next, we determined the stoichiometry of Rad54 protein binding to a Rad51 nucleoprotein filament that was assembled on the ssDNA. These preassembled Rad51-nucleoprotein filaments were incubated with increasing amounts of Rad54 protein. We found that Rad54 protein forms a stable complex with the Rad51-ssDNA complexes (Fig.3A). The amount of Rad51 protein in these co-complexes does not decrease with increasing Rad54 protein binding, demonstrating that the Rad51 protein is not being displaced; if anything, there was a slight increase in the amount of bound Rad51 protein, suggesting stabilization (see below). At saturating Rad54 protein concentrations, these complexes contain equimolar amounts of Rad51 and Rad54 proteins (Fig. 3B). The level of nonspecific Rad54 protein binding to the polystyrene beads lacking DNA did not exceed 15% of Rad54 protein binding to the Rad51-ssDNA complexes (see Fig.4A).Figure 4Rad54 protein stabilizes the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament on either ssDNA or dsDNA. A andC, the Rad51-ssDNA filaments were assembled by incubating Rad51 protein (0.85 μm) with bead-immobilized ssDNA (48-mer, oligonucleotide 48) (1.73 μm). Rad54 protein (0.42 μm) (A) or mutant K341R Rad54 protein (0.42 μm) (C) was added to the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments to form Rad54-Rad51-ssDNA co-complexes. The stability of the nucleoprotein complexes was challenged by NaCl for 5 min at 37 °C. The amounts of Rad51 protein, Rad54 protein, and K341R Rad54 protein bound to ssDNA and dsDNA were determined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The levels of Rad51 protein binding either alone (51p) or in the presence of Rad54 protein (51p (+54p)) or of Rad54 K341R mutant protein (51p (+K341R)) are indicated by squares and triangles, respectively. The levels of Rad54 protein (54p (+51)) or Rad54 K341R mutant protein binding in the presence of Rad51 protein (K341R (+51p)) are indicated bycircles and open circles, respectively. The nonspecific binding of Rad54 protein to beads devoid of DNA is indicated in A by open squares. The arrows indicate the STMP of the Rad51-ssDNA complexes. Typically, binding experiments were repeated three times; S.E. values for each point were smaller than 10%.B, Rad51-dsDNA filaments were assembled by incubating Rad51 protein (0.85 μm) with bead-immobilized dsDNA (48 base pairs, positions 48–26) (3.45 μm, nucleotides). Rad54 protein was added at the indicated concentrations. The stability of the nucleoprotein complex was challenged by NaCl for 5 min at 37 °C. For each Rad54 protein concentration, the STMP was determined from experiments done at 5–11 different NaCl concentrations. The STMP for each Rad54 protein-Rad51 protein-dsDNA complex is plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar experiments were conducted using Rad51-dsDNA filaments (gel data not shown). In this case, we also observed increased binding of Rad54 protein until saturation of the Rad51-dsDNA complexes was achieved (Fig. 3C). As was the case for ssDNA, saturation occurred at approximately one Rad54 monomer per Rad51 monomer. Also, it appeared that increasing amounts of Rad54 protein promoted a slight increase of Rad51 protein bound, particularly at the lower concentrations of Rad54 protein (see below). Thus, Rad54 protein forms a stable co-complex with the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament, assembled on either ssDNA or dsDNA, without the displacement of Rad51 protein. The slight increase in bound Rad51 protein that was detected in Fig. 3, when Rad54 protein was present, suggested that Rad54 protein might affect the stability of the Rad51-ssDNA and Rad51-dsDNA nucleoprotein filaments. As a criterion for stability, we used the resistance of the filament to disruption by NaCl (36Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol.

Consequently, the nucleoprotein complexes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl, and the amount of Rad51 protein bound to ssDNA was determined (Fig. 4A). We observed a decreased amount of Rad51 protein bound to dsDNA upon the addition of NaCl (36Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The STMP, which is defined as the NaCl concentration at which one-half of the protein (relative to the fully saturated complex) is dissociated from the nucleoprotein complexes, is ∼120 mm NaCl for Rad51 protein, when Rad54 protein was absent (Fig. 4A, squares). Interestingly, in the presence of 0.42 μm Rad54 protein (triangles), the STMP for the Rad51-ssDNA complexes increased to 300 mm. Similar NaCl titration experiments were conducted using dsDNA instead of ssDNA (titrations not shown). We found that Rad54 protein also stabilized the Rad51-dsDNA filament in a similar manner (Fig.4B). The STMP for the Rad51-dsDNA complexes is less than 50 mm NaCl for Rad51 protein, when Rad54 protein was absent. In the presence of Rad54 protein, we found that the addition of increasing amounts caused a gradual increase in the salt resistance of the Rad51-dsDNA complex. At the highest Rad54 protein concentration tested (0.42 μm), representing a stoichiometry of one Rad54 protein monomer per two Rad51 protein monomers), the STMP for Rad51 protein increased to 260 mm NaCl. Thus, Rad54 protein substantially stabilizes both the Rad51-ssDNA and the Rad51-dsDNA nucleoprotein complexes. In the salt stability experiments described above, we also measured the binding of Rad54 protein to the Rad51-ssDNA and Rad51-dsDNA complexes at each of the NaCl concentrations. The Rad54 nucleoprotein complexes show a very high resistance to NaCl: at 770 mm NaCl, about 80 and 50% of Rad54 protein remains complexed with ssDNA (Fig.4A, filled circles) and dsDNA (data not shown), respectively. The effect of nonspecific binding of Rad54 protein to beads was also tested; it was negligible over the entire range of tested salt concentrations (Fig. 4A,open squares). Thus, Rad54 protein remains bound to DNA over the range of these experiments, and the stabilizing effect of Rad54 protein on the Rad51-DNA nucleoprotein complexes is probably associated with its high affinity for DNA. Previously, it was shown that the Rad54 K341R mutant protein, which lacks ATP hydrolysis and dsDNA unwinding activities, is still proficient in binding to both DNA and Rad51 protein (29Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 2A. V. Mazin, A. A. Alexeev, and S. C. Kowalczykowski, unpublished observations. Therefore, we tested this mutant protein with regard to its capacity to stabilize Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments. We found that the K341R mutant protein also stabilized the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein to the same degree as the wild type Rad54 protein and that it also showed a high affinity for DNA (Fig. 4C). These results show that neither ATP hydrolysis nor DNA unwinding activity is needed for stabilization of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament. Rather, we conclude that the stabilizing effect of Rad54 protein on the Rad51 filament results from both its high affinity for DNA and its ability to bind DNA and Rad51 protein sim"
https://openalex.org/W2086268693,"UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) plays an important physiological role by contributing to the metabolism of endogenous substances such as bilirubin in addition to xenobiotics and drugs. The UGT1A1 gene has been shown to be inducible by nuclear receptors steroid xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and the constitutive active receptor, CAR. In this report, we show that in human hepatoma HepG2 cells the UGT1A1 gene is also inducible with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ah receptor) ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), β-naphthoflavone, and benzo[a]pyrene metabolites. Induction was monitored by increases in protein and catalytic activity as well as UGT1A1 mRNA. To examine the molecular interactions that controlUGT1A1 expression, the gene was characterized and induction by Ah receptor ligands was regionalized to bases −3338 to −3287. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this UGT1A1 enhancer region revealed a xenobiotic response element (XRE) at −3381/−3299. The dependence of the XRE on UGT1A1-luciferase activity was demonstrated by a loss of Ah receptor ligand inducibility when the XRE core region (CACGCA) was deleted or mutated. Gel mobility shift analysis confirmed that TCDD induction of nuclear proteins specifically bound to the UGT1A1-XRE, and competition experiments with Ah receptor and Arnt antibodies demonstrated that the nuclear protein was the Ah receptor. These observations reveal that the Ah receptor is involved in human UGT1A1 induction. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) plays an important physiological role by contributing to the metabolism of endogenous substances such as bilirubin in addition to xenobiotics and drugs. The UGT1A1 gene has been shown to be inducible by nuclear receptors steroid xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and the constitutive active receptor, CAR. In this report, we show that in human hepatoma HepG2 cells the UGT1A1 gene is also inducible with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ah receptor) ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), β-naphthoflavone, and benzo[a]pyrene metabolites.

Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). Some of the endogenous agents that are targets for glucuronidation are bilirubin and many of the steroids as well as several phenolic neurotransmitters. In addition, hundreds of drugs and xenobiotics are subject to glucuronidation (2Miners J.O. Mackenzie P.I. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 3Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The vast numbers of endogenous and exogenous substances that are susceptible to glucuronidation in humans are catalyzed by the family of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).1 A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the UGTs in mammalian species has helped in classifying these proteins as members of the UGT1 or UGT2 gene family (4Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Louisot P. Magdalou J. Chowdhury Ritter Jr., J.K. Schachter H. Tephly T.R. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). In humans, 16 cDNAs have been identified and shown through expression experiments in tissue culture to encode proteins that display functional glucuronidation activity (3Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). It is generally felt that evolutionary constraints associated with the UGT1 family of proteins leads to more efficient glucuronidation of drugs and xenobiotics, whereas the UGT2 family of proteins displays far greater catalytic diversity toward endogenous agents such as steroids. Regulation of the UGTs in human tissues is tightly controlled. Analysis of RNA expression patterns has demonstrated that no two tissues display the same pattern of UGT gene expression, indicating that regulatory control occurs in a tissue-specific manner (5Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, environmental influences on gene control clearly indicate that the UGTs are capable of undergoing differential regulation resulting in enhanced glucuronidation capacity. The treatment of Caco-2 cells with the antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone leads to induction of UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 (6Munzel P.A. Schmohl S. Heel H. Kalberer K. Bock-Hennig B.S. Bock K.W. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 569-573PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bock K.W. Eckle T. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation ofUGT1A6 and UGT1A9 occurs after exposure to Ah receptor ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (6Munzel P.A. Schmohl S. Heel H. Kalberer K. Bock-Hennig B.S.

Biophys. 1998; 350: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Human UGT1A1 has recently been shown to be under control by agents that induce gene expression in concordance with the constitutive active receptor (CAR) (9Sugatani J. Kojima H. Ueda A. Kakizaki S. Yoshinari K. Gong Q.H. Owens I.S. Negishi M. Sueyoshi T. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and the steroid xenobiotic receptor (SXR) (33Xie W. Yeuh M.-F. Radominska-Pandya A. Saini S.P.S. Negishi Y. Bottroff B.S. Cabrera G.Y. Tukey R.H. Evan R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The treatment of HepG2 and Caco-2 cells with the flavonoid chrysin leads to the induction of UGT1A1 (10Walle T. Otake Y. Galijatovic A. Ritter J.K. Walle U.K. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 1077-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 11Galijatovic A. Otake Y. Walle U.K. Walle T. Pharmacol. Res. 2001; 18: 374-379Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Galijatovic A. Walle U.K. Walle T. Pharmacol. Res. 2000; 17: 21-26Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, flavonoids have also been shown to induceCYP1A1 (13Allen S.W. Mueller L. Williams S.N. Quattrochi L.C. Raucy J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1074-1079PubMed Google Scholar) in a CYP1A1-luciferase reporter HepG2 cell line (14Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), implicating a potential role for the induction ofUGT1A1 through a similar mechanism. One potential mechanism that may link the expression of UGT1A1 and CYP1A1by flavonoids is the ability of these agents to activate the Ah receptor. Although the mechanisms surrounding expression ofCYP1A1 after activation of the Ah receptor are well documented (15Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 16Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol.

Experiments were undertaken in this study to examine the actions of several Ah receptor ligands to modulate expression of the UGT1A1 gene. 1-Naphthol, 17α-ethynylestradiol,o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and β-naphthoflavone (BNF) were purchased from Sigma. TCDD, 1-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (1B[a]P), 2B[a]P, 3B[a]P, 4B[a]P, 6B[a]P, 7B[a]P, 8B[a]P, 9–9B[a]P, 10B[a]P, benzo[a]pyrene-cis-4,5-dihydrodiol, and benzo[a]pyrene-trans-4,5-dihydrodiol were obtained from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository (Kansas City, MO). The Bio-Rad protein assay for protein concentration analysis was purchased from Bio-Rad. Restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Taq polymerase and the reporter plasmids PGL3-basic vector and PGL3-promoter vector were from Promega(Madison, WI). Custom oligonucleotides used in PCR cloning, DNA sequencing, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were purchased from Genbase (San Diego, CA). The β-galactosidase expression vector PCMVβ Gal was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Thin-layer chromatography plates for enzyme analysis were from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). The human cell lines used in this study are the hepatoma-derived HepG2 and the human CYP1A1-luciferase reporter gene TV101 cell line (14Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were trypsinized 24 h before chemical treatment, and 106cells were seeded in P100 plates. Cells were treated for 24–72 h with either TCDD (10 nm) or BNF (20 μm). For transient transfection experiments, 105 cells were split into 12-well plates ∼24 h before transfection followed by chemical treatment for 48 h. Chemicals were first dissolved in Me2SO, and Me2SO concentration in media never exceeded 0.1% (v/v). Fresh media and chemical treatment were changed every 24 h. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase analysis was determined using 1-naphthol and 17α-ethynylestradiol as substrates (18Bansal S.K. Gessner T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were treated with either 10 nm TCDD or 20 μm BNF, and the cells were collected after 24–72 h of treatment. Whole cell lysates were prepared. Each UGT assay was conducted in a total volume of 100 μl containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 μm uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid, 0.04 μCi of [14C]uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid (0.14 nmol), 8.5 mm saccharolactone, 100 μm substrate, and 100 μg of protein. Each reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. TLC plates were visualized with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 PhosphorImager. Resident glucuronides were then removed and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. HepG2 cells were collected and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ∼5 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were sonicated on a 10-s pulse cycle for 2 min at 6 watts with a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher). Each extract was centrifuged first for 5 min at 1000 × g in a refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 9000 × g. This supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge, and the microsomes were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Western blots were carried out on Nupage Bis-Tris 10% polyacrylamide gels as outlined by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Protein (10 μg) was run at 200 V for 50 min and transferred at 30 V for 1 h to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with anti-human UGT1A1 (19Ritter J.K. Kessler F.K. Thompson M.T. Grove A.D. Auyeung D.J. Fisher R.A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (1:1000) or antihuman CYP1A1 (20Soucek P. Martin M.V. Ueng Y.F. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16013-16021Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (1:5000) in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (for UGT1A1) or anti-rabbit (for CYP1A1) antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Detection of the proteins was conducted by chemiluminescence. HepG2 cells were treated for 24–72 h with 10 nm TCDD or 20 μm BNF, and total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blots, 15 μg of total RNA was separated through 1% formaldehyde agarose gels. RNA was subsequently blotted onto GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary transfer. After transfer, the blot was stained with methylene blue to visualize RNA for loading efficiency. A 423-bp fragment recovered by digesting the UGT1A1 cDNA withAvaI/ExoRI was 32P-labeled by random priming (Invitrogen) and purified using a nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). After boiling, the probe was added to hybridization solution (Stratagene) and incubated with the filters at 68 °C for 6 h followed by washing in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 mNaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. Visualization was performed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Genomic clones containing theUGT1 locus were characterized by screening a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. Enhancer DNA fragments as well as a −3712/−7 UGT1A1 promoter fragment containing the TATA box were amplified by PCR using primers corresponding to sites on the promoter sequence, as published in NCBI GenBankTM accession number AF297093 (21Gong Q.H. Cho J.W. Huang T. Potter C. Gholami N. Basu N.K. Kubota S. Carvalho S. Pennington M.W. Owens I.S. Popescu N.C. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The cap site in AF297093 is at base pair 175,027, as characterized previously (38Ritter J.K. Chen F. Sheen Y.Y. Tran H.M. Kimura S. Yeatman M.T. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3257-3261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The restriction enzyme sitesSacI and XhoI were incorporated at the 5′ end of the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The PCR product for the −3712/−7 UGT1A1 promoter was generated with oligonucleotides 5′-tttaggagctcTCAGACAAAAGGAA-3′ and 5-tcctgctcgagGTTCGCCCTCTCCT-3′, digested withSacI/XhoI (the sites are in lowercase and underlined) and subcloned into SacI/XhoI-digested PGL3-basic vector. This plasmid was identified as pLUGT1A1. Using the pL1A1Neo plasmid originally cloned in the laboratory (14Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the neomycin gene was removed and cloned into the SalI site of pLUGT1A1, generating the pLUGT1A1N plasmid. The sequences of the primers used for the enhancers are as follows: E1, 5′-atatggagctcAAAGAAGAGAACT-3′ and 5′-atctactcgaGGGAATGATCCTTT-3′; E2, 5′-atattgagctcTTGCTTGCTGC-3′ and 5′-aatttctcgagACCATGGCTGGTT-3′; E3, 5′-tttaggagctcTCAGACAAAAGGAA-3′ and 5′-ttacactcgagAACCACTACTAAGC-3′; E4, 5′-tccttgagctcTTTTTGACACTGGA-3′ and 5′-aaattctcgagCTCATTCCTCCTCT-3′; E5, 5′-aaagggagctcTAACGGTTCATAAA-3′ and 5′-aaattctcgagCTTACTATGACTG-3′; E6, 5′-aaagggagctcTAACGGTTCATAAA-3′ and 5′-aatggctcgagGTTATGTAACTAGA-3′. Each of these amplified inserts were digested with SacI andXhoI site and subcloned into theSacI/XhoI digested PGL3-promoter vector. For construction of the mutant UGT1A1-XRE enhancer plasmid, E4 was used as template. The primers used for amplification of the insert were 5′-tccttgagctcTTTTTGACACTGGA-3′ and 5′-aaattctcgagCTCATTCCTCCTCT-3′. The two internal primers that carried the mutations were 5′-CTTGGTAAGACCGCAATGAAC-3 and 5-GTTCATTGCGGTCTTACCAAG-3′. The underlined region represents the area of the Ah receptor core binding region, and the bold and italicized bases are those that were changed form the normal XRE sequence to disrupt the Ah receptor binding region (see Fig.4A). After digestion of the amplified sequence withSacI and XhoI, the insert was cloned into these same sites in the PGL3-promoter vector. HepG2 cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates at 30–40% confluence and transfected after 24 h using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described by the manufacture's protocol (Invitrogen). In general, transfection mixtures contained 500 ng of UGT1A1-reporter plasmid and 300 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (PCMVβ) as an internal control to monitor for transfection efficiency. The day after transfection, the cells were treated with 20 μm BNF, 10 nmTCDD, or Me2SO for 48 h. The cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activities were assessed by the methods described previously (22Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using a Monolight 2001 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, HepG2 cells were harvested in lysis buffer (1% Triton, 25 mm Tricine, 15 mmMgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). Cell lysates were centrifuged, and 10 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 300 μl of reaction mixture (15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tricine, and 1 mm DTT). Reactions were started by adding 100 μl of luciferin (0.3 mg/ml) dissolved in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4; light output was measured for 10 s, and the luciferase activity is expressed as relative light units. β-Galactosidase activities were determined using a standardo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside colorimetric assay (with instructions from Promega). Data represent the mean ± S.D. of experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. Using HepG2 cells that were seeded at ∼106cells/100-mm tissue culture dish, the pLUGT1A1N plasmid was transfected as outlined above. After 48 h of growth, the cells were trypsinized, 1/10 volume of the collected cells was plated into a 100-mm tissue culture dish, and the cells were exposed to media containing 0.8 mg/ml G418. After 2–3 weeks, individual colonies of selected cells were removed and re-cultured in 60-mm plates with continued G418 selection. A final round of clonal selection was made, and each clone was expanded and treated with 5 μm TCDD for 24 h followed by analysis of induced luciferase activity. For these studies, the cell line selected is referred to as MH1A1L cells. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were isolated as described previously (22Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), with all of the procedures performed at 4 °C. After 48 h of treatment with 10 nm TCDD, 20 μm BNF, or Me2SO, HepG2 cells were washed twice with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, collected by scraping into MDH buffer (3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder driven by an electric motor. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min, and the pellet was washed with MDHK buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl) 3 times. The pellet was then lysed in HDK buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 m KCl) and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was designated as nuclear extract. A complementary pair of synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-GCTAGGCACTTGGTAAGCACGCAATGAACAGTCA-3′ and 5′-GCTATGACTGTTCATTGCGTGCTTACCAAGTGCC-3′, encoding the consensus core sequence (underlined) of the UGT1A1 XRE element were synthesized. For analysis of Ah receptor activation, the humanCYP1A1 DRE3 oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCGGCTCTTGTCACGCAACTCCGAGCTCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGAGCTCGGAGTTGCGTGAGAAGAGCCG-3′) were used as previously described (22Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were assembled by annealing equal concentrations of either the XRE or DRE and then labeled with [α-32P]CTP in the presence of Klenow and 25 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. Binding assays were carried out on ice containing 3 × 104 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide, 10 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA in a final reaction volume of 30 μl containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol (22Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To examine the specificity of Ah receptor binding, 100 ηg of anti-Ah receptor or anti-Arnt antibody (a generous gift from Christopher Bradfield) was included in the binding reaction. Protein-DNA complex was then separated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using 45 mm Tris-borate, 10 mm EDTA as a running buffer. Competition assays were performed by adding a 50-fold excess of unlabeled CYP1A1 DRE or UGT1A1 XRE oligonucleotide. The gels were then dried, and protein-DNA complexes were visualized by a PhosphorImager. Human TV101 cells were derived from the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 but carry the humanCYP1A1 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase gene (14Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The −1600 bp of the CYP1A1 promoter contains 3 Ah receptor-specific XRE sites. Luciferase activity results from Ah receptor activation after treatment with Ah receptor ligands. The TV101 cells were grown under the same conditions as HepG2 cells but supplemented with 0.8 mg/ml G418. The TV101 cells were treated with TCDD, BNF, or Me2SO at different time points to evaluate their ability to activate CYP1A1 gene transcription. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized for protein concentration. The small phenolic compound 1-naphthol was used as a substrate to examine UGT activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A). Treatment of HepG2 cells with 10 nm TCDD for 72 h led to a time-dependent increase in 1-naphthol UGT activity that consistently was determined to be 3-fold over untreated cells. Similar treatment of cells with 20 μm BNF resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in 1-naphthol UGT activity. Simple phenols have been shown to be glucuronidated by most of the UGT1A proteins (3Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), with a preference for UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Glucuronidation of 17α-ethynylestradiol, a substrate that is preferentially glucuronidated by UGT1A1, was increased 2.5–5-fold in TCDD- or BNF-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Quantitation ofUGT1A1 RNA transcripts by Northern blot analysis demonstrated that both TCDD and BNF induced UGT1A1 (Fig.1B) in a time-dependent fashion. Slightly greater increases in RNA were observed with BNF-treated cells, a pattern that was also reflected in catalytic activity. It was also observed that induction of UGT1A1 RNA and 17α-ethynylestradiol glucuronidation by TCDD and BNF correlated with increased levels of UGT1A1 protein (Fig. 1C), with BNF generating slightly greater levels of induced UGT1A1 in microsomes. In HepG2 cells, TCDD and BNF are capable of inducing CYP1A1, as shown by induction of CYP1A1 (Fig. 1C) and activation of the humanCYP1A1-luciferase gene in TV101 cells (Fig.2). Induction ofCYP1A1-luciferase in TV101 cells has been linked to activation of the Ah receptor (22Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508PubMed Google Scholar). Although maximalCYP1A1-luciferase activity is achieved between 8–24 h in TV101 cells with TCDD and BNF, maximal levels of UGT1A1 RNA and protein are evident at around 48 h (Fig. 1C), indicating that slightly different regulatory events may control the CYP1A1and UGT1A1 genes. Combined, these results indicate that induction of UGT1A1 may occur through an Ah receptor-dependent mechanism.Figure 2Induction of CYP1A1-luciferase. TCDD and BNF were evaluated for their ability to induce luciferase activity in HepG2 TV101 cells at various times after treatment. Luciferase activity was expressed as relative light unitsμg of protein. The results reported at each time represent the average of two separate determinations. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the mechanism of UGT1A1 induction, an 11-kilobase region of the UGT1A1 promoter was cloned from a human BAC containing the entire UGT1A1 locus.UGT1A1 promoter and enhancer regions, cloned by PCR, were subcloned into the pGL3 basic or pGL3 promoter vectors, respectively. Portions of the regulatory region including the promoter constituted a fragment from −3712 to −7, whereas the individual enhancer sequences contained bases from −10998/−8134 (Enhancer 1, E1), −8533/−4738 (Enhancer 2, E2), and −3712/−2081 (Enhancer 3, E3). Each plasmid was transfected transiently into HepG2 cells, and expression of luciferase activity was determined after treatment of cells for 48 h with TCDD or BNF (Fig. 3). Our selection of 48 h for the treatment time was selected because we had observed adequate accumulation of both RNA and protein in TCDD/BNF-treated HepG2 cells. The UGT1A1 −3712/−7 luciferase promoter fragment was induced after treatment with TCDD and BNF. An enhancer sequence from −3712 to −2081 (E3) relative to the transcriptional start site was also responsive. Enhancer sequences E2 and E1, which covered a region from −10998 to −4738, were refractory to both TCDD and BNF. Induction of the −3712/−7 promoter-luciferase construct with TCDD indicates that the transcriptional activation may occur through an Ah receptor-dependent mechanism. Compounds that have been shown to be ligands for the Ah receptor are classically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To examine this possibility further, we developed MH1A1L cells carrying the UGT1A1-luciferase plasmid and demonstrated that classical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of hydroxylated benzo[a]pyrene were capable of inducing UGT1A1-driven luciferase. We examined 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, 8- , 9-, and 10-hydroxylated isomers of benzo[a]pyrene in addition to cis- and trans-4,5-dihydrodiol benzo[a]pyrene (Fig. 4). Along with TCDD induction, we observed a 2–5-fold induction of luciferase activity with the 3- and 9-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene and thetrans-4,5-dihydrodiol serving as the most efficient inducers. The use of cell lines deficient in Ah receptor function show that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons induce gene expression in an Ah receptor-dependent fashion (24Merchant M. Wang X. Kamps C. Rosengren R. Morrison V. Safe S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated through the use of reporter gene assays that are controlled by the Ah receptor enhancer sequence that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons induce transcription through activation of the Ah receptor (14Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Anderson J.W. Jones J. Steinert S. Sanders B. Means J. McMillin D. Vu T.

Chem. 2002; 21: 2027-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Combined, the results of TCDD, BNF, and B[a]P induction of the UGT1A1 promoter constructs strongly indicates that these agents elicit transcriptional activation through and Ah receptor-dependent pathway. To localize the region on the UGT1A1 gene that controls induction, further mutational analysis on the E4 clone demonstrated that a sharp drop in induction was observed between bases −3338 and −3287 (Fig. 5A). Sequence analysis in this region revealed the presence of a single copy of the Ah receptor XRE motif (CACGCA) starting at position −3309 (Fig.5B). Using DNA fragments spanning −3525 to −3144, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the conservedUGT1A1 XRE sequence, altering CACGCA to ACCGCA. Transient transfection of this plasmid demonstrated that the mutatedUGT1A1-XRE resulted in a loss of inducibility (Fig.5C) by TCDD and BNF. Regulation of UGT1A1 by the XRE core sequence indicates that the CACGCA motif may be a binding site for the Ah receptor. Binding of Ah receptor complex to the XRE response element in theUGT1A1 promoter region was examined by gel mobility shift analysis (Fig. 6). When nuclear extract prepared from TCDD-treated HepG2 cells was incubated with a32P-labeled UGT1A1-XRE probe, an induced DNA-protein complex was detected. Competition for the labe"

The effect was not associated with an increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells. The major part of the nuclear actin was not stained by rhodamine-phalloidin but could be visualized with an actin antibody, indicating its monomeric or a conformationally distinct state, e.g. cofilin-decorated filaments. Introduction of anti-cofilin into permeabilized cells inhibited nuclear actin accumulation, implying that an active, cofilin-dependent, import exists in this system. Nuclear actin was localized outside the ethidium bromide-stained region, in the extrachromosomal nuclear domain. In permeabilized cells, the appearance of nuclear actin and cofilin was not significantly affected by increasing [Ca2+] and/or adding guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), but was greatly promoted when ATP was withdrawn. Similarly, ATP depletion in intact cells also induced nuclear actin accumulation. In contrast to the effects of latrunculin B, ATP depletion was associated with an increase in cortical F-actin. Our results suggest that the presence of actin in the nucleus may be required for certain stress-induced responses and that cofilin is essential for the nuclear import of actin.

During these studies, we have consistently noticed accumulation of actin in the nuclei of LB-treated cells. Nuclear actin was visible even in cells that, as a consequence of the LB treatment, have lost all other structures recognizable by phalloidin. Here we address the mechanisms involved in and conditions necessary for this translocation. latrunculin B anti-β-actin chloride buffer ethidium bromide fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) glutamate buffer propidium iodide rat peritoneal mast cells rhodamine-phalloidin streptolysin-O piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) The existence of nuclear actin has long been questioned, but recent years have brought several lines of strong evidence indicating the regulated nuclear import and export of actin (2Rando O.J. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Actin has been shown to contain two functional leucine-rich nuclear export sequences, and their disruption leads to nuclear actin accumulation and consequently to a decrease in cell proliferation (3Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, actin itself does not possess any nuclear localization sequence. The actin-binding protein, cofilin, contains a classical bipartite SV40-type nuclear localization sequence (4Iida K. Matsumoto S. Yahara I. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and translocates into nuclei together with actin after a heat shock (4Iida K. Matsumoto S. Yahara I. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Nishida E. Iida K. Yonezawa N. Koyasu S. Yahara I. Sakai H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 1993; 206: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the physiological function of nuclear actin. Monomeric actin is a well known inhibitor of DNase I (7Blikstad I. Markey F. Carlsson L. Persson T. Lindberg U. Cell. 1978; 15: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and the actin-DNase I complex is stabilized by cofilin (8Nosworthy N.J. Kekic M. dos-Remedios C.G. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but the relevance of these interactions is still unknown. Actin may constitute a part of the nuclear matrix, the non-chromatin fraction of the nucleus, enabling compartmentalization of functions or reorganization of chromatin (2Rando O.J. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel protein, EAST, has been characterized as a component of the nuclear matrix, localized exclusively to the extrachromosomal nuclear domain (9Wasser M. Chia W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An increase in the levels of EAST (after a heat shock or due to its overexpression) led to an expansion of this domain and to accumulation of actin within it. Relevant to our study is the finding that cellular levels of G-actin control activation of a transcription factor, serum response factor. An increase in G-actin level, induced by an actin-destabilizing drug, latrunculin B, or by manipulation of some actin regulatory proteins, suppresses specific serum response factor target genes such as srf and vinculin (10Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In another study, latrunculin B was found to delay nuclear division in yeast; latrunculin B-induced disruption of actin filaments led to an incorrect spindle position, which in turn seems to promote stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (11Gachet Y. Tournier S. Millar J.B. Hyams J.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here we report that latrunculin B-induced disassembly of F-actin in mast cells promotes an entry of actin and cofilin into the nuclei. The competence to translocate actin is retained after cell permeabilization despite leakage of cytosolic proteins. Using the permeabilized cell system, we have shown that accumulation of nuclear actin is blocked by addition of an anti-cofilin antibody. Depletion of ATP from either intact or permeabilized cells also promoted an increase of nuclear actin and cofilin. In this case, the nuclear translocation was associated with an increase in F-actin content. LB was from Calbiochem (428020-S), and it was dissolved (5 mg/ml) in Me2SO and stored in small aliquots at −20 °C. GTPγS and ATP were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Streptolysin-O (SL-O) was from Murex Diagnostics (CX MR16, distributed by Corgenix). Glass “Multitest” slides (6-mm diameter wells) were from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). All other reagents were obtained from the Sigma (Poole, UK). RPMC were prepared as described previously (12Howell T.W. Gomperts B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in a solution containing 137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm NaPIPES, pH 7.2 (chloride buffer, CB). For confocal microscopy, cells in CB were allowed to attach to glass slides for 1 h at room temperature (∼25,000 cells/well). Suspended cells were used for flow cytometry. Glass-attached cells were washed with 137 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm NaPIPES, pH 6.8 (glutamate buffer, GB) and then exposed for 8 min at room temperature to SL-O at 0.4 IU/ml in GB, 3 mm EGTA. After permeabilization, cells were washed with GB free of soluble components and excess SL-O. Where indicated, cells were exposed to 20 μg LB/ml CB for 1 h before permeabilization and/or to 20 μg LB/ml GB, 100 μm EGTA for 10 min after permeabilization, both at room temperature. After the pretreatments, permeabilized cells were further incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm ATP, GB (in some experiments, ATP was omitted). LB, if present, was diluted by half to 10 μg/ml. Where indicated, free Ca2+ concentration was buffered by 3 mm Ca2+ EGTA buffer system, pH 6.8, calculated using appropriate dissociation constants as given by Martell and Smith (13Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1. Plenum Press, NY1974Google Scholar). Pretreatment of permeabilized cells with antibodies, anti-cofilin or anti-vinculin (both at 1:10 dilution), was performed before the addition of latrunculin B. To deplete ATP in intact cells, metabolic inhibitors, 6 mm deoxyglucose and 10 μmantimycin in CB, were applied at 30 °C for the indicated times. Cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde, 4% polyethylene glycol, 3 mmEGTA, GB; washed with 50 mm glycine, 100 μmEGTA, GB; and then exposed to a mild detergent, lysophosphatidylcholine (80 μg/ml), 100 μm EGTA, GB. Finally, cells were stained with either 0.3 μm rhodamine phalloidin (RP) (20 min) or with anti-β-actin (ABA, 1 h) or with anti-cofilin (1 h) all in 1 mm EGTA, GB (GBE). Blocking with 5% goat serum in GBE (20 min) and washing with GBE were performed before each step of the immunostaining. ABA was an affinity-purified monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15) from Sigma (used at 1/200 dilution), and it recognizes an N-terminal epitope. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we have found the AC-15 antibody to be truly β-actin-specific. AC-15 recognizes β-F-actin equally well as β-G-actin, and its binding to actin is unaffected either by cross-linking or by the interaction of actin with cofilin. Anti-human cofilin antibody (“9771”) was raised in rabbits against complexes of recombinant human cofilin (14Pope B.J. Gonsior S.M. Yeoh S. McGough A. Weeds A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and rabbit skeletal muscle. The complexes were prepared from F-actin mixed (∼1:1) with cofilin at pH 8.0 and centrifuged to remove residual F-actin. The cofilin antibodies were then affinity purified on Sepharose-cofilin and used at 1/50 dilution. The affinity of cofilin antibody for cofilin was unaffected by the interaction of cofilin with actin. The antibody binds equally well to cofilin and cofilin-actin complexes. Results of our antibody tests are available as Supplemental Material. The secondary antibodies (both at 1/50 dilution in GBE) were goat-anti-mouse IgG-biotin and goat-anti-rabbit-IgG-biotin, respectively, both from Sigma. Cy2-streptavidin (1/50, from Amersham Biosciences) was the tertiary layer. In double-label experiments, RP or ethidium bromide (EB, 0.5 μm) was added with the secondary antibody. This is particularly important for ABA + RP staining, since phalloidin was found to interfere with the ABA staining, while ABA did not seem to affect the staining with phalloidin. Stained cells were observed using an IX-70 inverted microscope (Olympus), fitted with an UltraVIEW confocal imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Cambridge, UK). This comprises a dual wavelength argon/krypton laser (Omnichrome) and a CSU-10 confocal scanning unit (Yokogawa, Japan). This system utilizes Nipkow discs to allow real-time confocal imaging. Digital images (mostly equatorial slices) were collected with no pixel binning, using a cooled 12-bit digital interline UltraPix FKI 1000 camera (G2) with 1008 × 1018 pixels (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Read-out speed was 0.5 MHz and sensitivity 0.72 electrons/gray level. Image capture was controlled by the software package “Ultraview” (“Spatial Module” configuration). For the detection of Cy2 fluorescence, excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was collected with a multiband-pass filter (transmitting between 500 and 540 nm). For the detection of RP or EB fluorescence, excitation was at 568 nm, and emission was collected between 580 and 620 nm. Olympus U Plan Apochromat 100× objective was used; images of equatorial slices that section nuclei are shown. Suspended intact cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with control buffer (0.25% Me2SO), LB (20 μg/ml), or, as a positive control, staurosporine (2 μm) + cyclohexamide (10 μg/ml), all in CB. Cells were then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V (FA, 1/100, NeXin Research), propidium iodide (PI, 2 μg/ml), 5 mm CaCl2, CB for 5 min at room temperature in the dark. Cell fluorescence was quantified using flow cytometry on EPICS Elite flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL) equipped with an argon-ion laser. Excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was collected at 525 nm for FA and at 575 nm for PI. Each sample contained 10,000–15,000 cells. Histogram was partitioned into four domains according to FA and PI fluorescence intensity. Duplicate samples of 10,000–15,000 cells were analyzed per condition. Samples of cell fractions were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide vertical slab gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed with an ABA (1/2000) followed by goat anti-mouse antibody (1/2000) as described (16Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44918) Google Scholar) and finally developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All figures shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. Resting RPMC, stained for filamentous actin with RP, exhibited only the prominent rings of cortical actin with no internal structures visible (Fig. 1, top left panel). Staining with a monoclonal ABA gave somewhat different results; in addition to the cortex, punctate internal foci were visible together with low levels of perinuclear, sometimes nuclear, staining (Fig. 1, top right panel, and Fig. 7,top left panel). No staining was observed in the absence of the primary antibody (not shown). RPMC contain about 2.6 ng total actin per 106 cells (as determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels (17Koffer A. Tatham P.E.R. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); densitometry of Western blots after ABA staining produced a value of 2.3 ng/106 cells (not shown). The close agreement indicates that most of the actin in mast cells is β-actin. The cortical staining disappeared within 10 min of LB treatment (Fig. 1); ABA-stained cells showed stronger diffuse staining throughout the cell due to the increase in the monomer concentration, and in some cells, intense nuclear staining was already apparent. The proportion of cells with nuclear actin increased with the time of treatment and this was also true for RP-stained cells, although with a discernible delay. After 60 min with LB, most cells exhibited nuclear actin, stained by both RP and ABA.Figure 7ATP depletion induces translocation of actin into the nuclei of intact mast cells. Intact cells were treated with metabolic inhibitors (6 mm deoxyglucose and 10 μm antimycin in CB) for the indicated times (minutes) at 30 °C. Cells were stained with ABA after fixation.Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After 1-h treatment of intact cells with 20 μg of LB/ml, RP staining decreases by 60–70%; secretion from these cells is inhibited by about 40%, and the effect is fully reversible (1Pendleton A. Koffer A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 48: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane of these cells remains intact as indicated by Bodipy-sphingomyelin staining (18Koffer A. Williams M. Johansen T. Cell Biol. Int. 2002; 26: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Consequently it is unlikely that nuclear actin is associated with apoptotic cells. To confirm that actin changes were not linked to apoptosis, LB-treated cells were stained with FA and PI and examined using flow cytometry (Table I). Annexin V marks the early stage of apoptosis (hi FA-low PI), it binds with high affinity to phosphaphatidyl serine, which appears on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during the early stages of programmed cell death. During the mid-late stages of apoptosis, membrane integrity is lost allowing propidium iodide to associate with DNA (hi FA-hi PI). Treating cells with staurosporine and cycloheximide, agents known to induce apoptosis (19Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), provided a positive control. After 2 h of LB treatment, there was no increase in the proportion of early or mid-apoptotic cells.Table IProportion of apoptotic cells after LB treatmentHealthy cellsEarly apoptoticMid-lateapoptoticBroken cells%%%%Fluorescence intensityLow FA-low PIHi FA-low PIHi FA-hi PILow FA-hi PIControl80.75.510.23.6LB90.23.85.10.9Stauro + CHI58.622.618.00.8 Open table in a new tab SL-O, a bacterial exotoxin, binds to membrane cholesterol and then oligomerizes to form pores with a diameter up to 30 nm, allowing passage of proteins of molecular weight up to 400 kDa (Ref. 20Holt M. Koffer A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 356-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references within). Permeabilized mast cells retain integrity of their cellular architecture and respond to stimulation by calcium and/or GTPγS (12Howell T.W. Gomperts B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as well as to the activation of cell surface receptors (21Cunningham E. Thomas G.M.H. Ball A. Hiles I. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After permeabilization, cytosolic components gradually leak out of the cells. Using ABA and Western blotting, we have found that about 60% of cellular actin leaks out within 15 min. This is in good agreement with our previous determination of actin leakage by densitometry of Coommassie Blue-stained gels (17Koffer A. Tatham P.E.R. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The leakage was increased to ∼95% in the presence of LB, and no such increase was seen in the presence of cytochalasin (not shown). Mast cells, permeabilized under control conditions (8 min with streptolysin-O, washed with GB followed by a 20-min exposure to 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm ATP, GB) showed either none or very weak nuclear staining with RP or ABA, respectively (Fig.2A, Control). Cortical staining was clearly visible, but occasionally (see Fig.2A, top left panel), a few spontaneously degranulating cells could be seen with filamentous actin around secretory granules. When intact cells were pretreated for 1 h with LB and then permeabilized in its absence, many cells retained nuclear actin, stained by both RP and ABA (Fig. 2A, LB → SL-O). It is noteworthy that actin translocation into nuclei occurred also when LB was applied after the permeabilization (Fig.2A, SL-O → LB); in this case most of the nuclear actin was not stained by phalloidin. LB treatment both before and after permeabilization resulted in the appearance of nuclear actin in all cells (Fig. 2A, LB → SL-O → LB), but only a proportion was recognized by phalloidin (Fig. 2B). Distinct dot-like nuclear actin structures were apparent, particularly when the LB → SL-O → LB protocol was used (Fig. 2B), and they could be seen on all Z axis confocal slices throughout the nuclei (taken 0.2 μm apart along the z axis; not shown). Differential interference contrast microscopy showed that these dot structures lie close to and within the nuclear envelope, concentrically with the structure seen in the middle of the nucleus, presumably a nucleolus (Fig.3A). The nuclear structures could be visualized with a DNA/RNA stain, EB, and actin was excluded from these EB-stained domains (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Nuclear actin is localized into areas of low DNA/RNA density. Mast cells were exposed for 1 h to LB (20 μg/ml), permeabilized, and treated for 10 min with LB (20 μg/ml) in GB, 100 μm EGTA (protocol LB → SL-O → LB). Cells were then further incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 3 mm ATP, 3 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml LB in GB, fixed, and stained with RP (A) or double-stained with 0.5 μm EB and ABA (B). Bar = 5 μm. The nucleus is clearly visible in the differential interference contrast image; RP staining is concentric with the structure seen in the middle of the nucleus. The intense EB staining does not co-localize with actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cofilin, a small actin-binding protein, has previously been reported to enter nuclei together with actin after a heat shock (4Iida K. Matsumoto S. Yahara I. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Nishida E. Iida K. Yonezawa N. Koyasu S. Yahara I. Sakai H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5262-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To establish whether F-actin disassembly induces nuclear entry of cofilin concomitantly with that of actin, the presence of this protein in control and LB-treated cells was studied using an affinity-purified anti-cofilin. Intact cells exhibited diffuse staining throughout the cell with some cells showing low levels of nuclear staining (Fig. 4A,bottom left panel). No staining was observed in the absence of the primary antibody except for the few cells, most probably those that have degranulated spontaneously (not shown); such cells with artificial high staining are also visible in Fig. 4. There was a significant increase in anti-cofilin staining of the nuclei of intact cells after LB treatment (Fig. 4A, bottom right panel). In parallel, actin presence in the nuclei of LB-treated cells was revealed by ABA (Fig. 4A, top panels). Cofilin entry into nuclei could also be induced in permeabilized cells. Cells, that were treated with LB after their permeabilization (protocol SL-O → LB), exhibited stronger nuclear staining with both anti-cofilin (Fig. 4B, bottom panels) and with ABA (Fig. 4B, top panels) relative to control cells. The permeabilized cell system, with its capacity to support nuclear entry of both actin and cofilin, provides a good opportunity to examine whether cofilin is required for latrunculin B-induced nuclear accumulation of actin. The 9771 cofilin antibody is entirely specific for cofilin and is able to bind cofilin both free and when complexed to actin (see Supplemental Material). The antibody was introduced into permeabilized cells prior to latrunculin B treatment and anti-vinculin was used as a control. As expected, control cells exhibited actin cortex and very low levels of nuclear/perinuclear staining (Fig. 5A). In the absence of any antibody (Fig. 5B) or in the presence of the control antibody, anti-vinculin (Fig. 5C), LB caused cortical actin disassembly and an increase in nuclear actin. In the presence of anti-cofilin, LB induced cortical actin disassembly but failed to induce nuclear accumulation actin (Fig. 5D). A small proportion of permeabilized cells exhibit nuclear or perinuclear staining with ABA even under control conditions (Fig.6A, top right paneland see also Figs. 2A, 4B, and 5A). This staining increased considerably when cells were maintained in the absence of ATP (Fig. 6A, bottom right panel). Phalloidin did not recognize this nuclear actin, but RP staining of the cortex was somewhat increased in the absence of ATP (Fig.6A, bottom left panel). Flow cytometric assay of RP fluorescence showed the relative F-actin level of cells maintained in the absence of ATP to increase by 5–10% relative to those with ATP (not shown). This is also reflected by a stronger cortical staining by ABA of cells without ATP (compare the two right panels in Fig. 6, A and B). Immunofluorescence with anti-cofilin of cells exposed to EGTA in the presence and absence of ATP revealed that ATP in permeabilized cells was also crucial for preventing accumulation of nuclear cofilin (Fig.6B, left panels). Calcium (pCa 5) and GTPγS, two agents capable of promoting secretion from permeabilized mast cells, did not seem to have any significant effect on cofilin localization (not shown). A small decrease in nuclear staining was occasionally apparent in GTPγS-treated cells, but the effect was marginal. Likewise, nuclear staining of actin with ABA was somewhat reduced in the presence of GTPγS (not shown). The main determinant of cofilin nuclear localization was absence of ATP, and the same was true for actin. Excepting the nuclei, the staining with anti-cofilin was dispersed throughout the cell, and no increase in the cortical staining was apparent in the absence of ATP, unlike that with ABA (Fig.6B). Treatment of intact mast cells with inhibitors of glycolysis (6 mm deoxyglucose) and oxidative phosphorylation (10 μm antimycin) causes depletion of ATP; concentrations of ATP are reduced to <5% and <1% of the original level (∼2.3 mm) within 10 and 20 min at 30 °C, respectively (22Koffer A. Churcher Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that these inhibitors induced translocation of actin into nuclei. This was already apparent after 20-min treatment and became very prominent with increasing time. Nuclear actin was not recognized by phalloidin (not shown). Again, cortical actin staining increased progressively with the time of metabolic inhibition. Permeabilization did not eliminate the presence of the punctate internal foci stained by ABA. In fact, they were visible more clearly in permeabilized than in intact cells, and this must be due to the leakage of soluble actin and therefore to a higher signal/noise ratio. At higher magnification, these foci could be seen throughout the cell, as if delineating cellular organelles/structures (Fig. 6C, right panel; see also Fig. 2A, control cells, bottom left panel). Examination of a stack of confocal slices (taken 0.2 μm apart along the z axis) has shown the foci of actin to be present at all planes (not shown). After latrunculin B treatment, these foci are less prominent, especially when LB was applied both before and after permeabilization (Fig. 2A, bottom right panel). This paper demonstrates cofilin-dependent translocation of actin into nuclei of mast cells exposed to two different stress-related conditions: 1) latrunculin B-induced disassembly of cortical F-actin and 2) ATP depletion, associated with an increase in F-actin. Latrunculins destabilize actin filaments by binding to G-actin at the site adjacent to the nucleotide-binding cleft (23Belmont L.D. Patterson G.M.L. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1325-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 24Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 25Yarmola E.G.

This prevents the re-incorporation of actin into filaments and depletes cellular F-actin over a period of time; the rate of this process depends on the rate of filament turnover (26Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 27Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytochalasins, the most frequently used actin-destabilizing drugs, bind to the barbed ends of filaments and prevent elongation and shortening from these ends. Cytochalasins inhibit polymerization of actin in response to cell activation but usually do not deplete cellular F-actin. Indeed, we have not seen any reduction in RP staining of resting mast cells, intact or permeabilized, in response to cytochalasin (not shown). It is remarkable that LB could induce accumulation of n"

As the expression of the gene for this enzyme is nearly silent in liver tissue, we tested the possibility that DNA methylation/demethylation events may be involved in its regulation. Initial studies employing methylation restriction endonuclease analysis provided evidence for differential methylation patterns for the HKII gene in normal hepatocytes and hepatoma cells, the latter represented by a highly glycolytic model cell line (AS-30D). Subsequently, sequencing following sodium bisulfite treatment revealed 18 methylated CpG sites within a CpG island (−350 to +781 bp) in the hepatocyte gene but none in that of the hepatoma. In addition, treatment of a hepatocyte cell line with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, 5′-azacytidine and 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, activated basal expression levels of HKII mRNA and protein. Finally, stably transfecting the hepatocyte cell line with DNA demethylase also resulted in activating the basal expression levels of HKII mRNA and protein. These novel observations indicate that one of the initial events in activating the HKII gene during either transformation or tumor progression may reside at the epigenetic level.

The Metabolism of Tumors. Arnold Constable, London1930Google Scholar, 2Aisenberg A.C. The Glycolysis and Respiration of Tumors. Academic Press, New York1961Google Scholar, 3Pedersen P.L. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 1978; 22: 190-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This aberrant metabolism serves well the goal of the cancer cell to proliferate both by maintaining a constant supply of energy even when oxygen levels decrease and by providing enhanced levels of biosynthetic precursors. Thus, the transformation/progression process that ultimately leads to the high glycolytic tumor phenotype provides the tumor with a metabolic advantage over its normal tissue of origin. Significantly, we have demonstrated in earlier studies the essential role that hexokinase plays in sustaining the high glycolytic tumor phenotype (4Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 5Bustamante E. Morris H.P. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8699-8704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), particularly the type II isoform that becomes markedly elevated in rapidly growing, highly malignant hepatomas (6Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar,7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These experimental observations are dramatic considering that liver normally expresses glucokinase (type IV “highKm” hexokinase), whereas the type II “lowKm” form is nearly silent (7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, within a poorly differentiated hepatoma, the expression of HKII1 may be elevated more than 100-fold (6Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the type IV enzyme is undetectable (6Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar, 8Parry D.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1094-10912Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Thus, in the transformation/progression process the genetic machinery has been directed to completely down-regulate the expression of type IV hexokinase and markedly up-regulate that of HKII. The major advantages of doing this are 2-fold (9Pedersen P.L. Mathupala S. Rempel A. Geschwind J.F. Ko Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), one of which is to enhance the glycolytic rate. This role is served optimally by HKII as it has a high affinity for ATP and binds to outer mitochondrial membrane porin (10Nakashima R.A. Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) where it has more ready access to ATP for phosphorylating glucose (11Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is less sensitive to both product inhibition (4Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and proteolytic degradation (12Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The second advantage is that, by binding to the mitochondria, HKII acts as an antiapoptotic factor (13Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), thus protecting the cancer cells against death signals and promoting their immortality. In a program designed to elucidate the molecular basis for the marked activation of HKII in rapidly growing hepatomas, we have employed the AS-30D cell line growing in ascites form in the peritoneal cavity of rats. This is a hepatocellular carcinoma line derived originally from a solid liver tumor induced by feeding rats the carcinogen dimethylaminoazobenzene (14Chang J.P. Gibley Jr., C.W. Ichinoe K. Cancer Res. 1967; 27: 2065-2071PubMed Google Scholar, 15Smith D.F. Walborg Jr., E.F. Chang J.P. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2306-2309PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line exhibits the high glycolytic phenotype characteristic of aggressive tumors (4Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and contains markedly elevated levels of both HKII mRNA (7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and the expressed enzyme bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane (4Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 11Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From this cell line we have isolated the HKII promoter (4.3 kb) and shown that it is quite promiscuous in its activation response to a number of physiological agents or conditions (7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16Mathupala S.P. Heese C. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

These include hypoxia, glucose, dibutyryl cAMP, a phorbol ester, mutated p53, and the opposing hormones insulin and glucagon. Furthermore, fluorescencein situ hybridization analysis showed that the HKII gene is located on a single rat chromosome where it is amplified at least 5-fold without noticeable chromosomal aberrations or rearrangements (19Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we have sequenced the normal rat liver promoter and found that it is about 99% identical to the AS-30D hepatoma promoter (GenBankTM accession number AY082375), rendering it unlikely that liver versus hepatoma differences in HKII expression are related to differences in the nucleotide sequence of the two promoters. Although the above studies demonstrated that a combination of gene amplification and transcriptional events contribute significantly to the marked expression of HKII in highly glycolytic hepatoma cells, they fail to explain why the expression of the enzyme is nearly silent in normal liver (7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings, and the recent progress in the study of the role of epigenetic factors in the silencing and activation of genes (20Attwood J.T. Yung R.L. Richardson B.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 21Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar, 22Leonhardt H. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 35 (suppl.): 78-83Crossref Google Scholar), led us to generate a working hypothesis. Stated simply, our hypothesis envisions that methylation/demethylation events may be involved in regulating HKII gene expression in hepatocytes and highly malignant hepatomas. The results of experiments described below provide substantial support for this working hypothesis. Rats (Sprague-Dawley, female) were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Their care and experimental use was approved by and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of The Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee. Rat hepatocytes, freshly prepared by the collagenase perfusion method (23Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique. 2nd Ed. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Anna Mae Diehl, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The normal rat liver (clone 9) cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection) were grown in 90% DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) with 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The clone 9 cells were maintained in the exponential growth phase at all times with subculture every 48 h at 1:5 dilution. AS-30D hepatoma cells were grown in the peritoneal cavity of female Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) and were harvested from the ascites fluid 6–7 days post-transplantation as described earlier (6Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The genomic DNA was obtained from freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and AS-30D hepatoma cells using a genomic DNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The rat hepatocyte and hepatoma genomic DNA (30 μg) were digested to completion with different methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, BstUI,HhaI, HpaII, EagI, and ClaI (New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The digested DNA was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and subsequently depurinated (0.25 n HCl) for 20 min, denatured (1.5m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH) for 30 min, and neutralized (0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl) for 30 min. The gel was subsequently soaked in 10× SSC (1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 30 min and transferred overnight onto a nylon membrane using TurboblotterTM rapid downward transfer system (Schleicher & Schuell). On the following day, the DNA was fixed onto the membrane by UV cross-linking and hybridized with the 4.3-kb HKII promoter and associated first exon and first intron (7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The full-length HKII promoter (7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was used to prepare the probe usingGene Images random prime labeling module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The blot was prehybridized with buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% w/v SDS, 5% w/v dextran sulfate) at 60 °C for 30 min. The blot was hybridized with a heat-denatured labeled HKII probe (10 ng/ml) at 60 °C for 16–18 h. After stringency washes at 60 °C (once with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS; once with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS), the methylation-sensitive restriction fragments of the HKII promoter were detected using Gene Images CDP-Star detection module according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA under conditions where the 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. Thus, all cytosine residues remaining after PCR amplification and sequencing represent cytosines that were methylated in the original DNA sequence. The genomic DNA was isolated from freshly isolated rat hepatocyte and AS-30D hepatoma cells using a genomic DNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA (10 μg) was digested to completion by BglII (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C and purified using a Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega). The bisulfite reaction was carried out for 16–18 h at 50 °C, pH 5.0, on 1 μg ofBglII-digested genomic DNA from either rat hepatocytes or AS-30D cells using CpGenomeTM DNA modification kit (Intergen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The modified DNA was finally eluted in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and stored at −20 °C for up to 1 month. PCR amplifications were performed using the HotStarTaqTM PCR kit (Qiagen). Sodium bisulfite-treated DNA (100 ng) was amplified in a 50-μl reaction mix containing 200 μm each of the four dNTPs, 30 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer, 1× Q solution, and 2.5 units of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). All reagents used were those supplied with the kit. The sequences of strand-specific primers containing the modified cytosine bases together with the annealing temperature used for the amplification of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA are summarized in Table I. The general hotstart thermal cycler program used for all the reactions was as follows: 95 °C for 15 min × 1 cycle; 94 °C for 1 min, 48 or 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min × 40 cycles; 72 °C for 10 min × 1 cycle. The PCR fragments amplified from rat hepatocyte and AS-30D hepatoma modified DNA were cloned using pCR®2.1 TA Cloning® kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The positive clones were sequenced in the Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility, Department of Biological Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. To test the efficiency of bisulfite conversion, the modified DNA was PCR-amplified using modified primers specific for HKII and digested with the restriction enzymes ApoI (R↓AATT↑Y) orTsp509I (↓AATT↑) (New England Biolabs) that cut only modified DNA. These restriction enzyme sites are only generated when cytosine residues are modified to thymidine residues. Subsequently, the efficiency of bisulfite conversion is assessed by complete digestion of a PCR fragment by ApoI orTsp509I. Clone 9 hepatocyte cells that predominantly express high Km glucokinase were used in this study. These cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum as detailed before. The test populations of cells were treated with either 2.5 and 5 μm 5′azaC (Sigma) or 2.5 and 5 μm 5′azadC (Sigma). The cells were harvested after 96 and 120 h of drug treatment, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy® kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using TITANIUMTM One-Step RT-PCR kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (1 μg) from each test sample was used for multiplex RT-PCR in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tricine, 20 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 20 units of recombinant RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 20 pmol each of the HKII-specific primers: HKRTF (5′-GTGTGCTCCGAGTAAGGGTGAC-3′, sense, position 469–490 of HKII cDNA) and HKRTR (5′-CGGTTCGGATGTCATTGAGTG-3′, antisense, position 1023 to 1003 of HKII cDNA), 5 pmol of rat β-actin-specific primers for an internal control: RACTBF (5′-ATATCGCTGCGCTCGTCGTC-3′, sense, position 11–30 of rat β-actin cDNA) and RACTBR (5′-ATCCTGTCAGCGATGCCTGG-3′, antisense, position 938 to 919 of rat β-actin cDNA), and 1× RT-TITANIUMTM TaqEnzyme mix (containing MMLV-RT mutant, TITANIUMTMTaqDNA polymerase and TaqStart antibody). The PCR cycling parameters were 50 °C for 1 h × 1 cycle; 94 °C for 5 min × 1 cycle; 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min × 30 cycles; 68 °C for 2 min × 1 cycle. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. Clone 9 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/150-mm dish and treated with DNMT inhibitors: 5′azaC (2.5 and 5 μm) and 5′azadC (2.5 and 5 μm) for 120 h as described earlier. Total cell lysate (100 μg) from each test sample was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, the proteins on the gel were transferred in the cold onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% v/v methanol, pH 11) at 100 V/2 h. The membranes were then blocked for overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, 136 mm NaCl, 0.15% Tween 20, pH 7.6), incubated with rabbit anti-HKII polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 22 °C for 1 h, followed by 1 h of incubation with a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, HKII protein was detected by an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA demethylase (dMTase) cDNA, a kind gift from Dr. M. Szyf (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), had been cloned previously in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1/His (Invitrogen) containing neomycin for selection of stable transfectants (24Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Clone 9 cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, as described earlier. The cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. The dMTase expression construct (2 μg) was transfected per well using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection for 48 h, the cells were split 1:10 in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin®)-selective antibiotic (Invitrogen). The cells (CRLdM) were selected on G418 for 14 days, and viable colonies were expanded for further experiments. The GenBankTM accession numbers for the rat HKII promoter sequence from normal liver and hepatoma cells (AS-30D) are AY082375 andU19605, respectively. As an initial test of our hypothesis that methylation/demethylation events may be involved in regulating HKII gene expression in normal liver and hepatoma cells, we carried out a search for CpG dinucleotide rich “CpG islands” using computer algorithm “CpG Island Finder” (25Takai D. Jones P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3740-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Such islands frequently contain methylated cytosines in repressed genes (20Attwood J.T. Yung R.L. Richardson B.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 21Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar, 22Leonhardt H. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 35 (suppl.): 78-83Crossref Google Scholar). Significantly, a high density of CpG dinucleotides was found in a response element-rich region straddling the transcription start site (Fig.1A). This region (−350 to +781 bp) shown in Fig. 1B contains 58.5% GC content with CGobs/CGexp ratio >0.8 and fits the criteria attributed to a classical CpG island (26Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J.

This finding applies to both normal liver and the AS-30D model hepatoma as they show >99% sequence identity (GenBankTM accession numbers AY082375 andU19605). The above analysis identifying a CpG island (−350 to +781 bp) in the HKII promoter raised the question as to whether this segment and perhaps other regions of the promoter are differentially methylated in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. For this reason, we subjected genomic DNA obtained from freshly isolated hepatocytes and AS-30D cells to digestion with several methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (BstUI,HhaI, HpaII, EagI, andClaI). The fully digested genomic DNA was subjected to Southern blot hybridization using a probe containing the 4.3-kb HKII promoter with first exon and intron (7Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). With only one exception (EagI), the results obtained (Fig.2) clearly showed more bands in the lanes containing restriction enzyme-digested hepatoma DNA than hepatocyte DNA (compare lanes 1 and 2; 3 and4; 5 and 6; and 9 and10). Moreover, the bands were in different positions in all cases. Thus, these findings strongly implicate hypermethylation of the HKII promoter in hepatocyte genomic DNA as compared with hepatoma DNA. Also, lanes containing digested hepatoma DNA showed much more intense bands than lanes containing the same amount of hepatocyte DNA consistent with our earlier work showing HKII gene amplification in the AS-30D hepatoma cell line (19Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). The observations noted above provided the impetus for subjecting the HKII CpG island (−350 to +781 bp) to sodium bisulfite modification/sequence analyses. Sodium bisulfite converts cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA under conditions whereby 5-methylcytosine remains non-reactive. After PCR amplification and sequencing, all cytosines that remain are the ones that were originally methylated. Results presented in Fig. 3, Aand B, provide examples of how these analyses were conducted for the HKII CpG island in hepatocyte and hepatoma DNA, whereas Fig.4 provides a complete accounting of methylated and unmethylated sites in these two cases. Specifically, data presented in Fig. 3A verify that the efficiency of sodium bisulfite treatment of hepatocyte and hepatoma DNA is nearly 100% (“Experimental Procedures”). Thus, examination of lanes 1–6 show that HKII DNA when untreated with bisulfite exhibits a single band (lane 1), which is unaffected by digestion with restrictions enzyme, Tsp509I (↓AATT↑) andApoI (↓AATT↑Y) (lanes 2 and 3). However, when the DNA is modified with bisulfite, Tsp509I completely cuts the DNA to give a smaller fragment (lane 6, arrow), showing nearly 100% efficiency of conversion to this site in bisulfite-modified DNA. Lanes 7–12 present an identical type of control experiment for the hepatoma HKII DNA, comparelanes 10 and 12 (arrow). In experiments not presented here, where a different set of PCR products were generated after bisulfite treatment, the other selected restriction enzyme (ApoI) also completely cleaved the modified but not the unmodified DNA. In all experiments, prior to performing any DNA sequence analysis, the efficiency of bisulfite conversion was assessed, with sequencing being performed only when conversion was complete or very near completion.Figure 4Summary of methylation analysis of the CpG island located in the rat HKII gene in the region encompassing the transcription initiation site. Each strand of sodium bisulfite-treated genomic DNA from rat hepatocyte and hepatoma (AS-30D) cells was PCR-amplified using appropriate sets of modified PCR primers as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Subsequently, the PCR products were cloned in pCR® 2.1 vector and sequenced using a M13R primer from the vector backbone. Upper panel, schematic representation of hypermethylated CpG dinucleotides in the rat HKII CpG island. The primary sequence of the HKII CpG island is shown with all CpG dinucleotides marked as vertical lines. The putative motifs for binding of different transcription factors in this CpG island are also shown. Information about the primers used for the amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA and the region amplified are given in Table I. The black circles represent the CpG dinucleotides that show different methylation patterns in the hepatocyte and hepatoma HKII CpG island. The position of CpG dinucleotide with respect to the transcription initiation site has been marked below each black circle. The bent arrow denotes the transcription initiation site. Middleand lower panels, the methylation profile of the HKII gene within the CpG island found in rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. The methylation profile of 15 individual, bisulfite-treated clones from hepatocytes (middle panel) and hepatomas (lower panel) is shown. Only the CpG dinucleotides that show differences in methylation between hepatocyte and hepatoma cells have been depicted in the figure. The remaining CpG sites do not show any differences in their methylation pattern between rat hepatocyte and hepatoma cells (data not shown). The open circles represent unmethylated CpGs, and the black circles represent methylated CpGs.

Here certain cytosines in the hepatocyte HKII CpG island remained unmodified by bisulfite (Fig. 3B, upper panel), implicating methylation, whereas the corresponding regions in the hepatoma CpG island were modified (G/C →A) implicating the absence of methylation (Fig.3B, lower panel). In a more detailed analysis of the CpG island containing 90 potential methylation sites (Fig. 4, A and B), 18 sites (CpG−294, CpG−291, CpG−266, CpG−226, CpG−202, CpG−164, CpG−70, CpG−55, CpG+101, CpG+142, CpG+155, CpG+167, CpG+172, CpG+387, CpG+540, CpG+560, CpG+572, and CpG+717) were found to be methylated to varying degrees in hepatocytes. In sharp contrast, no methylation was observed in the entire CpG island of hepatoma HKII. The remaining 72 CpG sites in the CpG island of the HKII gene showed no methylation in hepatocytes or hepatoma cells. In addition to the above, two other observations of potential interest emerged from these analyses. First, in the hepatocyte CpG island, the CpG sites downstream to the transcription initiation site (CpG+387, CpG+540, CpG+560, CpG+572, and CpG+717) showed higher degrees of DNA methylation (26–75%) as compared with the"

PP1, 4- amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyramidine constitutes a family of serine/threonine kinases that play key roles in signal transduction by receptors coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis (1Dempsey E.C.

The basic primary structure of all PKC isozymes consists of a single polypeptide chain with N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal catalytic domains. PKC isoforms are subdivided into three distinct subfamilies based upon structural differences in their N-terminal regulatory domains. Conventional PKC isoforms (cPKCs) contain an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain followed by two membrane-targeting modules, the C1 domain that binds diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine (PS) and the C2 domain that binds anionic lipids in a calcium-dependent manner. Novel PKC (nPKC) isoforms lack the C2 domain and are maximally activated by diacylglycerol/phorbol ester in the absence of calcium; atypical PKCs are regulated by lipids but are not activated by calcium and diacylglycerol. Current models of PKC isoform activation focus largely on the allosteric changes that are induced by cofactor binding to N-terminal membrane-targeting modules; these conformational changes expel the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain from the substrate binding pocket, relieve autoinhibition, and allow PKC to phosphorylate target substrates. protein kinase C conventional protein kinase C dominant negative human embryonic kidney norepinephrine novel protein kinase C phosphoinositide-dependent kinase phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate phosphoserine phosphatidylserine phosphothreonine ribosomal S6 kinase wild type. PP1, 4- amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyramidine In addition to allosteric activation mechanisms, recent studies identify a series of ordered “priming” phosphorylations that convert nascent PKC isoforms into the mature forms that reside in the cytosol and can be activated by diacylglycerol and calcium (2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The focus of most studies has been on cPKC isoform phosphorylations in heterologous expression systems. Here, the first of three sequential phosphorylations is at a conserved threonine in the activation loop and is under the control of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK-1) (3Balendran A. Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). According to current models, activation loop phosphorylation introduces a negative charge that critically aligns residues in the catalytic site and is required for catalytic competence of the enzyme. This enables two subsequent phosphorylations at conserved residues in the C-terminal V5 domain (a predicted autophosphorylation in a proline-flanked “turn motif” and an additional phosphorylation in a hydrophobic FXXFS/TF/Y motif 19 residues C-terminal to the turn motif). Phosphorylations at these two C-terminal sites are believed to lock the enzyme in a closed, catalytically competent, stabilized, and protease/phosphatase-resistant conformation (2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 5Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28496-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Although nPKC isoforms undergo a series of equivalent priming phosphorylations, there has been only limited progress defining the order of these phosphorylation events, the identity of the regulatory kinase(s) that operate on the activation loop and C-terminal sites, and the consequences of multisite phosphorylations on nPKC isoforms. Current concepts regarding nPKC isoform phosphorylation mechanisms are based largely on studies of serum-deprived cells maintained in suspension culture because nPKC isoforms remain highly phosphorylated in most adherent cell types grown in the presence of serum (6Parekh D. Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34758-34764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, in the course of studies on adherent neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures, we identified dynamically regulated serine/threonine phosphorylations of PKCδ and PKCε which accompany ligand-dependent PKC activation. Given the paucity of information regarding the regulation of nPKC phosphorylation in differentiated cell types (including cardiomyocytes) and the importance of nPKC isoforms as components of the signaling pathways leading to hypertrophy, apoptosis, and ischemic preconditioning in the heart, this study examines the regulation and consequences of nPKC isoform phosphorylations in cardiomyocytes. Antibodies against total and phosphorylated forms of PKC were from the following sources. Phospho-PKC-Pan, PKCδ-pS643, and PKCδ-pT505 were from Cell Signaling Technology. PKCα and PKCε were from Invitrogen. PKCδ was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The PKCδ substrate peptide (δ-peptide) and the PKCε substrate peptide (ε-peptide) were purchased from Calbiochem and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. PMA was from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rats by a trypsin dispersion procedure according to a protocol that incorporates a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiomyocytes followed by irradiation as described previously (7Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 40-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of cardiomyocytes typically is 2.5–3 × 106 cells/neonatal ventricle. Cells were plated on protamine sulfate-coated culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Experiments were performed on cultures grown for 5 days in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then serum-deprived for the subsequent 24 h. PKC overexpression was accomplished as described previously (8Braz J.C. Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Molkentin J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocyte infections were for 2 h with adenoviral vectors that contain nearly the full-length Ad5 genome (lacking regions E1 and E3) and a cytomegalovirus promoter driving expression of wild-type or dominant negative mouse PKCδ (K436R substitution at the ATP binding site of the catalytic domain), wild-type or dominant negative rabbit PKCε (analogous K376R substitution at the ATP binding), or β-galactosidase (as a control). Protein extracts were prepared 24 h later, in some experiments after a 15-min treatment with 200 nm PMA or vehicle. Immunoblot analysis was performed on whole cell extracts or soluble and particulate fractions prepared according to methods described previously (9Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then transferred immediately to ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 48 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mmNaF); cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant was saved as the soluble fraction. PKC isoforms were extracted from the pellets by incubation on ice for 10 min in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Electrophoresis was on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with a panel of antibodies that recognize total PKCα, PKCδ, or PKCε protein expression (identified previously as the phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms expressed by cardiomyocyte cultures (9Rybin V.O.

The specificity of the anti-PKC antibodies has been established previously (10Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); the specificity of all anti-phospho-PKC antibodies was validated in control experiments showing that anti-phospho-PKC immunoreactivity is stripped by treatment of samples with alkaline phosphatase (data not shown) and is down-regulated along with PMA-dependent down-regulation of the cognate protein (see Fig. 3). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, with each panel in each figure from a single gel exposed for a uniform duration.Figure 3The kinetics of PMA-dependent translocation and phosphorylation of phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms. Cardiomyocytes were pretreated for 60 min with vehicle or 5 μm GF109203X followed by stimulation with vehicle or 100 nm PMA for the indicated intervals. Immunoblot analysis was on soluble and particulate fractions with antibodies that recognize total PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε as well as anti-phospho-PKC-Pan and anti-PKCδ-pT505 as described in Fig. 2. Similar results were obtained in three experiments performed on separate culture preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After incubation with the compounds indicated in the figures, cells were lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin A, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2% Triton X-100). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 1,500 ×g. For immunoprecipitation, supernatant from five 100-mm dishes was incubated with 5 μg of anti-PKCδ antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 200 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl) and suspended in 1.15 ml of storage buffer (18 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1.8 mm EDTA, 1.8 mm EGTA, 0.45 mm dithiothreitol, 225 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitates (from 0.3 mg of protein assay) were used in immunocomplex kinase assays carried out in 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing buffer (26 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm EGTA, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 10 μm PP1, and 0.25 mmdithiothreitol) in the absence and presence of 80 μg/ml PS plus 160 ng/ml PMA with 0.5 mg/ml histone III-S, 50 μmε-peptide, or 50 μm δ-peptide as substrate. ε-Peptide is a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the pseudosubstrate domain of PKCε, with a phosphorylatable serine for alanine substitution (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV). δ-Peptide is a highly specific PKCδ substrate that corresponds to amino acids 422–443 of murine eEF-1α (RFAVRDMRQTVAVGVIKAVDKK). Reactions were initiated by the addition 13 μCi of 66 μm [γ-32P]ATP and were performed in quadruplicate at 30 °C for 16 min. Assays were terminated by placing samples on ice followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. 40 μl of supernatant was spotted onto phosphocellulose filter papers (P-81), which were immediately dropped into water, washed five times for 5 min, and counted for radioactivity. Pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for PKCδ to normalize for any minor differences in immunoprecipitated enzyme. PKC phosphorylation is increasingly recognized as a mechanism to regulate cPKC targeting and catalytic activity. However, there is still only limited information on the inputs that promote nPKC phosphorylation or its importance as a mechanism to regulate nPKC targeting and activity; PKC isoform phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes has never been considered. Therefore, PKC isoform phosphorylation was examined in cardiomyocyte cultures at rest and after stimulation with PMA. Fig. 2A shows that anti-phospho-PKC-Pan (an antibody that recognizes phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms phosphorylated at the conserved hydrophobic motif) identifies three major bands that comigrate with PKCδ, PKCα, and PKCε (∼78, 82, and 96 kDa, respectively), corresponding to PKCδ phosphorylated at Ser662, PKCα phosphorylated at Ser657, and PKCε phosphorylated at Ser729. Atypical PKC isoforms contain an acidic Glu in place of the Ser phosphoacceptor site in the hydrophobic motif and are not detected by the anti-phospho-PKC-Pan antibody (2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The most prominent immunoreactive species detected with anti-phospho-PKC-Pan in resting cardiomyocyte cultures corresponds to PKCα; PKCα-Ser657 phosphorylation is not detectably altered by PMA. PKCδ phosphorylation at the hydrophobic domain (Ser662) is also detected in quiescent cardiomyocyte cultures; treatment with PMA slows the migration of PKCδ in SDS-PAGE (characteristic of a phosphorylation-induced change in electrophoretic mobility) but induces little to no increase in hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. This suggests that PMA promotes PKCδ phosphorylation at a site that is distinct from Ser662. Therefore, immunoblot analysis also was performed with antibodies that recognize PKCδ phosphorylated at Ser643 in the turn motif (anti-PKCδ-pS643) or Thr505 in the activation loop (anti-PKCδ-pT505). Fig. 2A shows that PKCδ-pS643 immunoreactivity is similar in quiescent and PMA-stimulated cultures (i.e. PKCδ phosphorylations at the C-terminal turn and hydrophobic motifs are relatively stable modifications that are not influenced by PMA-dependent activation). In contrast, there is little to no PKCδ-pT505 immunoreactivity in quiescent cultures; PKCδ phosphorylation at the Thr505 activation loop site is increased markedly in association with PMA-dependent PKCδ activation. Anti-phospho-PKC-Pan detects low levels of immunoreactivity that comigrates with PKCε in quiescent cardiomyocyte cultures; immunoreactivity with PKCε-like mobility is considerably more abundant and (in some experiments) resolved as a doublet (similar to the appearance of PKCε protein; compare Fig. 2, A andC) in cultures stimulated with PMA. Because PKCε is recovered from many cell types as a mixture of species (with phosphorylation-induced differences in electrophoretic mobility (13Koide H. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1149-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)), the doublet recognized by anti-phospho-PKC-Pan could represent a mixture of Ser729-phosphorylated PKCε species with distinct phosphorylation patterns at other residues. Alternatively, the doublet could represent a phosphorylated form of PKCε and a phosphorylated form of a distinct gene product that comigrates with PKCε and also contains a phosphorylatable hydrophobic motif sequence. The most likely candidate is 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which is reported to undergo PMA-dependent phosphorylation at a consensus FRGFS386F hydrophobic motif sequence (14Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 15Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine whether RSK contributes to anti-phospho-PKC-Pan immunoreactivity, RSK and PKCε were immunoprecipitated individually from PMA-treated cultures and probed for anti-phospho-PKC-Pan immunoreactivity. Fig. 2B shows that anti-phospho-PKC-Pan immunoreactivity is recovered from PMA-treated cardiomyocyte cultures along with PKCε but not with RSK, effectively excluding RSK as the source of anti-phospho-PKC-Pan immunoreactivity in cardiomyocyte cultures. To examine PKC isoform phosphorylation in the context of activation-dependent redistribution of the enzyme to membranes, immunoblot analysis also was performed on cell extracts partitioned into soluble and particulate fractions. Fig. 2Cshows that PKCα protein is recovered largely from the soluble fraction of quiescent cardiomyocyte cultures and the particulate fraction of cultures stimulated with PMA. Immunodetection of PKCα with the anti-phospho-PKC-Pan antibody essentially tracks total PKCα protein (Fig. 2D; i.e.Ser657-phosphorylated PKCα is recovered largely from the soluble fraction of quiescent cultures and the particulate fraction of cultures stimulated with PMA). These results are consistent with the experiments on whole cell lysates (Fig.2A), which show no PMA-dependent change in PKCα-Ser657 phosphorylation. PKCδ protein is recovered from both soluble and particulate fractions of resting cardiomyocytes, but the phosphorylated forms of PKCδ are confined to the particulate fraction (Fig. 2, C andD); phosphorylated forms of PKCδ are not detected in the soluble fraction, even with increased protein loading and prolonged exposures of the gel. PKCδ phosphorylation at the C terminus (Ser662 and Ser643 in the hydrophobic and turn motifs, respectively) is similar in resting and PMA-stimulated cultures. In contrast, PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505 in the activation loop increases during stimulation with PMA, in association with PMA-dependent translocation of PKCδ protein to membranes (and the PMA-induced decrease in its mobility in SDS-PAGE). PKCε also distributes between soluble and particulate fractions of quiescent cardiomyocytes. PKCε-Ser729 phosphorylation is detected at trace levels in quiescent cardiomyocyte cultures and at markedly increased levels in both the soluble and particulate fractions of cultures treated with PMA (Fig. 2D). A phosphorylated form of PKCε in the soluble fraction of PMA-treated cultures was not anticipated because the bulk of PKCε protein is recovered from the particulate fraction. However, C-terminal phosphorylations have been described as modifications that promote the release of PKC from membranes and facilitate its down-regulation (16Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); the highly phosphorylated form of PKCε recovered in the soluble fraction of PMA-treated cardiomyocytes could represent a pool of PKCε newly released from membranes. Fig. 3 (left panel) examines the kinetics of PMA-induced phosphorylations and translocation of PKC isoforms in greater detail. PMA-dependent translocation of PKC isoforms, phosphorylation of PKCε at Ser729, and phosphorylation of PKCδ at Thr505 are rapid events that are readily detected at 5 min (the first time point measured). Phosphorylations of PKCε at Ser729 and PKCδ at Thr505 are stable modifications; both decline in parallel with the agonist-induced down-regulation of these enzymes. There is mounting evidence that PKC phosphorylations are mediated by at least two distinguishable signaling pathways (2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 6Parekh D. Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Largely based uponin vitro studies of isolated PKC isoforms (or studies of PKC isoforms heterologously expressed in undifferentiated cell types), activation loop phosphorylation has been attributed to the actions of PDK-1 (at least for PKCα, β, and δ), and the C-terminal phosphorylations have been characterized as intramolecular autophosphorylations (2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 4Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results predict that certain PKC phosphorylations would require intact intrinsic PKC activity. Therefore, initial studies examined the effects of GF109203X (an inhibitor of cPKCs and nPKCs (19Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). Figs. 3 (right panel) and 4 show that GF109203X prevents PMA-dependent phosphorylation of PKCε at Ser729. Somewhat unexpectedly, GF109203X also prevents PMA-dependent phosphorylation of PKCδ at Thr505 (as well as the PMA-dependent shift in PKCδ mobility). The inhibitory effects of GF109203X (on PKCε phosphorylation at Ser729, PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505, and the PKCδ mobility shift) are mimicked by Go6983 (another bisindolylmaleimide that inhibits cPKCs and nPKCs) but not by Go6976 (an indolocarbazole which selectively inhibits cPKCα but not nPKCs, Fig. 4). PMA-dependent phosphorylations of PKCε at Ser729 and PKCδ at Thr505 are not inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 (Fig. 5, under conditions where the efficacy of LY294002 and PP1 was validated, data not shown). These results identify a role for nPKC catalytic activity in the PMA-dependent phosphorylations of native PKCε (at Ser729) and PKCδ (at Thr505) in cardiomyocytes.Figure 5PMA-dependent phosphorylation of PKC δ and PKC ε requires intact nPKC kinase activity. Cardiomyocytes were pretreated for 30 min with vehicle, 10 μm LY294002, 5 μm GF109203X, or 10 μm PP1. Stimulations were with vehicle or 100 nm PMA for 10 min. Immunoblot analysis on total cell extracts was according to methods described in Fig. 4, with similar results obtained in three separate experiments on separate culture preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The acute PMA-dependent translocation of PKCε to the particulate fraction is similar in cultures treated with PMA alone or PMA plus GF109203X (Fig. 3). These results indicate that phosphorylation of PKCε at Ser729 is not required for PKCε association with membranes. However, Fig. 3 shows that GF109203X slows the kinetics of PMA-induced PKC isoform down-regulation (compare levels of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε immunoreactivity in the particulate fractions of cultures treated for 24 h with PMA aloneversus PMA plus GF109203X). These results suggest that PKC kinase activity and/or the resultant PKC isoform phosphorylations influence the kinetics of down-regulation. To examine more carefully the effect of PKC inhibitors on the kinetics of PKC isoform down-regulation, PKC isoform abundance was compared in resting cultures (as a reference for total PKC isoform immunoreactivity), cultures treated for 31 h with PMA alone, and cultures treated for 31 h with PMA plus PKC inhibitors. Fig. 6shows that PMA effectively down-regulates phorbol ester-sensitive PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε and that PMA-dependent down-regulation of PKCα, PKCδ, and (to a lesser extent) PKCε is impaired by GF109203X and Go6983 (general inhibitors of cPKC and nPKC kinase activities) but not by Go6976 (a selective cPKC isoform inhibitor). This identifies a requirement for intact nPKC isoform kinase activity and suggests two possible mechanisms. Because some studies identify C-terminal PKC isoform phosphorylations as prerequisites for the release of PKC from membranes and its subsequent down-regulation (16Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), nPKC kinase inhibitors might slow PKCε down-regulation by preventing its C-terminal phosphorylation. However, the effect of nPKC isoform inhibitors to slow the kinetics of PKCα and PKCδ down-regulation (i.e. to regulate PKCα intrans) suggests a more general role for nPKC kinase activity in the events that govern PKC trafficking/down-regulation (20Hansra G.

The producing strain was isolated from a soil/manure sample and identified using 16 S rRNA sequence homology along with chemical and morphological characterization.

Structure elucidation using a combination of chemical degradation, multidimensional NMR studies (COSY, HMBC, HMQC, ROESY), and mass spectrometric (MALDI MS/MS) analyses showed that mattacin is identical to polymyxin M, an uncommon antibiotic reported previously in certain Bacillus species by Russian investigators.

One subclass of these antimicrobial compounds is the antibacterial peptides, which can be divided into two categories based on the biosynthetic pathways by which they are generated. One group consists of gene-encoded, ribosomally synthesized peptides (bacteriocins) that typically have 30–60 residues, may be either unmodified or extensively post-translationally altered (i.e.lantibiotics), and are active against closely related bacteria (1Twomey D. Ross R.P. Ryan M. Meaney B. Hill C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2002; 82: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 2Klaenhammer T.R.

Peptides in the second class are nonribosomal in origin and are produced by a series of condensations catalyzed by specific nonribosomal peptide synthetases using a templated multienzyme mechanism (4Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 5Doekel S. Marahiel M.A. Metab. Eng. 2001; 6: 64-77Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These synthetases are large, multifunctional proteins composed of different modules, each of which has different domains capable of performing one step in the condensation of an amino acid onto a growing peptide chain (6Du L. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resulting peptidic compounds often contain nonproteinaceous amino acids, including d-amino acids, hydroxy acids, or other unusual constituents (7Kleinkauf H. von Dorhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The peptide portion of antibiotics produced in this fashion is generally smaller than in ribosomal bacteriocins and usually has fewer than 20 amino acids (8Kleinkauf H. von Dohren H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 8: 1-32Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Our interest in bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria, both unmodified (9van Belkum M.J. Worobo R.W. Stiles M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 2: 1293-1301Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y. Henz M.E. Fregeau Gallagher N.L. Chai S. Yan L.Z. Stiles M.E. Wishart D.S. Vederas J.C.

Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), has led us to examine other species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus (12Zheng G. Yan L.Z. Vederas J.C. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7346-7355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for novel peptidic antimicrobial agents. During a screening program we found that a Paenibacillus kobensis strain isolated from a soil/manure sample produced an active modified peptide with broad activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including a number of human and animal pathogens. We now report that the structure of the principal antimicrobial compound formed by this strain, mattacin, is identical to polymyxin M, an uncommon antibiotic reported previously in the Russian literature (13–16; all reports in Russian) (Fig. 2). Although polymyxins represent one of the earliest classes of commercially important antibiotics to be identified (17Ainsworth G.C. Brown A.M. Brownlee G. Nature. 1947; 160: 263-264Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and at least 15 unique polymyxins have been described (18Storm D.R. Rosenthal K.S. Swanson P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 723-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only polymyxin B is currently widely used and studied. In addition to efficient production and purification of mattacin, the present study describes its NMR solution structure and transfer NOE1 determination of conformational changes that occur upon binding to lipid A and compares these with previous results reported by others (19Pristovsek P. Kidric J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with polymyxin B. Isothermal titration calorimetry was also employed to compare the binding of mattacin and polymyxin B to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major antigen of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the biological potency of mattacin was assessed compared with that of polymyxin B, and the biosynthesis of mattacin was briefly examined. The producer strain, P. kobensis M, was isolated from a soil/manure sample mix and grown aerobically at 30 °C on tryptic soy agar (TSA) or in broth (TSB) with shaking (250 rpm). Escherichia coliBF2, a laboratory strain, was used as the standard sensitive strain.E. coli Jm2r′ was used as a gene cloning host for the recovery of the transposon-interrupted mutants. E. colistrains were grown aerobically at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani agar or in broth with shaking (250 rpm). All other strains used for the inhibition spectrum assay were grown in both broth and agar culture under their established optimum conditions and media. 1.5 μg/ml erythromycin, 20 μg/ml lincomycin, and 5 μg/ml tetracycline were used for selection of producer strain transformants. 20 μg/ml kanamycin was used for selection of E. coli Jm2r′ transformants. A pair of degenerate primers was designed to amplify the 16 S rRNA gene (20Edwards U. Rogall T. Blocker H. Emde M. Bottger E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7843-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). The PCR product was purified from agarose using a Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen Corp., Valencia, CA) and sequenced using an ABI Prism 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting sequence was analyzed by homology comparison using the NCBI nucleotide Blast search data base. Biochemical and morphological assays were then performed as described by Reva et al. (21Reva O.N. Sorokulova I.B. Smirnov V.V. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Shida et al.(22Shida O. Takagi H. Kadowaki K. Nakamura L.K.

Plates were prepared by inoculating 200 ml of molten (48 °C) TSA (40 g/liter) with 1.0 ml of a culture of the indicator organism E. coli BF2 (0.5% inoculum). The molten agar was swirled gently and then dispensed in 20-ml aliquots onto sterile Petri plates, allowed to cool, and then stored at 4 °C. When performing activity assays, small wells (4.6-mm diameter) were made in the seeded agar plates, and 50-μl aliquots of the solutions to be tested were dispensed into each well. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C, with growth of the indicator being visible in as few as 3 h. The antimicrobial spectrum was determined using a deferred inhibition assay described previously by Ahn and Stiles (23Ahn C. Stiles M.E. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1990; 69: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, the producer strain was spotted onto TSA plates and incubated 24 h at 30 °C. Molten 0.75% TSA, Luria Burtani, or MRS soft agar (medium used was optimum for each indicator strain) was then inoculated with 80 μl of a late log phase indicator broth culture (∼106 viable cells/ml) and poured onto the surface of the plate containing the producer strain colonies. These agar overlays were then incubated overnight at either 30 or 37 °C (according to the indicator's optimum temperature), and the zones of inhibition were then measured. Alternatively, 10 μl of a purified, antimicrobial peptide solution with a known concentration was spotted onto the surface of a TSA plate, allowed to dry, and overlaid as described above. 10 ml of a fresh, overnight producer strain culture was inoculated into 1 liter of TSB and incubated at 30 °C with stirring. At various time intervals during this incubation, 1 ml of culture was collected to determine growth phase and antimicrobial peptide production. These samples were centrifuged immediately (14,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) to remove the cells. The supernatant was heat treated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate any protease activity. The activity of each supernatant was then determined using a 2-fold dilution agar diffusion test. The samples were diluted serially in 2-fold increments, and 20 μl of each dilution was spotted onto a TSA plate. These spots were dried, and the plate was overlaid and read as described above with E. coli BF2 as the indicator strain. An arbitrary activity unit, defined as the 20-μl sample from the highest dilution that had a clear inhibition zone, was then determined for each fraction. Plasmids from E. coli were isolated using the Qiagen plasmid mini kit as described by the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids from the producer strain were isolated using the method of Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.25-1.28Google Scholar), except that cells were treated with 10 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 37 °C before the SDS lysis step. Transformation of E. coli Jm2r′ was performed using CaCl2E. coli competent cell preparation according to the method of Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.25-1.28Google Scholar), and transformation of the producer strain was performed with the transposon delivery plasmid pLTV3 (25Camille A. Portnoy D.A. Youngman P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3738-3744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following the protocol of Dramsi et al. (26Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Producer strain transformants were inoculated into TSB and grown to anA600 of ∼0.2. The cultures were then shifted to 41 °C for 4 h to force random chromosomal insertion of the transposon, creating a transpositional mutagenesis library. This library was then screened for loss of antibiotic production by a colony-deferred inhibition assay as described above. Confirmation of the transposon insertion of each mutant was performed by a PCR using primers derived from the Tn917 sequence. Mutant chromosomal extractions showing the Tn917 PCR fragment were then digested withXbaI (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) followed by ligation with high concentration T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The ligation mixtures were then used to transform E. coli Jm2r′. Plasmid preparations were performed on all Jm2r′ transformants and were sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions. Two primers were designed for plasmid sequencing. The first was derived from the sequence of the monoclonal site of the pLTV3 plasmid (5′-CCG GGG ATC CTC TAG A-3′), and the second was derived from 70 bp upstream of thelacZ gene on the pLTV3 plasmid (5′-GTT AAA TGT ACA AAA TAA CAG CGA-3′). The self-ligated plasmids were sequenced using an ABI Prism 373 DNA sequencer and the results analyzed by NCBI Blast homology searches (Table II).Table IINCBI Blast homology search results of Tn917-flanking fragmentsPlasmid no.Mutant typeHomologous gene from LacZ directionHomologous gene from MCS direction33-1Lower level productionVector sequenceResponse regulator-like gene and vector sequence33-2Lower level productionPeptide antibiotic synthetase geneABC transporter gene in tyrocidine biosynthesis operon34Lower level productionVector sequenceAcyl-CoA synthase55Lower level productionPeptide antibiotic synthetase geneABC transporter gene in tyrocidine biosynthesis operon56Lower level productionPeptide antibiotic synthetase geneABC transporter gene in tyrocidine biosynthesis operon239Lower level productionProbable transcriptional regulatorProbable transcriptional regulator301NonproductionNo significant alignmentSensor histine kinase in two-component regulator system410Lower level productionABC transporterTranscription regulator411Lower level productionABC transporter16 S rRNA gene460NonproductionPeptide antibiotic synthetase genePeptide antibiotic synthetase gene Open table in a new tab In a 10-ml culture tube of TSB, a preculture of P. kobensis M was grown for 24 h with shaking (200 rpm) at 30 °C. A 1-liter batch of TSB was then prepared by first passing through a column (2.5 × 30 cm) packed with 40 g of Amberlite XAD-16 resin (Sigma) to remove hydrophobic components from the medium which would otherwise interfere with the isolation of the hydrophobic peptide. After sterilization (15 min at 121 °C) and cooling, this modified TSB was inoculated with the entire 10-ml P. kobensis M preculture (1% inoculum). After a total growth time of 16–24 h at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm), the cells were removed by centrifugation (20 min, 8,000 rpm). The supernatant was then passed through a column (2.5 × 50 cm) containing 60 g of Amberlite XAD-16 resin at a flow rate of 15 ml/min with the aid of a peristaltic pump. The column was then washed with 500 ml of 30% ethanol. The active peptide was then removed from the Amberlite column by washing with 500 ml of 70% acid and isopropyl alcohol (pH 2 by addition of 1 m HCl). All fractions were assessed for activity using the well plate assay described above. The active 70% acid and isopropyl alcohol (pH 2) fraction was evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporation, and the yellow residue was redissolved/suspended in 5.0 ml of purified (Milli-Q system, Millipore, Bedford, MA) water. This concentrated solution was next applied to a column (2.5 × 50 cm) containing Sephadex G-25 superfine (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column was eluted with purified (Milli-Q) water overnight, and 10-ml fractions were collected. Each fraction was assayed again for activity as described above. The active fractions 17–20 were then pooled, evaporated, and redissolved in 10 ml of 20% isopropyl alcohol in preparation for reverse phase HPLC. Complete isolation of mattacin required two separate HPLC methods, each employing a C18 steel-walled column (Vydac, 10 × 250 mm, 5 μm). During the initial HPLC work, all isolatable peaks were assessed for antimicrobial activity using the aforementioned well plate assay until the retention time of mattacin was well established. In the first method, a 1.0-ml injection was applied, and a gradient of water and isopropyl alcohol (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), starting at 20% and climbing to 30% isopropyl alcohol over 25 min, was used (flow rate = 2.5 ml/min, detection at 225 nm). Using this method, most of the polar impurities were removed with mattacin eluting in a broad peak (Rt = 18–20 min) somewhat later. The active fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in 6.0 ml of 45% methanol. The second method employed the same C18 column using a gradient of water and methanol (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), starting at 45% and climbing to 60% methanol over 15 min (flow rate = 4.0 ml/min, detection at 225 nm). Under these conditions, mattacin was isolated as a single peak (Rt = 10–11 min). Using 1.0-ml sample injections, the entire sample was purified, and after pooling, evaporation of the methanol, and lyophilization, as much as 5 mg of pure mattacin was obtained as white powder from a 1-liter culture. 100 μg of mattacin was hydrolyzed at 160 °C for 1 h with 100 μl of 5.7 m HCl and 0.1% phenol in a sealed, evacuated tube. The solvent was removed by vacuum centrifugation (Speed-Vac), and the dried hydrolysate was redissolved in 0.2 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.0). Analysis was achieved through cation exchange chromatography with a Beckman 6300 amino acid analysis instrument using a 120 × 2.5-mm (inner diameter) column with postcolumn detection/quantitation by reaction with ninhydrin at 135 °C. With the knowledge that mattacin contained threonine, it was hoped that a crystalline product, suitable for x-ray analysis, might be obtained by chemically modifying nucleophilic residues. To this end, 500 μg of mattacin was treated with 1.0 ml of pyridine/acetic anhydride (1:1) on ice. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, and after 4 h a 10-μl aliquot was removed for mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. Samples for MALDI-MS analysis were prepared using sinnapinic acid as the matrix. Solutions containing the sample peptide were mixed in even part with a stock solution of sinnapinic acid (10 mg/ml) in 60% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A thin layer of sinnapinic acid was deposited on the surface of the gold target plate by delivery of a 0.7-μl droplet of a solution containing sinnapinic acid (4 mg/ml) in 50% acetone and 50% methanol. After evaporation of the acetone/methanol, a 0.3-μl droplet of the solution containing the sample peptide/matrix mixture was deposited on top of the fresh matrix layer on the plate. The solvent was evaporated at 1 atm prior to analysis. Mass spectra were recorded with a singlestage reflectron, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems API QSTAR Pulsar with a MALDI source) (27Baldwin M.A. Medzihradszky K.F. Lock C.M. Settineri T.A. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Tandem MS (MS/MS) was performed using two different instruments. The QSTAR instrument, described above, was of the geometry QqTOF, where MS/MS analysis was achieved through collision-induced dissociation in the RF-only section of the mass spectrometer (Q2) after mass selection with the Q1 resolving quadrupole. Fragment ions were detected in the orthogonal TOF section of the mass spectrometer. Ion generation was achieved through MALDI ionization using sinnapinic acid as the matrix. The QSTAR was equipped with a 20-Hz pulsed nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. Collision-induced dissociation MS/MS analysis was completed using argon as the collision gas in Q2. Also used in a second MS/MS analysis was a ThermoFinnegan (San Jose, CA) LCQ XP ion trap instrument equipped with a nanospray source. The peptide sample was dissolved in 1:1 methanol/water acidified with 0.2% formic acid and loaded into a PicoTip (New Objective, Woburn, MA) nanospray tip. Static nanospray was achieved by applying ∼800 V to the nanospray tip. Ions were introduced to the mass spectrometer, and before MS/MS analysis all ions except the parent ion of interest were ejected from the ion trap. MS/MS and MS3 analyses were completed using resonance excitation with the mass range up to m/z 1,200 for the fragment ions. NMR spectra were obtained in a 90% H2O and 10% D2O solution at 27 °C and at a peptide concentration of 2 mm. Spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer; data matrices of 2048 detected and 512 (1024 for DQF-COSY) indirect data points with 64 (96 for ROESY) scans were recorded and processed using a 90 shifted sine bell window function (unshifted for DQF-COSY). Water signal suppression was achieved by transmitter presaturation. All experiments were performed at pH 2 (H2O contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid); under these conditions, the possibility of peptide aggregation was reduced because of A2bu-γ-amino group protonation. The assignment of 1H resonances was performed using standard two-dimensional DQF-COSY (28Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1888) Google Scholar), TOCSY (29Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar) (mixing time 70 ms), and two-dimensional NOE experiments (NOESY (30Jeneer J. Meier B.H. Bachman P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar) and ROESY (31Bothner-By A.A. Stephens R.L. Lee J. Warren C.D. Jeanloz R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 811-813Crossref Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), mixing times 200 ms). The temperature coefficients of the amide proton chemical shifts were calculated using a series of one-dimensional experiments performed at four different temperatures in the range of 27–42 °C. Two-dimensional transferred NOE (TRNOE) experiments (32Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar,33Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with mixing times of 200 ms were done using a mixture of mattacin and LPS which corresponded to an 8:1 w/w ratio of both components; these conditions yielded moderately broadened lines in the amide region of the mattacin one-dimensional spectrum. A three-dimensional structure of mattacin was computed based on NOE restraints derived from the TRNOE experiment using a dynamic annealing protocol in CNS 1.1 (©Yale University). 50 representative structures were calculated based on 62 NOEs. The NOEs were classified as strong, medium, and weak, corresponding to maximum distances of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively, based on the volumes of the assigned cross-peaks in the NOESY spectrum. 1 mg of mattacin was hydrolyzed (1 ml of 6 n HCl, 110 °C, 18 h), and the hydrolysate was dried under a nitrogen stream and then derivatized using an Alltech (Deerfield, IL) pentafluoropropyl amide-isopropyl ester amino acid derivatization kit. The dried hydrolysate was treated with 0.2 n HCl (5 min at 110 °C) and dried under an argon stream. To this, 150 μl of acetylchloride and 500 μl of isopropyl alcohol were added, and the mixture was heated at 110 °C for 45 min. After drying with an argon stream, the derivatizing agent, pentafluoropropyl propionic anhydride (1 ml dissolved in 2 ml of CH2Cl2), was added, and the solution was heated at 115 °C for 15 min, blown dry with argon, and then solubilized in CH2Cl2. For standards, 10 mg each ofd/l-threonine, leucine, and α,γ-A2bu were subjected to the identical derivatization sequence. Also, 1 mg of purified polymyxin B was hydrolyzed and treated in the same fashion to serve as standard. All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-MS under identical conditions, using a Heliflex Chirasil-Val, 50 m × 0.25 mm × 0.16 μm column (Alltech), helium as carrier gas (0.6 ml/min), and a temperature gradient beginning at 90 °C (5-min hold) and ramping to 160 °C (3 °C/min) followed by a 12-min hold. LPS from E. coli strain 055:B5 was obtained from Sigma, and polymyxin B sulfate was purchased from Fluka. The polymxyin B was purified further by reverse phase HPLC (using methods identical to those described above for mattacin), and the LPS preparation was used as purchased. Using a molecular mass estimate of 20,000 Da for the LPS monomer (34Srimal S. Surolia N. Balasubramanian S. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) a 0.05 mm LPS solution was prepared by dissolving LPS in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) along with equimolar quantities of triethylamine with respect to the anionic groups in the LPS monomer (4 eq). The solution was vortexed vigorously for 15 min and sonicated for 5 min prior to use. Titrations were performed using the OMEGA high sensitivity microcalorimeter manufactured by MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA) as described previously (35Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). For measurement of heat exchanges accompanying the binding of polymyxin B or mattacin to LPS, the LPS solution was loaded into the sample cell of the calorimeter (volume = 1.4423 ml), and the reference cell was filled with water containing 0.05% sodium azide. Next, polymyxin B or mattacin, in the same buffer, was placed in a 250-μl syringe at a concentration of 1.25 mm (25-fold higher than that of the LPS). The system was allowed to equilibrate at 20.0 °C, and a stable base line was recorded before initiating an automated titration. A titration sequence involved 7.2-μl aliquot injections of polymyxin B or mattacin delivered over 10 s at 5-min intervals into the sample cell. Throughout the titration, the cell was stirred continuously at 400 rpm. NCBI nucleotide Blast homology search results of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence revealed high homology to the Paenibacillus genus. Specific biochemical and morphological results, shown in Table I, revealed the bacterium to beP. kobensis, later named strain M. Live cell deferred inhibition assays showed that P. kobensis M inhibited numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative species including among others E. coliO157:H7 ATCC 33150, Salmonella enterica serovar Rubislaw, and Listeria monocytogenes, but failed to inhibit Pediococcus acidilactici. Purified mattacin and polymyxin B showed the same inhibition spectrum as the liveP. kobensis M cells with the exception that they both failed to inhibit the strains of Listeria and Bacillus tested. Furthermore, mattacin showed a consistently higher level of activity against all strains tested in this study, including activity against Vibrio parahemeolyticusG1–166, against which polymyxin B was inactive. TableIII shows the complete antimicrobial spectrum elucidated in this study as well as the inhibition spectrum of polymyxin B against the same organisms for comparative purposes.Table IIIAntimicrobial spectrum of live P. koben"

Protein ubiquitination involves a cascade of enzymatic steps where ubiquitin (Ub)1 is passed sequentially as an activated thiolester from a Ub-activating enzyme (E1) to a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and finally to the protein target with the help of a Ub protein ligase (E3) (1Hochstrasser M.

The assembly of poly-Ub chains onto a targeted protein has proven to be a hallmark of a variety of processes, such as cell cycle control (3Peters J.-M. King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M.

Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). These chains are synthesized in an E2-dependent reaction where each Ub within the chain is covalently bound to its neighbor by an isopeptide bond that links the C terminus to a surface lysine of its target-proximal Ub partner. Previous observations have demonstrated that these chains can exist in different configurations that are defined by the specific lysine residue that links each Ub molecule within the chain (9Chau V.

The most prevalent and best-documented examples of protein ubiquitination use the Lys-48-linked chain configuration to target proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (2Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a non-proteolytic ubiquitination pathway has come to light that results in the substrate-tethered assembly of multi-Ub chains, where Ub molecules are tandemly linked to one another through Lys-63 (12Spence J.

Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The error-free repair and NF-κB pathways both catalyze the assembly of Lys-63 chains using a conserved E2 heterodimer, composed of a catalytically active hUbc13 subunit and a catalytically inactive E2-like subunit termed ubiquitin-conjugatingenzyme variant (UEV). UEV proteins share significant sequence similarity with other E2s but lack the characteristic active-site cysteine residue required for thiolester formation. In the error-free repair pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two chromatin-associated RING finger proteins, Rad5 and Rad18, recruit the Ubc13·Mms2 heterodimer and Ubc2 (Rad6) to DNA (23Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In very recent work, Hoege et al. (24Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 149: 135-141Crossref Scopus (1716) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a target of this pathway is the yeast proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is first mono-ubiquitinated through Rad6 and Rad18 and then poly-ubiquitinated by Ubc13·Mms2 in conjunction with Rad5. In NF-κB signal transduction, Traf6, a RING domain E3 protein, functions together with the hUbc13·UEV heterodimer (containing either hUEV1a or the functionally equivalent hMms2) in the formation of Lys-63-linked poly-Ub chains that are required for the activation of IκB kinase, a key signal transducer in the NF-κB pathway (18Deng L.

Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J.-I. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Insight into the mechanism of Lys-63 chain assembly and its relationship to structure recently became possible with the simultaneous determination of both S. cerevisiae (25VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and human (26Moraes T. Edwards R. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover M. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) Ubc13·Mms2 heterodimer structures by x-ray crystallography and an NMR-based approach for mapping the protein-protein interactions within the Ub-bound complex (27McKenna S.

Using the previously determined assignments for Ub in 1H-15N HSQC NMR experiments, we were able to footprint the surface of Ub that interacted with the human hUbc13·hMms2 heterodimer and each of its subunits in either the thiolester-linked or unlinked forms (27McKenna S.

The results of this study were consistent with a two-binding site model in which an “acceptor” molecule of Ub bound non-covalently to hMms2 was positioned in an orientation such that a second Ub molecule that was linked to hUbc13 as a thiolester could be transferred to Lys-63 of the accepting Ub molecule. The NMR assignments of both hMms2 and hUbc13 is an obvious prerequisite for footprinting the surfaces of the heterodimer that interact with both the covalently linked and unlinked forms of Ub. In the present work we have determined the footprint that both Ub molecules make on the surface of the hUbc13·hMms2 heterodimer. Taken together with our previous work, a compelling model is presented for the tetrameric structure that places Lys-63 of the accepting Ub molecule in catalytic proximity of the C terminus of the donor Ub molecule. hUbc13 and hMms2 were expressed and purified as described previously (27McKenna S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)-RP (Stratagene), and 2-liter cultures were grown at 25 °C to A590 = 0.3 in minimal media containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) for an additional 24 h at 25 °C. S. cerevisiae UbK48R, UbK63R, and Uba1 (E1) were expressed and purified as described previously (27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Unity INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer at 30 °C. The two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectra were acquired using the sensitivity-enhanced gradient pulse scheme developed by Kay and co-workers (28Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2408) Google Scholar, 29Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The 1H and15N sweep widths were 8000 and 2200 Hz, respectively. A minimum of 64 transients was collected for each spectrum. All NMR samples were prepared to include HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5), NaCl (75 mm), EDTA (1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (1 mm) in the presence of 9:1 H2O:D2O. Spectral processing was accomplished with the NMRPipe program (30Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar). The NMRview program (31Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1994; 29: 1012-1014Crossref Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) was employed in the assignment of all two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC NMR cross-peaks. To calculate the total average change in backbone amide1HN and 15N chemical shifts for each resonance, the following equation was applied (32McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar),Δδtotal=(Δδ15N)2+(Δδ1HN)2Equation 1 where Δδ15N and Δδ1H are the chemical shift changes in hertz. The average change in total chemical shift was then calculated for each identified residue, with the exception of those whose resonances had broadened past detectability in the two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectra. The standard deviation associated with each dataset was also calculated. An initial two-dimensional1H-15N-HSQC spectrum was acquired for15N-hMms2 (250 μm) as a point of reference for subsequent chemical shift perturbation experiments. The spectrum also served to confirm the proper folding and lack of aggregation of15N-hMms2. The interactions between 15N-hMms2 and hUbc13 were examined by inclusion of a slight excess of unlabeled hUbc13 (300 μm) to the sample described above for15N-hMms2 alone. The NMR tube was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 30 °C to ensure heterodimerization would proceed to completion. A two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum was then acquired for the sample. Non-covalent interactions between 15N-hMms2 (250 μm) and Ub were examined by including unlabeled UbK48R (600 μm) into NMR samples in the presence or absence of unlabeled hUbc13 (300 μm). A two-dimensional1H-15N-HSQC spectrum was then acquired for each sample. Chemical shift assignments in the two-dimensional1H-15N-HSQC spectra were again completed assuming that the closest cross-peak represented the correct change in chemical shift. The two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC NMR reference spectrum used when calculating changes caused by Ub were either (i) 15N-hMms2 alone to examine the changes cause in hMms2 by itself or (ii) 15N-hMms2·hUbc13 to probe the changes in chemical shift in hMms2 in the context of the heterodimer. As in the case of hMms2, an initial two-dimensional1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectrum was acquired as a point of reference and confirmed the proper folding and lack of aggregation of 15N-hUbc13 (305 μm). The interactions between 15N-hUbc13 and hMms2 were examined by inclusion of a slight excess of unlabeled hMms2 (330 μm) to the sample described above for15N-hUbc13 alone. Sample equilibration and acquisition were performed as described for the 15N-hMms2 samples. Thiolester-linked interactions between 15N-hUbc13 (305 μm) and Ub (330 μm) were examined in situ by inclusion of S. cerevisiae E1 (0.3 μm), ATP (5 mm), and MgCl2 (5 mm) as described previously (27McKenna S.

Addition of hMms2 (330 μm) to this sample allowed for the examination of the hMms2·15N-hUbc13-Ub species. Studies described elsewhere (27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have shown that thiolester formation is rapid (minutes) whereas the formation of Ub conjugate on hUbc13 is slow (hours). Furthermore, the onset of conjugate formation can be clearly identified based on the accumulation of new peaks emanating from the mixed population of Ub species. The two-dimensional1H-15N-HSQC NMR experiments were therefore performed between 10 and 120 min after the addition of E1 to minimize the impact of possible side-reactions. UbK63R was employed as the Ub species to eliminate the possibility of chain formation by the hUbc13·hMms2 heterodimer and, hence, to eliminate further complication of the spectra (27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional1H-15N-HSQC NMR reference spectra used when calculating changes caused by Ub in thiolester complexes were either (i) 15N-hUbc13 alone to examine the changes caused in hUbc13 by itself or (ii) 15N-hUbc13·hMms2 to probe the changes in chemical shift in hUbc13 in the context of the heterodimer. Non-covalent interactions between 15N-hUbc13 and Ub were detected by including unlabeled UbK63R into NMR samples in the presence or absence of unlabeled hUbc13 under conditions identical to thiolester formation with the exception that E1, ATP, and MgCl2 were omitted. A two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectrum was then acquired for each sample. However, no changes in15N-hUbc13 cross-peaks were observed in either case, and therefore no further analysis was performed. Molecular modeling of the surfaces of interaction was accomplished using the BiGGER soft-docking algorithm (33Palma P.N. Krippahl L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J.G.

Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) and the hUbc13·hMms2 heterodimer (probe) (26Moraes T. Edwards R. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover M. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The BiGGER algorithm systematically searches the complete six-dimensional binding spaces of both target and probe and then evaluates these solutions in terms of a global scoring function consisting of geometric complementarity, electrostatic interactions, desolvation energy, and the pairwise propensities of amino acid side chains to interact across molecular interfaces. Docking parameters in this initial search included a 15° angular step, 5000 maximum solutions, and 300 minimum atomic contacts. The top 5000 solutions based on global score were then filtered using the NMR chemical shift perturbation data in the following manner. First, surface-exposed residues on hMms2 and Ub, respectively, which produced significant Δδtotal values upon non-covalent interaction were determined, and the number of atomic contacts between these two groups within a 5-Å distance cutoff in each of the top 5000 solutions as determined by global score was evaluated. The top solution based on these criteria was then accepted as the “correct” orientation and subsequently underwent minimization using the INSIGHTII suite of programs. The thiolester-bound Ub placement upon the heterodimer was then determined in an identical manner using Δδtotal values. When engaged in catalysis, the hUbc13·hMms2 heterodimer necessarily exists as part of a tetramer that is composed of the heterodimer in association with two Ub molecules. One Ub molecule is linked as a thiolester to the active site of hUbc13 (the donor) while the other Ub molecule interacts non-covalently with hMms2 (the acceptor). Although a high resolution crystallographic structure for the heterodimer has been determined (26Moraes T. Edwards R. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover M. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a crystallographic structure for the Ub-bound tetramer is unlikely. This conclusion is based both on the instability of the hUbc13-Ub thiolester bond (36Miura T. Klaus W. Gsell B. Miyamoto C. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the relatively weak interaction that exists between the acceptor Ub and hMms2 (Kd ∼ 100 μm). 2S. McKenna, J. Hu, T. Moraes, W. Xiao, L. Spyracopoulos, and M. J. Ellison, manuscript in preparation. Based on these considerations, we have pursued an alternative NMR-based approach to determine the structure of the hUbc13·hMms2-Ub2tetramer. The tetramer has three major protein-protein interfaces: 1) the hMms2-hUbc13 interface, 2) the hMms2-Ub (acceptor) interface and, 3) the hUbc13-Ub (donor) interface. In this and previous studies (27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we have used 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy to observe the chemical shift perturbations that are induced upon interaction to define the footprint that each protein makes with its partner. The method that we have chosen here relies upon the comparison of1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra for each protein component in an unbound form and bound to its partner. To simplify the analysis, only one component of the complex is 15N-labeled in any given experiment. Backbone amide 1HN and15N chemical shifts are sensitive to a variety of factors, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and aromatic ring current effects, to name a few. Therefore, changes to chemical shifts that can result from differences in chemical environment upon complex formation can be used to identify residues that are either directly involved at the binding interface or correspond to long range structural changes. A necessary precursor to chemical shift mapping is the complete assignment of backbone amide1HN-15N cross-peaks in the1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra for a given component of the complex. Recently, we have completed the full backbone chemical shift assignments for both hUbc13 and hMms2 (available upon request). Each protein exhibits well dispersed and resolved1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra at 600 MHz, as is shown for hMms2 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the spectra retain these qualities fairly well upon formation of higher order complexes of up to 42.5 kDa, although the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced as expected, due to increased linewidths. Chemical shift assignments in the two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectra were made relative to the appropriate reference spectrum, assuming that the closest shifted cross-peak represented the correct one. This approach was required due primarily to the lability of complexes containing thiolester linkages. To map the interface between hUbc13 and hMms2, two heterodimer complexes were preparedin situ: one containing 15N-hUbc13 with unlabeled hMms2, and the other containing 15N-hMms2 with unlabeled hUbc13. The hUbc13·hMms2 heterodimerization (34 kDa) proceeds efficiently upon equimolar addition of each protein and results in the formation of a stable complex that remains associated during high resolution size-exclusion chromatography (27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Residues whose backbone amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts exhibited a perturbation upon complex formation were identified and quantified in terms of the total change in chemical shift, Δδtotal. The major Δδtotal values upon heterodimerization for either 15N-hMms2 or15N-hUbc13 are associated with residues found at the heterodimer interface (Figs.2B and3B), indicating the similarity of this interface in both the crystalline and solution phases.Figure 3Binding-induced NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis of hUbc13 with Ub. Comparison of backbone amide 1H and 15N chemical shift of hUbc13 in the absence or presence of thiolester-linked Ub (A) and hMms2 (B) or the comparison between hMms2·15N-hUbc13 heterodimer and this heterodimer in the presence of thiolester-linked Ub (C). The total change in chemical shift, Δδtotal, was calculated for hUbc13 under each of the conditions and plotted as a function of primary amino acid sequence. Dashed lines represent the average change in Δδtotal as well as one standard deviation above this average. Residues whose change in chemical shift could not be identified are indicated with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Residues resulting in the greatest effect on Δδtotalfor interactions within the heterodimer or between the heterodimer and Ub (see below) have been summarized in Fig.4 according to sequence and secondary structure. Also shown are the chemical shift indices for each residue contained in hMms2 and hUbc13, which provide a measure of the deviation between the observed chemical shifts and their random coil values, and are indicative of the type of secondary structure (37Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar, 38Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). A comparison between secondary structural elements for hMms2 and hUbc13, determined by x-ray crystallography to those determined from the chemical shift indices, demonstrate a close correlation between types of secondary structure determined in the solution and crystalline states. Both hMms2 and hUbc13 have each been observed to exist in a monomeric state and as the heterodimer (23Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas homodimerization has not been observed (see “Experimental Procedures”), and therefore an examination of the interaction between Ub and the hMms2 subunit is of interest. The chemical shift perturbations that result from the interaction of 15N-hMms2 subunit with unlabeled acceptor Ub are shown in Fig. 2A. The greatest effects on Δδtotal upon interaction with Ub are observed at the N-terminal portion of hMms2. Specifically, the affected residues are located in helix α1 (Glu-20, Gly-22, Lys-24), sections of strand β1 (Val-31, Ser-32, Leu-35), strand β2 (Thr-47, Gly-48, Met-49), strand β3 (Tyr-63, Leu-65), helix α2 (Leu-119) as well as the loop joining helix α1 to strand β1 (Val-26, Thr-30). Intermediate effects on Δδtotal are found close in sequence to the greatest changes and include the C-terminal portion of α1 (Gln-23), sections of β1 (Trp-33), β2 (Trp-46), L2 prior to β3 (Asn-60, Arg-61), β3 (Val-67, Gly-70), and the loop joining α1 to β1 (Gly-25, Gly-27, Gly-29). Intermediate changes are also found in α2 (Gln-120, Leu-125, Glu-130) and the C terminus (Gly-140, Gln-141). As expected, many of the residues in hMms2 that exhibit the greatest backbone amide chemical shift perturbations are located on the surface of the protein, and contain surface exposed side chains that may be involved in non-covalent interactions with Ub (Fig.5A). These residues cluster onto one face of hMms2, forming three distinct patches. Interestingly, no significant changes in chemical shift were observed for residues on the opposite surface of hMms2. The first patch is perpendicular to the hUbc13·hMms2 interface, and is composed of residues at the C-terminal end of α1 and the loop that joins α1 to β1 (Glu-20, Glu-21, Gly-22, Gln-23, Lys-24, Gly-25, Val-26, Gly-27, Gly-29, and Val-31), portions of β1 (Ser-32, Trp-33, and Leu-35), β2 (Thr-47, Gly-48, and Met-49), and β3 (Arg-61, Tyr-63, and Leu-65). The second patch is found at the C-terminal portion of hMms2. Notably, the total surface area of both these hMms2 patches corresponds well with the complementary patch on Ub that has previously been demonstrated to interact with hMms2 (27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Additionally, the combined electrostatic surface potential of the hMms2 patches is complementary to that found on Ub (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the third patch involves hMms2 residues that would normally interact with hUbc13 in the heterodimer, and include Val-7, Lys-8 (greatest Δδtotal), and other N-terminal amino acids of hMms2 (intermediate Δδtotal). Our previous findings indicated that the Ub contact surface with hMms2 remained largely the same when alone or in complex with hUbc13 (27McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C.

The Txl-2 open reading frame codes for a protein of 330 amino acids consisting of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain typical of thioredoxins and a C-terminal domain belonging to the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase family, separated by a small interface domain. The Txl-2 gene spans ∼28 kb, is organized into 11 exons, and maps at locus 3q22.3-q23. A splicing variant lacking exon 5 (Δ5Txl-2) has also been isolated. By quantitative real time PCR we demonstrate that Txl-2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, with testis and lung having the highest levels of expression. Unexpectedly, light and electron microscopy analyses show that the protein is associated with microtubular structures such as lung airway epithelium cilia and the manchette and axoneme of spermatids. Using in vitro translated proteins, we demonstrate that full-length Txl-2 weakly associates with microtubules. In contrast, Δ5Txl-2 specifically binds with very high affinity brain microtubule preparations containing microtubule-binding proteins. Importantly, Δ5Txl-2 also binds to pure microtubules, proving that it possesses intrinsic microtubule binding capability. Taken together, Δ5Txl-2 is the first thioredoxin reported to bind microtubules and might therefore be a novel regulator of microtubule physiology.

The redox activity of thioredoxin resides in the sequence of its conserved active site Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (CGPC), which undergoes reversible oxidation of the two cysteine residues from a dithiol to a disulfide form (1Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is maintained in its active reduced form by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase, a selenocysteine-containing protein that uses the reducing power of NADPH (1Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Several functions have been assigned to thioredoxin, mostly dependent on its redox activity, including regulation of transcription factor DNA binding activity, antioxidant defense, modulation of apoptosis, and the immune response (2Tanaka T. Nakamura H. Nishiyama A. Hosoi F. Masutani H. Wada H. Yodoi J. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 33: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, abnormal thioredoxin expression has been correlated with a number of pathological situations such as cancer and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (3Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of thioredoxin is conserved through evolution and consists of five central stranded β-sheets externally surrounded by four α-helices (4Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The active site is located in a protrusion of the protein between the β2-strand and the α2-helix (4Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The conserved active site sequence and the three-dimensional structure of thioredoxin are the hallmarks of the thioredoxin family. During recent years, the number of thioredoxin family members has increased substantially. Based on protein sequence organization, two distinct groups of thioredoxins can be distinguished. Group I includes those proteins that exclusively encode a thioredoxin domain; Group II is composed of fusion proteins of thioredoxin domains plus additional domains. Among those belonging to Group I are Escherichia coli Trx-1 (5Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the three yeast thioredoxins (6Gan Z.R. J. Biol.

Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Until our discovery of Txl-2, Sptrx-2 was the only mammalian member of the family where two different known protein domains are present in the same polypeptide, as Sptrx-2 is a fusion protein of an N-terminal thioredoxin domain followed by three nucleoside-diphosphate (NDP) kinase domains. A similar domain structure is also found in sea urchin axonemal protein IC1 (15Ogawa K. Takai H. Ogiwara A. Yokota E. Shimizu T. Inaba K. Mohri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1895-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NDP kinases (also known as nm23) constitute another well known family of structurally and functionally conserved proteins identified across a wide range of species from bacteria to human. NDP kinases catalyze the transfer of γ-phosphates between nucleosides and deoxynucleoside di- and triphosphates, playing a pivotal role in maintaining a balanced pool of nucleotides (16Postel E.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Lombardi D. Lacombe M.L. Paggi M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase function, nm23 proteins have been implicated in cell growth, cancer progression, and development (17Lombardi D. Lacombe M.L. Paggi M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Hartsough M.T. Steeg P.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similar to thioredoxins, humans have several NDP kinases (termed nm23-H1 to H8, of which nm23-H8 is also known as Sptrx-2). NDP kinases can also be classified into two groups based on sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (19Lacombe M.L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Group I is composed of nm23-H1 to H4 which all share a similar genomic organization consisting of a hexameric three-dimensional structure and the classical enzymatic activity of NDP kinases. Group II encompasses nm23-H5 to H8 genes, which are defined by a more divergent sequence, including a sequence of the active site which is not strictly conserved. Furthermore, nm23-H5, H7, and H8 have been shown to have a tissue-specific distribution mainly in testis/spermatozoa (14Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.J. Spyrou G.

We report here the characterization of a novel human fusion protein composed of an N-terminal thioredoxin domain followed by an NDP kinase domain, named Txl-2. Based on the considerations above, Txl-2 should be classified as a member of the Group II of both thioredoxin and nm23 family of proteins. Txl-2 shares clear homology with Sptrx-2 with the difference that the latter has three NDP kinase domains following the thioredoxin domain. In accordance with nm23 nomenclature, Txl-2 should also be denoted as nm23-H9. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (22Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) was used to perform a survey of different data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to identify new entries encoding potential novel members of the thioredoxin family. Using the thioredoxin domain of human Sptrx-2 as bait (14Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.J. Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we found the expressed sequence tag entry AI341589 to encode a putative thioredoxin-like sequence. Based on this sequence, the nested forward primers F1 (5′-GGGCAGCAGGAAGAAGGATATTGC-3′) and F2 (5′-CAGGTCAACATCAGCACACAACAGC-3′) were used for 3′-RACE on a human testis cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Based on the sequence obtained, the nested forward primers R1 (5′-CACCAGCCTAGATAGACATCAACAAC-3′) and R2 (5′-CTCGATCCTCATCTTCTGGAAGAG-3′) were used for 5′-RACE in the same library. The resulting sequences were used to amplify by PCR the full-length and Δ5Txl-2 cDNA of human Txl-2 from the same library. The amplification products were cloned in the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) and sequenced in both directions. Human cDNA multiple tissue cDNA panels were purchased from Clontech, oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Cybergene AB (Stockholm, Sweden), and TaqMan probes and GAPDH kits were purchased from PE Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK). To detect total Txl-2 mRNA, the forward primer was 5′-GGGCAGCAGGAAGAAGGAA-3′ (nucleotides 30–48), the reverse primer was 5′-TTAGTCCTTTGGAACTGAGCATTTC-3′ (nucleotides 115–91), and the Txl-2 TaqMan probe was 5′-CCTGCAGGTCAACATCAGCACCCA-3′ (nucleotides 54–77). To detect only full-length Txl-2 selectively, the forward primer was 5′-TCGTCTTGATGTCCTCGAAAAGTAC-3′ (nucleotides 234–258), the reverse primer was 5′-CCTCTAACCACAGCCACCAGTT-3′ (nucleotides 323–302), and the Txl-2 long TaqMan probe was 5′-GAGCCAACCTTTCTGTTTTATGCAGGAGGAG-3′ (nucleotides 189–212). All TaqMan probes were fluorescein labeled with the reporter dye FAM and quencher dye TAMRA. All primer/probe sets were designed to cross an exon-intron boundary to prevent detection of genomic DNA. 90 μl of Mastermix containing 400 nm primers, 400 nm TaqMan probe, and 1× TaqMan Universal Mastermix (PE Applied Biosystems) was added to 1.8 μl of cDNA before aliquoting in triplicate to a 96-well microtiter plate. The cDNA was amplified using an ABI PRISM 7700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The amounts of GAPDH and Txl-2 mRNA were calculated using the standard curve method (separate tubes, following the instructions in User Bulletin 2; PE Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence intensity was measured during the PCR run. A graph was drawn with the threshold cycleCT value versus the logarithm of the amount of serially diluted control cDNA. Using this graph and theCT value of GAPDH and transforming acidic coiled-coil samples, the relative amount of TACC mRNA adjusted for GAPDH was calculated. All real time PCR experiments were carried out in triplicate and performed a minimum of three independent times with similar results. To determine the relative amounts of full-length and alternatively spliced Δ5Txl-2 in samples, plasmids containing either form were quantified and serially diluted to prepare standard curves for analysis at the same time as sample tissue cDNA. As a secondary control, samples were also prepared containing various mixtures of Txl-2 full-length and Δ5Txl-2 plasmids. Each sample was amplified using the Txl-2 primer and probe sets to determine the quantity of either total or full-length Txl-2. The ORF encoding human Txl-2 was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) and used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). A single positive colony was inoculated in 1 liter of LB medium plus ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.5. The production of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued for another 3.5 h. Overexpressing cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen until use. The cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl plus protease inhibitor mixture at the concentration recommended by manufacturer (Sigma). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml with stirring for 30 min on ice. 1% sarkosyl was added, cells were disrupted by a 10-min sonication, and the supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min and loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). Binding to the matrix was allowed to occur for 2 h at room temperature. Thrombin (5 units/mg of fusion protein) was used to remove glutathione S-transferase by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The resulting protein preparation was then subjected to ion exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and human Txl-2 was eluted using a gradient of NaCl. For gel filtration chromatography, the Txl-2 preparation from ion exchange chromatography was applied to a Superdex G-75 preparation grade column (Amersham Biosciences) under nondenaturing conditions, preequilibrated with the same buffer as the protein preparation. Protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 24,310m−1 cm−1, calculated with the Protean Program included in the DNASTAR Software Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). An identical protocol was used to purify the recombinant Δ5Trx-2 variant, and the protein concentration was determined using the same molar extinction coefficient as that of the full-length form. Reduced Txl-2 was prepared by incubation in the presence of 250 mm DTT on ice for 30 min, and unreduced controls were treated under identical conditions but in the absence of DTT. The samples were diluted 10 times with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 33% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot of 0.5 μl of this mixture was crystallized on a microcrystalline layer that had been prepared with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (Fluka) in ethanol (23Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The spectra were acquired using a Reflex III mass spectrometer from Bruker (Germany) and calibrated using the high mass protein standard from Aglient Technologies which contained 66,430.2-Da bovine serum albumin, 16,951.5-Da equine cardiac myoglobin, and 12,359.2-Da equine cardiac cytochrome c. Data processing and evaluation were carried out with the XMASS software from Bruker. Purified GST-hTxl-2 was used to immunize rabbits (Zeneca Research Biochemicals). After six immunizations, serum from rabbits was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Affinity-purified antibodies were prepared using a cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B column, onto which 0.5 mg of recombinant Txl-2 fragment had been coupled using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity of the antibodies was tested by Western blotting using recombinant and in vitro translated human Txl-2 and Δ5Txl-2. Immunodetection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1/5,000 following the ECL protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and CD mice were anesthetized, and testes and epididymes were fixed by perfusion through the abdominal aorta and heart, respectively, either with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 50 mm lysine, pH 7.4, or with 4% paraformaldehyde (mice only) or in Bouin's fixative (for light microscopy). Tissues destined for Lowicryl (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA) embedding (for electron microscopy) were immersed in the respective fixatives for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times in phosphate buffer, and incubated with phosphate buffer containing 50 mm NH4Cl for 1 h at 4 °C. Tissues were subsequently washed in buffer, dehydrated in graded methanol up to 90%, and infiltrated and embedded in Lowicryl K4M. Thin sections were mounted on Formvar nickel-coated grids for immunogold labeling. Bouin's fixed rat and human tissue were washed extensively in 75% alcohol before being completely dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue were washed in phosphate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. For light microscopic immunocytochemistry, 5-μm paraffin sections were deparaffinized and hydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentrations before immunoperoxidase localization with anti-Txl-2 antibody by standard procedures (24Oko R. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For electron microscopic immunocytochemistry ultrathin Lowicryl sections on Formvar nickel-coated grids were immunogold labeled according to the procedure of Oko et al. (25Oko R.J. Jando V. Wagner C.L. Kistler W.S. Hermo L.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1141-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Staging of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium and determining the steps of spermiogenesis were done according to the classifications of Leblond and Clermont (26Leblond C. Clermont Y. Am. J. Anat. 1952; 90: 167-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Adult C57BL/6 mice were were killed by cervical dislocation, the trachea was cannulated, and the cannula was tied firmly in place. The anterior chest wall was removed and the lungs dissected out. The lungs were infused via the tracheal cannula with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, at 20 cm H2O pressure and maintained at this pressure for 5 min. The lungs were subsequently kept in fixative overnight at 4 °C. After fixation the lungs were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol. Finally the lobes were separated and placed into individual cassettes and embedded in paraffin. The central portions of the blocks were sectioned at 5-μm intervals, and the sections were mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized, and hydrated before immunoperoxidase localization with anti-Txl-2 antibody. To block unspecific binding of secondary antibodies, sections were incubated in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum). Primary antibody was added at a 1/20 dilution in blocking solution, and in control experiments 0.03 mg/ml blocking peptide was included. After several washes, the Vectastain-ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, OH) was used for visualization. Sections were slightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Indirect immunogold labeling was used at the electron microscope level to localize Txl-2 specifically. Small pieces (1 mm3) of adult mouse lung were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m Sorensen's buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing in several changes of Sorensen's buffer at 4 °C, the tissues were dehydrated in a graded series of methanol at progressively lower temperatures to −20 °C. The tissue pieces were then infiltrated and embedded in Lowicryl K4M at −35 °C. Lowicryl blocks were polymerized by ultraviolet illumination for 24 h at −35 °C and an additional 48 h at −10 °C. Lowicryl thin sections were placed on Formvar nickel-coated grids and incubated face-down on drops of blocking solution consisting of 1% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with 100 mm sodium chloride. After 30 min, the grids were transferred to drops of primary antibody diluted 1:10 in blocking solution and left overnight in a humidity chamber at 4 °C. The following day, the grids were washed face-down on wells containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with 100 mm sodium chloride for 3 × 10 min. The grids were then incubated on blocking solution for an additional 30 min prior to being transferred to drops of secondary antibody (goat F(ab′)2 anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10 nm of colloidal gold; Ted Pella) diluted 1/30 in blocking solution. After 1 h, the grids were washed as described previously and then rinsed in distilled water. Immunolabeled sections were counterstained with methanolic uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. MTs were purified from rat and mouse brain essentially as described previously (27Junco A. Bhullar B. Tarnasky H.A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), resulting in MT preparations that contain MTs and MT-binding proteins including mitogen-activated proteins and kinesins. In short, brain samples were extracted in ice-cold BRB80 buffer containing protease inhibitors pepstatin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing depolymerized MTs were removed and stored on ice. MT extracts were next supplemented with 0.5 mm GTP, 15 units/ml hexokinase, and 20 mm d-glucose to deplete ATP. Next the extracts were warmed to 30 °C and 5 μm paclitaxel was added. After a 5-min incubation at 30 °C, 15 μm Taxol was added (20 μm total). 2 mm AMP-PNP was added to stabilize kinesin heavy chains on MTs. The extracts were layered onto sucrose cushions and spun at 40,000 rpm for 20 min at 22 °C. The cushion was washed twice with BRB80 before being removed to avoid contamination of the MT pellets. MT pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of BRB80 and depolymerized on ice for 20 min. 0.5 mmGTP and 2 mm AMP-PNP were added to the MT preparations. Extracts were warmed to 30 °C and polymerized and centrifuged as above. MT pellets were subjected to another round of depolymerization and polymerization as above. Final pellets of polymerized MTs were resuspended in 10% glycerol and BRB80 and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pure polymerized MTs were made from purified tubulin (CytoSkeleton Inc.) as follows: 10 μl of pure tubulin (10 mg/ml) was mixed in BRB80 buffer with 5 μl of glycerol and 3.3 μl of 0.15 mmpaclitaxel, and water was added to 50 μl. This reaction was incubated at 33 °C for 15 min. The mix was loaded on a glycerol cushion of equal volume and spun at 22,000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. The MT pellet was recovered and dissolved in 50 μl of BRB80 buffer and 10% glycerol. To analyze binding of Txl-2 and Δ5Txl-2 to MT, both forms were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]cysteine using the TNT reticulocyte transcription and translation system (Promega). Radiolabeled proteins were incubated with polymerized brain MTs or with pure MTs at 30 °C for 15 min in the presence of 2 mm AMP-PNP, 0.5 mm GTP, and 20 μm paclitaxel. MTs were pelleted at 30,000 rpm for 15 min at 22 °C. Supernatants were saved for SDS-PAGE analysis. Two subsequent pelleting reactions were performed. Aliquots of both supernatants and final pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels dried and exposed to KODAK BIOMAX film. Intensity of bands was quantitated by image analysis. In the indicated experiments MTs were preincubated with anti-Txl-2 antibodies or with human recombinant Txl-2. By sequence comparison with human Trx-1 (8Wollman E. d'Auriol L. Rimsky L. Shaw A. Jacquot J. Wingfield P. Graber P. Dessarps F. Robin P. Galibert F. Bertoglio J. Fradelizi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15506-15512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that GenBank expressed sequence tag entry AI341589 (from pooled germ cell tumors) encoded a putative novel human Trx-like sequence. Therefore, we designed specific primers based on the AI341589 sequence and performed 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR analysis using a human testis cDNA library to clone the full-length cDNA sequence of this novel protein. The complete sequence of the cDNA obtained consists of an ORF of 990 bp, a 5′-UTR of 27 bp, and a 3′-UTR of 432 bp upstream of the poly(A)+ tail (Fig.1A). In addition, the PCR also rendered a smaller band, which corresponded to a putative splicing variant (see below). Human Txl-2 ORF encodes a protein of 330 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 36.9 kDa and a pI of 4.73. Analysis of the human Txl-2 sequence identified two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (comprising the first 105 residues) similar to thioredoxins and a C-terminal domain composed of one NDP kinase domain (Fig. 1B). The domains are separated by a small interface domain. The Txl-2 protein domain organization resembles that of Sptrx-2 (14Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.J. Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), with the exception that Sptrx-2 has three NDP kinase domains. Regarding the N-terminal thioredoxin domain, some of the structural amino acids that are conserved in previously characterized mammalian thioredoxins (including Sptrx-2) such as Asp-26, Trp-31, Pro-75, or Gly-91 (numbers refer to those of human Trx-1) are also conserved in Txl-2. However, other residues shown to be essential for catalysis, maintenance of three-dimensional structure, or protein-protein interactions are substituted, for instance Phe-11, Ala-29, Pro-40, Asp-58, or Lys-81 (4Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2B of Ref. 14Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.J. Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Txl-2 C-terminal domain consists of one NDP kinase domain. Following the nomenclature for NDP kinase protein family, Txl-2 should be considered the ninth member of this family and therefore termed nm23-H9 (19Lacombe M.L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A protein alignment and phylogenetic analysis of all human NDP kinase domains show that Txl-2 belongs to NDP kinase Group II (Fig. 2, A and B) (19Lacombe M.L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The protein alignment of the Txl-2 domain with all of the previously identified thioredoxin proteins has been reported elsewhere (14Sadek C.M. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.J. Spyrou G. Miranda-Vizuete A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of human Txl-2 mRNA contains a short interspersed repetitive element of the Alu family spanning from base 1156 to 1439 (Fig. 1A). This is not the first report of the presence of such a repetition in a member of the N"

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of the IRAK-1/TRAF6 interaction are largely unknown. We have identified TIFA, a TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. The FHA domain is a motif known to bind directly to phosphothreonine and phosphoserine. In transient transfection assays, TIFA activates NFκΒ and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. However, TIFA carrying a mutation that abolishes TRAF6 binding or mutations in the FHA domain that are known to abolish FHA domain binding to phosphopeptide fails to activate NFκΒ and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. TIFA, when overexpressed, binds both TRAF6 and IRAK-1 and significantly enhances the IRAK-1/TRAF6 interaction. Furthermore, analysis of endogenous proteins indicates that TIFA associates with TRAF6 constitutively, whereas it associates with IRAK-1 in an IL-1 stimulation-dependent manner in vivo.

O'Neill L.A. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 933-943Google Scholar). The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have also recently emerged as critical molecules in the establishment of innate immune and inflammatory responses due to their ability to recognize various pathogen-associated molecules (2Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar). Thus, the Toll/IL-1 receptor family members play a critical role in the switch from innate to adaptive immunity. The signal transduction pathways of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family members consist of common intermediates including MyD88, members of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), whereas TLR3 and TLR4 have MyD88-independent pathways (3O'Neill L.A.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 969-971Google Scholar). Furthermore, the signaling cascade is evolutionarily conserved with that initiated by the Drosophila Toll receptor (2Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar). Therefore, the MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 pathway is an essential protein linkage required for the immune and inflammatory systems. IL-1 signaling is initiated by ligand-induced formation of a receptor complex that consists of the IL-1 receptor and IL-1 receptor accessory protein. Then, the cytosolic protein MyD88 (4Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 5Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Google Scholar) and Tollip (6Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Google Scholar) are recruited to this complex. MyD88 in turn recruits members of the IRAK family including IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-M (4Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X.

Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Google Scholar) via interaction between their death domains. IRAK-1 is activated presumably via phosphorylation by IRAK-4, leaving the receptor complex to interact with TRAF6. Subsequently, TRAF6 activates transforming growth factor ॆ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which activates a number of downstream signaling cascades, including those of IκB kinase, p38, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to the activation of transcription factors such as NFκB and AP-1 (10Ninomiya T.J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Google Scholar). All members of the IRAK family activate NFκΒ when overexpressed in cells. However, only IRAK-4 requires kinase activity to activate NFκΒ, and IRAK-4 phosphorylates IRAK-1 in vitro (9Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of IRAK-1, IRAK-2, or IRAK-M can restore IL-1-induced NFκΒ activation in IRAK-1-deficient cells, whereas IRAK-4 cannot compensate for the loss of IRAK-1. Thus, IRAK-4 may act upstream of IRAK-1 and phosphorylate IRAK-1 in a stimulation-dependent manner. TRAF6-deficient mice are defective in IL-1 signaling (11Naito A. Azuma S. Tanaka S. Miyazaki T. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 353-362Google Scholar, 12Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRAF6 activates TAK1 when TRAF6 was artificially oligomerized without IL-1 stimulation (13Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Google Scholar, 14Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Google Scholar). Although these recent data indicate that IRAK-1 and TRAF6 play pivotal roles in the Toll/IL-1 receptor signaling, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of TRAF6 with IRAK-1 released from the receptor complex and how the IRAK-1·TRAF6 complex activates downstream signals remain to be elucidated. In this study, we identified an adapter protein that is likely to link IRAK-1 to TRAF6 and activates TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation. Full-length mouse TRAF6 was subcloned into pBD-GAL4-Cam (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as bait in a two-hybrid screening of an ICR (8-week-old female) bone marrow cDNA library fused to the activation domain of Gal4 in pAD-GAL4–2.1 (Stratagene). The cDNA encoding human TIFA was identified from a human B-cell cDNA library. Sequence data for mouse, and human TIFA have been submitted to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM databases under accession numberAB062111 and AB062110, respectively. A mouse multiple tissue RNA blot (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was incubated with32P-labeled full-length mouse TIFA cDNA and ॆ-actin cDNA at 65 °C. The filter was washed with 0.5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.2 (w/v)7 SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. pME-FLAG-TRAF6 and pME-FLAG-TRAF6-(275–530) were described previously (15Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28745-28748Google Scholar). pME-FLAG-TIFA and pME-Myc-TIFA were constructed by insertion of a DNA fragment encoding FLAG- or Myc-tagged TIFA, respectively, into pME18S (16Shiio Y. Yamamoto T. Yamaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5206-5210Google Scholar). For expression of GST fusion proteins, a DNA fragment encoding GST-tagged TIFA or a mutant was inserted into pME18S. A cDNA encoding IRAK-1-(1–211) was cloned by PCR and inserted into pME18S. pEF-MyD88 and pEF-MyD88-(152–296) were kindly provided by S. Akira (Osaka University); pEF-TLR4 and pEF-MD-2 were provided by K. Miyake (University of Tokyo); pEF-TAK1, pEF-TAK1(K63W), and pEF-TAB1 were provided by K. Matsumoto (Nagoya University); pEF-IRAK-1 was provided by T. Naka (Osaka University); 3xκB-luc and 3xMκB-luc were provided by S. Miyamoto (University of Wisconsin); pEF-T7-JNK was provided by S. Ohno (Yokohama City University); pEF-Ubc13(C87A) was provided by Z. J. Chen (University of Texas). Anti-TRAF6, anti-IRAK-1, and anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-T7 antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) were purchased. Anti-GST, anti-TIFA, and anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) antibodies were generated by injection of recombinant GST protein or MBP-TIFA fusion protein into rabbits. For the GST pull-down assay, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pME-GST-TIFA and either pME-FLAG-TRAF6, pME-FLAG-TIFA, or pEF-IRAK-1. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 500 ॖl of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 17 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was used as a cell lysate. Cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and the GST fusion protein complexes were separated on 8.57 polyacrylamide/SDS gels. For analysis of the IRAK-1·TIFA·TRAF6 complex, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated combinations of pEF-IRAK-1, pME-Myc-TIFA, and pME-FLAG-TRAF6. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by the addition of anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated on 107 or 12.57 polyacrylamide/SDS gels. Cell lysates were also used to analyze the expression level of each protein. Establishment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and TRAF6-deficient MEFs and introduction of FLAG-TIFA into MEFs by retrovirus vector were performed as described (17Kobayashi N. Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1271-1280Google Scholar). Mouse 70Z and MEF cells were either untreated or treated with IL-1 (20 ng/ml) for 5 min. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1 ॖg of the appropriate antibody and 20 ॖl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates or whole-cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were immunoblotted with specific antibodies and visualized with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody and the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). MBP-tagged TIFA protein was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 and affinity purified with amylose resin (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). MBP-TIFA (24 ॖg) was cleaved with 2.4 units of PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h. Fifty microliters of the reaction mixture was applied to a Superdex 75 column (0.32 × 30 cm), and fractions (20 ॖl) were collected. The fractions were analyzed on 107 polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue Staining. Molecular weight marker proteins were analyzed under the column conditions described above. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 ng of 3xκB-luc or 3xMκB-luc (mutant κB sites), 10 ng of ॆ-actin-ॆ-galactosidase and the indicated amounts of various expression plasmids. Thirty-six hours after transfection, luciferase activity was measured with the PicaGene luciferase assay system (TOYO INK, Tokyo), and ॆ-galactosidase activity was used to standardize transfection efficiency. For thein vitro JNK kinase assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with 10 ng of pEF-T7-JNK and the indicated amounts of pME-FLAG-TIFA. Thirty-six hours after transfection, His-JNK was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 ॖg of GST-c-JUN (1–89) fusion protein (New England BioLabs) in 20 ॖl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 5 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol)) at 30 °C for 30 min. To identify the protein(s) that regulate association of IRAK-1 with TRAF6, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse bone marrow cDNA library using murine TRAF6 as bait. We identified a cDNA encoding a 184-amino acid protein, identical to T2BP previously identified as a TRAF2-binding protein, that activates NFκB and JNK in transient transfection assays (Ref. 18Kanamori M. Suzuki H. Saito R. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1108-1113Google Scholar and data not shown). Because the present study showed that T2BP associates with TRAF6 and a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of the T2BP (Fig.1A) is likely to play a critical role in the signaling (see 舠Discussion舡), we designated T2BP as a TRAF-interactingprotein with an FHA domain, TIFA. TIFA mRNA was expressed highly in spleen and moderately in other tissues, whereas it was not detectable in skeletal muscle (Fig.1B). FHA domains are conserved sequences of 60–100 amino acids found mainly in eukaryotic nuclear proteins (19Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Google Scholar) that participate in establishing or maintaining cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, or transcriptional regulation (20Li J. Lee G.I. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Google Scholar). More importantly, some of them were shown to bind directly to phosphoserine/phosphothreonine (Ser(P)/Thr(P)) residues (21Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar, 22Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7821-7826Google Scholar, 23Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Google Scholar) in the same way that SH2 domains interact with phosphotyrosine residues (20Li J. Lee G.I. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Google Scholar, 25Yaffe M.B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1999; 402: 30-31Google Scholar). To determine whether interaction of TIFA with TRAF6 is required for TIFA-induced NFκΒ and JNK activation, we identified the TRAF6 binding site in TIFA. Wild-type TIFA and various mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C) in conjunction with FLAG-TRAF6. Subsequent GST pull-down assays revealed that the carboxyl-terminal portion of TIFA (C domain) is sufficient for TRAF6 binding and that the amino-terminal portion (N domain) and the FHA domain are not necessary (Fig. 1D). Recent analysis of the crystal structure of the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 in complex with TRAF6-binding peptides from CD40 and RANK revealed that eight amino acid residues of the TRAF6-binding peptide contact the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 and identifiedXXPXEXX-(aromatic/acidic) as a consensus sequence for TRAF6 binding (26Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevede N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Substitution of Ala for Glu at the fifth amino acid position of the TRAF6 binding site in CD40 abolished binding to TRAF6 (27Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Google Scholar, 28Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1234-1239Google Scholar). A consensus TRAF6 binding motif is present in the C domain of both human and mouse TIFA (Fig. 1C). Substitution of Ala for Glu-178 (E178A) abolished binding of TIFA to TRAF6 (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with the notion that the TRAF domain of TRAF6 is responsible for binding to both CD40 (15Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28745-28748Google Scholar) and TIFA (data not shown). We then analyzed the ability of various TIFA mutants to activate NFκB and JNK. Both the FHA and the C domain were required, whereas the N domain was not necessary for NFκB activation (Fig.2A). GST-E178A did not activate NFκB or JNK (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that interaction of TIFA with TRAF6 is essential for TIFA-mediated NFκΒ and JNK activation. To clarify the role of the FHA domain of TIFA in NFκΒ and JNK activation, Gly-50 and Ser-66 were replaced with Glu and Ala, respectively (G50ES66A, Fig. 1,A and C), since identical mutations in the FHA domain of the Arabidopsis kinase-associated protein phosphatase abolished its binding to the phosphorylated receptor-like protein kinase (22Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7821-7826Google Scholar). Interestingly, GST-G50ES66A, which binds to TRAF6 (Fig. 1D), did not activate NFκB or JNK (Fig. 2,A and B), indicating that interaction of TIFA with TRAF6 is necessary but not sufficient for activation. Thus, the FHA domain of TIFA plays a critical role in the NFκB and JNK activation. TRAF6 transduces signals when oligomerized (13Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Google Scholar,14Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Google Scholar). Because a part of the expressed TIFA is phosphorylated (data not shown), homo-oligomerization of TIFA via the FHA domain/phosphopeptide interaction may facilitate or induce oligomerization of TRAF6. To address whether TIFA forms a homo-oligomer, the binding of FLAG-TIFA to various GST-TIFA mutants was analyzed (Fig.3A). GST-TIFA, but not GST, associated with FLAG-TIFA, indicating that TIFA forms a homo-oligomer. Both the FHA domain and the C domain were required, whereas the N domain was not necessary for the TIFA self-association. The structural requirement for the self-association is similar to that for NFκB and JNK activation, suggesting that the self-association of TIFA may be a prerequisite for activation of NFκB and JNK. However, GST-G50ES66A associated with FLAG-G50ES66A, suggesting that the FHA domain/phosphopeptide interaction is not likely to be involved in the self-association. More importantly, because the G50ES66A mutant does not activate downstream signals, homo-oligomer of wild-type TIFA and that of the G50ES66A mutant could have different physical properties. To address this question, recombinant TIFA was generated as an MBP-tagged protein with a cleavage site for human rhinovirus type-14 3C protease (29Walker P.A. Leong L.E. Ng P.W. Tan S.H. Waller S. Murphy D. Porter A.G. Biotechnology. 1994; 12: 601-605Google Scholar) at the junction (MBP-TIFA). Purified MBP-TIFA was digested almost completely by a fusion protein of GST with the 3C protease (GST-3C), and the reaction mixture was analyzed by Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3B, upper). According to the elution profile of the marker proteins, MBP (43 kDa) was present as a monomer, and GST-3C (46 kDa) formed a dimer. TIFA (24 kDa) was eluted at around fraction 14, which corresponds to TIFA trimer. However, when recombinant TIFA-G50ES66A protein was subjected to a similar experiment, the mutant protein was eluted at around fraction 7, which corresponds to TIFA pentamer or hexamer (Fig3B, lower). These results indicate that introduction of the G50ES66A mutation result in loss of the ability to form a trimer, presumably by altering the conformation of the FHA and the C domains, which are responsible for the self-association. Taken together, the self-association of TIFA may be required for activation of downstream signals, but the size or the conformation of homo-oligomer could be important. We next addressed whether TIFA interacts with IRAK-1. Coexpression of GST-TIFA with IRAK-1 followed by GST pull-down assay revealed that TIFA associates with IRAK-1 (Fig.4A). Both GST-G50ES66A and GST-E178A bind to IRAK-1 as efficiently as wild-type TIFA, indicating that the IRAK-1/TIFA interaction is not mediated by recognition of the phosphopeptide by the FHA domain. Because TIFA binds both TRAF6 and IRAK-1, we hypothesized that TIFA may affect the IRAK-1/TRAF6 interaction. To test this, the interaction between TRAF6 and IRAK-1 was analyzed in both the absence and presence of increasing expression of TIFA. Transfection experiments were carried out using 0.2 ॖg of TRAF6 and IRAK-1 expression vectors to minimize the IRAK-1/TRAF6 interaction in the absence of TIFA expression. The amount of IRAK-1 coprecipitated with TRAF6 was increased dramatically at the optimal expression of TIFA (Fig. 4B), indicating that TIFA, when overexpressed, can link TRAF6 to IRAK-1. For investigation of the physiological significance of the IRAK-1·TIFA·TRAF6 complex, the interactions of endogenous proteins were analyzed. For identification of endogenous TIFA protein, rabbit anti-TIFA polyclonal antibody was generated. When lysates prepared from 70Z mouse pre-B cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting with anti-TIFA antibody, two bands at ∼24 kDa that comigrated with protein expressed from TIFA cDNA in HEK293T cells were identified (Fig. 5A,left four lanes). These two bands were not observed when control IgG was used for immunoprecipitation, indicating that they represent endogenous TIFA. We next addressed whether TIFA interacts with TRAF6. Endogenous TRAF6 was immunoprecipitated from either unstimulated 70Z cells or from cells stimulated with IL-1 for 5 min, and coprecipitated TIFA was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-TIFA antibody. Similar amounts of TIFA were detected irrespective of IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 5A, right two lanes), indicating that TIFA interacts with TRAF6 constitutively in the 70Z pre-B cell line. To determine whether TIFA interacts with TRAF6 in a different cell type, wild-type MEF and TRAF6-deficient MEF (17Kobayashi N. Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1271-1280Google Scholar) were analyzed. Because the reactivity of anti-TIFA antibody was relatively weak, wild-type MEF and TRAF6−/− MEF expressing FLAG-TIFA were generated by retrovirus vector-mediated gene transfer. To avoid overexpression of FLAG-TIFA, infection with retrovirus carrying FLAG-TIFA and a puromycin resistance gene was performed with a low titer of virus followed by puromycin selection. The amount of FLAG-TIFA expressed in wild-type MEF and TRAF6−/− MEF was ∼3 times that of endogenous TIFA protein in MEF and, because of this low expression of FLAG-TIFA, the basal activity of NFκΒ and JNK in MEF was not affected (data not shown). Thus, we may characterize the FLAG-TIFA as endogenous TIFA. When lysates from wild-type or TRAF6−/− MEF were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-TRAF6 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody, TIFA was precipitated only in the presence of TRAF6 (Fig.5B). Therefore, anti-TRAF6 antibody did not immunoprecipitate TIFA directly due to its cross-reactivity. From these data, we conclude that TIFA binds TRAF6 constitutively both in 70Z pre-B cells and in MEF in vivo. We next investigated the interaction of TIFA and IRAK-1 in vivo. When FLAG-TIFA was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody from wild-type MEF in the absence or presence of IL-1 stimulation for 5 min followed by Western blotting with anti-IRAK-1 antibody, phosphorylated IRAK-1 was coprecipitated only in the presence of IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 5C). Because activated phospho-IRAK-1 is reported to be released from the receptor-MyD88 complex (5Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Google Scholar), it is possible that IRAK-1 associated with TIFA after release from the receptor complex, consistent with the previous finding that only activated phospho-IRAK-1 is coprecipitated with TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation (30Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Google Scholar). IRAK-1 was not precipitated from MEFs infected with control virus. These results clearly indicate that TIFA interacts with IRAK-1 in an IL-1 signal-dependent manner in vivo and suggest that TIFA links TRAF6 to IRAK-1 upon IL-1 stimulation. To further investigate the notion that TIFA functions by interacting with IRAK-1 and TRAF6, the effect of a dominant-negative mutant (DN) of TIFA and DN of previously identified proteins involved in IL-1 signaling on NFκB-mediated transcription was analyzed. GST-G50ES66A suppressed IL-1- and TLR4-induced NFκB activation but not TNFα-induced activation (Fig. 6A), suggesting that TIFA functions in TRAF6-mediated signaling. MyD88- and IRAK-1-induced NFκB activation was also suppressed by GST-G50ES66A, whereas TAK1/TAB1-induced activation (10Ninomiya T.J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Google Scholar) was not affected (Fig.6B, left, luciferase activity without GST-G50ES66A was set to 100). Unexpectedly, TRAF6-induced NFκB activation was further augmented by GST-G50ES66A (Fig. 6B,right, luciferase activity with reporter alone was set to 1), which binds to TRAF6 but does not activate NFκΒ without expressing exogenous TRAF6. Transfection of a suboptimal dose of TRAF6 leads to the activation of NFκΒ to some extent, suggesting that exogenously expressed TRAF6 can be partially activated presumably by its conformational change or by its oligomerization under this transient transfection condition. GST-G50ES66A may be able to activate partially activated exogenous TRAF6. TIFA-induced NFκB activation was blocked by TRAF6-DN and TAK1-DN (Fig. 6C). An inactive form of Ubc13 (Ubc13(C87A)) also suppressed TIFA-induced activation (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the TIFA signal leads to Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6, which is required for TAK1-mediated activation of IκB kinase and MKK6 (13Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Google Scholar, 31Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Google Scholar). TIFA-induced activation was not affected by MyD88-DN, but it was blocked by IRAK-1-DN (Fig. 6C). Because TIFA binds IRAK-1 when overexpressed (Fig. 4A), it is possible that IRAK-1-DN inhibited TIFA-mediated NFκΒ activation by interfering with the activation process of TIFA even if IRAK-1 functions upstream of TIFA in vivo. Taken together, these findings support the notion that TIFA links TRAF6 to IRAK-1. We report the identification of TIFA as a TRAF6-binding protein that can mediate IL-1 signaling. In transient transfection assays, TIFA binds both TRAF6 and IRAK-1. Furthermore, IRAK-1 is efficiently coprecipitated with TRAF6 under conditions of optimal TIFA expression. Thus, TIFA, when overexpressed, can link TRAF6 to IRAK-1 in the absence of IL-1 stimulation. By analyzing the interaction of endogenous TIFA with TRAF6 in two different types of cells, we showed that TIFA can bind TRAF6 irrespective of IL-1 stimulation. In contrast, interaction of TIFA and IRAK-1 is dependent on IL-1 stimulation in vivo. These results strongly suggest that TIFA links TRAF6 to IRAK-1 in an IL-1 stimulation-dependent manner in vivo. TIFA may play a similar role in the signaling from members of the TLR family, because the TLR signal transduction pathways are also mediated by IRAK-1 and TRAF6 (3O'Neill L.A.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 969-971Google Scholar, 32Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Mühlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Google Scholar). In fact, TLR4-mediated NFκB activation was inhibited by expression of the DN of TIFA. Thus, TIFA may function in innate immunity. Although T2BP, identical to TIFA, was shown to associate with TRAF2, when they overexpressed, the T2BP/TRAF2 interaction in vivo has never been demonstrated (18Kanamori M. Suzuki H. Saito R. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1108-1113Google Scholar). Nevertheless, TIFA may regulate both TRAF2 and TRAF6 in vivo. The association of signal transducers including kinases and adapter proteins is largely regulated through protein phosphorylation, allowing dissociation as the balance shifts from kinase to phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of proteins on serine and threonine residues has traditionally been recognized as a way to regulate enzyme conformation. Recent studies have revealed that serine/threonine phosphorylation can play critical roles in the formation of multimolecular signaling complexes through specific interaction of phosphorylated peptides and Ser(P)/Thr(P) binding modules including FHA domains, 14-3-3, WW domains, and WD40 and leucine-rich repeat domains (25Yaffe M.B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1999; 402: 30-31Google Scholar). Among the identified FHA domain-containing proteins, a specific target protein has been determined for some. In each case, phosphorylation-dependent interaction of the FHA domain with the target protein is thought to be responsible for the physiologically significant regulation of cell function (20Li J. Lee G.I. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Google Scholar). The FHA2 domain of Rad53p, a protein kinase involved in the DNA damage response and in cell cycle arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, binds Rad9p when Rad9p is phosphorylated by DNA damage signals. Mutation of the FHA2 domain of Rad53p abolishes DNA damage-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, indicating the biological relevance of the Rad53p-Rad9p interaction (21Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar). In addition, the FHA domain ofArabidopsis kinase-associated protein phosphatase interacts with a plasma membrane-integrated receptor, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase, when receptor-like protein kinase is autophosphorylated upon ligand binding (22Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7821-7826Google Scholar). Receptor-like protein kinase is a product of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) gene, mutations that result in plants with enlarged shoots and floral meristems (33Clark S.E. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 575-585Google Scholar). These observations and the fact that the G50ES66A mutant of TIFA is not able to activate NFκΒ or JNK suggest that a specific target protein for the FHA domain of TIFA may exist and play a role in the regulation of TIFA-mediated signaling. In this study, we identified three TIFA-binding proteins including TRAF6, IRAK-1, and TIFA itself. However, they were able to bind the G50ES66A TIFA mutant as well as wild-type TIFA, which suggests that none of them is a candidate protein that binds to the FHA domain in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Because TRAF6 transduces signals when oligomerized (13Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Google Scholar, 14Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Google Scholar) and recombinant TIFA can form trimers, one may postulate that TIFA is involved in the oligomerization of TRAF6 in concert with IRAK-1 to activate NFκΒ and JNK. Interestingly, recombinant TIFA G50ES66A mutant formed a pentamer or hexamer, not a trimer. Moreover, the G50ES66A mutant is able to activate NFκB in the presence of the suboptimal dose of TRAF6 but not in concert with endogenous TRAF6 in the absence of exogenous TRAF6. Given that transient transfection of the suboptimal dose of TRAF6 results in the partial activation of TRAF6, the intact structure of the FHA domain of TIFA may be required for the initial step of the TRAF6 activation that may require specific oligomer formation of TRAF6. Further studies are required to clarify exact roles of the FHA domain of TIFA; that is, binding to the putative phosphoprotein, holding the TIFA protein in an active conformation, or some other functions. Whether TIFA is essential for the IRAK-1/TRAF6 interaction or whether it stabilizes the interaction is not clear. One interesting possibility is that TIFA may augment the signal strength. IRAK-1 contains three consensus TRAF6 binding sites (26Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevede N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Google Scholar), and TIFA contains a single consensus TRAF6 binding site. Because TIFA and IRAK-1 interacts upon IL-1 stimulation, the number of TRAF6 molecules involved in signaling in cells abundantly expressing TIFA could be higher than that in cells with less TIFA expression. Furthermore, IRAK-1/TIFA interaction may induce their structural changes and increase their affinity for TRAF6. It is possible that the FHA domain of TIFA may bind to the substrate of IRAK-1 or IRAK-4, which leads to the stabilization of IRAK-1·TIFA·TRAF6 complex. It has been reported that kinase activity of IRAK-1 is not required for IL-1 signaling in a human embryonic kidney 293 cell line (34Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Google Scholar). Perhaps it can affect signal strength in other specific cell types. In this sense, it is interesting that TIFA is highly expressed in spleen but scarcely expressed in skeletal muscle. During the preparation of our manuscript, Pellino 1 was reported to be associated with IRAK-1·IRAK-4·TRAF6 complex in an IL-1 signal-dependent manner (35Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10952-10956Google Scholar). Thus, Pellino 1 and TIFA may have similar roles. However, they have distinct tissue specificities; Pellino 1 is weakly expressed in spleen but significantly expressed in skeletal muscle. TRAF6 is also involved in mediating signals from members of the TNF receptor superfamily, including CD40, RANK, X-linked ectodysplatin-A2 receptor (XEDAR), and p75 neutrophin nerve growth factor receptor (11Naito A.

Although a recent study showed that the p75 nerve growth factor receptor recruits IRAK-1 upon ligand stimulation (38Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Google Scholar), other receptors are thought to form trimers and do not require IRAK-1 (39Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiments, TIFA did not bind the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 or RANK, suggesting that TIFA may not be required for oligomerization of TRAF6 to transduce signals from members of the TNF receptor superfamily with the exception of the p75 nerve growth factor receptor. TIFA may regulate signals that are mediated by both TRAF6 and IRAK-1. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying TIFA signaling, especially to identify a role of the FHA domain, crystallographic studies of TIFA and identification of a target protein of the FHA domain are required. Further studies of TIFA may reveal a novel regulation of inflammation and innate immunity. We thank Z. J. Chen, S. Miyamoto, K. Miyake, S. Akira, K. Matsumoto, T. Naka, and S.

https://openalex.org/W2079832429,"While PDZ domain-containing proteins represent cellular targets for several different viral oncoproteins, including human papillomavirus E6, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax, and human adenovirus E4-ORF1, the functional consequences for such interactions have not been elucidated. Here we report that, at the plasma membrane of cells, the adenovirus E4-ORF1 oncoprotein selectively and potently stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), triggering a downstream cascade of events that includes activation of both protein kinase B and p70S6-kinase. This activity of E4-ORF1 could be abrogated by overexpression of its PDZ-protein targets or by disruption of its PDZ domain-binding motif, which was shown to mediate complex formation between E4-ORF1 and PDZ proteins at the plasma membrane of cells. Furthermore, E4-ORF1 mutants unable to activate the PI3K pathway failed to transform cells in culture or to promote tumors in animals, and drugs that block either PI3K or p70S6-kinase inhibited E4-ORF1-induced transformation of cells. From these results, we propose that the transforming and tumorigenic potentials of the adenovirus E4-ORF1 oncoprotein depend on its capacity to activate PI3K through a novel PDZ protein-dependent mechanism of action."

By using a T7 promoter-based system, TnaT with an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed at high levels in the membrane and was purified to near-homogeneity in high yield. γ-aminobutyric acid 5-hydroxytryptamine neurotransmitter:sodium symporter 2,4-dinitrophenol N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside serotonin transporter transmembrane dopamine transporter norepinephrine transporter Transporters responsible for reuptake of neurotransmitters across the plasma membrane of neurons and glia fall into two gene families (1Amara S. Nature. 1992; 360: 420-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The majority of small neurotransmitters, including glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA),1 dopamine, norepinephrine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), are transported by proteins belonging to the family designated the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family 2.A.22 by Saier (2Saier M.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75 Suppl. 32: 84-94Crossref Google Scholar). Glutamate, however, is transported by a family of mono- and dicarboxylic amino acid transporters, the dicarboxylate/amino acid:cation symporters family (2Saier M.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75 Suppl. 32: 84-94Crossref Google Scholar). Proteins in both families play important roles in brain function as indicated by the profound behavioral effects of drugs that influence their activity, such as cocaine and amphetamines, which interact with amine transporters in the NSS family (3Ritz M.C.

These orphans include v7-3 (18Uhl G. Kitayama S. Gregor P. Nanthakumar E. Persico A. Shimada S. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), NTT4 (19Liu Q.

Although these orphan sequences are highly similar to those encoding functional transporters, it is possible that these proteins fulfill other functions. For example, within the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters are the sulfonylurea receptor (24Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P.T. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator chloride channel (25Riordan J.R. Chang X.-B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 221-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the dicarboxylate/amino acid:cation symporters neurotransmitter transporter family is EAAT4, a ligand-gated ion channel (26Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar); SGLT3, a member of the sodium:solute symporter (SSS) sugar transporter family, also is not a transporter but rather a glucose-gated ion channel. 2A.

Biol. 1994; 49: 241-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and patched (29Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Cell. 1989; 59: 751-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) also have 12 transmembrane segments but no known transport function. For the orphan transporters in the NSS family, it is important to know if any of the newly discovered prokaryotic sequences actually encode functional transporters.Symbiobacterium thermophilum is a symbiotic thermophile, the growth of which is dependent on co-culture with an associatedBacillus strain (30Ohno M. Shiratori H. Park M.J. Saitoh Y. Kumon Y. Yamashita N. Hirata A. Nishida H. Ueda K. Beppu T. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2000; 50: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Suzuki S. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2353-2362Google Scholar). The 16 S rDNA-based taxonomy showed that S. thermophilum occupies a novel phylogenetic branch in the Gram-positive group without clustering with any other genus (30Ohno M. Shiratori H. Park M.J.

This bacterium produces a thermostable tryptophanase directed by the tna1 gene which, when cloned (32Hirahara T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 39: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was found to be part of a tna operon with an unusual gene organization. The operon differs from the conserved structure among enterobacteriaceae in that it consists of three open reading frames (33Martin K. Morlin G. Smith A. Nordyke A. Eisenstark A. Golomb M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the region downstream from the tryptophanase gene, this unique bacterium appears to encode a transporter, TnaT, that belongs, based on sequence homology, to the NSS family. 3K. Ueda and T. Beppu, GenBankTM accession number BAA24689.2.3K. Ueda and T. Beppu, GenBankTM accession number BAA24689.2. In this communication, we demonstrate that the tnaT gene encodes a Na+-dependent tryptophan transporter and that this transporter can be expressed in the cell membrane and purified in high yield.RESULTSS. thermophilum is a symbiotic thermophile (30Ohno M.

In cloning the tryptophanase gene from this organism, we discovered a downstream sequence with high homology to mammalian neurotransmitter transporters. The sequence was deposited as AB010832and identified as a putative tryptophan transporter by virtue of its location in the tryptophanase operon and its similarity to other transporters in the sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the sequence with the full consensus sequence of the NSS family (pfam00209) from the Conserved Domain data base (37Marchler-Bauer A. Panchenko A.R. Shoemaker B.A. Thiessen P.A. Geer L.Y. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and with the sequence of rat serotonin transporter (SERT), whose substrate, 5-HT, is closest to tryptophan among the known neurotransmitter transporters.Wild type E. coli cells express endogenous transporters capable of catalyzing tryptophan influx. Fig.2 shows a time course of tryptophan accumulation by E. coli K12 (open circles). To analyze tryptophan transport resulting from expression of the S. thermophilum tnaT gene, we used E. coli strain CY15212, obtained from the Yale E. coli Stock Center (CGSC 7672). This strain is inactivated in the three genes, mtr,tnaB, and aroP, that encode tryptophan transporters (38Yanofsky C. Horn V. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6009-6017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (squares), this strain is incapable of accumulating [3H]tryptophan. However, transformation of CY15212 with an expression plasmid encoding theS. thermophilum tnaT gene led to robust [3H]tryptophan uptake, as shown in Fig. 2 (filled circles).Figure 2Time course of tryptophan uptake.l-[5-3H]Tryptophan transport at room temperature was measured at the indicated times as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results are presented as the amount ofl-[5-3H]tryptophan taken up by the cells per mg of cell protein.

Data are means ± S.D. from six measurements in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A consequence of tryptophan uptake by cells expressing TnaT is that the transporter facilitated growth of cells on tryptophan-containing minimal media. Fig. 3 shows the dramatic increase in growth by BL21 cells transformed with pET26-TnaT over the first 12 h of incubation (filled circles) in contrast to the relatively slow growth in Trp-free medium or by control cells lacking the tnaT insert. The increase in cell growth indicates that tryptophan taken up by cells is accumulated within the cell where it can be metabolized and is not merely bound to the cell surface.Figure 3Stimulation of growth on tryptophan by TnaT. After an overnight aerobic culture of E. coliBL21(DE3) harboring pET-TnaT in LB medium, the cells were harvested by centrifugation followed by one wash with distilled water. The cells were then inoculated into Trp minimal medium containing (per liter); tryptophan, 5 g; K2HPO4, 11.2 g; KH2PO4, 4.8 g; (NH4)2SO4, 2 g; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.25 g; NaCl 0.5 g; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.5 mg; yeast extract (Difco) 0.05 g; and 1 mm IPTG at ∼5 × 105cells/ml and cultured aerobically at 37 °C for 2 days. Growth was measured by direct cell counting. Control BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET26b were used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Trp transport by TnaT was saturable, as shown in Fig.4.

The results are shown in Fig. 5. Aside from tryptophan, none of the amino acids tested significantly inhibited tryptophan influx. A small inhibition was observed with tryptamine and serotonin, and the concentrations of these amines that inhibited influx by 50% were found to be 200 ± 18 and 440 ± 16 μm, respectively (not shown). With one exception, inhibitors of mammalian biogenic amine transporters also failed to block TnaT-mediated tryptophan transport. The following compounds failed to inhibit at 100 μm (not shown): imipramine, desipramine, fluoxetine, citalopram, nomifensine, mazindol, GBR-12909, GBR-12935, amphetamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Cocaine (1 mm) also did not inhibit (not shown). Sertraline, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with nm affinity, inhibited tryptophan uptake with aKI of 98 ± 3 μm (not shown).Figure 5Substrate specificity of TnaT. CY15212 cells expressing TnaT were incubated withl-[5-3H]tryptophan in the absence (control) or presence of 100 μm of the indicated reagents. (The single letters correspond to individual amino acids according to the standard single letter code.) The incubation time was 20 s at room temperature, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are presented as the percentage of the control transport rate. Data are means ± S.D. from four measurements in two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In TM1 of all amino acid transporters in the NSS family, there is a glycine residue that is replaced by aspartate in the biogenic amine transporters. In TnaT, the corresponding residue is a glycine at position 24. Mutation of this residue to an aspartate led to a transporter that was unable to transport tryptophan (Fig.6A), serotonin, or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (not shown). This was not due to a block in expression because the His6-tagged G24D mutant was expressed in the membrane of CY15212 cells at 69 ± 15% (n = 3) of the level of wild type His6-tagged TnaT (Fig. 6B).Figure 6Tryptophan uptake and immunoblotting of wild type and G24D His6-TnaT expressed in the membrane of CY15212. His6-tagged wild type (WT) and G24D TnaT were expressed in CY15212 cells using the pQE82–6xHis-TnaT construct as described under “Materials and Methods.” A,l-[5-3H]tryptophan accumulation into CY15212 cells expressing His6-tagged wild type and G24D TnaT performed in parallel with samples used for the immunoblot inB. Total uptake in the wild type was ∼10 pmol per min per mg of total cell protein. B, membranes were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods,” and after solubilization the supernatant fluid was concentrated using nickel-Sepharose, and a representative immunoblot of the eluted material is shown in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A defining characteristic of the sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family is the requirement for sodium ions. In almost all of the family members studied, sodium is required, and the transmembrane sodium gradient provides a driving force for solute accumulation. In many of the transporters in this family, chloride ion is also required, and the Cl− gradient also provides part of the driving force. The data in Fig. 7show that TnaT absolutely requires Na+ but not Cl− for transport. Transport was minimal below 0.1 mm Na+ and was half-maximal at ∼1 mm Na+. The inset shows that influx was essentially the same in NaCl and sodium isethionate medium but was not detectable in medium in whichN-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl replaced NaCl. Thus, tryptophan transport catalyzed by the tnaT gene product was Na+-dependent but not Cl−-dependent.Figure 7Sodium and chloride dependence of TnaT-mediated tryptophan uptake. Main graph,l-[5-3H]tryptophan influx into CY15212 cells expressing TnaT was measured as described under “Materials and Methods” using the indicated concentrations of Na+. To adjust sodium concentration, NaCl was replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl. Nonlinear least squares fits of the data revealed that influx was half-maximal at 1.06 ± 0.07 mm Na+. Inset,l-[5-3H]tryptophan influx was measured in NaCl-containing buffer (NaCl), and in buffers where all Na+ was replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl (−Na), or where all Cl− was replaced by isethionate (−Cl). Transport activities are shown as a percentage of the control sample (NaCl). In both graphs, data are means ± S.D. from four measurements in two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Neurotransmitter transport utilizes transmembrane ion gradients. Within the NSS family, the coupled inward movement, or symport, of Na+ and neurotransmitter molecule is an almost universal feature. However, at least one member, the K+-coupled amino acid transporter, catalyzes substrate symport with K+ as well as Na+ (40Castagna M. Shayakul C. Trotti D. Sacchi V.F. Harvey W.R. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Most of the known transporters in the NSS family also require Cl−, which is symported with substrate in the cases that have been examined (41Rudnick G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Among bacterial transport systems, some are energized directly by ATP, whereas others are coupled to transmembrane ion gradients.As an approach to determine the driving force used by TnaT to accumulate tryptophan, we used 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a proton ionophore, to dissipate the transmembrane electrochemical potential for H+ (Δμ̃H+). As representatives of transporters coupled to ATP or to ion gradients, we used the histidine transporter, which is in the ATP-binding cassette family and known to be driven by ATP hydrolysis (42Ames G.F. Mimura C.S. Shyamala V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 429-446Crossref Google Scholar), and the proline transporter, a Na+-coupled symporter (43Ramos S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 44Cairney J. Higgins C.F. Booth I.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 22-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because dissipation of Δμ̃H+ can deplete ATP supplies by allowing futile H+ pumping through the F0F1-ATPase (45Hugenholtz J. Hong J.S. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3446-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we also includedN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) to inhibit the ATPase. The results in Table Idemonstrate that, in both the presence and the absence of DCCD, DNP strongly inhibited both proline and tryptophan accumulation while having virtually no effect on histidine transport. These results strongly suggest that TnaT-mediated tryptophan transport, like the endogenous proline transport of E. coli, is coupled to the transmembrane electrochemical Na+ potential, which depends on Δμ̃H+.Table IThe effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol on transport of histidine, proline, and tryptophanl-[2,5-3H]Histidinel-[U-14C]Prolinel-[5-3H]TryptophanControl100 ± 5100 ± 7100 ± 10DCCD103 ± 10103 ± 893 ± 7DNP102 ± 107.0 ± 0.115 ± 5DCCD → dNP91 ± 27.5 ± 0.615 ± 10CY15212 cells expressing TnaT were treated with DCCD (1 mm, 20 min), DNP (1 mm, 5 min), or DCCD followed by DNP, and accumulation of l-[2,5-3H]histidine,l-[U-14C]proline, andl-[5-3H]tryptophan was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Transport levels are shown as a percentage of the untreated control sample. Data are means ± S.D. from six measurements in three separate experiments. Open table in a new tab For purification of the TnaT protein, the gene was tagged at the N terminus with 6 histidine residues and expressed in BL21(DE3)/pLysE using a T7 promoter-mediated expression system as described under “Materials and Methods.” After induction by IPTG, the cells were disrupted; membranes were isolated, and the membrane proteins were extracted with dodecyl maltoside. The His-tagged TnaT protein was purified using nickel chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein migrated as a single band of ∼45 kDa relative to the predicted molecular size of the tagged construct of 57,258 kDa (Fig.8). In prokaryotic proteins the N-terminal Met is often cleaved, which would give a predicted mass of 57,127 kDa. Preliminary matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the purified TnaT gave a molecular mass of 57,012 ± 44 kDa (mean ± S.D., n = 2) or 99.8% of the predicted mass, suggesting that the protein is full-length and unmodified. From an initial culture of 1 liter, we obtained ∼0.5 mg of highly purified protein.Figure 8Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of nickel chromatography purification of TnaT.

To illustrate this observation, a BLAST search (46Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) of GenBankTM was performed using a highly conserved portion of the consensus sequence (37Marchler-Bauer A. Panchenko A.R. Shoemaker B.A. Thiessen P.A. Geer L.Y. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) for the NSS family. At the time the search was performed, it yielded, in addition to tnaT, more than 40 other sequences from bacteria and Archaea, although no significant matches were found in sequences from yeast, fungi, or plants. The sequence similarities between the predicted prokaryotic proteins, including TnaT, and mammalian members of the NSS transporter family are extensive (Fig. 1). For the 30 prokaryotic sequences with the greatest sequence similarity to the NSS family, the MEMSAT2 transmembrane topology prediction method (47Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) found 12 well aligned transmembrane domains (TM) in 12 of these sequences, including TnaT, 11 TMs in 16 other sequences, and 10 TMs in 2 sequences. The sequences containing fewer than 12 TMs lacked the last one or two TMs and were homologous with the 12 TM sequences through the first 10 or 11 TMs.The apparent variability in the lengths of these transporter-like sequences highlights the uncertainty regarding their function. Without an unequivocal demonstration that these sequences encode functional transporters, we cannot rule out the possibility that they are responsible for other membrane functions. The characterization of TnaT as a functional Na+-coupled tryptophan transporter opens up this large family of orphan transporters to experimental study. We hope that these studies will shed light also on the structure and function of eukaryotic NSS neurotransmitter transporters. For example, if we find that those proteins with 10 or 11 TMs are functional as transporters, it will help to define which TMs are required for substrate binding, ion coupling, and other functions.Like almost all of the transporters in the NSS family, TnaT required Na+ for its function, although unlike many other NSS transporters, we found that Cl− was not required (Fig. 7). Moreover, TnaT-mediated Trp influx saturates at relatively low concentrations (Fig. 4) and is highly selective, similar to other NSS transporters. This high degree of functional and sequence similarity between TnaT and the mammalian members of the NSS family is even more remarkable in light of the complete absence of homologous sequences in yeast, fungi, or higher plants. This situation was found also in the sodium:solute symporter family (2Saier M.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75 Suppl. 32: 84-94Crossref Google Scholar), which also has many members in prokaryotes and animals but almost none in yeast, fungi, or higher plants (48Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).One possible reason for the restricted distribution of this family to some prokaryotes and animals lies in the Na+ dependence of the NSS family. Prokaryotic and animal cells are known to maintain transmembrane Na+ gradients that are used for driving metabolite accumulation. Yeast and plants, however, extrude Na+ but rarely use solute-Na+ symport for metabolite accumulation (49Blumwald E. Aharon G.S. Apse M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 50Versaw W.K. Metzenberg R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3884-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If the coupling of substrate transport to Na+ is an integral property of NSS transporters, and they exclusively function, therefore, only as Na+ symporters, the restriction of their distribution to organisms that utilize a transmembrane Na+ gradient for metabolite transport would be understandable. This may also explain the distribution among prokaryotes. For example, among bacilli,Bacillus halodulans, an alkaliphilic species that uses the Na+ gradient as a driving force, has an NSS homologue (51Takami H. Nakasone K. Takaki Y. Maeno G. Sasaki R.

A consequence of this explanation, however, is that all bacterial NSS proteins should catalyze Na+ symport, a prediction that we are currently testing.There is a high degree of sequence identity between TnaT and mammalian transporters for serotonin (21%), and dopamine (24%), and the consensus NSS sequence from the Conserved Domains data base (37Marchler-Bauer A.

https://openalex.org/W2039570783,"We investigated the role of cdc42, a Rho GTPase family member, in insulin-induced glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Microinjection of anti-cdc42 antibody or cdc42 siRNA led to decreased insulin-induced and constitutively active Gq (CA-Gq; Q209L)-induced GLUT4 translocation. Adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active cdc42 (CA-cdc42; V12) stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake to 56% of the maximal insulin response, and this was blocked by treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor, wortmannin, or LY294002. Both insulin and CA-Gq expression caused an increase in cdc42 activity, showing that cdc42 is activated by insulin and is downstream of Gαq/11 in this activation pathway. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that insulin enhanced a direct association of cdc42 and p85, and both insulin treatment and CA-cdc42 expression stimulated PI3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates with anti-cdc42 antibody. Furthermore, the effects of insulin, CA-Gq, and CA-cdc42 on GLUT4 translocation or 2-deoxyglucose uptake were inhibited by microinjection of anti-protein kinase Cλ (PKCλ) antibody or overexpression of a kinase-deficient PKCλ construct. In summary, activated cdc42 can mediate 1) insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and 2) glucose transport in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner. 3) Insulin treatment and constitutively active Gq expression can enhance the cdc42 activity state as well as the association of cdc42 with activated PI3-kinase. 4) PKCλ inhibition blocks CA-cdc42, CA-Gq, and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Taken together, these data indicate that cdc42 can mediate insulin signaling to GLUT4 translocation and lies downstream of Gαq/11 and upstream of PI3-kinase and PKCλ in this stimulatory pathway.

Insulin stimulates glucose transport in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by inducing the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (1Birnbaum M.J.

Although the signaling pathways and the dynamics of GLUT4 movement have been intensively studied, the precise mechanisms of GLUT4 translocation remain incompletely understood.

This PI3-kinase-independent pathway involves insulin-mediated localization of CAP-Cbl complexes to membrane rafts with subsequent recruitment of CrkII-C3G to these structures, leading to activation of the small Rho family GTPase, TC10. Insulin-stimulated cortical actin remodeling and polymerization are necessary for the final steps of GLUT4 movement to the plasma membrane, and it has been proposed that TC10 interacts with neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein in an insulin-dependent manner to mediate cortical actin polymerization (18Jiang Z.Y. Chawla A. Bose A. Way M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cdc42, another member of the Rho GTPase family, has 69% homology and 86% similarity to TC10 (16Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Insulin can stimulate cdc42 activity, and cdc42 can facilitate actin rearrangement (19Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bradykinin, a GPCR agonist that couples into Gαq/11, can stimulate glucose transport and actin remodeling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (20Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Since it has been shown that cdc42 can mediate the effects of bradykinin-stimulated Gαq/11 on actin remodeling (21Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that cdc42 might also mediate signals to GLUT4 translocation. In the current study, we show a novel role for cdc42 as a downstream activator of Gαq/11, which can mediate GLUT4 translocation in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Mouse monoclonal anti-cdc42 and anti-p85 antibodies (N-SH2), cdc42 assay kit, and protein A-agarose were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody was purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαq/11, anti-p110α, and anti-cdc42 (P1) antibodies, goat polyclonal anti-cdc42 (C20) antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-cdc42 antibody (B8), and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Sheep IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. All radioisotopes were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The GTPase-deficient (constitutively active) Q209L mutant Gαq expression vector and recombinant adenoviruses were described elsewhere (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K.

Adenoviruses encoding constitutively active and kinase-deficient PKCλ were kindly provided by Dr. Wataru Ogawa (Kobe University, Japan), and adenoviruses encoding constitutively active cdc42 and dominant negative cdc42 were kindly provided by Dr. James R. Bamburg (Colorado State University). 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 100 μm LY294002, 100 or 300 nm wortmannin, 50 μm PD98059, or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle for 1 or 4 h before each assay. For adenovirus infection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transduced for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium with 5% heat-inactivated serum with the following multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) and with either the recombinant adenovirus of wild type-Gαq (40 m.o.i.), constitutively active mutant-Gαq (Q209L) (40 m.o.i.), constitutively active cdc42 (V12) (40 or 80 m.o.i.), dominant negative cdc42 (N17) (80 m.o.i.), constitutively active PI3-kinase (P110-CAAX) (40 m.o.i.), constitutively active PKCλ (80 m.o.i.) or kinase-deficient PKCλ (10–100 m.o.i.), or a control recombinant adenovirus of GFP. The total amount of adenovirus was adjusted to the same m.o.i. with control adenovirus in each experiment. Transduced cells were incubated for 48 or 60 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium with 10% heat-inactivated serum, followed by incubation in the starvation media required for the assays. The efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was above 90% as measured by histocytochemical staining of LacZ-infected cells with β-galactosidase, as we reported previously (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The procedure for glucose uptake was described previously (22Takano A. Usui I. Haruta T. Kawahara J. Uno T. Iwata M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5050-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with some modifications. After 60 h of adenovirus infection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 3 h, and the cells were stimulated with 0.5 or 17 nm insulin in KRP-Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 131.2 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4) for 30 min at 37 °C. The procedure for stimulation by osmotic shock was the same as described previously (23Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose uptake was determined in triplicate at each point after the addition of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (0.1 μCi, final concentration 0.1 mm) in KRP-Hepes buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. Microinjection was carried out using a semiautomatic Eppendorf microinjection system. Antibodies for microinjection were concentrated and dissolved at 5 mg/ml in microinjection buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl and were injected into the cytoplasm. Five mg/ml sheep IgG was injected into the control cells. siRNA for cdc42 (guuauccacagacagaugutt), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (cgagaguucucgcuggacutt), and insulin receptor (tataccatgaattccagcaactt) were purchased from Dharmacon. siRNAs were dissolved at 5 μm in microinjection buffer. Immunostaining of GLUT4 was performed essentially as described (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with insulin for 20 min at 37 °C and were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Following washing, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 2% fetal calf serum in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-GLUT4 antibody in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum overnight at 4 °C. After washing, GLUT4 and injected IgG were detected by incubation with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-sheep antibody, respectively, followed by observation under an immunofluorescence microscope. In all counting experiments, the observer was blinded to the experimental condition of each coverslip. Serum-starved 3T3-L1 cells were stimulated with 17 nm insulin at 37 °C for various times as indicated in each experiment. The cells were lysed in solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm NaF, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (20–50 μg of protein) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) using Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with specific antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies followed by chemiluminescence detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). After 48 h of adenovirus infection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved for 16 h and stimulated with insulin (17 nm) for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold PBS, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (300–500 μg of total protein) with anti-cdc42 or anti-p110α antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-plus agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were washed with the following buffers: (i) PBS, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4; (ii) 100 mmTris, 0.5 m LiCl, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4; and (iii) 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4. Immunoprecipitates were washed mildly (once with each washing buffer) only in the experiment using LY294002, whereas they were washed more strictly (twice with each buffer) in the other experiments, because LY294002 was a reversible inhibitor. The washed immunocomplexes were incubated with phosphatidylinositol for 5 min and then with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 8 nHCl, mixed with 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1). Samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was applied to a silica gel TLC plate that had been coated with 1% potassium oxalate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and exposed to an x-ray film. PI3-kinase activity was quantitated by scanning the film using NIH Image. Cdc42 activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After 48 h of adenovirus infections, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved for 16 h and stimulated with 17 nm insulin for the indicated times, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 mm NaF for 15 min at 4 °C. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. For a negative control, cell lysate was incubated with 1 mm GDP for 15 min at 30 °C. Five μg of PAK1-agarose beads, which specifically bound to active cdc42 (24Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), were added to the cell lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed with lysis buffer three times and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cdc42 antibody. To evaluate the role of cdc42 in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we conducted single cell microinjection studies using mouse monoclonal (B8) or goat polyclonal (C20) anti-cdc42 antibody, followed by immunofluorescence staining with GLUT4 antibody in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.1A). In the basal state, most of the cells display GLUT4 staining in the perinuclear region, and after insulin stimulation there is a marked increase in the proportion of cells demonstrating GLUT4 localization at the plasma membrane as a circumferential ring, as described previously (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Microinjection of either mouse monoclonal or goat polyclonal anti-cdc42 antibody decreased 1.7 nm insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by 60–75%. To demonstrate further the importance of cdc42 for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we utilized siRNA to knock down cdc42 expression followed by measurement of GLUT4 translocation (Fig.1B). siRNA directed against cdc42 was microinjected into the cytoplasm of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and 72 h later, GLUT4 translocation was measured. As seen in Fig. 1B, cdc42 siRNA led to a 65% decrease in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. As a positive control, siRNA against the insulin receptor was injected, which completely abolished insulin stimulation. As a negative control, siRNA against silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor, a transcription co-regulating molecule, was also injected and had no effect. To examine further the role of cdc42 in insulin-induced glucose transport, we next measured 2-DOG uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with adenovirus vectors containing either constitutively active cdc42 (CA-cdc42; V12) or dominant negative cdc42 (DN-cdc42; N17). As shown in Fig. 1C, infection of CA-cdc42 at 80 m.o.i. increased 2-DOG uptake to 61% of the maximal insulin response in the basal state and further enhanced 2-DOG uptake stimulated by submaximal insulin (0.5 nm). Interestingly, adenovirus-mediated expression of DN-cdc42 was without effect on insulin stimulation of glucose transport. Taken together, these results suggest that cdc42 plays an important role in insulin signaling leading to GLUT4 translocation. As we reported recently (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), an adenovirus encoding constitutively active Gq (CA-Gq; Q209L) stimulated GLUT4 translocation to 60% of the maximal insulin response, showing a role for Gαq/11 in this insulin action. In order to examine whether cdc42 is downstream of Gαq/11, we microinjected mouse monoclonal anti-cdc42 antibody (B8) into cells infected with CA-Gq or CA-cdc42, and similar to the results with insulin- or CA-cdc42 stimulation, anti-cdc42 antibody injection inhibited CA-Gq-induced GLUT4 translocation (Fig.2). To assess further the relative loci of Gαq/11 and cdc42 in this pathway, we microinjected anti-Gαq/11 antibody into cells stimulated by CA-cdc42, CA-Gq, or insulin. Anti-Gαq/11 antibody injection inhibited insulin- or CA-Gq-induced GLUT4 translocation but did not inhibit the effects of CA-cdc42 (Fig. 2). These data provide further evidence that cdc42 is downstream of Gαq/11 in mediating insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. We next examined the effects of the PI3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, on CA-cdc42-induced 2-DOG uptake (Fig.3A). In the absence of insulin, expression of CA-cdc42 increased 2-DOG uptake in a dose-responsive manner with 40 and 80 m.o.i. stimulating to 39 and 56% of the maximal insulin response, respectively. Incubation of the cells with 100 nm wortmannin or 100 μmLY294002 for 1 h did not alter 2-DOG uptake stimulated by CA-cdc42 expression, whereas it completely inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, when the cells were incubated with these inhibitors for 4 h, not only insulin-induced but also CA-cdc42-induced 2-DOG uptake was inhibited to basal levels. As reported previously (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), overexpression of CA-Gq enhanced 2-DOG uptake, and this was also inhibited by incubation with 100 nm wortmannin or 100 μm LY294002 for 4 h but not for 1 h. As expected, incubation with a MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, for 4 h did not affect 2-DOG uptake stimulated by insulin, CA-cdc42, or CA-Gq expression (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that activated cdc42 and Gαq/11 can stimulate glucose uptake in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Because the lower doses of wortmannin and LY294002 took 4 h to reach their maximal effects, we further examined the time course and dose dependence of PI3-kinase inhibition on 2-DOG uptake in cells expressing CA-cdc42 as well as constitutively active PI3-kinase (p110-CAAX). As seen in Fig. 3B, 48 h after expression of CA-cdc42, cells were treated with 100 or 300 nmwortmannin for 1–4 h, and 2-DOG uptake was measured. The CA-cdc42-induced increase in glucose transport was maximally inhibited at 300 nm at the first time point, and at the lower dose (100 nm) transport was inhibited in a gradual, time-dependent manner reaching maximal inhibition by 4 h. Constitutively active PI3-kinase (p110-CAAX) expression is known to stimulate 2-DOG uptake in 3T3-L1 cells, and the same inhibitory experiments were performed in p110-CAAX-expressing cells with essentially identical results (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that in cells manifesting chronic PI3-kinase activation, there is a time- and dose-dependent effect of these inhibitors to suppress glucose transport. This is in contrast to acute effects of insulin to stimulate transport, which can be inhibited rapidly at a low or high dose of PI3-kinase inhibitors. To exclude the possibility that the decrease in CA-cdc42- or CA-Gq-induced 2-DOG uptake after 4 h of treatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitors might be because of the toxicity or the nonspecific effects on general trafficking systems, 2-DOG uptake stimulated by osmotic shock was measured after 4 h of treatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitors. Osmotic shock stimulates glucose transport predominantly through a PI3-kinase-independent mechanism, and as seen in Fig. 3D, pretreatment with 100 nmwortmannin or 100 μm LY294002 for 4 h did not inhibit osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. Because our data indicate that glucose uptake induced by CA-cdc42 and CA-Gq involves common mechanisms, we further examined the relationship between cdc42 and Gαq/11 before and after insulin stimulation. We measured the time course of insulin-induced cdc42 activation using GST-PAK1 as a substrate, which specifically binds to active cdc42 (24Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4A, insulin rapidly stimulated cdc42 activity with a maximal response at 1 min, returning to basal levels thereafter. We showed recently (6Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) that insulin treatment led to tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11, and this could activate Gαq/11 as a positive signaling molecule. Interestingly, the time course of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 was comparable with the time course of cdc42 activation (Fig. 4A). Cdc42 activity was also measured in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after adenovirus expression of wild type or constitutively active Gq, before and after insulin stimulation for 1 min (Fig. 4B). Expression of CA-Gq stimulated cdc42 activity in the basal state and enhanced the effect of insulin compared with control cells. These data show that cdc42 is activated by insulin and Gαq/11, further suggesting the concept that cdc42 is downstream of Gαq/11 in the insulin signaling cascade. We also assessed the activity of DN-cdc42 by using this method. As can be seen in Fig.4C, expression of CA-cdc42 resulted in increased cdc42 activity in the absence of insulin, whereas expression of DN-cdc42 at 80 m.o.i. inhibited the effect of insulin to activate cdc42. Since it has been shown in other systems that cdc42 can bind to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase and stimulate PI3-kinase activity (25Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between cdc42 and PI3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fig.5A shows the co-precipitation of p85 in anti-cdc42 immunoprecipitates after insulin stimulation. Association of p85 with cdc42 was barely detected in the basal state and was increased by insulin stimulation, with a maximal association at 10 min. Next, we directly measured PI3-kinase activity associated with cdc42 (Fig. 5, B and C). Insulin increased the PI3-kinase activity in anti-cdc42 immunoprecipitates by 2.8-fold with a maximal response by 10 min. Expression of CA-cdc42 and CA-Gq (40 m.o.i.) stimulated PI3-kinase activity in the absence of insulin by 4.4- and 4.2-fold, respectively. Incubation of the cells with 100 nm wortmannin for 4 h inhibited PI3-kinase activity stimulated by either CA-Gq, CA-cdc42, or insulin (Fig. 5B), while 1 h of treatment with wortmannin inhibited only insulin stimulation (data not shown). Comparable results were obtained when 100 μm LY294002 was used (Fig. 5C). As with the glucose transport data presented in Fig. 3, inhibition of cdc42-associated PI3-kinase activity was not complete until 4 h after treatment with 100 nm wortmannin or 100 μm LY294002. To study the dose response and time course of this inhibition, CA-cdc42 and p110-CAAX-expressing cells were treated with wortmannin at 100 or 300 nm for up to 4 h, followed by measurement of cdc42-a"

Wild type and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) responded to plicatamide exposure with a massive potassium efflux that began within seconds. Soon thereafter, treated bacteria largely ceased consuming oxygen, and most became nonviable. Native plicatamide also formed cation-selective channels in model lipid bilayers composed of bacterial lipids. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus treated with plicatamide for 5 min contained prominent mesosomes as well as multiple, small dome-shaped surface protrusions that suggested the involvement of osmotic forces in its antimicrobial effects. To ascertain the contribution of the C-terminal dcΔDOPA residue to antimicrobial activity, we synthesized several analogues of plicatamide that lacked it. One of these peptides, PL-101 (Phe-Phe-His-Leu-His-Phe-His-Tyr-amide), closely resembled native plicatamide in its antimicrobial activity and its ability to induce potassium efflux. Plicatamide was potently hemolytic for human red blood cells but did not lyse ovine erythrocytes. The small size, rapid action, and potent anti-staphylococcal activity of plicatamide and PL-101 make them intriguing subjects for future antimicrobial peptide design.

Craig A.G. Taylor S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the preceding sequence, dcΔDOPA indicates decarboxy-(E)-α,β-dehydro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. Although the sequence of plicatamide did not resemble a conventional antimicrobial peptide, we examined its antimicrobial properties because hemocytes are key participants in innate antimicrobial defenses. Despite its small size, plicatamide proved to be a potent, rapidly acting, and broad spectrum antimicrobial. We also prepared the following four synthetic analogues that differed from plicatamide only in their C-terminal residue: tyrosine amide in PL-101; tyrosine acid in PL-102; DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) acid in PL-103; and DOPA-amide in PL-104. Of these octapeptides, PL-101 most closely simulated the antimicrobial properties of native plicatamide. This report will describe the effects of plicatamide on staphylococci. Native plicatamide was purified from freshly harvested hemocytes (blood cells) of S. plicata as described recently (1Tincu J.A. Craig A.G. Taylor S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We determined their peptide content either by performing quantitative amino acid analysis or by doing analytical reverse phase-HPLC on a C18 column and then computing and comparing the area under the curve (AUC) at 215 nm with the AUC of an appropriate standard previously subjected to quantitative amino acid analysis. The synthetic peptides used in our initial experiments were custom-synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry at Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and purified to homogeneity by reverse phase-HPLC. Mushroom tyrosinase (6680 units/mg) was purchased from Sigma, and all other reagents were of analytical grade. Mushroom tyrosinase (Sigma) was used to prepare PL-103 and -104 (Table I) by converting the C-terminal tyrosine of PL-101 and -102 to DOPA (2Craig A.G. Taylor S.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 3Taylor S.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the synthetic peptides (1 mg/ml, final concentration) were dissolved in 10 ml of 20 mm borate, 0.1m phosphate/ascorbate buffer, pH 7.0, in a plastic reaction vessel. Before starting the reaction by adding 100 μg/ml (final concentration) of mushroom tyrosinase (Sigma, 6680 units/mg), we removed a 50-μl aliquot and acidified it with 2 μl of 6n HCl. Tyrosinase reactions were run at room temperature under a stream of humidified air. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed every 20 min and subjected to analytical reverse phase-HPLC to monitor the progress of the reaction. This chromatography was performed over 50 min on a Phenomenex Jupiter Series 4.6 × 250-mm analytical C-18 column (10 μm, 300-Å pore size), using a 0–40% linear gradient of water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to acetonitrile in 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid. After 60 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 6 n HCl, and the mixture was desalted by loading it directly onto a Sep-Pac Vac 1-g (6 ml) cartridge (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). After washing the cartridge with 20 ml of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were eluted with 10 ml of 60% acetonitrile containing 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid. Subsequent purification was obtained by multiple runs on a 10 × 250-mm C-18 reverse phase-HPLC column. The peptide sequences were checked by tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ Ion Trap Instrument. Subsequent batches of PL-101 were synthesized in our UCLA laboratory on an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer using FastMocTM chemistry and purified by reverse phase-HPLC as described above.Table IPeptides used in this studyPeptideResidues 1–7Residue 8PlicatamideFFHLHFHdcΔDOPAPL-101FFHLHFHTyrosine amidePL-102FFHLHFHTyrosine acidPL-103FFHLHFHDOPA acidPL-104FFHLHFHDOPA amidePlicatamide was purified from the hemocytes of S. plicata.All other peptides were synthetic and were prepared as described in the text. Open table in a new tab Plicatamide was purified from the hemocytes of S. plicata.All other peptides were synthetic and were prepared as described in the text. The assay has been described elsewhere (4Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Our Gram-positive test organisms wereStaphylococcus aureus 930918-3, MRSA ATCC 33591, a methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain, and Listeria monocytogenes, strain EGD. In some experiments we also testedEscherichia coli, ML-35p, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MR3007, a strain that was resistant to many conventional antibiotics. Native plicatamide was serially 3.16-fold diluted with 0.01% acetic acid that contained 0.1% human serum albumin to minimize its nonspecific adsorption to plastic tubes. Organisms were grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 37 °C in trypticase soy broth. After they were washed with 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, ∼4 × 106 bacterial colony-forming units (CFU) were incorporated into 10 ml of the underlay gel mixture. Unless otherwise stated, the underlay gels also contained 1% w/v agarose (Sigma A-6013), 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.3 mg/ml trypticase soy broth powder. Some underlay gels were supplemented with 100, 175, or 250 mmNaCl. A 6 × 6 array of sample wells, each 3.2 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm deep, was punched in the underlay gel. These allowed 8-μl aliquots of each dilution to be introduced. After the plates had incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, a nutrient-rich overlay gel (60 mg/ml trypticase soy broth powder in 1% v/v agarose) was poured, and the incubation was continued overnight to allow surviving organisms to form microcolonies. The diameters of completely clear zones were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm and expressed in units (1 unit = 0.1 mm), after first subtracting the well diameter. Because a linear relationship exists between the zone diameter and the log10of the peptide concentration, the X intercept of this line was determined by a least mean squares fit and was considered to represent the minimal effective concentration (MEC). Stationary or mid-logarithmic phase bacteria were prepared as described above and incubated with antimicrobial peptides at 37 °C in an agarose-free liquid medium containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, or Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and such other additions as are described in the text. Aliquots (20 μl) were removed at intervals, diluted appropriately, and transferred to nutrient agar plates with a Spiral Plater (Spiral Biotech, Rockville, MD). Colonies were counted after overnight incubation at 37 °C. These assays used cation-adjusted, Mueller Hinton II Broth (BD Biosciences) and were performed according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (5National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Wayne, PA1993Google Scholar), except that the 10× stock plicatamide was prepared and serially diluted in acidified water (sterile 0.01% acetic acid) instead of in Mueller Hinton II Broth. Test organisms were incubated overnight in 50 ml of trypticase soy broth at 37 °C, washed three times with buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4), and resuspended in this buffer at ∼2.5 × 108 CFU/ml, based on A620. Experiments were done at 37 °C in stirred polypropylene tubes surrounded by a 50-ml water-jacketed reaction vessel (Kimble/Kontes, Vineland, NJ). The tube contained 6 × 107 CFU of washed, stationary phase bacteria in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 250 μl. An Orion SensorLink PCM-700 pH/ISE meter, fitted with a MI-442 potassium electrode (Microelectrodes, Bedford, NH) and an SDR-2 reference electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), was used as described previously (6Orlov D.S. Nguyen T. Lehrer R.I. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2002; 49: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption by washed, stationary phase bacteria was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Ltd., Norfolk, UK). Briefly, an overnight culture of MRSA was twice washed with PBS and adjusted to 3 × 108 CFU/ml in this medium. After adding bacteria (1 ml) to the continuously stirred chamber, we added 10 μl of full strength trypticase soy broth, and we measured the basal rate of O2 consumption at room temperature for 5–10 min before adding peptide (10 μg/ml final concentration). The cytotoxicity of plicatamide for ME-180 (ATCC HTB-33) human cervical epithelial target cells was assessed with an MTT-tetrazolium reduction assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Target cells were grown to confluency in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin and harvested with trypsin/EDTA. After washing them with this medium, their concentration and viability (trypan blue exclusion) was determined, and they were suspended at 5 × 104 cells/ml. Cell aliquots (100 μl) were dispensed into 96-well tissue plates (Corning Glass) and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in room air with 5% CO2 before the peptides were added. After 20 additional hours of incubation, we added 10 μl of MTT solution, followed 4 h later by 100 μl of extraction buffer. After overnight extraction of the reduced MTT-tetrazolium, absorbance was measured at 600 and 650 nm, on a Spectramax 250 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Hemolytic activity was tested by incubating various concentrations of peptide with a suspension (2.8% v/v) of washed human or sheep red cells in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. After 30 min at 37 °C, the tubes were centrifuged, and the absorbance (A) of the supernatants was measured. The percentage of hemolysis was calculated by Equation 1, whereAexper and Acontrolsignify the absorbance values of supernatants from treated and untreated red cells, and Atotal is the supernatant of red cells treated with 0.1% Triton X-100.%release=((Aexper−Acontrol)/(Atotal−Acontrol))×100Equation 1 For transmission electron microscopy, 5 × 108bacterial CFU/ml were exposed at room temperature to 42.5 μg/ml native plicatamide in PBS (100 mm NaCl and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) containing 1% v/v trypticase soy broth. At intervals, 1-ml aliquots were removed, centrifuged briefly at 2000 × g, and immediately resuspended in 1 ml of freshly made 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. After 30 min on ice, the fixed organisms were washed in PBS. For scanning EM, 10% of the above bacteria were adhered for 30 min to mixed cellulose ester membrane filters with 0.025-μm pores (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series into hexamethyldisilane. After carbon coating, the samples were viewed on a Cambridge Stereoscan Electron Microscope. The remaining bacteria were washed in PBS, post-fixed for 45 min at room temperature in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through ethanol to propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon 812. After staining with uranyl acetate at 60 °C for 15 min, and then by lead citrate, the sections were viewed on a JEOL CX II microscope. Solvent-containing phospholipid bilayer membranes were formed by placing a small bubble of 15 mg/ml lipid solution inn-heptane onto the end of Teflon tubing with 0.25-mm inner diameter. The design of the chamber allowed 50 μl of solution to be rapidly introduced immediately adjacent to the membrane (7Mirzabekov T.A. Silberstein A.Y. Kagan B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). E. coli total lipid extract were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and stored at −20 °C. Agar salt bridges connected the electrodes to the solutions, and voltage clamp conditions were employed in all experiments. Thecis-side (i.e. the side to which peptide was added) was taken as ground. All stated voltages refer to the voltage of the trans-side. Current was recorded with an Axopatch-1C amplifier with a CV-3B head stage and stored on videotape for later playback and analysis. Membrane capacitance and resistance were monitored to ensure the formation of reproducible membranes. The peptide stock solution (2 mg/ml) was stored at 4 °C, and the working solutions were prepared immediately before use. The bath solution contained 100 mm KCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, or 10 mm MES-Tris buffer, pH 5.5 and pH 6.5, or 10 mm Tris citrate buffer pH 7.4. Fig.1a summarizes a series of radial diffusion assays done in underlay gels containing 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5. Both native plicatamide and PL-101 (Phe-Phe-His-Leu-His-Phe-His-Tyr-amide) were more effective microbicides at neutral pH. Although native plicatamide and PL-101 had similar potency against the two Gram-positive organisms, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes, the native plicatamide was 2–3-fold more potent against the Gram-negative test strains, E. coliand P. aeruginosa. Fig. 1b shows that PL-101 was considerably more active than either PL-102 (Phe-Phe-His-Leu-His-Phe-His-Tyr-acid) or the two DOPA-containing peptides PL-103 and PL-104. The sequences of these peptides are shown in Table I. In several of our preparations of native plicatamide, FTIR analyses revealed additional bands, characteristic of lipids and/or phospholipid, in addition to the expected absorption bands for a peptide (Fig.2a). A mixture of synthetic PL-101 and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol provided a similar FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2b), whereas PL-101 gave a typical peptide spectrum (Fig. 2c). Because the antimicrobial data shown in Fig. 1a were obtained with a preparation of plicatamide that contained only the expected peptide bands, we consider it unlikely that any co-purified lipids were responsible for the antimicrobial properties of our other preparations. Fig. 3 shows the results of experiments comparing the effects of pH and salinity on the antimicrobial activity of plicatamide and PL-101. These native plicatamide preparations did contain associated (phospho)lipids by FTIR. Again, native plicatamide and synthetic PL-101 were substantially more effective at pH 7.4, than at pH 5.5 despite their greater cationicity at the lower pH. The MEC of plicatamide in 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 μg/ml for E. coli, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes. These results are quite similar to those obtained with the phospholipid-free preparation of plicatamide (Fig.1a). We obtained similar MEC values when the underlay gels contained 250 μg/ml (data not shown). Colony counting experiments revealed that native plicatamide killed MRSA and S. aureus very rapidly (Fig.4). The peptide was equally effective in medium with or without nutrients, and we found little difference in the susceptibility of mid-logarithmic and stationary phase staphylococci to plicatamide (data not shown). Furthermore, staphylocidal activity was not impaired by including 10 μg/ml catalase in the medium, nor did inclusion of 1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mmMg2+ impair it (data not shown). We assessed the membrane integrity of plicatamide-treated staphylococci by measuring their loss of cytoplasmic potassium (Fig.5). To ensure adequate amounts (100–200 nmol) of total K+, bacterial concentrations of ∼7.5 × 107 CFU/ml were used. We also measured viability by removing aliquots at intervals for colony counting. The virtually immediate and substantial efflux of K+ from plicatamide-treated MRSA is consistent with an antimicrobial mechanism that targets their cell membrane. Native plicatamide induced a similar efflux of K+ from S. aureus, and synthetic PL-101 induced K+ efflux from both S. aureus and MRSA (data not shown). We also examined the effects of plicatamide on planar bilayer membranes prepared from E. coli lipids dissolved in n-heptane. The untreated membranes were stable between ±100 mV, and displayed low (<10 picosiemens) conductance. At pH 7.4, plicatamide concentrations below 5 μg/ml caused short spikes of increased conductance, whereas concentrations between 5 and 10 μg/ml sometimes induced substantial conductivity (Fig. 6a), with an essentially linear integral current-voltage response (Fig.6b). Plicatamide concentrations above 10 μg/ml typically increased conductance very quickly before destroying the membrane. When these various concentrations of plicatamide were added at pH 5.5, no increased conductivity resulted (data not shown). The plicatamide-modified membranes were cation-selective, manifesting a current reversal potential of +15.5 ± 3.5 mV for a 10-fold KCl gradient. They showed relatively little selectivity for potassiumversus sodium (2.1 ± 1 mV for bi-ionic system at 100 mm, and 10.7 ± 3.2 mV for 100 mm KCl, 1m NaCl system). Although adding 1–10 mmCaCl2 had no effect on plicatamide-induced currents, adding 1 mm ZnCl2 blocked current flow by up to 75% (data not shown). Because we have found that plicatamide binds zinc, 2J. A. Tincu, L. P. Menzel, R. Azimov, J. Sands, T. Hong, A. J. Waring, S. W. Taylor, and R. I. Lehrer, unpublished data. we attribute the inhibitory effect of this cation to its interaction with plicatamide, rather than to nonspecific stabilization of the membrane. It is noteworthy that ZnCl2 blocks pore formation by two histidine-rich polypeptides: aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila (8Wilmsen H.U. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Wilmsen H.U. Buckley J.T. Pattus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and a histidine-rich analogue of staphylococcal α-hemolysin (10Walker B. Kasianowicz J. Krishnasastry M. Bayley H. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Exposing MRSA to plicatamide or PL-101 quickly decreased their consumption of oxygen by 87.1%, from a basal rate of 5.1 to 0.66 nmols/min/108 CFU, within 60 s after 10 μg/ml native plicatamide was added (Fig.7). Synthetic PL-101 was almost as effective, reducing O2 consumption by 81.8% to 0.93 nmols/min/108 CFU. Untreated control organisms continued to consume O2 at the basal rate until the chamber became anaerobic. We also performed conventional, National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microbroth dilution assays to determine the susceptibility of E. coli ML-35p, P. aeruginosa MR3007, S. aureus 930918-3, and L. monocytogenes EGD to native plicatamide and PL-101. In contrast to its prominent antimicrobial effects in our radial diffusion and colony count experiments, the MIC of plicatamide exceeded 100 μg/ml for each of the aforementioned organisms. Because microbroth dilution assays are widely considered to represent “gold standards” in testing antimicrobials, we decided to investigate the cause of this apparent discrepancy. Initially, we suspected that the Mueller-Hinton broth used in National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type assays might not support plicatamide mediated staphylocidal activity. However, when we exposed mid-logarithmic or stationary phase S. aureus to 2 or 5 μg/ml of plicatamide in Mueller-Hinton broth, the colony counts fell by >2–3 logs after 30 and 120 min of incubation (data not shown). A few additional experiments revealed that the few organisms that survived exposure to plicatamide could repopulate the culture, thereby masking the antimicrobial properties of plicatamide, at least for microbroth dilution assays. This effect is illustrated in Fig.8. MRSA treated with plicatamide showed many alterations. After only 5 min, striking changes were observed by scanning electron microscopy, wherein multiple small dome-shaped bulges, often arranged in linear and clustered arrays (Fig. 9), deformed their surfaces. These abnormalities became more marked as the duration of exposure to plicatamide increased (Fig. 10). In many bacteria, large amounts of cytoplasm extruded beyond the confines of the cell wall. Transmission electron microscopy of plicatamide-treated bacteria revealed fixed prominent mesosomes, even in cells fixed as early as 5 min after exposure to plicatamide (Fig.11). Many plicatamide-treated MRSA contained electron dense material between their plasma membrane and cell wall, representing partially contained “eruptions” of cytoplasm akin to the more flamboyant manifestations evident in Fig.10.Figure 10Later effects on morphology. More advanced surface deformities were noted in MRSA exposed to native plicatamide (15 μg/ml) for 15–60 min. In addition, many cells showed transmural extrusions of their cytoplasm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 11Transmission electron microscopy. Many plicatamide-treated MRSA contained mesosomes (white arrows), and such structures were evident as early as 5 min post-exposure to plicatamide. After longer exposures to plicatamide (15 μg/ml), some MRSA contained electron dense material between their plasma membrane and thick wall.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Plicatamide-lysed human erythrocytes, acting with almost the same potency as melittin on a weight/volume basis (Fig. 12). However, in marked contrast to melittin, plicatamide was not hemolytic for sheep red blood cells, even when applied at 80 μg/ml. Moreover, although melittin induced hemolysis over a broad pH range, the hemolytic properties of plicatamide were markedly diminished as acidity increased. Furthermore, whereas melittin was exceptionally cytotoxic for human cervical ME-180 epithelial cells, plicatamide was relatively noncytotoxic for these cells under the same conditions (data not shown). Plicatamide (Fig. 13) is an interesting peptide for many reasons, not the least of which is that it violates conventional notions about antimicrobial peptides. Typically, one expects such peptides to be cationic and amphipathic molecules with 16–40 residues (11Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 12Epand R.M. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 13Gennaro R.

A few smaller antimicrobial peptides with 11–13 residues have been described. These include the bactenecin dodecapeptides of bovine or ovine neutrophils (16Bagella L. Scocchi M. Zanetti M.

Plicatamide contains eight residues, and it is only modestly cationic at pH 7.4, and when it was rendered more cationic (at pH 5.5) its activity decreased. To our knowledge, only two smaller antimicrobial peptides have been found in animals: 5-S-GAD, and halocyamine A.N-β-alanyl-5-S-glutathionyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (5-S-GAD) is a pentapeptide that was purified from the hemolymph of injured or infected “fleshflies” (Sarcophaga peregrina) (21Leem J.Y. Nishimura C. Kurata S. Shimada I. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13573-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the antimicrobial activities of 5-S-GAD were completely inhibited by catalase, it was suggested that H2O2 participates in its antimicrobial mechanism, as well as its induction of apoptosis in HL60 cells (22Hijikata M. Matsumoto H.N. Kobayashi A. Nifuji A. Noda M. Natori S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because we found that catalase did not inhibit the bactericidal effects of plicatamide, its antimicrobial mechanism evidently differs from that of 5-S-GAD. Other properties of the 5-S-GAD molecule include an ability to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of certain kinases, PTK p60(v-src) and PTK p210(BCR-ABL) (23Leem J.Y. Park H.Y. Fukazawa H. Uehara Y. Natori S. Biol. & Pharm. Bull. 1998; 21: 784-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Zheng Z.B. Nagai S. Iwanami N. Suh D.Y. Kobayashi A. Hijikata M. Natori S. Sankawa U. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 47: 136-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Halocyamine A is a tetrapeptide (histidyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-glycyl-bromodidehydrotryptamine) that, like plicatamide, is also found in the hemocytes of a tunicate, in this case Halocynthia roretzi. Halocyamine A was reported to inhibit the growth of yeast and of the marine bacteriaAchromobacter aquamarinus and Pseudomonas perfectomarinus (25Azumi K. Yoshimizu M. Suzuki S. Ezura Y. Yokosawa H. Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 1066-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Neither its antimicrobial mechanism nor the effects of catalase on its activity have been described. It is remarkable that three of the smallest known antimicrobial peptides (5-S-GAD, halocyamine A, and plicatamide) should all contain a DOPA moiety. Although this could be a coincidence, it may also be an indication that this residue plays an important functional role. Although PL-103 and PL-104, the DOPA-containing synthetic analogues of plicatamide examined here, were unimpressive microbicides, we have yet to prepare an exact synthetic replica of plicatamide. Another possible function of DOPA and dcΔDOPA might be"

https://openalex.org/W2140807655,"The t(12;22) creates an MN1–TEL fusion gene leading to acute myeloid leukemia. The fusion partner TEL (ETV6) is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. The nature of the other fusion partner, MN1, has not been investigated in detail until now. We recently described that MN1 activates the transcription activity of the moloney sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, indicating that this protein itself may act as a transcription factor. We show here that MN1 comprises multiple transcription activating domains. A search for a bound DNA sequence revealed that MN1 has affinity for retinoic acid responsive elements. A DR5 retinoic acid responsive element was observed in the LTR. The combination of MN1 and ligand-activated retinoic acid receptor leads to a synergistic induction of expression directed by the LTR. Cotransfection of MN1 with RAC3 or p300, known coactivators of retinoic acid receptors, leads to a further synergistic induction of transcription. In addition, the effect of MN1 can be inhibited by the wild-type adenovirus ElA protein that inhibits p300 function, but not by an E1A mutant lacking the p300-binding site. GAL4-MN1-mediated transcription can be enhanced directly by RAC3 and p300. Taken together, our results indicate that MN1 is a transcription coactivator rather than a sequence-specific transcription factor, and that it may stimulate RAR/RXR-mediated transcription through interaction with p160 and p300."

A, Dolinsky, V. W., and Hatch, G. M. (1999) J. Lipid Res. 40, 1837–1845). We report here the purification and characterization of a monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity from pig liver mitochondria. Monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity was purified over 1000-fold by butanol extraction, hydroxyapatite chromatography, and preparative SDS-PAGE. The purified 74-kDa protein catalyzed acylation of monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin with [14C]linoleoyl coenzyme A. Photoaffinity labeling of the protein with 12-[(4-[125I]azidosalicyl)amino]dodecanoyl coenzyme A indicated coenzyme A was bound at its active site and photoaffinity cross-linking of 12-[(4-azidosalicyl)amino]dodecanoyl coenzyme A to the enzyme inhibited enzyme activity. Enzyme activity was optimum at pH 7.0, and the enzyme did not utilize other lysophospholipids as substrate. The purified enzyme was heat-labile and exhibited an isoelectric point of pH 5.4. To determine the enzymes kinetic mechanism the effect of varying concentrations of linoleoyl coenzyme A and monolysocardiolipin on initial velocity were determined. Double-reciprocal plots revealed parallel lines consistent with a ping pong kinetic mechanism. When the enzyme was incubated in the absence of monolysocardiolipin, coenzyme A was produced from linoleoyl coenzyme A at a rate consistent with the formation of an enzyme-linoleate intermediate. The true Km value for linoleoyl coenzyme A and true Km value for monolysocardiolipin were 100 and 44 μm, respectively. The calculated Vmax was 6802 pmol/min·mg of protein. A polyclonal antibody, raised in rabbits to the purified protein, cross-reacted with the protein in crude pig liver mitochondrial fractions. In liver mitochondria prepared from thyroxine-treated rats, the level of the protein was elevated compared with euthyroid controls indicating that expression of monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase is regulated by thyroid hormone.

The synthesis of CL occurs via the CDP-DG pathway in mammalian tissues (6Kiyasu J.Y. Pieringer R.A. Paulus H. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2293-2298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hatch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid is converted to CDP-DG, which is then condensed withsn-glycerol-3-phosphate to form PG phosphate, which is rapidly dephosphorylated to PG. Finally, PG condenses with another CDP-DG molecule to form CL. CL is localized to mitochondria and is required for the reconstituted activity of a number of key mammalian mitochondrial enzymes involved in cellular energy metabolism, including cytochrome c oxidase (8Vik S.B. Georgevich G. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (9Fiol C.J. Bieber L.L. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), ADP/ATP carrier (15Hoffman B. Stockl A. Schlame M. Beyer K. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1940-1944PubMed Google Scholar), and the ATP synthase (16Eble K.S. Coleman W.B. Hantgan R.R. Cunningham C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19434-19440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several recent studies have implicated CL loss in the regulation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 17Esposti M.D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the appropriate content of CL is an important requirement for activation of enzymes involved in mitochondrial respiration and in the control of programmed cell death. CL is unique among glycerophospholipids in that it contains four fatty acyl side chains. The proportion of CL symmetrical molecular species is 50–65%, and the four acyl positions are occupied by monounsaturated and diunsaturated chains of 16–18 carbons in length (18Schlame M. Brody S. Hostetler K.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic double unsaturated linoleic diacylglycerol species appears to be the important structural requirement for the high protein binding affinity of CL (19Schlame M. Hovath L. Vigh L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Alteration in molecular species composition of CL may alter activities of the electron transport chain enzymes. For example, the activity of delipidated rat liver cytochrome coxidase was reconstituted by the addition of CL (20Yamaoka-Koseki S. Urade R. Kito M. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 956-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the reconstituted cytochrome c oxidase varied markedly and significantly with different molecular species of CL. In addition, peroxidation of CL in rat basophile leukemia cells lead to an increase in cytochrome c release, a primary event in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (21Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to CL content, the CL molecular species composition may regulate mitochondrial respiratory performance and programmed cell death. The CL de novo biosynthetic enzymes show little acyl species selectivity (22Rustow B. Schlame M. Rabe H. Reichman G. Kunze D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Hostetler K.Y. Galesloot J.M. Boer P. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, CL must be rapidly remodeled to achieve the molecular composition of CL observed in the mitochondrial membrane. The deacylation-reacylation cycle was first described by William Lands several decades ago (24Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 253: 2233-2237Google Scholar). However, it was not until 1990 that a deacylation-reacylation cycle for the molecular remodeling of endogenous CL in rat liver mitochondria was proposed (25Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, we characterized the MLCL AT activity responsible for the acylation of MLCL to CL in the rat heart and mammalian tissues and proposed a model of cardiolipin molecular remodeling (26Ma B.J. Taylor W.A Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study we describe a procedure for the purification of MLCL AT activity from pig liver mitochondria. In addition, we have characterized the purified enzyme activity, raised a polyclonal antibody to the protein, and shown that the protein is expressed in response to thyroid hormone. This study represents the first purification and characterization of a MLCL AT from any organism. Pig livers were obtained from freshly slaughtered pigs from the local abattoir. Sprague-Dawley rats (125 g) were obtained from Central Animal Care Services, University of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Treatment of rats conformed to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. [1-14C]Linoleoyl-CoA and [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [1-14C]Oleoyl-CoA and [Na125I] were obtained from Dupont (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Acyl-CoAs were obtained from Serdary Research Laboratories (Englewood Cliffs, NJ). MLCL (a mixture of 1′(1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl)-3′-(1“,2”-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl)glycerol and 1′-(1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl)-3′-(1“-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl)glycerol), produced by phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of bovine heart CL, was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The purity of the MLCL substrate was checked by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described previously (27Poorthuis B.J.H.M. Yasaki P.J. Hostetler K.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acyl molecular species composition of the MLCL substrate was examined as described previously (28Tardi P.G. Mukherjee J.J. Choy P.C. Lipids. 1992; 27: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and was comprised mainly of linoleic (90.3%) and oleic (8.6%) acids. Ecolite scintillation mixture was obtained from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA), and thin layer plates (Silica Gel 60, 0.25-mm thickness) were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Kodak X-OMATTM SA film was used for autoradiography and Western blot analysis. Precision Plus Protein Standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other biochemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from either Fisher Scientific (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) or Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) or the source indicated in the purification protocol. For assay of MLCL AT activities, fractions (1–50 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 30–170 μm[1-14C]linoleoyl-CoA (specific radioactivity, 14,200 dpm/nmol) at pH 7.0, and 30–480 μm MLCL in a final volume of 0.35 ml. The MLCL substrate in chloroform was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in double-distilled water via sonication in a bath sonicator for 45 min prior to addition to the assay mixture. The temperature of the bath sonicator was maintained at 4 °C by ice. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the radioactive acyl-CoA substrate and terminated by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). 0.8 ml of 0.9% KCl was added to facilitate phase separation. The aqueous phase was removed, and the organic phase was washed with 2 ml of chloroform:methanol:0.9% NaCl (3:48:47, v/v). The resulting organic fraction was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 25 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). A 20-μl aliquot of the resuspended organic phase was placed on a thin layer plate, and CL was separated from other phospholipids using a two-dimensional separation described previously (27Poorthuis B.J.H.M. Yasaki P.J. Hostetler K.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The silica gel corresponding to CL was removed and placed in a plastic scintillation vial, and 5 ml of scintillant was added. Radioactivity incorporated into CL was examined ∼24 h later using a liquid scintillation counter. MLCL AT activity was taken as radioactivity incorporated into CL in the presence of the MLCL substrate minus radioactivity incorporated into CL in the absence of the MLCL substrate. In some experiments, 0.3 mmlysophospholipid (lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidic acid, or lysophosphatidy-lethanolamine) was included in the assay mixture in place of MLCL. In other experiments, [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA or [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (similar specific radioactivity as [1-14C]linoleoyl-CoA) was substituted for [1-14C]linoleoyl-CoA. In other experiments, MLCL AT activity was determined in the presence of a fixed concentration of MLCL and variable concentrations of linoleoyl-CoA or in the presence of a fixed concentration of linoleoyl-CoA and variable concentrations of MLCL. In other experiments, the purified enzyme was incubated for up to 1 h with 40 μm linoleoyl-CoA and 0.13 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the absence of MLCL in the standard assay, and the absorbance at 412 nmwas determined. The formation of CoA was calculated from a standard curve (29Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). In other experiments, MLCL AT was preincubated at 50 °C for up to 10 min, and enzyme activity was assayed as described above. For the pH titration curve, MLCL AT was assayed at pH range between 5.0 and 9.0. Protein was determined as described previously (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Pig liver (3.2 kg) was ground in a Hobart meat grinder. 3.8 liters of buffer A (10 mmTris-HCL, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA) was added, and the mixture was homogenized in a Polytron® (Kinematica, Switzerland) for 3 min (medium speed). The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 700 ×g for 50 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was filtered through glass wool. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting crude mitochondrial pellet was washed with 1.5 liters of buffer A and recentrifuged. The washed pellet was resuspended in 400 ml of buffer A and allowed to sit overnight at 4 °C. The crude mitochondrial fraction was then homogenized in a Polytron for 3 min (medium speed) and then freeze-dried. Butanol (250 ml) was added to 35 g of freeze-dried crude mitochondria in a beaker and stirred for 25 min using a magnetic stirrer. The mixture was centrifuged at full speed for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-extracted with 200 ml of butanol. The pellet was washed twice with 150 ml of acetone and dried with a stream of nitrogen. Double-distilled water (200 ml) and 100 ml of homogenizing buffer were added to the butanol-extracted pellet and mixed for 3 min using a Polytron at low speed. The mixture was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 40 min, and the resulting supernatant (250 ml) used for hydroxyapatite chromatography. The supernatant above was loaded onto a column containing 80 ml of hydroxyapatite gel (Bio-Gel, HT Gel from Bio-Rad) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The gel was washed stepwise with 1.5 liter of buffer A containing 0.2m sodium phosphate (monobasic, hydrated). The enzyme was eluted with buffer A containing 0.42 m sodium phosphate. The eluted enzyme (250 ml) was dialyzed against 4 liters of double-distilled water overnight. 450 ml of the dialyzed protein was freeze-dried to a final weight of 4.5 g. The freeze-dried protein from above (1 g) was dissolved in 1.5 ml of double-distilled water and 1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma, 2× concentrate) and centrifuged at maximum speed in a tabletop centrifuge through a 0.22 μmCentricon filter. The filtered protein was subjected to Preparatory Gel Electrophoresis (Model 491 Prep Cell) using 40 ml of 7.5% acrylamide (separating gel) and 10 ml of 4% acrylamide (stacking gel). The gel was run at a constant current of 20 mA overnight. The elution buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.19m glycine. Fractions (6 ml) were collected at a rate of 20 min per fraction. The eluted fractions with the highest MLCL AT activity were pooled and freeze-dried. An aliquot of the freeze-dried eluate from the hydroxyapatite purification step (55 μg) and aliquots of the eluted protein fraction 30, pooled fractions 32–33, and pooled fractions 34–36 from the preparative SDS-PAGE step (0.2–1.0 μg) along with protein standards (6.25 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on mini-gels (Bio-Rad) using 7.5% acrylamide (separating gel) and 4% acrylamide (stacking gel). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. In some experiments, the pooled fractions 34–36 from the preparative SDS-PAGE step were subjected to non-denaturing-PAGE using 7.5% acrylamide (separating gel) and 4% acrylamide (stacking gel) to remove SDS and MLCL AT activity determined in the gel slices. Purified MLCL AT (pooled fractions 34–36 from the preparative SDS-PAGE step) (0.2 μg) was subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. The first dimension isoelectric focusing step was performed using ready-made IPG 13 Cm strips (Amersham Biosciences) with a pH 3–10 gradient. The protein was focused overnight on an IPGhor (Amersham Biosciences) isoelectric focusing unit. The protein was then separated in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE on a 15- × 15-cm gel with 12% acrylamide using a standard electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad) with 6.25 μg of molecular mass standards. The gel was silver-stained, and the molecular mass and isoelectric point of the purified MLCL AT were calculated. A polyclonal antibody to the purified 74-kDa protein was raised in New Zealand White rabbits at National Biologicals Inc., Winnipeg, Canada. Excised gel slices from the preparative SDS-PAGE step (pooled fractions 34–36) containing the purified acyltransferase (∼15 μg each) were utilized for biweekly intramuscular injections. Antiserum was collected biweekly. The antibody was purified on a protein A-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) and used for the immunological studies. The crude mitochondrial fraction (56 μg) and the purified MLCL AT fraction obtained from the preparative SDS-PAGE step (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the Laemmli procedure using 7.5% separating gels (31Laemmeli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein from the separating gel was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with either preimmune serum or with the anti-MLCL AT polyclonal antibody (dilution, 1:500 dilution). Identification was according to the ECL Western blotting Analysis System (Amersham Biosciences) using goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibody (dilution, 1:1000). In other experiments, crude liver mitochondrial fractions were prepared from euthyroid and thyroxine-treated rats as previously described (32Mutter T. Dolinsky V.W. Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 403-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 100 μg of the fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the Laemmli procedure using 10% separating gels (31Laemmeli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibody was performed as described above. 12-[(4-Azidosalicyl)amino]dodecanoic acid (ASD) and 12-[(4-azidosalicyl)amino]dodecanoyl-CoA (ASD-CoA) were synthesized as described (33Rajasekharan R. Marians R.C. Shockey J.M. Kemp J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12386-12391Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ASD-CoA was iodinated with Na125I as described (34Ji T.H. Ji I. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 121: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling was performed by incubation of the purified 74-kDa protein with [125I]ASD-CoA at room temperature in a dark room. The reaction mixture contained 1.9 μCi of [125I]ASD-CoA (9.15 × 106 cpm/μmol) in 20 mm Tris-succinate (pH 6.0), 40 μm EDTA, and 4.2% glycerol (v/v) and 0.2 μg of purified MLCL AT in a final volume of 215 μl. Cross-linkage of the photoaffinity probe to the enzyme was induced by exposing the mixture to ultraviolet light. A hand-held ultraviolet lamp (Model UVS-54, Ultraviolet Productions Inc., San Gabriel, CA) was held a distance of 5 cm from the sample for 15 min. 10% Trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction, and the mixture was incubated at −20 °C for 15 min. The precipitated protein was sedimented at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of 0.1 mNaOH. SDS-PAGE sample buffer (15 μl) was added to the sample. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide as described (35Schaggar H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The gel was dried, and the labeled protein band identified by autoradiography. In some experiments, the purified protein was photoaffinity-labeled as described above except [125I]ASD-CoA was replaced with various concentrations of ASD-CoA and MLCL AT activity determined in this fraction. The purification protocol for MLCL AT activity is outlined in TableI. Pig liver was homogenized, and the mitochondrial fraction was prepared and subjected to butanol extraction. The freeze-dried butanol extract was subjected to hydroxyapatite chromatography followed by preparative SDS-PAGE. The elution profiles of MLCL AT activity from hydroxyapatite chromatography and preparative SDS-PAGE steps are shown in Fig.1. The result was the isolation of a single protein band of 74-kDa molecular mass (Fig.2).Table IPurification of monolysocardiolipin acyltransferaseTotal activityProteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldpmol/minmgpmol/min/mg-fold%Crude mitochondrial extract230,17625,0199.21.0100Butanol treatment11,94429134.15.18Hydroxyapatite chromatography145041.4353.80.62Preparative SDS-PAGE (pooled fractions 34–36)3010.0310,0411,0910.13MLCL AT was purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Figure 2Purification of MLCLAT.

The isoelectric point was determined to be 5.4. We investigated whether the purified enzyme bound acyl-CoA. The purified enzyme was incubated with [125I]ASD-CoA and photoaffinity cross-linked to the enzyme. As seen in Fig. 3(inset), [125I]ASD-CoA was bound to the 74-kDa purified protein. The purified enzyme was then incubated with ASD-CoA and exposed to ultraviolet light, and then the MLCL AT activity was determined. MLCL AT activity of the purified protein was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by ASD-CoA (Fig. 3). Thus, the purified protein bound acyl-CoA and ASD-CoA inhibited enzyme activity. We examined the pH profile, substrate specificity, and heat inactivation profile of purified MLCL AT. The purified protein exhibited a pH optimum at 7.0 (Fig. 4). The purified protein utilized [1-14C]linoleoyl-CoA, [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA, and [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA as substrates, and enzyme activity was 10-fold greater with the unsaturated fatty-acyl CoA substrates compared with palmitoyl-CoA (data not shown). The purified protein did not utilize other lysophospholipids (lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylinositol, or lysophosphatidic acid) as substrate and was heat-labile, because preincubation at 50 °C for up to 10 min reduced enzyme activity by 70% (data not shown). MLCL AT catalyzes a Bi Bi reaction. To determine the kinetic mechanism of the enzyme, the effects of varying concentrations of linoleoyl-CoA and monolysocardiolipin on enzyme velocity were determined. The results were depicted in a double-reciprocal plot (Fig.5). The parallel lines of the initial-rate kinetic behavior of MLCL AT was indicative of a ping pong reaction mechanism (Fig. 5). The calculated Km for linoleoyl-CoA from the inset of Fig. 5A was 100 μm, and the calculated Km of MLCL from the inset of Fig. 5B was 44 μm. TheVmax calculated from the inset of Fig. 5B was 6802 pmol/min·mg of protein. The formation of CoA from linoleoyl-CoA was determined in the absence of MLCL. In the absence of MLCL, CoA was formed from linoleoyl-CoA at a rate consistent with the formation of an enzyme-linoleate intermediate (TableII). These results provide further support for a ping pong reaction mechanism.Table IIFormation of CoA from linoleoyl-CoA in the absence of MLCLAdditionCoA formednmol/min·mg proteinNoneMLCL ATLinoleoyl-CoALinoleoyl-CoA + MLCL AT16.6Purified MLCL AT was incubated in the presence of linoleoyl-CoA in the absence of MLCL, and the formation of CoA was determined.

Open table in a new tab Purified MLCL AT was incubated in the presence of linoleoyl-CoA in the absence of MLCL, and the formation of CoA was determined. Results represent the mean of two determinations performed in duplicate. The results between samples differed by less than 15%. A polyclonal antibody was raised in New Zealand White rabbits from the purified protein. The polyclonal antibody reacted with the purified 74-kDa protein obtained from the preparative SDS-PAGE step (pooled fractions 34–36) (lane 3) and from crude pig liver mitochondrial fraction (lane 2) (Fig.6A). Pre-immune serum did not react with the 74-kDa protein (data not shown). The polyclonal antibody was not immunoprecipitating, because incubation of crude mitochondrial fractions with antibody did not reduce enzyme activity. Previously we demonstrated that cardiac MLCL AT activity was elevated in crude mitochondrial fractions prepared from thyroxine-treated rats. Rats were injected with thyroxine (250 μg/kg/day) or saline (euthyroid control) for 5 consecutive days. Crude rat liver mitochondrial fractions were prepared, and then equal amounts of mitochondrial protein from thyroxine-treated or euthyroid rats were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was then performed using the polyclonal antibody. As seen in Fig. 6B, expression of MLCL AT protein was elevated in thyroxine-treated rats compared with euthyroid control. The bands were analyzed by scanning the film with a densitometer, and relative intensities of the bands were determined by Scion Image software. The relative intensity of the band in lane 2 of Fig. 6B was 1.8-fold higher than lane 1. Thus, MLCL AT protein expression is regulated by thyroid hormone. In this study, we have purified a unique and previously unidentified MLCL AT activity from pig liver mitochondria to apparent homogeneity. The protein exhibits a molecular mass of 74 kDa and acylates MLCL to CL with linoleoyl-CoA. Purified MLCL AT is heat-labile, has Km values of 44 μmfor MLCL and 100 μm for linoleoyl-CoA, and aVmax of 6802 pmol/min·mg. Parallel lines obtained from primary plots indicate a ping pong reaction mechanism. In support of this, CoA is formed from linoleoyl-CoA at a rate consistent with the formation of an enzyme-linoleate intermediate. The initial purification step utilized butanol extraction to remove lipids from the protein. Although no degree of purification was obtained, this step allowed reconstitution of enzymatic activity subsequent to freeze-drying. Previously, we demonstrated that different detergents inhibited in vitro MLCL AT activity to varying degrees in crude rat heart mitochondrial fractions (26Ma B.J. Taylor W.A Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because SDS was required for purification of MLCL AT in the terminal preparative SDS-PAGE step, it is possible that the observed degree of purification is an underestimate of the actual value. The pH optimum of purified MLCL AT was pH 7.0. This value falls within the range of the normal physiological pH observed within respiring mitochondria (36Addanki S. Cahill F.D. Sotos J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2337-2348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE indicated an isoelectric point of pH 5.4. We had previously demonstrated that various acyl-CoAs could compete with [14C]CL formation from [14C]oleoyl-CoA and [14C]linoleoyl-CoA in crude rat heart mitochondria (26Ma B.J. Taylor W.A Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the ASD-CoA experiments. The enzyme-bound acyl-CoA as indicated in photoaffinity cross-linking studies with [125I]ASD-CoA. In addition, cross-linking of the enzyme with ASD-CoA inhibited in vitro enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, purified MLCL AT binds acyl-CoA substrates. Substrate specificity studies of the purified enzyme indicated that purified MLCL AT utilized exclusively MLCL and not other lysophospholipids as substrate. In addition, purified MLCL AT utilized unsaturated acyl-CoAs (oleoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA) to a much greater degree (10-fold preference) than a saturated acyl-CoA (palmitoyl-CoA). This may explain the enrichment of the unsaturated fatty acyl molecular composition of CL observedin vivo (18Schlame M. Brody S. Hostetler K.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits to MLCL AT reacted with the protein in crude mitochondrial fractions prepared from pig liver. Subsequent to de novo biosynthesis, CL is rapidly remodeled by deacylation followed by reacylation (25Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Ma B.J. Taylor W.A Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular species composition of CL is responsive to changes in diet (37Yamaoka S. Urade R. Kido M. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, dietary modification of the molecular species composition of CL has been shown to alter the oxygen consumption in cardiac mitochondria (20Yamaoka-Koseki S. Urade R. Kito M. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 956-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,37Yamaoka S. Urade R. Kido M. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hence, regulation of the activities of the enzymes involved in CL remodeling may play a key role in regulation of CL function and mitochondrial respiration. It is well documented that thyroid hormone regulates mitochondrial respiration (38Shingenaga M.L. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Previously we demonstrated that treatment of rats with thyroxine for 5 days elevated cardiac CL levels, CL synthase, and MLCL AT activities (32Mutter T. Dolinsky V.W. Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 403-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Taylor W.A. Xu F.Y. Man B.J. Mutter T.C. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial phospholipase A2 and lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase activities were unaltered under these conditions (32Mutter T. Dolinsky V.W. Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 403-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, the polyclonal antibody prepared against purified pig liver MLCL AT cross-reacted with the protein in crude rat liver mitochondrial fractions. In addition, expression of MLCL AT protein was elevated in rat liver mitochondrial fractions prepared from thyroxine-treated rats indicating that MLCL AT expression is regulated by thyroid hormone. Because CL synthase exhibits little fatty acyl species specificity (23Hostetler K.Y. Galesloot J.M. Boer P. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and thyroid hormone did not affect mitochondrial phospholipase A2 activity but elevated CL synthase and MLCL AT activities (32Mutter T. Dolinsky V.W. Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 403-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that MLCL AT could serve as a control point for the regulation of the remodeling of newly synthesized CL in mammalian tissues.

Here we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the heat of FtsZ self-association under various conditions. The measurements were designed to test whether FtsZ protofilaments are assembled by an isodesmic (linear aggregates in which each bond has an identical equilibrium constant) or a cooperative (aggregates only become stable after forming a oligomeric nucleus) assembly process. The isodesmic model can fit the assembly in GDP closely but cannot fit the assembly in GTP. FtsZ-GTP without Mg2+ exhibits an apparent critical concentration, which is indicative of cooperative assembly, near 2.9 μm. With 2.5 mmMg2+ (which allows FtsZ to hydrolyze GTP) the critical concentration is reduced 10-fold to ∼0.31 μm. Both with and without Mg2+ there is no evidence for assembly below the critical concentration, but there is an abrupt transition to full assembly above. The ITC data are highly suggestive of a cooperative assembly, although this is difficult to reconcile with the 1-subunit-thick protofilaments observed by electron microscopy.

Light microscopy has shown that FtsZ assembles into a ring that constricts and divides the cell (8Levin P.A. Losick R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Ma X.

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The substructure of Z-ring has not been visualized by electron microscopy of bacteria, but much has been learned from in vitro assembly studies. FtsZ forms straight protofilaments with longitudinal bonds similar to those in microtubules (11Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 12Löwe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Under many conditions the protofilaments tend to associate laterally into pairs or small bundles (13Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 14White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. Seitz L.E. Moore G.D. Borhani D.W. J.

Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but in most studies at least some polymers appear to be single protofilaments. Romberg et al. (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) used mass measurement by scanning transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate that protofilaments were indeed only 1 subunit thick. The existence of single protofilaments is quite different from tubulin, where protofilaments are stable only when assembled into parallel sheets in which the protofilaments are connected by lateral bonds (17Erickson H.P. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 293-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A single protofilament should have only a single type of longitudinal bond, and all bonds should be identical. This type of assembly is now referred to as isodesmic (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,18Frigon R.P. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Isodesmic assembly was demonstrated for glutamate dehydrogenase (19Reisler E. Pouyet J. Eisenberg H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,20Thusius D. Dessen P. Jallon J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 92: 413-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and β-lactoglobulin (21Adams Jr., E.T. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the thermodynamic principles of the assembly were developed. Tubulin has been interpreted to assemble isodesmically in the presence of GDP (18Frigon R.P. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Frigon R.P. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4559-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The assembly of glutamate dehydrogenase and β-lactoglobin are probably not physiologically important, and the GDP-tubulin polymer is probably only transiently important during microtubule disassembly. In contrast to isodesmic assembly, all physiologically relevant filaments studied so far, in particular tubulin and actin, assemble in a cooperative manner. The key distinction of cooperative assembly is that subunits are connected by two types of bonds to form a helical or two-dimensional polymer (17Erickson H.P. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 293-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition to the longitudinal bonds within a protofilament, adjacent protofilaments are connected by lateral or diagonal bonds. Cooperative assembly produces two features that are very important for cytoskeletal filaments like microtubules and actin. First, fragmentation in the middle is many orders of magnitude less favorable than removing a subunit from the end, and so the filament can last for long periods without breaking (23Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Isodesmic assembly, in contrast, produces a population of relatively short filaments, in which fragmentation of every interface in the middle is equivalent to dissociation of a subunit from the end. Second, cooperative assembly exhibits a critical concentration (Cc). 1The abbreviations used are:Cccritical concentrationinjinjectionITCisothermal titration calorimetryMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid There is a sharp transition from disassembly to assembly as the pool of free subunits rises above Cc (24Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). This sharp transition at the Cc, coupled with unfavorable nucleation, results in a population of very long polymers, in equilibrium with monomers at a concentrationCc. Assembly and disassembly at the ends can be finely controlled by the concentration of free subunits. critical concentration injection isothermal titration calorimetry 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Several studies have suggested that FtsZ assembly is cooperative based on the observation of an apparent critical concentration. Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus (13Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) proposed a Cc forEscherichia coli FtsZ of 1 μm using a centrifugation assay and 2 μm using light scattering. White et al. (14White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. Seitz L.E. Moore G.D. Borhani D.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3971-4028Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) proposed a Cc of 3 μm for Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsZ based on light scattering data. One of the most convincing indications of a Cc was obtained from GTPase assays. GTPase, which is thought to be coupled to assembly, is highly dependent on FtsZ concentration. Relative specific activity was not measurable below 2 μm for Bacillus subtilis FtsZ and rose rapidly to a plateau at 5 μm (25Wang X. Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similar curves were obtained for E. coli FtsZ, with activity beginning at an apparentCc of 0.5 μm (Ref. 16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and Footnote 2S. Redick, personal communication.) and reaching a plateau at 2 μm. Romberg et al. (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) proposed that FtsZ may assemble isodesmically. The primary basis for this proposal was an analysis of protofilaments by scanning transmission electron microscopy, which determined the mass density to be that of a 1-subunit-thick protofilament. If the protofilaments are 1 subunit thick they could only have one type of bond, and hence assembly should be isodesmic. Romberg et al. (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) repeated centrifugation and light scattering assays, suggesting that might not support a critical concentration. A problem with these assays is that they under-report short protofilaments, which is particularly problematic at low FtsZ concentrations. Romberg et al. (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), however, did note that the GTPase assays provided strong evidence for a critical concentration and thus cooperative assembly. There was therefore a significant controversy as to whether FtsZ assembly is isodesmic or cooperative. One of the most distinctive predictions of the isodesmic theory is that the association constant for each interface should be quite high,KA = 3.3 × 108m−1, (KD = 3 nm). This high affinity bond was necessary to fit the observed filament lengths of 30 to 50 subunits. This leads to the prediction that short protofilaments should form above 3 nmFtsZ, and for FtsZ above 10–30 nm almost all of the subunits should be assembled (only the subunits at the ends of the protofilaments would not be involved in two interfaces). In contrast, in a cooperative assembly there will be no assembly until FtsZ exceeds the critical concentration, near 1 μm. To test the theory further, we sought a technique that could quantitate the extent of assembly at different protein concentrations, reporting the total number of interfaces formed without any bias from filament length. The formation of a protein-protein interface is typically associated with a release of heat, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can be used to measure the association. Because the heat generated by the association should be the same for each interface, ITC should meet the above criterion. This application of ITC is different from the typical study of a heterodimer association, where one subunit is placed in the reaction cell and the other in the syringe. In our case the entire FtsZ sample is initially in the syringe at high concentration and then is diluted by being injected into the reaction cell. In general the protein in the syringe will be assembled for the most part, and injection will result in disassembly, which is sometimes followed by reassembly. We found that informative data on FtsZ assembly can be obtained with this novel approach to ITC. The following protocol was adapted from Romberg et al. (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). BL21 cells were transformed with Pet11b-wtFtsZ (wild type E. coli FtsZ). A 50-ml culture (LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) was grown overnight in a shaker at 37 °C, centrifuged to pellet the cells, resuspended in fresh LB, and added to two 500-ml cultures (LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin). These were grown in a shaker at 37 °C to A600 nm∼1.0 and then induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 2 h the cultures were centrifuged at 2350 × g(5000 rpm, Type 19 rotor, Beckman L8 ultracentrifuge) for 10 min, the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) to give a total volume of ∼20 ml, and the suspension was frozen at −80 °C. Immediately after thawing, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and ∼100 μg/ml lysozyme were added; the suspension was rotated at room temperature for 15 min. After the suspension was cooled on ice for 10 min, it was sonicated (Virsonic 50 (115 V, 1 A, 60 Hz), Virtis Co., Inc., Gardiner, NY) with four 30-s pulses at 50% power with 1 min on ice between pulses to keep the sample cold. 10 mm MgCl2 and ∼10 μg/ml DNase was then added followed by rotation at room temperature for 15 min. After centrifugation at 96,000 × g (35,000 rpm, 45 Ti rotor, Beckman L8) for 30 min, the 20 ml of supernatant was mixed with 5 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 8.0), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 17,600 × g (15,000 rpm, Beckman 45 Ti rotor). This 20% ammonium sulfate pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was mixed with 1.333 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 8.0), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 17,600 × g (15,000 rpm, 45 Ti rotor, Beckman L8). This 25% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaMES brought to pH 6.5 with KOH, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate) followed by centrifugation at 70,000 × g (30,000 rpm, 45 Ti rotor, Beckman L8). The supernatant was brought to 10% glycerol and 50 μm GDP, and then aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The day prior to an experiment, FtsZ was cycled through one round of assembly to further reduce the concentration of contaminants and to increase the fraction of FtsZ capable of assembly into protofilaments. An aliquot (0.5 ml) from the above preparation was thawed and dialyzed (8000 molecular weight cutoff, 6.4-mm wet diameter dialysis tubing, BioDesigns Inc., Carmel, NY) at 4 °C against two changes of 50 ml of buffer A for 1 h each. The sample was brought to room temperature, 2.0 ml of buffer A was added, and the diluted sample was brought to 20 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm GTP after which the sample was allowed to polymerize for 3 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g (13,000 rpm, Biofuge A, Baxter Scientific Products) at room temperature for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet (consistency of a soft gel) was resuspended in ∼1 ml of buffer A. EGTA was added to 5 mm, and the sample was incubated on ice for 30 min to allow disassembly. Subsequent centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 5 min removed any particles unable to resolubilize. The concentration of the resultant solution was determined colorimetrically by BCA assay (Pierce) and corrected for the 25% color difference between FtsZ and the BSA standard (26Lu C. Erickson H.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For FtsZ samples containing no magnesium, the solution described above was brought to 10 mm EDTA (by adding 500 mm EDTA pH 8.0) and then diluted with buffer B (50 mm NaMES brought to pH 6.5 with KOH, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA) to the desired injectant concentration. For FtsZ samples containing magnesium, the solution from calcium cycling was diluted with buffer A. These samples were dialyzed against their appropriate buffers, buffer B and buffer A, respectively, at 4 °C. The buffer was changed after 1 h and again after a second hour; the last 50 ml of buffer was allowed to reach equilibrium overnight. ITC measurements were made in a MicroCal Systems ITC unit (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The reaction cell was loaded (using a 5-ml gas-tight syringe, Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) with 2.5 ml of the final dialysate of the injectant brought to either 200 μm GDP or 1 mm GTP and degassed immediately before the experiment was run. The FtsZ solution was loaded into the injection syringe (250 μl capacity, 101.8 μl/inch) with no added nucleotide. Mg2+ was the same concentration in the syringe as in the reaction cell. All FtsZ experiments were performed at 25 °C with data points taken every 2 s. For the GDP experiments (representative data shown in Fig. 1), 50 injections at 4.995 μl/injection and 12.56 s/injection were made after a 300-s initial delay and with 180 s between the start of each injection (reference offset = 10%). For the GTP experiments (represented in Figs. 2 and 3), 25 injections at 5.058 μl/injection and 12.72 s/injection were made after a 300-s initial delay, with 180 s between the start of each injection (reference offset = 10% for no magnesium, 20% for 2.5 mm magnesium).Figure 2FtsZ injected into buffer with GTP and EDTA. a, raw data are shown for an ITC experiment in which 98.7 μm FtsZ was injected into buffer with 1 mm GTP and 1 mm EDTA. Each peak corresponds to one injection, and each injection increased the FtsZ concentration in the sample by 0.267 μm. The 25 injections shown here provide data for 0.27–6.68 μm. b, integrated heat/injection is calculated by subtracting the base line from the raw data and normalizing to the moles of FtsZ in each injection for each peak in panel a (diamonds). Because the data generate an S-shaped curve (rather than a monotonic decrease in amplitude), the isodesmic model does not fit regardless of theKA, ΔH, and shift parameters chosen, and thus, no calculated curve is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3FtsZ injected into buffer with GTP and magnesium.

The software then integrated each peak to yield integrated heats; these were normalized to the moles of protein in the injectant. Because the base line for the FtsZ experiment with magnesium and GTP (Fig. 3) was highly variable, plots of raw data without base-line subtraction are presented to allow direct comparison (Figs.1a, 2a, and 3). Three repetitions of each experiment were performed to ensure reproducibility. However, only representative samples are shown in the figures. We used numerical modeling to test whether the isodesmic assembly model would match the experimental data. The goal of the calculation was to estimate the total number of FtsZ-FtsZ interfaces as a function of CT, the total concentration of subunits in the reaction cell. The model is based on two equations from Romberg et al. (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar),Ci=(2KA)(i−1)·C1i(Eq. 1) CT=∑​Ni=1iCi(Eq. 2) where Ci is the concentration of protofilaments consisting of i subunits,KA is the equilibrium association constant,N is the longest protofilament modeled, andCT is the total concentration of FtsZ in the solution. This differs from early formulations of isodesmic assembly (19Reisler E. Pouyet J. Eisenberg H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Thusius D. Dessen P. Jallon J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 92: 413-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in the factor 2 in front of KA, which accounts for the equal probability of adding a subunit at either end (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). When we present values of KA from previous studies, we will report the numbers as given in the original papers but will refer to them as 2KA (or the equivalent (1/2)KD). To estimate the total number of interfaces, we used a numerical iteration. Taking FtsZ injected into buffer with GDP as an example, the sample calculation began with choosing KAarbitrarily. For the first calculated injection (concentration = 2.2 μm after injection), C1 was chosen arbitrarily, Ci values were calculated using Equation 1 (to n = 50, at which the concentration is generally very low), and finallyCT was calculated using Equation 2. The value ofC1 was changed, and the calculation was repeated until the CT value equaled 2.2 μm. The total moles of FtsZ-FtsZ interfaces (NINT,2.2 μm) were calculatedNINT,CT=V·∑​Ni=1(i−1)·Ci(Eq. 3) where V is the volume of the solution (2.5 ml in the case of the initial injection). Because an ITC data point consists of a change from the injectant state to the sample state, we also calculated the number of interfaces in the injectant. The KA value was the same, but a new set of calculations for Ci andCT was required (iteratingC1) until CT equaled the injectant concentration (1100 μm). The total moles of interfaces in one injection (NINT, inj) was calculated using Equation 3 with a volume of 5 μl. Finally the normalized heat of injection was calculated using the equationHeat=ΔH(NINT,2.2 μM−NINT,inj)mol inj(Eq. 4) where ΔH is the enthalpy of forming one FtsZ-FtsZ interface. We have now calculated the data point for the first injection. Subsequent injections were calculated similarly. The desiredCT value changes with each injection, and therefore the iteration of C1 must vary accordingly. The only other change was in calculating the normalized heat of injection. The number of interfaces in the sample prior to injection and the number of interfaces in the injectant must both be subtracted from the number of interfaces in the sample after injection.Heat=ΔH·(NINT,X μM−NINT,(X−2.2)μM−NINT,inj)mol inj(Eq. 5) After an entire set of data points (2.2–110 μm) had been calculated, the square of the difference between the calculated points and the experimentally determined points was determined. We found that the curve needed to be shifted down, and therefore we introduced a shift factor that was simply added to the calculated normalized heats of injection. This parameter and ΔH were optimized using the Solver tool in Microsoft Excel to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the calculated points and the experimental points. Finally, the shape of the curve depends on the value chosen for KA. Changing this value required repeating the iteration of all C1values to achieve the desired CT for all injections; thus, this parameter was best-fit by trial and error, using several values and selecting the one that gave the best overall fit. It is worth noting at this point that the isodesmic assembly model always predicts net disassembly from injectant to reaction cell, when the buffers are the same in both, and a curve in which amplitude decreases monotonically with an asymptote of zero (before shifting). This curve fitting procedure was attempted for the data in Figs. 2 and3, but no reasonable fit was obtained. It is therefore shown only in Fig. 1. The nature of ITC experiments necessitates that the concentration of protein in the injection syringe be about 20 times greater than the midpoint of the range of concentrations of interest. To explore assembly/disassembly at ∼50 μm concentrations, the protein in the syringe needs to be at least 1000 μm. Rivas et al. (27Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported a magnesium-dependent assembly of FtsZ-GDP with a (1/2)KD ∼8 μm at 2.5 mmMg (thus, 2KA = 1.25 × 105m−1). The model of Rivas et al.(27Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), termed indefinite assembly, is identical to isodesmic assembly except that the 2KA value is allowed to vary with protofilament length. Because their 2KA did not vary more than the error expected for our experiments, here we treated the Rivas et al. (27Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) model as isodesmic with a fixed KA derived from their Fig. 5a. Because assembly in GDP is not complicated by hydrolysis, we decided first to establish the behavior of FtsZ when injected into a solution containing only buffer and GDP. FtsZ at 1100 μm, in buffer A, was injected into the chamber containing the same buffer with 200 μm GDP. The protein in the injection chamber is assumed to contain approximately equimolar amounts of FtsZ and bound GDP, and no free nucleotide. Fig.1a shows the raw data (with no base-line subtraction to allow for direct comparison to Fig. 3) for an experiment in which the sample concentration was raised 2.2 μm by each injection. In Fig. 1b the data are replotted as integrated heats of mixing for each injection. The first heat of injection is the largest with heats decreasing monotonically as the FtsZ concentration in the sample increases. The interpretation is that at the 1100 μm concentration in the syringe, almost all of the FtsZ is associated into polymers. During the first injection a large fraction of these interfaces disassembled as the concentration dropped to 2.2 μm in the reaction cell; the second injection yielded a slightly smaller fraction of interface disassembly and thus a smaller heat of injection. The heat of injection continued decreasing until the fraction of disassembling interfaces approached zero as the concentration in the chamber rose substantially above KD. To derive more information from these data, we calculated the response we would expect from an isodesmic disassembly of FtsZ protofilaments (Fig. 1b, solid and dashed lines). The curves were calculated as described under “Modeling” and were fit using three parameters: KA, ΔH, and a shift factor. In Fig. 1b the solid line shows the best fit (optimized ΔH and shift factor) using the value 2KA = 2.50 × 105m−1 (KD = 8 μm). The fit was only slightly worse when it was repeated with the 2KA determined previously by Rivaset al. (27Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (dashed line; 2KA = 1.25 × 105 was extrapolated from their Fig. 5A for a magnesium concentration of 2.5 mm). Although there is no corroborating evidence for the ΔH value, the model does match the trend of the data, specifically the monotonic decrease in amplitude of the peaks. The best fit was obtained with ΔH+ −13.6 kcal/mol and a shift factor of −1.17 kcal/mol injectant for each calculated injection. Possible explanations for a shift factor are a difference between the temperature of the injectant and the reaction cell, a heat of mixing for dilution of the protein, or adding buffer with no GDP to the 200 μm GDP in the reaction cell. Because FtsZ has GTPase activity, we performed two experiments to determine the effects of GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis on assembly. The first experiment used a buffer with no magnesium and contained 1 mm EDTA to chelate any residual magnesium. In the absence of magnesium, E. coliFtsZ binds GTP and assembles into protofilaments, but hydrolysis of the nucleotide is blocked completely (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 28Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2a shows the raw data for 98.7 μm FtsZ injected into buffer B with 1 mm GTP. The FtsZ in the syringe contained only its residual GDP. The key features of these data are the initial positive peaks that are obtained up to the 12th injection, at 3.2 μm. The 13th injection, at 3.4 μm, produces a distinctly smaller positive peak and initiates a sharp transition to negative peaks. This transition is complete by 4.5 μm, after which the peaks are uniformly negative. This can be seen even more clearly in Fig. 2b, which shows the integrated heats of mixing for each peak. We believe the positive peaks are due to disassembly of FtsZ-GDP from the highly concentrated injectant state. We attribute the negative peaks to reassembly of subunits supported by GTP. The abruptness of the transition suggests a critical concentration of about 3.5 μm, with little to no assembly at concentrations belowCC and almost complete assembly of all added FtsZ above CC. This transition could not be modeled by an isodesmic assembly process regardless of theKA or ΔH chosen. Therefore, we conclude that, in the presence of GTP, FtsZ assembles in an apparently cooperative manner. It is important to note that the switch to cooperative assembly requires only that FtsZ bind, not hydrolyze, GTP. The addition of 2.5 mm magnesium acetate (and removing EDTA) allows FtsZ to hydrolyze GTP during the assembly process. Injecting FtsZ at 24.7 μm into buffer A containing 1 mm GTP yielded the results shown in Fig.3. Qualitatively the base line begins straight (ITC base lines are rarely exactly horizontal) with a small positive peak at each injection. At about 0.4 μm there are two abrupt changes; each injection now results in a substantial negative displacement, and this is maintained rather than returning to the base line, resulting in a continuous downward slope of the base line. This behavior may be attributed to continuous GTP hydrolysis at concentrations above 0.4 μm. This exothermic process should last at least 30 min to 1 h before the GTP is exhausted, similar to the time scale of the experiment. We had expected the base line to become more negative as more FtsZ was injected, leading to increased GTP hydrolysis, but instead the base-line slope remained constant for the remainder of the experiment. Because the GTP concentration is decreasing with time, we speculate that this behavior may be due to a balance of these factors. We attempted to test this hypothesis by adding a greater concentration of GTP (5 mm), but this created too large a mismatch between the buffer and the injectant, resulting in large heats of mixing that masked the heats from FtsZ-FtsZ binding and GTP hydrolysis (data not shown). These experiments were done three times each, with the transitions (beginning-ending) being 2.4–3.5 and 2.9–4.0 μm and 3.5–4.5 μm for assembly in GTP-EDTA. For assembly in GTP-Mg, the beginning of the transition was observed at 0.4, 0.26, and 0.26 μm. Taking the average of beginnings of the transition as the estimate of Cc, we estimateCc = 2.9 μm for GTP-EDTA andCc = 0.31 μm for Mg-GTP. One of the most distinctive predictions of the isodesmic assembly model is that the association constant for each interface should be very high (KA = 3.3 × 108m−1 (KD = 3 nm)) for assembly in GTP (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This implies that most FtsZ subunits should be associated into short protofilaments at concentrations 3–10 times above KD, ∼10–30 nm. The ITC experiments reported here should report the total formation of interfaces, without the complication of underestimating short protofilaments. ITC experiments in GTP showed no evidence for assembly below micromolar concentrations and therefore do not support the isodesmic assembly model. On the contrary, they gave a clear indication of a critical concentration, which is characteristic of a cooperative assembly. We first analyzed disassembly of FtsZ-GDP and found that it did fit the isodesmic assembly model, with a 2KA close to that derived from a previous study using sedimentation techniques (27Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This 2KA = 2.50 × 105m−1 is 1000 times weaker than that predicted in the isodesmic model. Because the 1100 μm FtsZ in the syringe is well above the KD (16 μm), it will be almost completely assembled. In the ITC experiments the first injections resulted in a dilution in the reaction cell that was well below KD, giving a positive peak corresponding to the disassembly of the polymer. As the concentration in the reaction cell approached KD the peaks decreased, and at concentrations well above KD the peaks approached zero. The experiment was more complicated when FtsZ was injected into the reaction cell containing GTP. The concentration in the syringe was 98.7 and 24.7 μm for the assemblies in EDTA and Mg, respectively. In the experiment using Mg, the 24.7 μm concentration was less than twice theKD; nevertheless, based upon the isodesmic assembly model, which seems to apply for FtsZ-GDP, we expect about two-thirds of the FtsZ to be assembled in the syringe. For the experiment using EDTA we cannot predict the KD, but because Rivas et al. (27Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) found the KA to be proportional to the Mg concentration, we can assume that in the absence of Mg the association will be very weak and the KD high. In this experiment the FtsZ in the syringe should be largely unassembled, consistent with the much smaller positive peaks. In both cases reassembly following the transition generates a substantial negative peak instead of the asymptote to zero seen in the dilution into GDP. This may be due to two factors. First, the disassembly applies only to the two-thirds or less of FtsZ that was assembled in the syringe, whereas reassembly following the transition may be close to 100%. Second, the bond formed in GTP is of higher affinity that that in GDP and may evolve more heat per bond. These two factors should explain why more heat is evolved in the reassembly in GTP than was lost upon the disassembly from GDP. Assembly in magnesium differed from assembly in EDTA in two major respects: the critical concentration was about 10-fold lower, and once the transition occurred there was a continuous downward slope. In both cases the transitions were very sharp. In EDTA, as shown in Fig. 2, the transition began at 3.5 μm and was complete by 4.5 μm, which is only a 33% increase. In Mg the transition was perhaps even sharper, beginning at 0.4 μm and, although we cannot be exact because of the difficulty in integrating the heats of injection due to the changing base line, it seems the heat of injection reached a plateau after only two more injections (0.13 μm). The abrupt transition to assembly at a critical concentration of 0.31 or 2.9 μm is characteristic of cooperative assembly. At present we do not know the mechanism for this apparent cooperativity. Cooperative assembly typically involves two types of bonds, one longitudinal and one lateral, to make a helical or two-dimensional polymer (23Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although protofilaments do seem to associate side-by-side later in assembly and at high protein concentrations (13Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 14White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. Seitz L.E. Moore G.D. Borhani D.W. J.

Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), this association does not seem to be essential because the single subunit-wide protofilaments appear to be the basic polymer under the conditions used here (16Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have sought to explain how a single-stranded protofilament can show features of cooperativity, but several avenues of structural modeling and thermodynamics failed to provide a compelling mechanism. Understanding the mechanism for the apparent cooperativity of FtsZ assembly thus remains a major challenge. We thank Dr. Sambra Redick for helpful discussions."

The pre-TCR is formed by the association of a correctly rearranged βTCR chain with the invariant pTα chain and signaling molecules of the CD3 complex. Since expression of the pre-TCR is critical for αβ T-cell differentiation, dissecting the molecular program that drives the expression of its components is of particular interest to understand the transcriptional regulation of early T-cell development.Recently, the promoter and the enhancer sequences of thepTα gene have been cloned (4Reizis B.

We have previously observed that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, HEB, plays a critical role in the regulation of pTα expression (9Herblot S. Steff A.M. Hugo P. Aplan P.D. Hoang T. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The E2A and HEB genes encode class I bHLH transcription factors, also called E-proteins (E12-E47 and HEB, respectively), which bind specific DNA sequences (E-box, CANNTG) as homo- or heterodimers. E-protein function is essential for T- and B-cell development as revealed by gene-targeting experiments or expression of dominant-negative molecules, such as Id factors or the SCL oncogene (9Herblot S.

Here, we provide evidence that E2A-HEB oligomers determine pTα mRNA levels in DN thymocytes in vivo, through direct binding to two conserved E-boxes of the upstream enhancer. The effect is tightly dose-dependent and is disrupted by heterodimerization with SCL.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we show that the bHLH factors E2A and HEB drive pTα enhancer activity in immature thymocytes through high affinity binding to two conserved E-boxes, E2 and E3. Moreover, SCL inhibits E2A-HEB activity through binding to the same regulatory elements.Importance of E2A-HEB in Driving Stage-specific Activity of the pTα EnhancerDuring thymocyte differentiation, E47 increases at the mRNA and protein levels, determined by flow cytometry analysis, from the DN1 to DN4 stage, and start to decrease as the cells progress to the DP stage (9Herblot S. Steff A.M. Hugo P. Aplan P.D. Hoang T. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 40Engel I. Johns C. Bain G. Rivera R.R. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). HEB mRNA also follows the same pattern (9Herblot S. Steff A.M. Hugo P. Aplan P.D. Hoang T. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our Western blot analysis of CD3ε−/−thymocytes (consisting of more than 90% DN3 cells) and wild-type thymocytes (more than 80% DP cells) suggests that E47 and HEB protein levels decrease at the DP stage. This expression pattern is in agreement with the stage-specific expression of the pTαgene in immature T cells, which is maximal at the DN3 and DN4 stages and then decreases after β selection (41Saint-Ruf C. Ungewiss K. Groettrup M. Bruno L. Fehling H.J. von Boehmer H. Science. 1994; 266: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and the finding that thepTα gene is a target of transcription regulation by E2A and HEB (7Petersson K. Ivars F. Sigvardsson M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Takeuchi A. Yamasaki S. Takase K. Nakatsu F. Arase H. Onodera M. Saito T. J.

More importantly, this correlation suggests that pTα levels are determined by E2A/HEB levels. In the present study, we provide direct evidence that E2A and HEB gene dosage determines pTα mRNA levels.At the molecular level, the regulatory elements of the pTαgene have been identified and Reizis and Leder (4Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have shown that the pTα upstream enhancer is necessary and sufficient to drive stage and tissue-specific expression of the pTα gene in immature thymocytes. Indeed, this regulatory sequence is inactive in transient transfection assays in non-T cells or in mature T-cell lines that do not express the endogenous pTα gene (data not shown) (4Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reporter transgenes driven by thepTα enhancer element are preferentially expressed in immature thymocytes, in a pattern closely resembling that of the endogenous pTα gene (5Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Gounari F. Aifantis I. Martin C. Fehling H.J. Hoeflinger S. Leder P. von Boehmer H. Reizis B. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Analysis of thepTα enhancer sequence revealed potential binding sites for several transcription factors, including ZBP89, YY1, c-Myb, CSL, and E-proteins. Previous reports have shown that pTα enhancer activity depends on the integrity of binding sites for c-Myb and CSL, the latter a downstream effector of the Notch1 pathway (5Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Reizis B. Leder P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, mutation of either c-Myb or the CSL binding site did not abolish enhancer activity in transgenic reporter experiments, suggesting that these transcription factors, otherwise important for optimal and stage-specific pTα expression, are not absolutely required for enhancer activity.Here we demonstrate that in addition to c-Myb and the CSL-NICD complex, E2A and HEB are critical determinants of pTα enhancer activity. Moreover, 80% of enhancer activity in a DN cell line is determined by two E-box binding sites, E2 and E3, which are conserved between mouse and man (5Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that E2A and HEB associate with these E-boxes with high affinity in vitro and in vivo, while E4 that is not conserved (5Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has a low affinity for these proteins. We therefore propose that E2A and HEB serve as nucleation factors for the assembly of a multimeric complex into an enhanceosome-like structure.There is substantive controversy with regards to the contribution of E-boxes to pTα enhancer activity. Indeed, Reizis and Leder (5Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Takeuchi et al. (8Takeuchi A. Yamasaki S. Takase K. Nakatsu F. Arase H. Onodera M. Saito T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggested that mutations of these E-boxes did not affect enhancer activity, while Peterssonet al. (7Petersson K. Ivars F. Sigvardsson M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported the opposite. This discrepancy may be attributed to different cellular contexts used for transient transactivation assays or alternatively, to the reporter vector itself used in these experiments. Indeed, our previous work indicated that the promoterless pXpII vector, as well as other luciferase reporter vectors (pGL3 basic), contains E-boxes within or near their multiple cloning sites (19Lecuyer E. Herblot S. Saint-Denis M. Martin R. Begley C.G. Porcher C. Orkin S.H. Hoang T. Blood. 2002; 100: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The use of the modified pXpIII vector (19Lecuyer E. Herblot S. Saint-Denis M. Martin R. Begley C.G. Porcher C. Orkin S.H. Hoang T. Blood. 2002; 100: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) where all E-boxes in the vicinity of the multiple cloning site were mutated has permitted us to reveal the functional importance of the conserved E-box sites on pTα enhancer activity.Transient transactivation assays in heterologous cells indicate that E47 can activate the pTα enhancer and promoter, the latter containing a tandem E-box site previously shown to be required for full promoter activity (5Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Takeuchi A. Yamasaki S. Takase K. Nakatsu F. Arase H. Onodera M. Saito T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, a role for E2A in activating thepTα gene in primary thymocytes has not been assessed. Using two complementary approaches, we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that E47 binds both pTα regulatory sequences in vivo. Furthermore, the activity of a singleE2A allele is not sufficient for full pTα gene expression, indicating that HEB does not compensate for E2A haploinsufficiency, at least with regards to the transcriptional activity of thepTα locus. Hence, E2A+/− mice exhibit a 30% lower level of pTα mRNA in DN thymocytes, with variable penetrance, and a modest decrease in thymocyte numbers. Interestingly, loss of one E2A allele in the context of theHEB+/− genotype exacerbates T-cell differentiation defect caused by HEB haploinsufficiency, resulting in an increase in the DN and ISP populations (28Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These results revealed the importance of E2A and HEB in T-cell development (28Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We show here that both E2A and HEB bind the pTα regulatory sequences in chromatin and that full E2A and HEB loci activities are required for proper pTα expression. We therefore conclude that the combined dosage of E2A and HEB controls pre-TCR levels and, consequently, determines cell fate in the thymus.SCL-E2A/HEB Complexes Occupy E-box Elements within the pTα Enhancer and PromoterSCL is a tissue-specific bHLH transcription factor that heterodimerizes with E47 and HEB and binds DNA at consensus E-box sequences (43Hsu H.L. Cheng J.T. Chen Q. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3037-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 44Hsu H.L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SCL shows an opposite expression profile to that of E proteins (9Herblot S. Steff A.M. Hugo P. Aplan P.D. Hoang T. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and decreases from the DN1 to DN3 stage, exactly when pTα mRNA increases. We and others have previously shown that ectopic SCL expression in the thymus, in combination with its nuclear partners LMO1 or LMO2, down-regulates E-protein target genes such as the CD4 and pTα genes (9Herblot S. Steff A.M. Hugo P. Aplan P.D. Hoang T. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18Chervinsky D.S. Zhao X.F. Lam D.H. Ellsworth M. Gross K.W. Aplan P.D. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 2002; 100: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism through which SCL represses E-protein function in thymocytes remains to be determined. SCL could either sequester E2A-HEB factors into complexes that do not bind DNA in the same way as Id proteins, HLH factors lacking a DNA binding domain. Alternatively, SCL-containing complexes could bind DNA on E-protein target sites and prevent E-protein transcriptional activity. Here we show that SCL associates with E2A or HEB and binds in vitro the pTαE-box sites, E2 and E3, with the same affinity as E2A-HEB heterodimers and that SCL occupies the pTα enhancer and promoter sequences in vivo, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Together, these results suggest that the repression induced by SCL is mediated by a DNA binding-dependent mechanism rather than a sequestration effect. It remains to be determined whether SCL disrupts the formation of a transcription factor complex required for optimal enhancer activity or alternatively, whether SCL recruits new cofactors that repress pTα gene transcription. In B cell development, E2A recruits a chromatin remodeling complex at target DNA (46Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 47Massari M.E. Grant P.A. Pray-Grant M.G. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Murre C.

It is possible that high levels of the SCL transgene are sufficient to form inactive SCL-E2A or SCL-HEB heterodimers, hampering the formation of this complex (the present study) (45Goardon N. Schuh A. Hajar I. Ma X. Jouault H. Dzierzak E. Romeo P.H. Maouche-Chretien L. Blood. 2002; 100: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Alternatively, since SCL genetically interacts with LMO1 or LMO2 to inhibit T-cell development at the DN-DP transition point controlled by the pre-TCR, it is possible that SCL recruits new cofactors that actively repress pTα gene transcription. Further protein-protein interaction studies are warranted to distinguish between these two possibilities.In summary, we unambiguously identify the pTα enhancer and promoter sequences as direct targets of E2A-HEB heterodimers in the thymus, as well as direct targets of repression by the SCL oncogene. Moreover, we show that pTα and SCL exhibit opposite expression patterns in DN1 to DN3 subsets, indicating that SCL may regulate E-protein activity during early thymocyte development. These results, together with previous reports, suggest that the pTαenhancer is regulated by a complex combination of transcription factors including c-Myb, CSL-NICD complex, and E-proteins. This unique combination may determine the tissue and stage-specific expression of an essential component of the pre-TCR, the pTα chain, required for αβ T-cell development. The development of αβ T cells from multipotent progenitors is a complex and multistep process that is critically dependent on genetic recombination and extracellular signals. Maturation of recent thymic immigrants from bone marrow derived precursors is characterized by the sequential expression of the pre-TCR1 complex and of several surface markers including CD4 and CD8 (1Godfrey D.I. Zlotnik A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 547-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Within the CD4/CD8 double-negative (DN) population, cell survival, cell proliferation, and β allelic exclusion as well as the subsequent transition to the more mature CD4/CD8 double-positive (DP) stage (2Chaffin K.E.

The pre-TCR is formed by the association of a correctly rearranged βTCR chain with the invariant pTα chain and signaling molecules of the CD3 complex. Since expression of the pre-TCR is critical for αβ T-cell differentiation, dissecting the molecular program that drives the expression of its components is of particular interest to understand the transcriptional regulation of early T-cell development. Recently, the promoter and the enhancer sequences of thepTα gene have been cloned (4Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp.

Hoang T. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The E2A and HEB genes encode class I bHLH transcription factors, also called E-proteins (E12-E47 and HEB, respectively), which bind specific DNA sequences (E-box, CANNTG) as homo- or heterodimers. E-protein function is essential for T- and B-cell development as revealed by gene-targeting experiments or expression of dominant-negative molecules, such as Id factors or the SCL oncogene (9Herblot S.

In the current study, we show that inactivation of Cdc13p induces apoptotic signals in yeast, as evidenced by caspase activation, increased reactive oxygen species production, and flipping of phosphatidylserine in the cytoplasmic membrane. These apoptotic signals were suppressed in a mitochondrial (ρo) mutant. Moreover, mitochondrial proteins (e.g. MTCO3) were identified as multicopy suppressors of cdc13-1, suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial functions in telomere-initiated apoptotic signaling. These telomere-initiated apoptotic signals were also shown to depend onMEC1, but not TEL1, and were antagonized byMRE11.

Cdc13p appears to be a multifunctional protein involved in both telomere replication and protection (1Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 2Lin J.J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1777-1788PubMed Google Scholar). Its role in telomere replication has been suggested based on the findings that it interacts with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α and an essential subunit of telomerase, Est1p (4Qi H. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1777-1788PubMed Google Scholar), and a mutation form of CDC13,cdc13-2, shows the telomerase negative phenotype (3Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Its essential role in protecting yeast telomeres is presumably related to its binding to the exposed G-strand (1Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 2Lin J.J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Buckley K. Lundblad V. Cell. 2001; 104: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Cdc13-1p (P371S), a temperature-sensitive mutant form of Cdc13p, is unable to protect telomeres at the restrictive temperature (1Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). At the non-permissive temperature, cells with the cdc13-1 allele exhibit extensive degradation of telomeres from the 5′-ends, the C-rich strands (C-strands). The C-strand degradation results in long single-stranded G-tails (up to 20 kb) at the 3′-ends. The abnormal telomeres incdc13-1 at the non-permissive temperature lead toRAD9-dependent cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, as well as cell death (1Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Lydall D. Weinert T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of cell death triggered by Cdc13p inactivation is unclear. It was assumed that essential gene deletion because of the C-strand degradation is the cause of the cell death. Yeast apoptosis is not well understood. Bax, Bcl-2, and other established apoptotic proteins have not been found in yeast cells. However, expression of human BAX in yeast induces cell death (7Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,8Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guerin M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), accompanied by mitochondrial alkalinization and cytosol acidification (9Matsuyama S. Llopis J. Deveraux Q.L. Tsien R.Y. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). This process can be blocked by co-expression of human anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 (8Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guerin M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Additionally, aged mother cells and H2O2-treated cells have shown apoptosis markers in yeast, including flipping of phosphatidylserine (PS)1 from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, DNA damage (by TUNEL assay), and reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) induction (10Laun P. Pichova A. Madeo F. Fuchs J. Ellinger A. Kohlwein S. Dawes I. Frohlich K.U. Breitenbach M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). More recently, a caspase-like protease Yca1p has been identified in yeast and was found to regulate yeast cell death induced by H2O2 treatment (12Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Moreover, a broad range mammalian caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk inhibits cell death in yeast induced by H2O2 treatment (12Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In addition, like apoptosis in mammalian cells, yeast apoptosis is inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (11Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that inactivation of Cdc13p activates caspase activity, increases ROS production, and induces flipping of PS in the cytoplasmic membrane. Caspase activation and ROS induction were shown to be MEC1-dependent and antagonized byMRE11, suggesting the involvement of DNA damage signaling. Caspase activation appears to involve mitochondria and is linked to cell death because a mitochondrial mutant (ρo) significantly suppressed caspase activation and cell death. Moreover, mitochondrial proteins have been identified as multicopy suppressors of cell death incdc13-1. YPH cdc13-1a (MATa cdc13-1 his7 leu2-3 ura3-52 trp1-289), YPH cdc13-1α(MATα cdc13-1 his7 leu2-3 ura3-52 trp1-289) and the isogenic wild type (his7 leu2-3 ura3-52 trp1-289), W13α (MATα cdc13-1 his7 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 trp1-289) and its isogenic wild type strain (MATα his7 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 trp1-289), YPH499tel1::HIS3, YPH499mre11::LEU2, and YPH499mec1::URA3 slm1::TRP1 were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Virginia A. Zakian (Princeton University, New Jersey). The haploid cdc13-1 mec1::URA3 sml1::TRP1 was generated by mating YPH499mec1::URA3 slm1::TRP1 with W13α. The haploidcdc13-1 mre11::LEU2 was generated by mating W13α with YPH499 mre11::LEU2. The haploid strain cdc13-1 tel1::HIS3was generated by mating YPH499 cdc13-1 or W13a with YPH500tel1::HIS3. The W13α ρostrain was generated by growing W13α in a minimum medium containing 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide to saturation. The ethidium-treated culture was inoculated in the same medium containing ethidium and grew to saturation again, as described (13Guthrie G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 150-151Google Scholar, 14Simon H.U. Haj-Yehia A. Levi-Schaffer F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, essentially all clones will be ρo. These ρo clones are unable to grow in medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source (e.g. 2% glycerol). PS flipping was measured by using the ApoAlert annexin V-EGFP apoptosis kit from Clontech with modifications as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, log phase yeast cells (5 × 106) were harvested, washed in a sorbitol buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 35 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8), and digested with 5.5% glusulase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 15 units/ml lyticase (Sigma) in the sorbitol buffer for 2 h at 28 °C. Cells were washed with a binding buffer (10 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1.2 m sorbitol). Annexin V-EGFP was added to cells according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with the binding buffer and resuspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer for FACS analysis. Caspase activity was measured by using a CaspACE FITC-VAD-fmk in situ marker from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 5 × 106 yeast cells were stained with 100 μmFITC-VAD-fmk at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Cells were then washed and resuspended with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline buffer. FACS analysis of cells was performed with excitation of 488 nm and emission of 525–550 nm. ROS was measured by adding dihydrorhodamine 123 to log phase cells (final concentration, 25 μg/ml). Cells continued to grow in the medium for 2 h. Cells were then subjected to FACS analysis. In an attempt to isolate cdc13-1suppressors, we transformed cdc13-1 with a yeast genomic library (15Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had inserts of about 1 kb in size linked to a Gal1 promoter. Two clones that suppressed the cdc13-1 temperature sensitivity at 34 °C were isolated. These clones were identified as fragments of YDR333C and antisense of CYC8 (Fig.1). We also transformedcdc13-1 with a human HeLa cDNA library. Expression of cDNAs in this library is also under the control of the Gal1 promoter. One clone was isolated and identified as the mitochondrial protein MTCO3 (Fig. 1). All three proteins, Ydr333Cp, Cyc8p, and MTCO3, are involved in mitochondrial functions. Ydr333Cp was found to interact with the mitochondrial ribosomal protein Mrp51p (16Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar), which is involved in regulating the expression of COX2 and COX3 (17Green-Willms N.S. Fox T.D. Costanzo M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1826-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), subunits 2 and 3 of yeast mitochondrial cytochrome coxidase, respectively. CYC8 encodes a protein that regulates expression of COX3 and COX6 of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (18Wright R.M. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1297-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MTCO3 is subunit 3 of human mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. As mitochondrial functions are known to affect apoptotic cell death in mammalian cells (14Simon H.U. Haj-Yehia A. Levi-Schaffer F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar, 19Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results point to the possibility thatcdc13-1 cells may die of apoptosis. To test whether cdc13-1 cells die of apoptosis, various known apoptosis markers were measured at the non-permissive temperature. A caspase inhibitory substrate conjugated with FITC (FITC-VAD-fmk) was used to monitor caspase activation in cdc13-1 cells (12Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This compound can freely enter yeast cells and binds only to the activated caspase (12Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The caspase activity can be measured by the intensity of the FITC fluorescent signal. As shown in Fig.2B, after incubation ofcdc13-1 at 37 °C overnight, about 60% of the cell population exhibited intense FITC fluorescence, indicative of caspase activation. Interestingly, 43.5% of cells survived the overnight incubation at 37 °C, which was monitored by plating the same samples at the permissive temperature (23 °C) (Fig. 2A). The caspase inhibitor, VAD-fmk, is a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor in mammalian cells. Yca1p, being the only identified caspase in yeast, is known to be inhibited by VAD-fmk (12Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Consequently, caspase activation in cdc13-1 cells revealed by the use of FITC-conjugated VAD-fmk is likely because of activation of Yca1p. Another early event of apoptosis in mammalian cells is the increased production of ROS in mitochondria (14Simon H.U. Haj-Yehia A. Levi-Schaffer F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Early log phase yeast cells, wild type and cdc13-1, incubates at room temperature or 37 °C were mixed with the compound dihydrorhodamine 123, which can be oxidized by ROS to become fluorescent chromophore rhodamine 123. Flow cytometric analysis of rhodamine 123 (Fig. 2C) showed an additional peak with more fluorescent intensity incdc13-1 at 37 °C but not in the wild type strain at 37 °C. This result indicates that ROS was induced upon inactivation of Cdc13p. We also checked the flipping of PS from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. PS is normally present in the inner leaflet of the bi-layer cell membrane in budding yeast (20Cerbon J. Calderon V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1067: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), as in mammalian cells (21Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, PS is transferred to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane in mammalian cells by an unknown mechanism, although the cell membrane structure is intact (21Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). PS has high affinity to a protein, annexin V (22Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and therefore can be detected by annexin V-EGFP. As shown in Fig. 2D, PS flipping, as revealed by surface fluorescence because of binding of annexin V-EGFP to the flipped PS in the outer leaflet of the membrane, occurred in cdc13-1(bottom right panel) but not in the wild type strain (top right panel) at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 2E, the annexin V-EGFP fluorescence signal revealed by FACS analysis was greatly enhanced upon inactivation of the telomere binding protein Cdc13p at 37 °C incdc13-1 cells (bottom right panel) compared with that in cdc13-1 cells at room temperature (bottom left panel) or wild type cells at 37 °C (top right panel). Mitochondria play a pivotal role in apoptosis in mammalian cells (19Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the involvement of mitochondria in cdc13-1 death, we generated a mitochondria-deficient mutant ρo in both wild type andcdc13-1 strain backgrounds using the ethidium method (13Guthrie G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 150-151Google Scholar). Because these mitochondria-deficient cells cannot respire, they cannot utilize non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. As shown in Fig. 3A (top four panels), ρo mutants grew in Glc but not Gly medium at 26 °C. ρo rescued cdc13-1partially at a non-permissive temperature, 30 °C (Fig.3A, bottom two panels). Suppression of cdc13-1 by ρo was observed up to 34 °C but not at 37 °C (data not shown). To test if the ρo mutant blocks cdc13-1-induced caspase activation, we used the same caspase assay. As shown in Fig.3B, the ρo mutant exhibited greatly reduced activation of caspase in cdc13-1 background (bottom panels). The essential protein Mec1, an ATM-like kinase (24Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13749-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), is a checkpoint protein and is involved in telomere maintenance (25Craven R.J. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2378-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Ritchie K.B. Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell.

Its essential function can be separated from its checkpoint and telomere functions by deletion of Sml1p, which regulates the nucleotide pools (26Ritchie K.B. Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Longhese M.P. Paciotti V. Neecke H. Lucchini G. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1577-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zhao X.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To test whether Mec1p mediates apoptotic signals in cdc13-1 cells, we constructed themec1Δ sml1Δ cdc13-1 mutant strain (also labeled asmec1 cdc13-1 in Fig. 4). The mutant mec1Δ sml1Δ cdc13-1 had a slight higher permissive temperature (about 29 °C), as previously reported (31Grandin N. Damon C. Charbonneau M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6127-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, mec1Δ sml1Δ greatly reduced caspase activation (Fig. 4A) and ROS production (Fig. 4B) incdc13-1. The reduction in apoptotic signals in the triple mutant is because of mec1Δ but not sml1Δ, because sml1Δ did not reduce the apoptotic signals (caspase activation and ROS induction) in cdc13-1 (data not shown). Both sml1Δ and mec1Δ sml1Δ mutants were viable and did not generate apoptotic signals (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the MEC1 mediates the apoptotic signals generated by inactivation of Cdc13p. We also tested the role of Tel1p in telomere-initiated apoptosis signaling. Like Mec1p, Tel1p is another yeast ATM homologue (24Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13749-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Tel1p is known to be involved in telomere maintenance and checkpoint (32Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Genetics. 2000; 155: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar,33Usui T. Ogawa H. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We analyzed multiple isolates of the tel1Δ cdc13-1double mutant for caspase activation and ROS production. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, unlike the mec1Δ cdc13-1 double mutant, the tel1Δ cdc13-1 double mutant showed slightly reduced caspase activation (C) and ROS production (D), suggesting that Tel1p is not significantly involved in telomere-initiated apoptotic signaling. TheMRE11/RAD50/XRS2 (MRX) complex has been shown to function in telomere length maintenance (32Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Genetics. 2000; 155: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar) and checkpoint activation by DNA double strand breaks (33Usui T. Ogawa H. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The MRX complex contains exonuclease activity and has been proposed to process double strand breaks for repair (33Usui T. Ogawa H. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 34Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1336-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Deletion of any gene in the MRX complex abolishes the function of the complex and therefore exhibits the same phenotypes (30Tsukamoto Y. Taggart A.K.P. Zakian V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Genetics. 2000; 155: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar, 35Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To study the roles of the MRX complex in cdc13-1-induced apoptosis, we constructed cdc13-1 mre11Δ double mutants. The cdc13-1 mre11Δ double mutant had a lower maximum permissive temperature (26 °C) than the cdc13-1 single mutant (28 °C) (data not shown), in agreement with a previous report (36Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cdc13-1 mre11Δ double mutant died more extensively than the cdc13-1 single mutant after overnight incubation at 37 °C as assayed by plating at the permissive temperature (23 °C) (about 100-fold lower survival, data not shown). Similarly, the cdc13-1 mre11Δ double mutant exhibited more extensive caspase activation (Fig. 4E, right panel) and ROS induction (Fig. 4F,right panel) than the cdc13-1 single mutant. The mre11Δ single mutant was viable and did not activate caspase nor induce ROS (data not shown). These results suggest that the MRX complex may function in repairing damaged telomeres and thereby antagonizing telomere-initiated apoptotic signals. We have shown that inactivation of Cdc13p in cdc13-1 yeast cells leads to caspase activation, PS flipping, and increased ROS production (Fig. 2). These three events are major landmarks of apoptosis in mammalian cells (37Araya R. Uehara T. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and have been demonstrated to occur in yeast (10Laun P. Pichova A. Madeo F. Fuchs J. Ellinger A. Kohlwein S. Dawes I. Frohlich K.U. Breitenbach M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J.

Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). These apoptotic signals probably reflect cell death because caspase activation and cell death appear to be correlated (e.g. about 60% of cells were shown to undergo both caspase activation and cell death as shown in Fig. 2, A andB). Moreover, we demonstrated that a mitochondria-deficient ρo mutant suppressed both cdc13-1-induced caspase activation (Fig. 3B) and death of cdc13-1 cells at the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 3A). The involvement of mitochondria in telomere-initiated apoptotic signals was also supported by suppression analysis. We have identified three multicopy suppressors of cdc13-1. Interestingly, these suppressors are either directly or indirectly related to mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochromec oxidase is known to trigger apoptosis in mammalian cells (38Mills E.M. Gunasekar P.G. Pavlakovic G. Isom G.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Bhattacharya R. Lakshmana Rao P.V. Toxicology. 1997; 123: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, apoptosis has been shown to be associated with reduction of MTCO3 (40You K.R. Wen J. Lee S.T. Kim D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3870-3877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, Bax-induced apoptosis in yeast has been shown to result in reduction of cytochrome coxidase (8Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guerin M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 41Manon S. Priault M. Camougrand N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1314-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It seems possible that overexpression of cytochromec oxidase may suppress apoptosis. Indeed, overexpression of subunit 3 of the human mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (MTCO3) resulted in reduced apoptotic signals in human 293T cells. 2T-K. Li, H. Qi, and L. F. Liu, unpublished results. We have noticed that none of the suppressors or the mitochondria-deficient strains can fully rescue cdc13-1 at 37 °C. In addition, cell death as measured by colony formation inmec1Δ sml1Δ cdc13-1 cells was almost the same as incdc13-1 cells, although the apoptotic signals were essentially abolished in mec1Δ sml1Δ cdc13-1 cells (Fig.4, A and B). However, the cell number inmec1Δ sml1Δ cdc13-1 did increase 3–5-fold compared withcdc13-1 after overnight incubation at 37 °C in agreement with a previous report (42Maringele L. Lydall D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1919-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These results suggest that in addition to apoptosis, cdc13-1 cells may die through another cell death pathway(s). It is conceivable that essential gene deletion because of extensive degradation from the telomere ends or mitotic catastrophe because of MEC1 DNA damage checkpoint defect may result in cell death by a pathway distinct from apoptosis incdc13-1 cells. Both MEC1and TEL1 are yeast homologues of the human ATM kinase (24Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13749-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and are involved in telomere maintenance (25Craven R.J. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2378-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Ritchie K.B. Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 30Tsukamoto Y. Taggart A.K.P. Zakian V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our studies have shown that MEC1 deletion can dramatically reduce (from 52 to 8%) caspase activation and ROS production in cdc13-1 cells (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the apoptotic signaling in cdc13-1 cells is primarily mediated byMEC1. Surprisingly, TEL1 did not significantly affect caspase activation in cdc13-1 cells at the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 4, C and D). Telomere dysfunction in human cells by inactivation of TRF2, a mammalian telomere binding protein (43Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), results in ATM-dependent apoptosis in some human cells (44Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that MEC1 is more related to ATR whereas TEL1 is more related to ATM (45Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It is unclear why telomere dysfunction in yeast triggers MEC1- rather thanTEL1-dependent caspase activation. One possibility is thatcdc13-1 inactivation and TRF2 inhibition produce different biochemical effects on telomeres. It is known that Cdc13p binds preferentially to single-stranded (ss) telomeric sequences (1Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), whereas TRF2 prefers to bind to double-stranded (ds) telomeric sequences at the ds/ss junctions and promotes t-loop formation (43Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 46Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Moreover, inactivation Cdc13p results in long ss G-tails, whereas inactivation of TRF2 results in loss of G-tails in apoptotic cells (44Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that TEL1 plays a dual role at telomeres: damage repairing and checkpoint signaling, which would have opposing effects on caspase activation. Further studies are necessary to distinguish between these possibilities. In addition, it is worth noting that MEC1, but not TEL1, is involved in a telomere checkpoint pathway required for senescence in yeast (27Enomoto S. Glowczewski L. Berman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2626-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Cdc13p has been shown to result in activation of the RAD9 checkpoint and arrest of cells in G2/M phase because of the generation of extended ss G-rich strands (1Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the MRX complex acts upstream ofRAD9 in activating checkpoint and DNA damage repair (33Usui T. Ogawa H. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The MRX complex also functions in telomere maintenance (32Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Genetics. 2000; 155: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar). Our results have shown that cdc13-1 mre11Δ double mutants died more extensively than the cdc13-1 single mutant and exhibited more extensive caspase activation and ROS production (Fig. 4,E and F), suggesting that the MRX complex antagonizes the telomere-initiated apoptotic signals. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the MRX complex may terminate the telomere-initiated apoptotic signaling by promoting homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining at the de-protected telomeres. In the aggregate, our results suggest a model that is schematically shown in Fig. 5. In this model, inactivation of Cdc13-1p results in extensive degradation of the telomeric C-strands and hence the exposure of the G-tails. The exposed G-tails then activate a MEC1-dependent nuclear mitochondrial apoptotic pathway leading to caspase activation and other apoptotic signals. The G-tails can also triggerRAD9-dependent DNA damage signals under less severe conditions (1Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Lydall D. Weinert T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The DNA damage in cdc13-1 can be repaired by the MRX complex, presumably through homologous and/or non-homologous recombination. Extensive degradation of the telomeres may also lead to essential gene deletion or mitotic catastrophe in addition to apoptosis. Our results suggest that apoptosis or apoptosis-like cell death occurs in yeast upon exposure of the G-tails. Although it is not clear if the initial signal is the exposed G-tails in mammalian cell, this signal pathway appears to be conserved: initiated by abnormal telomeres, mediated by ATM-like kinase in the nucleus and through mitochondria in the cytosol. At present, the functional significance of this conserved telomere-initiated, nuclear mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is still unclear. It is conceivable, however, that the telomeres may play an important role in cell death regulation. We are grateful to Drs. Virginia A. Zakian, Andrew K. P. Taggart, and Yasumasa Tsukamoto and to Lara Goudsouzian for providing various yeast strains and helpful discussion."

In transient transfections, forskolin plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), which increases intracellular cAMP, stimulated the transcriptional activities of both ERα and ERβ. This effect was blocked by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (N-(2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide) and was dependent on an estrogen response element. A 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) located 5′ to the estrogen response element was necessary for cAMP-dependent activation of gene expression by ERβ but not ERα, indicating that the former subtype requires a functional interaction with TRE-interacting factor(s) to stimulate transcription. Both p160 and CREB-binding protein coactivators stimulated cAMP-induced ERα and ERβ transcriptional activity. However, mutation of the two cAMP-inducible SRC-1 phosphorylation sites important for cAMP activation of chicken progesterone receptor or all seven known SRC-1 phosphorylation sites did not specifically impair cAMP activation of ERα. The E/F domains of ERα are sufficient for activation by forskolin/IBMX, and this is accompanied by an increase in receptor phosphorylation. In contrast, cAMP signaling reduces the phosphorylation of the corresponding region of ERβ, and this correlates with the lack of forskolin/IBMX stimulated transcriptional activity. Our data suggest that cAMP activation of ERα transcriptional activity is associated with receptor instead of SRC-1 phosphorylation. Moreover, differences in the cofactor requirements, domains of ERα and ERβ sufficient for forskolin/IBMX activation, and the effect of cAMP on receptor phosphorylation indicate that this signaling pathway utilizes distinct mechanisms to stimulate ERα and ERβ transcriptional activity.

These ligand-regulatable transcription factors possess six structural domains labeled A through F (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). The A/B domain encompasses activation function-1 (AF-1); the C and D domains correspond to the DNA binding domain and the hinge region, respectively; the E region encompasses a second activation function (AF-2) and an overlapping ligand binding domain; and the F domain, located at the extreme carboxyl terminus, is thought to play a modulatory role in ER activity. Both ERs possess similar binding affinities for estradiol and their cognate DNA binding site (estrogen response element; ERE), which is likely caused by the high degree of sequence homology they share in their ligand and DNA binding domains (2Cowley S.M.

Notable for ERα, in most cases the AF-1 and the AF-2 domains interact functionally to enhance transcription in a cooperative manner (7Tora L. White J.H. Brou C. Tasset D.M. Webster N.J.G. Scheer E.

In the best studied mechanism of ERα and ERβ activation, hormone diffuses into the cell, binds to the receptor, and induces a conformational change in the receptor ligand binding domain (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Receptors, bound to their EREs either as ERα or ERβ homodimers or ERα:ERβ heterodimers, can then recruit coactivators to the promoter region of estrogen target genes via their interaction with the receptor activation domains (2Cowley S.M.

In addition to this relatively well characterized mode of activation, ERα can be activated via the cAMP signaling pathway in the apparent absence of estrogens (for review, see Ref. 18Coleman K.M. Smith C.L. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1379-D1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, endogenous ERα target genes, including the progesterone receptor (PR; Ref. 19Cho H. Aronica S.M.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), can be stimulated either with the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or a combination of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and cholera toxin, which increases cAMP production via a G protein-mediated signal transduction pathway. Importantly, in these experiments as well as in later studies the cAMP-induced responses are inhibited by treatment with the pure antiestrogen ICI 164,384, signifying their receptor dependence (19Cho H. Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20el-Tanani M.K. Green C.D. Mol. Cell.

Demonstrating the need to transfect ERα into cells lacking endogenous receptor further supported this receptor dependence (22El-Tanani M. Green C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 928-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to these ERα studies a number of reports indicate that the transcriptional activities of several other nuclear receptors can be modulated by the cAMP signaling pathway. For example, the chicken PR (23Denner L.A. Weigel N.L. Maxwell B.L. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1990; 250: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), androgen receptor (24Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol.

Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3175-3182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) can be activated by cAMP signaling, demonstrating that this mode of ligand-independent activation is not exclusive to ERα. However, human PR (28Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) cannot be activated ligand-independently via this mechanism, nor can the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor, although cAMP stimulation increases the hormone-dependent responses of these receptors (29Rangarajan P.N.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Collectively, these reports demonstrate the specific nature by which the cAMP signaling pathway can cross-talk with different nuclear receptors. Some progress has been made in the effort to understand the mechanisms involved in cAMP activation of nuclear receptor-dependent transcription. Although an increase in receptor phosphorylation accompanies the cAMP-mediated activation of ERα (31LeGoff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), there is no increase in chicken PR phosphorylation associated with its activation in cells treated with 8-bromo-cAMP (33Bai W. Rowan B.G. Allgood V.E. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10457-10463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rather, cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling enhances chicken PR-dependent transcription, in part by increasing phosphorylation of a receptor-interacting coactivator, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), and thereby promotes a more stable interaction between this coactivator and p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor and facilitates functional synergism between SRC-1 and CBP (34Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although it is still unknown how the unliganded ERα is activated by cAMP/PKA, there is evidence that the transcription factor, CREB, can interact functionally with ERα and thereby mediate synergism between the 17β-estradiol (E2)-dependent and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways (35Lazennec G. Thomas J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The identification of ERβ has increased our awareness of the diversity of potential mechanisms by which ER-dependent and estrogenic responses may be achieved (6Kuiper G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar). Notably, the relative magnitude of ERα- and ERβ-mediated estrogen activation of ERE-containing reporters typically varies depending on the cell type and promoter context (36Jones P.S. Parrott E. White I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32008-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, both ERα- and ERβ-dependent transcription can be modulated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling pathway (8Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 9Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol.

Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, whether ERβ can be activated by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, and we therefore examined this using transient transfection assays and synthetic agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels. In so doing, we have defined mechanistic differences between cAMP activation of ERα and ERβ, particularly with respect to phosphorylation and the influence of cross-talk with AP-1 transcription factors. Moreover, we report that all of the p160 coactivators, as well as CBP, can coactivate ERα and ERβ transcriptional activity stimulated by cAMP pathways, and we demonstrate that the importance of SRC-1 phosphorylation to cAMP activation of gene expression is receptor-dependent. E2, IBMX, and N-(2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89) were obtained from Sigma. Forskolin was obtained from Calbiochem(San Diego).

Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 939-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The pBind expression plasmid encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The SRC-1a phosphorylation mutant pCR3.1-hSRC-1a-7Ala, which has alanine substitutions at positions 372, 395, 517, 569, 1033, 1179, and 1185, was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the appropriate mutagenic primers. The plasmids were sequenced to ensure that errors did not occur during mutagenesis. The constructs for hERα-179C (pCR3.1-hERα-179C) and hERβ-143C (pCR3.1-hERβ-143C) were made by PCR using the primers 5′-ACCATGGCCAAGGAGACTCGCTACTGT-3′ and 5′-CTCTCAGACTGTGGCAGGGAAACC-3′ to amplify the segment of pCMV5-hERα encoding amino acids 179–595 and the primers 5′-ACCATGAAGAGGGATGCTCACTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCACTGAGACTGTGGGTTCTG-3′ to PCR amplify the segment of pCXN2-hERβ encoding residues 143–530, respectively. Each of the resulting PCR fragments was subcloned into the pCR3.1 expression plasmid using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The expression plasmids encoding Gal-ERα EF (pBind-ERα EF) and Gal-ERβ EF (pBind-ERβ EF) were generated by PCR using the primers 5′-GGGATCCGTAAGAAGAACAGCCTGGCCTTGTTCC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGACTGTGGCAGGGAAACCCTCTGCC-3′ to amplify the segment of pCMV5-hERα corresponding to amino acids 302–595 and the primers 5′-CGGGATCCGAGTGCGGGAGCTGCTGCTGG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTCACTGAGACTGTGGGTTCTG-3′ to amplify the portion of pCXN2-hERβ encoding amino acids 254–530. Each of the resulting fragments was subcloned into the pCR3.1 expression plasmid via the TA cloning kit and subsequently transferred to the pBind expression vector via a BamHI-XbaI restriction fragment for pBind-ERα EF and BamHI-NotI fragment for pBind-ERβ EF. The pCR3.1-FLAG-hERα construct was generated by PCR using a 5′-primer (5′-GATATTGCTAGCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGACCCTCCACACCAAAGCATCT-3′), which incorporated the FLAG epitope (underlined), and 5′-CGCCGCAGCCTCAGACCCGGGGCC-3′ to amplify the 5′-region of a hERα cDNA within pCR3.1-hERα, and the resulting PCR fragment was substituted back into the pCR3.1-hERα expression vector viaNheI and XmaI restriction sites. The pCR3.1-FLAG-hERβ expression vector was constructed as follows. First, the coding region for hERβ was removed from pCXN2-hERβ via a partial digest with EcoRI and transferred to pCR3.1, which yielded pCR3.1-hERβ. The 5′-primer (5′-CGTGACCGTGCTAGCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGATATAAAAAACTCACCATCTAGC-3′), which encompasses a coding sequence for the FLAG peptide (underlined), and 3′-primer (5′-CACAAGGCGGTACCCACATCTCTC-3′) were used to PCR amplify a portion of pCR3.1-hERβ corresponding to the 5′-end of the hERβ cDNA. The resulting PCR product was substituted into pCR3.1-hERβ via NheI and KpnI restriction sites. All of the expression vectors that were made using PCR amplification were sequenced to ensure that no errors occurred during their synthesis. The 17mer-E1b-CAT(ΔTRE) reporter plasmid was generated by an Eco0109-HindIII digest of the 17mer-E1b-CAT, which was religated after blunting the restriction ends. HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 24 h prior to transfections for transactivation assays, cells were plated in six-well culture dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in phenol red-free DMEM with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (sFBS). For transfections, medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and DNA was introduced into cells in the indicated amounts using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 5 h later, serum-free medium was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% sFBS. 12 h thereafter, cells were treated with the indicated amounts of various hormones. After 24 h of hormone treatment (12 h for inhibitor experiments), cells were harvested, and extracts were assayed for CAT activity, as described previously (45Smith C.L. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6120-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 46Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) using butyryl-coenzyme A (Amersham Biosciences) and [3H]chloramphenicol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The quantity of resulting radiolabeled product was determined by scintillation counting using biodegradable counting scintillant (Amersham Biosciences) and a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter, and then normalized to total cellular protein measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. Experiments were done in duplicate, and values represent the average ± S.E. of at least three individual experiments. To determine ER expression levels, cells were transfected as above and harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in a 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 0.4m NaCl, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium molybdate, and 20 mm NaF and incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysates were subsequently centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked using 1% nonfat dried milk in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, and sequentially incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, anti-mouse antibody. Blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline using a cell scraper and subsequently resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, Complete Mini-Tablet protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and incubated on ice for 5–15 min to lyse the cell membranes. The resulting lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at ∼ 1,400 × g to pellet the nuclei. Nuclei were washed in 2.5 ml of lysis buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 and repelleted as before. Thereafter, the nuclei were resuspended in a minimum volume of 250 mm Tris (pH 7.8) buffer containing 60 mm KCl and protease inhibitors and subjected to three cycles of rapid freeze/thaw. The nuclear lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 21,000 × g and 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the resulting supernatants were determined by Bradford assay. Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the region of the ERE-E1b-CAT plasmids containing the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) (5′-TGAAAACCTCTGACACATGCAGCTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGGTTTTCA-3′) or mTRE (5′-TGAAAACCTCGGACTCATGCAGCTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCTGCATGAGTCCGAGGTTTTCA-3′) were synthesized by Invitrogen and annealed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 50 mm NaCl to create double-stranded oligonucleotides. These DNA fragments were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed with a MicroSpin G25 column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The radiolabeled oligonucleotides were combined with nuclear extract in binding reaction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For oligonucleotide binding competition and antibody supershift experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides or antibody (anti-c-Jun (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)), respectively, were incubated with the nuclear extract for 30 min on ice before the addition of 32P-labeled probe. Free and complexed DNAs were resolved on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel. To avoid any possible influence of the loading dye on complex mobility, the gel-loading buffer containing 250 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol was added to the minus-extract control sample only. After electrophoresis at 350 V, the gel was transferred to 3MM Whatman paper, vacuum dried, and exposed to X-Omat film for autoradiography. For metabolic labeling studies, 2 × 106 HeLa cells were plated onto 150-mm Petri dishes, and 24 h thereafter they were transfected with pBind-ERα EF or pBind-ERβ EF using a nonrecombinant adenovirus DNA transfer procedure (47Allgood V.E. Zhang Y. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA (200 ng/plate) was mixed with polylysine-coupled adenovirus and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Before the addition of the adenovirus-plasmid particles to the cells, the medium was aspirated and replaced with DMEM. The adenovirus-plasmid particles were added to the cells at a 400:1 adenovirus:cell ratio. After incubation with the cells for 2 h at 37 °C, an equal volume of DMEM with 5% sFBS was added to each dish resulting in a final concentration of 2.5% sFBS. 24 h after transfection, the medium was aspirated from the dishes and replaced with phosphate-free DMEM, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with phosphate-free DMEM containing 1% dialyzed FBS before the addition of 0.14 mCi/ml [32P]H3PO4. After a 14–16-h incubation, the plates were incubated for 90 min with either 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle) or 10 μm forskolin + 100 μm IBMX. After treatments, cells were harvested and incubated with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture of 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, benzamidine HCl, chymostatin, and pepstatin), vortexed, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with 2 μg of antibody to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (sc-577; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the cell lysate supernatant for 2 h whi"

Lipid A of all Rhizobiaceae is acylated with a long fatty acid chain, 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid. Biosynthesis of this long acyl substitution requires a special acyl carrier protein, AcpXL, which serves as a donor of C28 (ω-1)-hydroxylated fatty acid for acylation of rhizobial lipid A (Brozek, K.A., Carlson, R.W., and Raetz, C. R. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 32126–32136). To determine the biological function of the C28 acylation of lipid A, we constructed an acpXL mutant of Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021. Gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis of the fatty acid composition showed that theacpXL mutation indeed blocked C28 acylation of lipid A. SDS-PAGE analysis of acpXL mutant LPS revealed only a fast migrating band, rough LPS, whereas the parental strain 1021 manifested both rough and smooth LPS. Regardless of this, the LPS of parental and mutant strains had a similar sugar composition and exposed the same antigenic epitopes, implying that different electrophoretic profiles might account for different aggregation properties of LPS molecules with and without a long acyl chain. The acpXL mutant of strain 1021 displayed sensitivity to deoxycholate, delayed nodulation of Medicago sativa, and a reduced competitive ability. However, nodules elicited by this mutant on roots of M. sativa and Medicago truncatula had a normal morphology and fixed nitrogen. Thus, the C28 fatty acid moiety of lipid A is not crucial, but it is beneficial for establishing an effective symbiosis with host plants. acpXL lies upstream from a cluster of five genes, including msbB (lpxXL), which might be also involved in biosynthesis and transfer of the C28 fatty acid to the lipid A precursor.

The rhizobia-legume symbiosis is a highly specific and complex developmental process in which both partners undergo differentiation in a concerted way. Bacteria induce the formation of nodules on roots of their host plants and colonize the root tissue as intracellular nitrogen-fixing bacteroids (1Brewin N.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 191-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Rhizobial cell surface polysaccharides play an important role during this process (2Niehaus K. Becker A. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 29: 73-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). LPS1 constitutes an integral part of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It is therefore intimately involved in the formation of the plant-bacterial interface during symbiosis (3Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. Spaink H. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.

Actually, these related bacterial species have identical lipid A core structures and different O antigens (5Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol.

Its chemical composition has been analyzed many times, but its structure is still unknown (9Zevenhuisen L.P.T.M. Scholten-Koerselman I. Posthumus M.A. Arch.

The LPS of S. meliloti strains 1021 and 102F51 reveals a high content of acidic sugars, namely galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, and Kdo (3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid) (11Russa R. Brunetau M. Shashkov A.S. Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Mayer H. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Campbell G.R.O. Reuhs B.L. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3938-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, the LPS of S. meliloti strain 102F51 contains DHA (3-deoxy-2-heptulosaric acid), considered a component of the O chain (11Russa R. Brunetau M. Shashkov A.S. Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Mayer H. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Campbell G.R.O. Reuhs B.L. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3938-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, DHA could be also a component of the outer core. The LPS of Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae is also known as endotoxin because of its diverse pathophysiological effects displayed during the infection of animal hosts, such as cytokine production, inflammation, and shock (14Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 15Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5745-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Lipid A is primarily responsible for the endotoxic activity of LPS. Modifications of lipid A may significantly change its toxicity. The lipid A ofE. coli and related Enterobacteriaceae is composed of a backbone of two glucosamines replaced by two phosphate groups at positions 1 and 4′, and four residues of R-3-hydroxymyristic acid (C14) in ester and amide linkage at positions 2, 2′, 3, and 3′ (Fig. 1). The hydroxymyristic residues at positions 2′ and 3′ are further replaced by laurate (C12) and myristate (C14) forming acyloxyacyl moieties (14Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

Regardless of significant variations of lipid A structures within the family of Rhizobiaceae there is one common feature that distinguishes their lipid A from that of Enterobacteriaceae: the presence of a long fatty acid chain, 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid (27-OH-C28:O) (4Bhat U.R. Mayer H. Yokota A. Hollingsworth R.I. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was detected in various members of this family, including species ofRhizobium, Sinorhizobium,Mesorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Agrobacterium (4Bhat U.R. Mayer H. Yokota A. Hollingsworth R.I.

All six components share the following structural features: the absence of phosphate groups and the presence of a galacturonic residue at the 4′ position and of a long acyloxyacyl moiety as a secondary acyl substitution of the N-linked hydroxyacyl chain (7Que N.L.

Variation of R. etli lipid A species concerns mainly the proximal glucosamine residue and its acyl substitutions (7Que N.L. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

Forsberg L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3957-3968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It appeared to be a remarkable “hybrid” sharing features with enteric lipid A and lipid A of R. etli. A similarity to enteric lipid A consisted in the presence of two phosphate substitutions of glucosamine disaccharide. A similarity to lipid A of R. etli was observed in the type and location of an acyloxyacyl residue and in the heterogeneity of lipid A species concerning the presence or absence of an acyl substitution at position 3 (56Gudlavalleti S.K. Forsberg L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3957-3968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structure of S. meliloti lipid was characterized 14 years ago and probably needs confirmation with modern methods of analysis. Similar to the lipid A of enteric bacteria, lipid A ofS. meliloti had a glucosamine backbone with two phosphate substitutions (10Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Seydel U. Greck M. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 527-532Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). No secondary acyl substitutions were found, and a C28 hydroxylated fatty acid chain was identified as a primary ester-linked substitution of glucosamine (10Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Seydel U. Greck M. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 527-532Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S. meliloti and R. leguminosarumlipid A were reported to have the same endotoxic activity on animal hosts as lipid A of enteric bacteria (10Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Seydel U. Greck M. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 527-532Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Urbanik-Sypniewska T. Choma A. Kutkowska J. Kaminska T. Kandefer-Szerszen M. Russa R. Dolecka J. Immunobiology. 2000; 202: 408-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The role of bacterial LPS in symbiotic interactions with plants seems to be profoundly different from its role in pathogenic interactions with animals. There are several lines of evidence that LPS of rhizobia may suppress host defense responses in plant cells and promote symbiotic interaction (2Niehaus K. Becker A. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 29: 73-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,17Dazzo F.B. Truchet G.L. Holligsworth L.I. Hrabak E.M. Pankratz H.S. Philip-Holligswirth S. Salzwedel J.L. Chapman K.

Plant Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 99-112Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Studies with rhizobial mutants producing modified lipid A may shed more light on mechanisms of LPS interaction with plant cells. To our knowledge, all LPS mutants of rhizobia studied so far contained modifications either in the core or in the O antigen, and rhizobial mutants affected in lipid A expression have not been analyzed yet. Recently, the complete genome sequence of S. meliloti 1021 was determined (19Galibert F. Finan T.M. Long S.R. Pühler A. Abola P. Ampe F. Barloy-Hubler F. Barnett M.J. Becker A. Boistard P. Bothe G.

Sequence annotation of the S. melilotichromosome revealed a number of genes whose products are conserved among Gram-negative bacteria and control early steps in lipid A biosynthesis, namely lpxABCDK, fabZ, and kdtA (3Kannenberg E.L.

Sc. i U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9877-9882Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition to the conserved lipid A biosynthesis genes, a gene cluster containing the acpXL gene was found. This cluster may be responsible for the formation of the C28 acyl substitution of lipid A. The acpXL gene was first identified because of the partial sequencing of a protein purified fromR. leguminosarum. This protein mediated the incorporation of a C28 fatty acid chain into a lipid A precursorin vitro (21Brozek K.A. Carlson R.W. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32126-32136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Up to now, the role of the acpXLgene in vivo was not investigated. To provide experimental evidence for the predicted function of the acpXL gene ofS. meliloti, we constructed an acpXL mutant in strain 1021. We demonstrate here that the acpXL mutation results in a structural modification of LPS and affects the properties of free living and endosymbiotic bacteria. Based on the results of LPS composition analysis as well as results of electrophoretic and immunological comparisons of mutant and wild type LPS, we reconsider here the structure of S. meliloti LPS. Strains and plasmids used in this work are described in TableI. S. meliloti strains were incubated at 30 °C either on LB or TY or mannitol-glutamate-salts medium (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

E. coli strains were incubated at 37 °C on LB medium. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations (μg·ml−1): streptomycin (Sm) 600, neomycin (Nm) 120, tetracycline (Tc) 8 for S. meliloti; ampicillin (Ap) 100, kanamycin (Km) 50, tetracycline 5 for E. coli. The deoxycholate (DOC) sensitivity of S. meliloti strains was tested on LB plates containing 0.1% sodium deoxycholate.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this workStrain/PlasmidRelevant characteristicsSource or referenceS. meliloti 1021SmRderivative of wild type strain SU4722Meade H.M.

The PCR product was first inserted into vector pGEM-T-Easy, then recovered using the endonucleasesSphI and SalI and ligated into the mobilizable vector pK18mob2. The resulting plasmid pLSacpXL was transferred toS. meliloti recipient strains by S17-1-mediated conjugation. Transconjugants were selected on LB plates containing neomycin and streptomycin. To verify that the genomic acpXL sequence was disrupted by the plasmid, the transconjugants were analyzed by PCR using the primer pair acpXLupK (5′-GCGTGACAGCTACATTCGAC) and acpXLdnK (5′-CGATCTTGGCACAAAGGTTC). This resulted in amplification of a DNA fragment including the duplicated target DNA and the integrated vector. To clone theacpXL gene, a 448-bp genomic fragment including the entire open reading frame and the flanking sequences, 144 bp upstream from the start codon and 5 bp downstream from the stop codon, were amplified by PCR using primers acp11Xup (5′-AATCTAGATCACGAAGTAACCCCGCT) and acp11Kdn (5′-AA′GGTACCGCTTCAGGCTTTCCTCAA). The underlined nucleotides represent XbaI and KpnI restriction sites, respectively, added for convenience of cloning. The amplified DNA product was cloned into the broad host range vector pPHU231 (27Reyes F. Roldan M.P. Klipp W. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivian C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in the orientation opposite to the lacZ promoter, to allow expression of acpXL from its own promoter presumably located in the 5′-upstream DNA sequence. The resulting plasmid, designated pXK11a, was used for complementation. Conjugational transfer of pXK11a into S. meliloti acpXL mutant L994 was accomplished as described above. Transconjugants were selected on LB plates containing tetracycline and streptomycin. Preparative purification of LPS was performed from S. meliloti strains 1021 and L994. S. meliloti strains were grown on TY plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Bacterial cells were harvested from plates and washed twice with 0.9% NaCl. The cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of distilled water, and LPS was extracted after a hot phenol-water extraction procedure (31Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). The material from the water phase was treated with DNase, RNase, and proteinase K, dialyzed against water for 2 days, and freeze dried. Then LPS was dissolved in water to a final concentration of about 40 mg/ml and centrifuged for 20 h at 100,000 ×g. The pellet consisting of LPS micelles was dissolved in water and freeze dried. The determination of fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acids was done by gas-liquid chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) as described (32Wollenweber H.W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 200 μg of purified LPS was supplemented with 10 μg of 17:0-Me as internal standard. The samples were dissolved in 1 ml of 4m HCl and heated for 4 h at 100 °C in a tightly closed Reacti-Vial (Pierce). 1 ml of 5 m NaOH was added, and the mixture was incubated at 100 °C for a further 30 min. After the addition of 3 ml of water, the pH was adjusted to 3 using ∼300 μl of HCl. The fatty acids were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform. The extraction was repeated three times, and the extracts were pooled and dried in a steam of nitrogen. Methylation of the carboxyl groups was carried out using diazomethane in ether (0.1 ml), freshly prepared using 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitroguanidin (Aldrich), and the MNNG diazomethane generator (Aldrich). The ether was evaporated by a steam of nitrogen, and fatty acid methyl esters carrying free hydroxy groups were replaced by 40 μl of BSTFA (Pierce) in 4 h at 65 °C to produce the particular methyltrimethylsilyl esters. As a further reference for GC-MS, octacosanoic acid (Sigma, O 4004) was subjected to the same derivatization procedure. GC-MS was carried out on a Thermo Trace gas chromatographer equipped with a 30-m SPB-50 (Supelco) and a Polaris electron impact ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo). The following temperature program was used: 80 °C for 3 min, then 5 °C/min up to 300 °C and holding for 10 min. MS spectra were compared with reference substances and the NIST data base. Analysis of neutral sugars and uronic acids was performed as described previously (33Plötz B.M. Lindner B. Stetter K.O. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11222-11228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). LPS from S. meliloti strains was extracted using triethylamine/EDTA or SDS/proteinase K methods (34Valverde C. Hozbor D.F. Lagares A. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis in 16.5% acrylamide gels, LPS was visualized by the silver staining method of Tsai and Frash (36Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). LPS was electroblotted from SDS-PAGE to an Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore), pore size 0.45 μm, and detected using polyclonal antiserum as described (37Petrovics G. Putnoky P. Reuhs B. Kim J. Thorp T.A. Noel K.D. Carlson R.W. Kondorosi A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). S. melilotistrain 2011 (23Casse F. Boucher C. Julliot J.S. Michel M. Denarie J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 113: 229-242Google Scholar) was grown in mannitol-glutamate-salts medium overnight, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and incubated for 5 min at 65 °C. A final titer of 1010cells was used for immunization of rabbits. The antiserum was produced following the 2-month standard immunization protocol (www.seqlab.de/customer_services.html) by SEQLAB, Sequence Laboratories Göttingen GmbH (Germany). The resulting antiserum 2605 showed high reactivity to surface antigens of numerous S. melilotistrains, including 1021. Coincubation of the antiserum with whole cells of a specific strain results in binding of antibodies to epitopes of cell surface polysaccharides. If the antiserum is incubated with mutant cells lacking a particular epitope, antibodies recognizing this epitope will remain unbound and may be detected by an immunoblot with material of a wild type strain. Preadsorption of the antiserum was performed basically as described previously (37Petrovics G. Putnoky P. Reuhs B. Kim J. Thorp T.A. Noel K.D. Carlson R.W. Kondorosi A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with modifications. Because adsorption of antibodies after incubation with strains 2011 and 1021 was incomplete, bacterial cells were boiled for 3 min in phosphate-buffered saline, cooled down, and mixed with the antiserum. Adsorption was performed for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. This resulted in a complete and specific adsorption of antibodies. Medicago sativa cv. Europe and Medicago truncatula genotype Jemalong seeds were surface sterilized by concentrated sulfuric acid for 10 min and washed several times with large volumes of sterile water. Seeds were germinated on 0.7% water agar plates at room temperature, in the dark. Seedlings were grown on nitrogen-free medium (38Rolfe B.G. Gresshoff P.M. Shine J. Plant Sci. Lett. 1980; 19: 277-284Crossref Google Scholar). One day after planting, the seedlings were inoculated with overnight cultures of S. meliloti strains that were washed in distilled water. Each plate containing three M. sativa or two M. truncatula seedling was inoculated with 200 μl of cell suspension (108–109 cells). Plants were grown at 20 °C under a 16-h light:8-h dark cycle for 30–40 days. To confirm that mutant L994 did not revert during the passage through root nodules, we isolated bacteria from nodules and tested them for the expression of the neomycin antibiotic resistance marker of the integrated plasmid pLSacpXL. Nodules elicited by mutant L994 were harvested from roots of both host plants, at least three nodules from each variant of inoculation. Detached nodules were surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, washed with sterile water, and crushed in 0.85% saline buffer. Bacterial suspensions, recovered from nodules, were diluted and streaked on LB plates containing neomycin and streptomycin or only streptomycin. To distinguish between nodules occupied by the competitor strain L753, carrying β-glucuronidase gene (GUS+), and the tester GUS– strains, roots of alfalfa were washed with phosphate buffer and incubated in the dark for 3–4 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide and 1% SDS. Nodules occupied by a GUS+ strain stained blue; nodules occupied by a GUS– strain remained white or pink. All genes of the acpXL-msbB cluster are oriented in the same direction and probably comprise three transcriptional units: (i) acpXL; (ii) SMc04277,SMc04275, and SMc04270; and (iii)SMc04270 and msbB (Fig.2). A similar gene cluster was recently identified in R. leguminosarum (39Basu S.S. Karbarz M.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

In our previous study, we showed that LIGHT is able to induce cell death via the non-death domain containing receptor LTβR to activate both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathway. In this study, a LIGHT mutein, LIGHT-R228E, was shown to exhibit similar binding specificity as wild type LIGHT to LTβR, but lose the ability to interact with herpes virus entry mediator.

Cross-linking of LTβR is able to recruit TRAF3 and TRAF5 to activate ASK1, whereas its activity is inhibited by free radical scavenger carboxyfullerenes. The activation of ASK1 is independent of caspase-3 activation, and kinase-inactive ASK1-KE mutant can inhibit LTβR-mediated cell death.

Lymphoid nodes are deficient in LTα gene-deleted (LTα−/−) mice (7De Togni P. Goellner J. Ruddle N.H. Streeter P.R. Fick A. Mariathasan S. Smith S.C. Carlson R. Shornick L.P. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Science. 1994; 264: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), and the impairment of lymph node development as well as the loss of splenic architecture was also observed in LTβ knockout mice (8Koni P.A. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1977-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LTβR-deficient mice are shown to lack Peyer's patches, colon-associated lymphoid tissues, and all lymph nodes (9Futterer A. Mink K. Luz A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Pfeffer K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the administration of agonistic antibody to LTβR can induce lymph node development in LTα−/−mice (10Rennert P.D. Browning J.L. Hochman P.S. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1627-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in lymphoid organ formation, LTβR is also involved in host immune responses to foreign antigens. Blockade of LTβR with LTβR-Fc not only prevents germinal center formation in spleen but also results in impaired IgG antibody responses to sheep red blood cells (11Mackay F. Majeau G.R. Lawton P. Hochman P.S. Browning J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Moreover, administration of LTβR-Fc is shown to enhance host survival after virus challenge (12Puglielli M.T. Browning J.L. Brewer A.W. Schreiber R.D. Shieh W.J. Altman J.D. Oldstone M.B. Zaki S.R. Ahmed R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1370-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and is effective in preventing the onset of Th2 cell-mediated colitis (13Dohi T. Rennert P.D. Fujihashi K. Kiyono H. Shirai Y. Kawamura Y.I. Browning J.L. McGhee J.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of TNFR families function as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Signaling occurs mostly through two classes of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins: death domain-containing molecules and TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs). The death domain-containing molecules or TRAFs are recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of members of TNFR after engagement with ligands. The cytoplasmic domain of LTβR does not contain consensus sequences characteristic of death domain; thus, LTβR-transduced signaling is mainly mediated by TRAFs. TRAF molecules consist of amino-terminal RING finger domain, central zinc finger loop, and carboxyl-terminal TRAF domain. The TRAF domain mediates interactions between TRAF proteins and both their upstream and downstream effectors, whereas the RING finger domain is reported to be necessary for TRAF effector activation (14Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Among the six TRAF proteins, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 are found to associate with LTβR (15Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Force W.R. Glass A.A. Benedict C.A. Cheung T.C. Lama J. Ware C.F. J. Biol.

Further study has indicated that TRAF3 plays an important role in mediating LTβR-induced cell death (15Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol.

Moreover, two serine/threonine protein kinases (p50 and p80) are reported to be associated with cytoplasmic region of LTβR (20Wu M.Y. Hsu T.L. Lin W.W. Campbell R.D. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but their roles in LTβR-mediated signaling have not been elucidated yet. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), also called mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 5 (MEKK5), can be activated in response to various stress signals, including genotoxic stress (21Chen Z. Seimiya H. Naito M. Mashima T. Kizaki A. Dan S. Imaizumi M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) (22Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

Invest. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1 inhibits cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor, Fas ligation, anti-cancer drugs, or withdrawal of neurotrophic factors (21Chen Z. Seimiya H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ASK1 functions as an upstream component of the kinase cascades and interacts with a variety of molecules involved in stress-induced signaling pathways (21Chen Z. Seimiya H. Naito M. Mashima T.

ASK1 phosphorylates and activates MKK4/7, which then activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNKs), also known as the stress-activated protein kinases. JNK activation requires phosphorylation at a specific motif (TPY). Moreover, ASK1 phosphorylates and activates MKK3 and MKK6, leading to activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (24Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T.

It has been reported that JNK and p38 activations are abolished inASK1 −/− embryonic fibroblasts (28Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Signaling mediated by death domain-containing receptors, such as TNFRI and Fas, could be inhibited efficiently by caspase inhibitors. However, caspase inhibitor has only a partial effect to prevent LIGHT/IFN-γ-induced cell death (30Chen M.C. Hsu T.L. Luh T.Y. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38794-38801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, free radical scavenger carboxyfullerenes (C60) can completely inhibit LIGHT/IFN-γ-induced cell death (30Chen M.C. Hsu T.L. Luh T.Y. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38794-38801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), indicating the important roles of ROS in LIGHT/IFN-γ-induced cell death (30Chen M.C. Hsu T.L. Luh T.Y. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38794-38801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since ROS are key mediators to activate ASK1, which contributes to progression of cell death (22Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of ASK1 in LIGHT-LTβR-induced cell death. Here we report that activation of LTβR alone, without the necessity to trigger HVEM activation, by either agonistic anti-LTβR mAb or a LIGHT mutein (LIGHT-R228E) incapable of HEVM binding, could induce the production of free radicals and the activation of ASK1. Blockade of ASK1 activation by free radical scavenger C60 could inhibit LTβR-mediated cell death. Thus, in addition to caspase activation, the activation of ASK1 also contributes to LTβR-mediated apoptotic pathways. The human hepatoma cells (Hep3BT2), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, and traf knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2. Plasmids containing the hLTβR and hLTβR-CD proteins have been described (19Wu M.Y. Wang P.Y. Han S.H. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged expression constructs of ASK1, catalytically inactive ASK1-KE-HA, were kindly provided by Dr. Wen-Chen Yeh (32Hoeflich K.P. Yeh W.C. Yao Z. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5814-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The dominant negative TRAF mutants were provided by Dr. Wen-Chen Yeh (TRAF2 mutant) and Dr. Bharat B. Aggarwal (TRAF3, -5, and -6 mutants) vector. All of the TRAF mutants contained the c-Myc tag except TRAF6 mutant. For DNA transfection, cells were plated and grown for 16 h and transfected with expression vectors by the calcium phosphate method or by using LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen). Monoclonal antibodies were prepared by immunizing Balb/c mice with recombinant human lymphotoxin β receptor-Fc (hLTβR-Fc) protein (6Zhai Y. Guo R. Hsu T.L. Yu G.L. Ni J. Kwon B.S. Jiang G.W. Lu J. Tan J. Ugustus M. Carter K. Rojas L. Zhu F. Lincoln C. Endress G. Xing L. Wang S. Oh K.O. Gentz R. Ruben S. Lippman M.E. Hsieh S.L. Yang D. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Spleen cells were fused with NS-1 cells, and hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-hLTβR monoclonal antibodies were selected by their specific binding to hLTβR but not to the Fc portion of human IgG1. The cDNA of extracellular region of LIGHT was cloned into pIZ/V5-His-FLAG (Invitrogen). Substitution of Arg228 by glutamic acid was performed by overlap extension using polymerase chain reaction (33Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6659) Google Scholar). The primers used for polymerase chain reaction were designed to introduce anXhoI site as described in the followings: 5′-GAGGATGGTACCCGGTCTTACTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGTCGAACCAGGCGTTCATC-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were ligated at the XhoI site of pIZ/V5-His-FLAG-LIGHT to create pIZ/V5-His-FLAG-LIGHT(R228E). The construct was autosequenced (MB Mission Biotech) for verification of the mutation. The pIZ/V5-His-FLAG-LIGHT(R228E) construct was transfected into Sf21 cells by LipofectinTM(Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected with 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Protein was purified by agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2) and followed by dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline as described (30Chen M.C. Hsu T.L. Luh T.Y. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38794-38801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ASK1-KE DNA construct (a gift from Dr. Wen-Chen Yeh) was transfected into Hep3BT2 using LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen) as suggested by the vendor. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 (800 μg/ml Geneticin; Sigma), followed by immunoblot analysis to confirm the expression of ASK1-KE. The expression of ASK1-HA and TAK1-HA was detected by using anti-HA mAb (clone 3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-human ASK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The expression of c-Myc-tagged TRAF2-DN, TRAF3-DN, and TRAF5-DN was detected by using anti-c-Myc tag polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against TRAF6 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant human IFN-γ was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cell lysates were prepared by the addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotonin). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Biosciences), and reacted with appropriate antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.02% Tween 20. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and reacted with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents subsequently (Amersham Biosciences). Association and dissociation rates of the interaction of LIGHT or LIGHT-R228E with human LTβR-Fc or HVEM-Fc were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore® 2000 biomolecular interaction analysis system (BIA-core Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The Fc fusion proteins (50 μg/ml) were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling at pH 7.0. The sensor surface was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, and sensorgrams were collected at 25 °C and a flow rate at 30 μl/min. A 120-μl injection of LIGHT or LIGHT-R228E was passed over the sensor surface. After the association phase, 600 s of dissociation data were collected. The sensor surface was regenerated after each cycle with a 15-μl pulse of 10 mm glycine (pH 2.0) twice with a 30-s interval. Sets of eight analyte concentrations, 100–800 nm, were collected and analyzed. To measure the activity of ASK1 in cell extracts, the immune complex was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 2 μg of substrates (such as myelin basic protein (MBP)) in 30 μl of solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/10 mm MgCl2/0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphorylated proteins were identified by autoradiography and quantified by a densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Cell death induced by overexpression of LTβR was determined by β-galactosidase-based cell morphology assay, and the killing effect of LIGHT/IFN-γ treatment was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. For the β-galactosidase-based cell morphology assay, HeLa cells were co-transfected with lacZexpression vector, pBKCMV-lacZ. After 24 h of transfection, cells were fixed and then were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galatopyranoside (X-gal) to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells as described previously (19Wu M.Y. Wang P.Y. Han S.H. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The survival rate of Hep3BT2 cells was determined by MTT assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well. After treatment, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT per well was added and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were then lysed by the addition of 50 μl of 10% SDS in 0.4n HCl per well and incubated at 37 °C for another 16 h. The optical density of each sample was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 versus 650 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (TECAN; RainBow) (30Chen M.C. Hsu T.L. Luh T.Y. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38794-38801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts were prepared by freezing and thawing of cells in extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) as described (34Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (50 μg) were diluted with 500 μl of ICE standard buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin) and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with 20 μm fluorescent substrates. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4500) at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm and emission wavelength of 392 nm. Cross-linking of cell surface receptor by ligand or by agonistic antibodies can trigger signal transduction, and members of the TNFR superfamily are reported to be activated by agonistic antibodies, such as anti-human Fas antibody (CH11) and anti-mouse Fas antibody (Jo2). To study the signaling transduced by LTβR, monoclonal antibodies against human LTβR were raised. One of the selected clones, 31G4D8, is found to bind to LTβR specifically. Anti-LTβR mAb 31G4D8 does not have any cytotoxic effect to Hep3BT2 or HT29, which are sensitive to LIGHT/IFN-γ-mediated cell death. However, in conjunction with IFN-γ, 31G4D8 mAb is able to induce cell death with similar extent as that induced by wild type LIGHT (Fig. 1). This observation is in agreement with the previous observation that overexpression of LTβR is able to induce cell death (19Wu M.Y. Wang P.Y. Han S.H. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and LIGHT mutein incapable of binding to LTβR loses its ability to induce cell death (35Rooney I.A. Butrovich K.D. Glass A.A. Borboroglu S. Benedict C.A. Whitbeck J.C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14307-14315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To further confirm this argument, we designed a recombinant LIGHT mutein to bind LTβR but not HVEM, using a strategy of molecular modeling. A three-dimensional model for the interaction of LIGHT and its receptors (LTβR, HVEM, and DcR3) was generated by homology modeling (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA) based on the crystallographic complex structure of LTα and TNFRI (Protein Data Bank code 1TNR) (36Banner D.W.

Residues of the receptor-binding sites of this system, conventionally denoted as the A-R interaction domain and the A-S interaction domain, were identified. A few charge or polar residues were chosen for site-specific mutagenesis with the prediction that their mutations would, depending on the type of receptor, either enhance or interrupt receptor binding through altered electrostatic interactions. One of the LIGHT muteins that we have substantially characterized, the mutation at amino acid 228 from arginine to glutamic acid (LIGHT-R228E) at the A-R interaction domain (see the model in Table I), met the modeling objective of the present study.Table IKinetics of ligand binding to receptors determined by surface plasmon resonanceValues are the means of at least five measurements over a ligand concentration range of 100–800 nm.

The association and dissociation rates of wild type LIGHT and LIGHT-R228E to LTβR and HVEM were determined by surface plasmon resonance. As shown in Fig. 2 and TableI, the binding affinity of wild type LIGHT to both HVEM (K D = 8.81 ± 3.2 nm) and LTβR (K D = 8.72 ± 3.21 nm) is similar, whereas the binding affinity of LIGHT-R228E to HVEM is almost undetectable, and its binding affinity to LTβR (K D = 77.8 ± 41 nm) is reduced from that of the wild type but is clearly evident (Fig. 2 B). The reduction in affinity of R228E for LTβR-Fc was due to a decrease in association rate and an increase in dissociation rate (Table I). The binding of LIGHT-R228E to LTβR and the lack of it to HVEM were further confirmed by a competition analysis using LTβR-Fc or HVEM-Fc to inhibit wild type LIGHT and LIGHT-R228E-mediated cell death (Fig.2 C). Namely, wild type LIGHT/IFN-γ-induced cell death could be blocked by either LTβR-Fc or HVEM-Fc in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C, upper panel), whereas LIGHT-R228E/IFN-γ-induced cell death was only blocked by LTβR-Fc and not by HVEM-Fc (Fig. 2C, lower panel). These observations provided direct evidence that the amino acid arginine 228 is essential for the interaction between LIGHT and HVEM, and LTβR alone is sufficient for LIGHT-mediated cell death. Oxidative stress was reported to disrupt the ASK1-thioredoxin complex and thereby to activate ASK1 (39Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ROS play essential roles in LIGHT/IFN-γ-induced cell death (30Chen M.C. Hsu T.L. Luh T.Y. Hsieh S.L.

To address this question, HeLa cells were transfected with HA-tagged ASK1, followed by incubation with agonistic 31G4D8 mAb (Fig. 3 A) or LIGHT-R228E (Fig. 3 B) to test their ability to activate HA-tagged ASK1 by in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig.3 A, a rapid increase of ASK1 activity was observed at 5 min after 31G4D8 treatment and observed to last for at least 60 min (Fig.3 A). LIGHT-R228E had a similar"

To test the role of Wnt signaling in neuronal differentiation, embryonal carcinoma P19 cells (P19 EC), which can be stimulated to differentiate into a neuron-like phenotype in response to retinoic acid (RA), were used. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that Axin is expressed in undifferentiated cells, whereas the level is clearly reduced during RA-induced neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, Axin levels were not reduced during endodermal differentiation of P19 EC cells and F9 EC cells by RA, suggesting that the reduction of the Axin level is a specific property of neuronal differentiation. Western analysis showed that the cytoplasmic level of β-catenin increased during neuronal differentiation of P19 EC cells. Indirect immunofluorescence with β-catenin antibody showed that the localization of β-catenin was changed from membrane in undifferentiated cells to nuclei in neuronal P19 EC cells. Induced expression of Axin during endodermal and early neuronal differentiation, using the Tet-On system, did not block normal differentiation. However, maintenance of the Axin level blocked neuronal differentiation and inhibited expression of a neuron-specific marker protein, βIII-tubulin. Also, ectopic induction of a β-catenin signaling inhibitor, ICAT, inhibited expression of βIII-tubulin. In contrast, addition of Wnt-3A-conditioned medium during the neuronal differentiation period enhanced the expression of βIII-tubulin. Overall, our data show that Wnt-3a/canonical β-catenin signaling through the down-regulation of Axin may play an important role in neuronal differentiation.

The accumulating data have shown that Axin acts as a scaffolding protein, containing several domains that interact with adenomatous polyposis coli, GSK-3β, CKI, β-catenin, and other proteins (13–25). In the absence of a Wnt signal, Axin itself is phosphorylated and enhances phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β by bringing those proteins together, and the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated pathway leads phosphorylated β-catenin to degradation (26Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr.

Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). However, antagonizing GSK-3β activity upon binding of Wnts to Frizzled leads to an increase in hypophosphorylated Axin, which has lower affinity to interact with β-catenin. This results in the release of hypophosphorylated β-catenin from the degradation complex (40Jho E. Lomvardas S. Costantini F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 41Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The released hypophosphorylated β-catenin is accumulated in the cytoplasm, translocated into nuclei, and then interacts with Tcf/LEF factors to regulate downstream target gene expression. Currently, about 50 target genes have been identified. The known function of several identified target genes explains some of the phenotypes that are caused by abnormal Wnt signaling. For example, induction of c-myc or cyclin D1 expression by Wnt signaling causes abnormal cell proliferation and results in tumors, whereas ectopic Xenopus axis induction by the injection of Wnts is due to enhanced expression of the dorsalizing homeobox genesiamois, brachyury gene, and others (42He T.C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3185-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Among the diverse biological roles of Wnts, their involvement in neural differentiation has been studied due to prominent expression of several Wnts in the developing central nervous system (6Parr B.A. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Development. 1993; 119: 247-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7Parr B.A. McMahon A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Indeed, absence of Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a leads to abnormal populations of dorsal interneurons, implying that Wnt signaling has a role in the determination of neuronal cell fate (46Muroyama Y. Fujihara M. Ikeya M. Kondoh H. Takada S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). An elegant finding by Hallet al. (10Hall A.C. Lucas F.R. Salinas P.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), that secretion of Wnt-7a from postsynaptic granule cell neurons remodels the axons and growth cones of developing mossy fibers, is another good example for involvement of Wnt signaling in neuronal differentiation. However, it has not been shown that Wnt signaling plays any autocrine role in neurite extension. The pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line has been used as a model system to study neuronal differentiation, because these cells can be easily differentiated into neuronal cells that form neurite-like structures upon simple retinoic acid treatment (47McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 48McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the expression of diverse Wnts are regulated during neuronal differentiation, and it has therefore been suggested that different Wnts may have roles in this process (49Smolich B.D. Papkoff J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, although many Wnts display a dynamic expression pattern during the neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, so far only Wnt1 has been tested for a potential role in this process, and it remains unknown whether endogenous canonical β-catenin signaling is involved in the neuronal differentiation of P19 cells (49Smolich B.D. Papkoff J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 50Tang K. Yang J. Gao X. Wang C. Liu L. Kitani H. Atsumi T. Jing N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We show here that Axin is down-regulated and that β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, during the neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. These data imply that canonical β-catenin signaling is involved in the neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. To test the significance of canonical β-catenin signaling for this process, the expression of Axin was induced during RA-induced neuronal differentiation, using the Tet-On-inducible system (51Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2025) Google Scholar, 52Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). This treatment blocked the formation of neurite-like structures. In contrast, neuronal differentiation of P19 cell was enhanced in the presence of Wnt-3a-conditioned media. Overall, our data lead us to conclude that Wnt-3a/canonical β-catenin signaling through the down-regulation of Axin may play an important role in neural differentiation. P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), in humidified 5% CO2. To induce neuronal differentiation by P19 EC cells, they were aggregated in bacterial-grade Petri dishes with 1 μmall-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) at a density of 1 × 105/ml. After 4 days, aggregates were dissociated by 0.25% trypsin-0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), and re-plated in poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture dishes and then allowed to differentiate 6 more days. For endodermal differentiation, P19 and F9 cells were cultured with 10 and 100 nm RA, respectively, for 4 days. Wnt-3a-expressing L cells (kindly provided by Dr. Roel Nusse, Stanford University) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). For preparation of Wnt-3a-conditioned medium (CM), the Wnt-3a-expressing L cells were grown in serum-free DMEM in humidified 5% CO2, and Wnt-3a CM was harvested after 24 h. Wnt-3a CM was concentrated to 30 times by using Centricon (Millipore). P19 cells were incubated with 10× Wnt-3a CM supplemented with 10% FBS. For immunofluorescent labeling, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. The fixed cells were incubated with blocking solution (1% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-SSEA-1 (Development Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-βIII-tubulin (BAbCO), anti-MAP2 (Sigma), anti-β-catenin, or anti-E-cadherin antibodies (Transduction laboratories). After a rinse with PBS, the cells were incubated with rhodamine, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, mounted, and examined using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) from undifferentiated or differentiated P19 cells at different time periods. For Northern blot analysis, ∼20 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to NC membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by using a TurboBlotter kit (Schleicher & Schuell). The inserts for the preparation of probes for mouse Wnt-1, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a were generated by PCR, using the pLNCX/Wnt-1, pLNCX/Wnt-3a, and pLNCX/Wnt-5a plasmid DNA (kind gift from Dr. Jan Kitajewski, Columbia University) as templates with primers derived from sequences in GenBankTM. The insert for the mouse β-actin was obtained by RT-PCR with total RNA of P19 EC cells. The sequences of all PCR products were confirmed by automated sequencing. All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Random Primed DNA Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hybridized to the membrane with ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All Northern blots were stripped and hybridized to β-actin cDNA probe for even RNA loading control. The following primers were used for PCR: for Wnt-1, 5′-CAGTAGTGGCCGATGGTG-3′ and 5′-ATCGATGTTGTCACTGC-3′; forWnt-3a, 5′-TAGTGCTCTGCAGCCTGAA-3′ and 5′-CCACAGATAGCAGCTGAT-3′; for Wnt-5a, 5′-ATTGGAATATTAAGCCCG-3′ and 5′-GTGACCATAGTCGATGTT-3′; for β-actin, 5′-AGGCCAACCGCGAAGATGACC-3′ and 5′-GAAGTCCAGGGCGACGTAGCAC-3′; for Axin, 5′-CAGGGTTTCCCCTTGGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCAAACATGGCAGGATC-3′; and forICAT, 5′-GAATTCGATGAACCGCGAGGGAGCAC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGCTACTGCCTCCGGTCTTCCGT-3′. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Brains of 13.5 dpc Balb/c mouse embryos and 1-month-old postnatal mice were dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and total extracts were obtained in the supernatant. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). About 20 μg of lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot using following antibodies. Mouse monoclonal antibodies for c-myc (for the detection of myc-tagged Axin, Oncogene), βIII-tubulin (BAbCO), MAP2, actin, α-tubulin (Sigma), GFP (Clontech), GSK-3β, β-catenin antibodies (Transduction Laboratories), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody for Axin (kind gift from Dr. Paul Polakis, Genentech Inc.) were used to detect the corresponding proteins. Peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used, and then the proteins were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were washed twice in PBS and scraped in physiological buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were lysed by 30 strokes in a chilled Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (Wheaton) at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The cleared lysates were subject to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. Protein concentration of the cytoplasmic fraction was measured by using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). To construct pBI-EGFP-Axin, pCS2-MT-mAxin (125–956) was digested with ClaI and NotI, and both ends were filled-in with Klenow fragment (Invitrogen). The 3-kb fragment was inserted into pBI-EGFP (Clontech), which was digested with NheI and blunted with Klenow fragment. The SpeI and HindIII digested fragment of the pTet-On (Clontech) was replaced withSpeI/HindIII fragment of the pUHDrtTA2S-M2 (kind gift from Dr. Wolfgang Hillen, Erlangen University (52Urlinger S.

Mouse ICAT cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using total mouse RNA as template from a published sequence (53Tago K. Nakamura T. Nishita M. Hyodo J. Nagai S. Murata Y. Adachi S. Ohwada S. Morishita Y. Shibuya H. Akiyama T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1741-1749PubMed Google Scholar). Cloned ICAT cDNA was inserted into the pCS2-MT vector (13Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) for myc tagging on the amino terminus (pCS2-MT-ICAT). pBI-EGFP-ICAT was constructed from pCS2-MT-ICAT with the same methods that were described for the generation of pBI-EGFP- Axin. P19 cells were cotransfected with the CMV-rtTA2S-M2 and pBI-EGFP-Axin, or pBI-EGFP using the Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's protocol. Two days after transfection, transfectants were subcultured and selected in culture media supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. Each selected clone was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. To induce expression of Axin or green fluorescent protein (GFP), P19 cells were treated with 500 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma). To measure the inhibitory effect of an ICAT-expressing construct on β-catenin/Tcf signaling, we performed luciferase assays as described previously (40Jho E. Lomvardas S. Costantini F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cell viability was analyzed using an XTT cell proliferation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. P19 cells exposed to RA during aggregation were trypsinized, and 5 × 103 cells were re-plated onto 96-well plates. Cells were incubated with or without Dox for 6 days, and tetrazolium salt XTT was added. The plates were incubated further for 4 h at 37 °C, and the optical density at 450 nm (A450) was measured with a spectrophotometer. P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells can be differentiated into neuronal cells upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment during aggregation followed by plating on tissue culture plates (47McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 48McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar). This process can be detected with the neuron-specific marker proteins, βIII-tubulin and MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) (Fig.1A). Two days after plating, neurite-like structures began to appear, and after 6 days these structures were obvious and clearly detected by immunochemical staining with βIII-tubulin and MAP2 antibodies. It has been shown that several Wnts were differentially expressed during neuronal differentiation of P19 EC cells (49Smolich B.D. Papkoff J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We observed a similar pattern of Wnt expression during neuronal differentiation (Fig. 1B). Wnt-1 mRNA is transiently expressed upon plating on tissue culture plates after aggregation and the early stages of neuronal differentiation have occurred. Interestingly, during the later stages of differentiation (4 and 6 days after plating), the level of Wnt-1 mRNA expression rapidly diminished, whereas the expression of Wnt-3a was induced. In contrast to either Wnt-1 or Wnt-3a, the level of Wnt-5a increases steadily during differentiation. These observations suggest that Wnt-1, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a may have different roles in P19 EC cell differentiation. The occurrence of proper neuronal differentiation was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti βIII-tubulin and MAP2 antibodies (Fig. 1C). It was shown that Axin is down-regulated upon Wnt-3a treatment of C57MG and L cells (41Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 54Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Because the endogenous Wnt-3a level increased during neuronal differentiation of P19 EC cells, we examined the levels of Axin mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B), and found that they were both down-regulated during neuronal differentiation (3.2 ± 0.9-fold reduction in protein level for the 6-day-differentiated compared with undifferentiated samples (n = 3)). We predicted that down-regulation of Axin might lead to stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 2C, cytoplasmic β-catenin is steadily accumulated during neuronal differentiation (4.1 ± 1.2-fold induction in undifferentiated versus in 6-day-differentiated samples (n = 3)), whereas the actin and total β-catenin levels are unchanged. It is well accepted that accumulated cytoplasmic β-catenin is translocated into nuclei to regulate the expression of downstream target genes. Immunochemical staining with anti β-catenin antibody revealed that β-catenin is mainly localized in the nuclei of differentiated cells, in contrast to its membrane localization in undifferentiated cells (Fig.2D). These data suggest that down-regulation of Axin and induction of β-catenin signaling is important for neuronal differentiation. To test whether the down-regulation of Axin occursin vivo as well as during P19 EC cell differentiation, the Axin level was compared in the brains of 13.5 dpc mouse embryos (which contain many undifferentiated neuronal precursor cells)versus brains of 1-month-old postnatal mice (which contain more differentiated neurons). The level of the neuron-specific marker βIII-tubulin was increased during that period, as shown by others (55Kusek J.C. Greene R.M. Pisano M.M. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 54: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas the Axin level was reduced (Fig. 2E). RA treatment of F9 EC, or treatment of P19"

In this regard, α-l-fucose is an important constituent of the carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates involved in a variety of biological events as growth regulators and receptors in signal transduction, cell-cell interactions, and antigenic response (1Staudacher E. Altmann F. Wilson I.B. Marz L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 216-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).In plants, α-l-fucosylated oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucan, a plant cell wall component that controls cell expansion, have been shown to regulate auxin- and acid pH-induced growth (2de La Torre F. Sampedro J. Zarra I. Revilla G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In mammals, oligosaccharides containing fucose have been found, for instance, in human milk and in blood group substances (3Stahl B. Thurl S. Henker J. Siegel M. Finke B. Sawatzki G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 501: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and they are reported to play important roles in fertilization (4Mori E. Hedrick J.L. Wardrip N.J. Mori T. Takasaki S. Glycoconj.

Pathol. 1998; 110: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Changes in fucosylation patterns have been observed in several physiological events including pregnancy (6Xiang J.

The central role of fucose derivatives in biological events explains the interest in α-l-fucosidase and fucosyltransferase activities.Family 29 of glycosyl hydrolases classification (GH29)1 groups α-fucosidases (EC 3.2.1.51) from a variety of sources, including human and several pathogenic bacteria (15Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). No structural data are available about this class of enzymes, and the residues involved in catalysis are still unknown. Recently, it has been shown (16Eneyskaya E.V. Kulminskaya A.A. Kalkkinen N. Nifantiev N.E. Arbatskii N.P. Saenko A.I. Chepurnaya O.V. Arutyunyan A.V. Glycoconj.

Rather, since no multiple interruptions could be found, a selection toward a single conserved shift occurs, suggesting a conserved translational regulation mechanism. 2B. Cobucci-Ponzano, M. Rossi, and M. Moracci, manuscript in preparation.2B. Cobucci-Ponzano, M. Rossi, and M. Moracci, manuscript in preparation. The maintenance of a correct reading frame is fundamental to the integrity of the translation process; nevertheless, an increasing number of cases have been described in which localized deviations from the standard translational rules are used to regulate the correct expression of a minority of genes (18Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These events, named recoding, are used to increase the diversity in gene expression or for its regulation, and they include programmed ribosome frameshifting to a different reading frame, ribosome hopping over nucleotides, and reading of stop codons as sense codons (readthrough). Among recoding events, programmed −1 frameshifts are by far the most prevalent (19Farabaugh P.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 507-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); they have been well characterized in RNA viruses, but the basic molecular mechanisms governing these events are almost identical from yeast to humans (20Hammell A.B. Taylor R.C. Peltz S.W. Dinman J.D. Genome Res. 1999; 5: 417-427Google Scholar). In Archaea, documented recoding events are limited to readthrough (21Hao B. Gong W. Ferguson T.K. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Chan M.K. Science. 2002; 296: 1462-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar); no proofs of programmed −1 frameshifting have been reported in this domain so far.To test the hypothesis that SSO11867 and SSO3060 ORFs could express a functional α-fucosidase, we have cloned and expressed these genes inEscherichia coli. Two specific mutations, designed on the basis of the programmed −1 frameshifting mechanism, allow the expression of a full-length thermophilic and thermostable α-l-fucosidase, with micromolar substrate specificity, which promotes transfucosylation reactions by following aretaining reaction mechanism. This is the first evidence of an α-fucosidase from Archaea, and our data unequivocally demonstrate that GH29 enzymes follow a retaining reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the data presented give support to the hypothesis that translational recoding could be used to regulate gene expression in Archaea.DISCUSSIONAmong the disrupted genes in S. solfataricus, we have identified two ORFs, SSO11867 and SSO3060, homologous to eukaryal and bacterial α-fucosidases from family 29 of glycosyl hydrolases; the presence of a −1 shift between these ORFs was confirmed, and we found that they are actively co-transcribed in S. solfataricus. A complete programmed −1 frameshifting regulation site has been identified, suggesting that SSO11867 and SSO3060 could be expressedin vivo by following this mechanism. Remarkably, the two ORFs express in E. coli trace amounts of α-fucosidase activity, confirming that the frameshifting cassette promotes non-regulated frameshifting during overexpression of foreign genes inE. coli (19Farabaugh P.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 507-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis showed two major transcriptional initiation sites: the first mapped upstream from the two ORFs, and the second started from the G of the first ATG of the SSO3060 ORF. This ORF could not express a functional protein with α-fucosidase activity in E. coli, suggesting that post-transcriptional cleavage may occur on the longer transcript. However, the possibility that SSO3060 expresses in S. solfataricus a polypeptide with a different function, thus explaining the programmed −1 frameshifting regulation, cannot be ruled out; experiments are in progress to study the expression in vivo of these genes.Two mutations, in key positions to mimic programmed −1 frameshifting, made it possible to drive the expression of the full-length α-fucosidase Ssα-fuc that is optimally active at 95 °C. Remarkably, the enzyme is stable at 80 °C, the temperature at whichS. solfataricus optimally grows; these observations are strong evidences that the enzyme produced by following the programmed −1 frameshifting could be stable and active in vivo. These results indicate that SSO11867 and SSO3060 ORFs encode for the first archaeal α-fucosidase identified so far, suggesting that they may not be pseudogenes and that programmed −1 frameshifting could be present in this living domain.The substrate characterization revealed that Ssα-fuc catalyzes the hydrolysis of pNp-Fuc with high efficiency and specificity; in the framework of our mechanistic studies on thermophilic glycosyl hydrolases, the reaction mechanism of Ssα-fuc was analyzed in detail. Glycosyl hydrolases follow two distinct mechanisms that are termedretaining or inverting if the enzymatic cleavage of the glycosidic bond liberates a product with the same or the opposite anomeric configuration of the substrate, respectively (32Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Both classes of enzymes employ a pair of carboxylic acid residues in catalysis and operate via transition states with substantial oxocarbenium ion character. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of the 24 GH29 α-fucosidases shown in Fig. 1 revealed two residues of aspartic/glutamic acid that are completely conserved in this family (Asp-124 and Asp-146 in Ssα-fuc numbering) and are the best candidates to be involved in catalysis as the nucleophile or the acid/base of the reaction (not shown); experiments are currently in progress to test the functional role of these residues.In retaining enzymes, when acceptors different from water intercept the reactive glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, they promote transglycosylation reactions (Fig. 9). The ability of Ssα-fuc to function in the transglycosylation mode allowed us to demonstrate experimentally that the enzyme catalyzes the formation of the α-(1,2) and α-(1,3) bonds between fucose and the glucose of pNp-Glc. The α-anomeric configuration of the interglycosidic linkages in the products unequivocally indicates that GH29 α-fucosidases follow a retaining reaction mechanism; this is the first time that the mechanism followed by glycosyl hydrolases from this family has been experimentally demonstrated by following transglycosylation reaction. Moreover, the activity observed on α-l-Fuc-(1–3)-α-l-Fuc-O-pNp revealed that Ssα-fuc is an exo-glycosyl hydrolase that attacks the substrates from their non-reducing end. The disaccharide α-l-Fucp-(1–3)-α-d-Glc-O-pNp was synthesized previously (33Farkas E. Thiem J. Ajisaka K. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 328: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) by using a mesophilic α-l-fucosidase in a reaction using the fluoroderivative of the donor and glucose as acceptor in 34% yield. In our case no efforts were made for the optimization of the reaction conditions (keeping as low as possible the acceptor/donor equivalent ratio useful for synthetic application with rare acceptors). However, the thermophilic nature of Ssα-fuc is of interest for biotechnological exploitation of its transferring capability (34Fischer L. Bromann R. Kengen S.W.M. de Vos W.M. Wagner F. Biotechnology. 1996; 14: 88-91PubMed Google Scholar).Family 29 of glycosyl hydrolases includes enzymes from plants, vertebrates, and pathogenic microbes of plants and humans. The data presented here demonstrate that this enzymatic activity is present in all the three living domains. The ORF TM0306 from the bacteriumThermotoga maritima, putatively encoding for an α-fucosidase, is the only other known example from hyperthermophiles (35Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L.

Y5 has been isolated and characterized (16Eneyskaya E.V. Kulminskaya A.A. Kalkkinen N. Nifantiev N.E. Arbatskii N.P. Saenko A.I. Chepurnaya O.V. Arutyunyan A.V. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 10: 827-834Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ssα-fuc showed the highest amino acid sequence identity (40%) with a putative α-fucosidase from the phytopathogen bacterium Xanthomonas (36da Silva A.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C.

Setubal J.C. Kitajima J.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), whereas only 25% identity with the T. maritima enzyme was observed; this is surprising because higher similarity between enzymes from hyperthermophiles would be expected. Structural comparisons of Ssα-fuc with Thermus sp. enzyme, which is a secreted tetrameric protein, are hampered by the only partial sequence available for the eubacterial enzyme; however, Ssα-fuc did not show signal peptides for secretion, and no α-fucosidase activity was found inS. solfataricus media.α-Fucosidases in higher plants and in mammals are associated with different mechanisms of cell growth and regulation, because they are involved in the modification of fucosylated glucans (1Staudacher E. Altmann F. Wilson I.B. Marz L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 216-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). By contrast, at present, there are only limited data on α-fucosidases from eukaryal and bacterial microorganisms. The presence, in S. solfataricus, of glycosylated proteins has been reported recently (37Lower B.H. Kennelly P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2614-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); although the composition of their carbohydrate moiety is unknown, different enzymatic activities for the synthesis, modification, and hydrolysis of these glycosidic bonds should be present in this Archaeon and regulated in some manner. The activity of Ssα-fuc (efficient hydrolysis of aryl fucosides, very high substrate specificity, transfucosylation capability) may suggest its involvement in vivo in these biological processes.Relatively little is known about the function of the 22 glycosyl hydrolases of S. solfataricus; several genes encoding for this class of enzymes, including SSO11867 and SSO3060, an α-glucosidase (SSO3051), a β-glucuronidase (SSO3036), a β-xylosidase (SSO3032), and the clustered α-xylosidase (XylS), and β-glycosidase (Ssβ-gly) (SSO3022 and SSO3019, respectively) map in the same region of about 50 kb and are likely to be involved in the degradation of sugars for energy metabolism. In particular, we reported previously that XylS and Ssβ-gly hydrolyze xyloglucan oligosaccharides in vitro in a cooperative way (22Moracci M. Cobucci-Ponzano B. Trincone A. Fusco S.

In this regard, a similar situation is present in T. maritima, in which the α-fucosidase gene is part of a cluster of six ORFs potentially involved in xyloglucan utilization (22Moracci M. Cobucci-Ponzano B. Trincone A. Fusco S. De Rosa M. van de Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22082-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); remarkably,S. solfataricus, strain P2, hydrolyzes xyloglucan from tamarind seed, which is not fucosylated. 3B. Cobucci-Ponzano, unpublished results. The ability of Ssα-fuc to hydrolyze short fucosylated oligosaccharides is revealed by the rapid hydrolysis observed using α-l-Fuc-(1–3)-α-l-Fuc-O-pNp substrate. The hypothesis that Ssα-fuc, XylS, and Ssβ-gly cooperate in the sequential hydrolytic steps on fucosylated xyloglucans from plant cell walls (38Crombie H.J. Chengappa S. Hellyer A. Reid J.S.G. Plant J. 1998; 15: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) is tempting and is currently under investigation, in the hope of shedding some light on a novel metabolic pathway inS. solfataricus for the utilization of this hemicellulose as a carbon source. It has been known that carbohydrates can serve as structural components of natural products, as energy sources, or more interestingly, as key elements in various molecular recognition processes. In this regard, α-l-fucose is an important constituent of the carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates involved in a variety of biological events as growth regulators and receptors in signal transduction, cell-cell interactions, and antigenic response (1Staudacher E. Altmann F. Wilson I.B. Marz L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 216-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In plants, α-l-fucosylated oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucan, a plant cell wall component that controls cell expansion, have been shown to regulate auxin- and acid pH-induced growth (2de La Torre F. Sampedro J. Zarra I. Revilla G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In mammals, oligosaccharides containing fucose have been found, for instance, in human milk and in blood group substances (3Stahl B. Thurl S. Henker J. Siegel M. Finke B. Sawatzki G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 501: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and they are reported to play important roles in fertilization (4Mori E. Hedrick J.L. Wardrip N.J. Mori T. Takasaki S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in adhesion processes of viruses, bacteria, and other parasites (5Listinsky J.J. Siegal G.P. Listinsky C.M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1998; 110: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Changes in fucosylation patterns have been observed in several physiological events including pregnancy (6Xiang J. Bernstein I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), programmed cell death of different cell types (7Russell L. Waring P. Beaver J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in a variety of pathological events including diabetes (8Wiese T.J. Dunlap J.A. Yorek M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and colon and liver carcinomas (9Rapoport E. Pendu J.L.

Cancer. 1998; 75: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the determination of α–fucosidase activity can be used to predict the development of colorectal, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinomas (11Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Ayude D. de la Cadena M.P. Martinez-Zorzano V.S. de Carlos A. Caride-Castro A. de Castro G. Rodriguez- Berrocal F.J. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2000; 24: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar, 12Abdel-Aleem H.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The central role of fucose derivatives in biological events explains the interest in α-l-fucosidase and fucosyltransferase activities. Family 29 of glycosyl hydrolases classification (GH29)1 groups α-fucosidases (EC 3.2.1.51) from a variety of sources, including human and several pathogenic bacteria (15Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). No structural data are available about this class of enzymes, and the residues involved in catalysis are still unknown. Recently, it has been shown (16Eneyskaya E.V. Kulminskaya A.A. Kalkkinen N. Nifantiev N.E. Arbatskii N.P. Saenko A.I. Chepurnaya O.V. Arutyunyan A.V. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 10: 827-834Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that the α-fucosidase from Thermus sp. Y5 performs the hydrolytic reaction with the retention of the anomeric configuration. The analysis of the genome of the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (17She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J. Chan-Weiher C.C. Clausen I.G.

A. 2001; 98: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of two ORFs, annotated as SSO11867 and SSO3060, separated by a −1 frameshift, that are homologous to the N- and the C-terminal fragments, respectively, of full-length bacterial and eukaryal GH29 fucosidases. In the genome of this Archaeon several interrupted genes, conserved in distantly related Archaea, have been identified, arguing that these interruptions were not sequencing mistakes. Rather, since no multiple interruptions could be found, a selection toward a single conserved shift occurs, suggesting a conserved translational regulation mechanism. 2B. Cobucci-Ponzano, M. Rossi, and M. Moracci, manuscript in preparation.2B. Cobucci-Ponzano, M. Rossi, and M. Moracci, manuscript in preparation. The maintenance of a correct reading frame is fundamental to the integrity of the translation process; nevertheless, an increasing number of cases have been described in which localized deviations from the standard translational rules are used to regulate the correct expression of a minority of genes (18Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These events, named recoding, are used to increase the diversity in gene expression or for its regulation, and they include programmed ribosome frameshifting to a different reading frame, ribosome hopping over nucleotides, and reading of stop codons as sense codons (readthrough). Among recoding events, programmed −1 frameshifts are by far the most prevalent (19Farabaugh P.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 507-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); they have been well characterized in RNA viruses, but the basic molecular mechanisms governing these events are almost identical from yeast to humans (20Hammell A.B. Taylor R.C. Peltz S.W. Dinman J.D. Genome Res. 1999; 5: 417-427Google Scholar). In Archaea, documented recoding events are limited to readthrough (21Hao B. Gong W. Ferguson T.K. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Chan M.K. Science. 2002; 296: 1462-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar); no proofs of programmed −1 frameshifting have been reported in this domain so far. To test the hypothesis that SSO11867 and SSO3060 ORFs could express a functional α-fucosidase, we have cloned and expressed these genes inEscherichia coli. Two specific mutations, designed on the basis of the programmed −1 frameshifting mechanism, allow the expression of a full-length thermophilic and thermostable α-l-fucosidase, with micromolar substrate specificity, which promotes transfucosylation reactions by following aretaining reaction mechanism. This is the first evidence of an α-fucosidase from Archaea, and our data unequivocally demonstrate that GH29 enzymes follow a retaining reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the data presented give support to the hypothesis that translational recoding could be used to regulate gene expression in Archaea. DISCUSSIONAmong the disrupted genes in S. solfataricus, we have identified two ORFs, SSO11867 and SSO3060, homologous to eukaryal and bacterial α-fucosidases from family 29 of glycosyl hydrolases; the presence of a −1 shift between these ORFs was confirmed, and we found that they are actively co-transcribed in S. solfataricus. A complete programmed −1 frameshifting regulation site has been identified, suggesting that SSO11867 and SSO3060 could be expressedin vivo by following this mechanism. Remarkably, the two ORFs express in E. coli trace amounts of α-fucosidase activity, confirming that the frameshifting cassette promotes non-regulated frameshifting during overexpression of foreign genes inE. coli (19Farabaugh P.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 507-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis showed two major transcriptional initiation sites: the first mapped upstream from the two ORFs, and the second started from the G of the fi"

Ligand binding results in dimerization of TraR and is required for its activity. Analysis of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of TraR localized the quormone-binding domain to a region between residues 39 and 140 and the primary dimerization domain to a region between residues 119 and 156. The dominant-negative properties of these mutants predicted a second dimerization domain at the C terminus of the protein. Analysis of fusions of N-terminal fragments of TraR to λcI′ confirmed the dimerization activity of these two domains. Fifteen single amino acid substitution mutants of TraR defective in dimerization were isolated. According to the analysis of these mutants, Asp-70 and Gly-113 are essential for quormone binding, whereas Ala-38 and Ala-105 are important, but not essential. Additional residues located within the N-terminal half of TraR, including three located in α-helix 9, contribute to dimerization, but are not required for ligand binding. These results and the recently reported crystal structure of TraR are consistent with and complement each other and together define some of the structural and functional relationships of this quorum-sensing activator.

N-acylated homoserine lactone N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone N-octanoylhomoserine lactone 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside Many bacteria use a cell-cell signaling system to control expression of specialized gene sets in response to their population size. Called quorum sensing, the bacteria measure their cell numbers by sensing the accumulation within the environment of a small diffusible signal molecule, the quormone, which they themselves produce (reviewed in Ref. 1Whitehead N.A. Barnard A.M.L. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 365-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gram-negative bacteria often use N-acylated homoserine lactones (acyl-HSL)1 as their quormone, with signal specificity being determined by the length and degree of saturation of the acyl side chain as well as the nature of the chemical group at C-3. For example, Vibrio fischeri, which regulates the expression of the luxoperon by quorum sensing (2Sitnikov D.M. Schineller J.B. Baldwin T.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), produces and responds toN-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL) (3Eberhard A. Burlingame A.L. Eberhard C. Kenyon G.L. Nealson K.H. Oppenheimer N.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2444-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), whereas Rhizobium leguminosarum regulates expression of a network of genes (4Lithgow J.K. Wilkinson A. Hardman A. Rodelas B. Wisniewski-Dye F. Williams P. Downie J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in a quorum-dependent manner usingN-(3-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone as the signal (5Gray K.M. Pearson J.P. Downie J.A. Boboye B.E.A. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 372-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schripsema J. de Rudder K.E.E. van Vliet T.B. Lankhorst P.P. de Vroom E. Kijne J.W. van Brussel A.A.N. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 366-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the acyl-HSL-mediated systems examined to date, expression of the target genes is controlled by a dedicated transcription factor, usually an activator (1Whitehead N.A. Barnard A.M.L. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 365-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins, of which LuxR is the prototype, require the quormone to activate transcription. Genetic evidence from studies of LuxR suggests that the activator binds the acyl-HSL ligand and, in doing so, converts from an inactive to an active form (7Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). LuxR (and by inference, all other members of the family) is believed to be composed of two functional regions, a C-terminal DNA recognition and interaction domain and an N-terminal quormone-binding domain (7Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar).Recent studies of TraR, the quorum-sensing transcriptional activator responsible for controlling conjugal transfer of theAgrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmids, are consistent with this model. TraR activates expression of the three operons of the Ti plasmid tra regulon from promoters that contain an 18-bp inverted repeat called the tra box (8Farrand S.K. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J.J. The Rhizobiaceae: Molecular Biology of Plant-associated Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 199-233Crossref Google Scholar). The acyl-HSL quormone N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL) (9Zhang L. Murphy P.J. Kerr A. Tate M.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) is required for TraR to bind thetra box (10Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, purified TraR binds the ligand tightly (11Qin Y Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), with such binding resulting in dimerization of the protein (11Qin Y Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). No higher order multimers are formed at detectable levels (11Qin Y Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), indicating that TraR is active only in the dimer form. These observations suggest a model in which, in the absence of the quormone, TraR fails to dimerize and cannot bind the tra box. In the presence of the signal, TraR binds the quormone, thereby forming stable homodimers. The dimer binds the tra boxes and, in interaction with RNA polymerase, activates transcription.TraR is the only activator of the LuxR family that can be purified in its full-sized active form, making it an ideal candidate for molecular and biochemical analysis (12Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic assays and biochemical techniques are available to examine the DNA-binding, dimerization, and transcriptional activation properties of this regulator (10Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Qin Y Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mutations in the C-terminal domain of TraR abolish DNA binding (10Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of a helix-turn-helix motif located within this region of the protein (13Piper K.R. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. Nature. 1993; 362: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 14Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2796-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In addition, certain residues located at the far N terminus and in the middle of the protein are important for transcriptional activation, but not for DNA binding (10Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Analysis of a series of stable N- and C-terminal deletion mutants identified a region of TraR located between residues 49 and 156 that is important for dimerization (11Qin Y Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, like LuxR, TraR is composed of an N-terminal dimerization domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain, a conclusion that is supported by the recent reports of the x-ray crystal structure of TraR bound to its DNA recognition element (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, although the x-ray structure predicts regions and residues involved in ligand binding as well as in dimerization, the importance and contributions of these residues in the two processes have not been assessed by biochemical or genetic analyses.In this study, we combine a genetic analysis with biochemical tests to identify regions of TraR required for ligand binding and dimerization. We also report the isolation of a series of substitution mutants of TraR defective in these properties and have used these mutants to identify residues of the activator that are critical for binding the quormone and for forming dimers. Our results indicate that certain conserved residues are essential for binding acyl-HSL; but, although ligand binding is required for the process, no single residue is essential for dimerization per se. In addition, although two residues were identified as being essential for ligand binding, substitutions at several positions that hinder dimerization alter, but do not abolish, the ligand-binding properties of the protein.DISCUSSIONWe reported previously that purified active TraR is a homodimer and that formation of stable dimers depends upon binding the acyl-HSL quormone (11Qin Y Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently reported crystallographic analyses confirm this prediction and identify sets of residues, all in the N-terminal half of TraR, that contribute to ligand binding and to dimerization (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our studies of dimerization-defective mutants of TraR generally support these assignments. However, we show that substitutions at residues predicted to be involved in quormone binding exert different effects, ranging from abolishing binding outright to modifying the nature of the binding, resulting in altered responses to cognate and non-cognate signals.Of the 15 substitution mutants we isolated, alterations at only two residues, Asp-70 and Gly-113, completely abolished quormone binding. Not surprisingly, both mutants failed to dimerize and lacked detectable biological activity. The two amino acids are among five residues that are conserved in all acyl-HSL-dependent members of the LuxR family (1Whitehead N.A. Barnard A.M.L. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 365-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the corresponding residues of LuxR (Asp-79) and LasR (Asp-73) also are important for transcriptional activation (33Shadel G.S. Young R. Baldwin T.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3980-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kiratisin P. Tucker K.D. Passador L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4912-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and, in the case of LasR, for dimerization (34Kiratisin P. Tucker K.D. Passador L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4912-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). That a mutation at Asp-70 affects binding is predictable; in the crystal structure, the side chain carboxyl group of this residue forms a hydrogen bond with the imino group of the quormone (Fig.6A) (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our analyses show that Asp-70 and its contributed hydrogen bond are essential for binding signal.The two replacements at Asp-70, D70N and D70E, provide an informative contrast. Whereas C-terminally repaired D70N was completely inactive, the D70E mutant was very weakly active in cells grown with high levels of quormone (Table II). Asparagine differs from the native Asp predominantly in charge, whereas the glutamate retains the acidic function, but the side chain is larger by one methylene group. We conclude that, although the bulkiness of the side group at position 70 is important, this residue must contain an acidic function, a prediction that is consistent with the structural studies (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Vannini A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).The G113S mutation exerted a profound effect on TraR activity; and clearly, the glycine at this position is essential for quormone binding and subsequent dimerization. The corresponding residues in LuxR (Gly-121) and LasR (Gly-113) also are required for biological activity (2Sitnikov D.M. Schineller J.B. Baldwin T.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Shadel G.S. Young R. Baldwin T.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3980-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kiratisin P.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4912-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The structural analysis did not predict a direct interaction between Gly-113, located in β-sheet 4, and the acyl-HSL (Figs. 3 and 6A) (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T.

Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) concluded that Trp-85 interacts with the acyl side chain, whereas Vannini et al. (16Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) predicted that this residue interacts with the lactone moiety. Our examination of the crystal structure is consistent with the latter interpretation (Fig.7A). We suggest that the bulkier side group of the serine substitution in the G113S mutant perturbs the correct positioning of Trp-85 (Fig. 7B), thereby inhibiting quormone binding.Figure 7Specific interactions between residues of TraR and between residues of TraR and the acyl-HSL ligand.

However, although the mutant was defective, unlike the Asp-70 and G-113 mutants, activity was restored by addition of excess quormone (Fig. 5). Ala-38 is located in the ligand-binding site (Fig. 6A) and, along with Thr-129, is predicted to contribute to a water bridge with the 3-oxo group of the quormone (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The A38V mutant still bound a small amount of signal, suggesting that the valine substitution can participate, although poorly, in the coordination of the water molecule. Alternatively, the decreased binding may reflect the contribution of Thr-129 alone. Consistent with its limited signal binding, the A38V mutant formed heterodimers, albeit at low levels, with His-tagged TraR (Fig. 4B). Moreover, although functional, the C-terminally repaired mutant activated expression of the reporter to levels only half those of the wild-type activator (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the mutant was as sensitive as wild-type TraR to the cognate acyl-HSL, but was considerably less sensitive to the non-cognate signals (Fig. 5). We suggest that the bulkier valine substitution interferes with the water bridge, resulting in a decreased affinity for the quormone. However, this defect can be partially overcome by addition of excess ligand. Given the disproportionately decreased sensitivity to 3-oxo-C6-HSL, we speculate that, in the absence of a water bridge, the van der Waals interactions with the acyl side chain take on added importance for signal binding. Ala-38 is not highly conserved among sequenced homologs of LuxR (1Whitehead N.A. Barnard A.M.L. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 365-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among those members that recognize acyl-HSLs with oxo or hydroxy substitutions at C-3 in which a water bridge might be important, the analogous positions can be occupied by alanine, serine, and the considerably bulkier residues threonine and leucine, but none contain valine (1Whitehead N.A. Barnard A.M.L. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 365-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Like the A38V mutant, cells expressing the A105V mutant retained only small amounts of quormone (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the two mutants formed very weak heterodimers with His6-TraR (Fig.4) and also exhibited reduced sensitivity to the non-cognate signals (Fig. 5). However, whereas A38V activated the reporter to only about half its maximal level, the A105V mutant induced the same reporter to wild-type levels. Ala-105 contributes to quormone binding through a van der Waals interaction with the homoserine lactone moiety (Fig.6A) (16Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Moreover, the residue is conserved in most members of the LuxR family (1Whitehead N.A. Barnard A.M.L. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 365-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and an A105V mutation in LasR has similar effects on the activity of the Pseudomonas aeruginosaactivator (34Kiratisin P. Tucker K.D. Passador L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4912-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We suggest that the bulkier valine substitution at this position affects the capacity of TraR to initially bind the quormone. However, once bound, the protein forms stable dimers, and the ligand is retained strongly. This conclusion is consistent with the wild-type levels of activity exhibited by the mutant when exposed to higher levels of quormone (Fig. 5). Moreover, when tested at high levels of signal, cells expressing the A105V mutant retained as much signal as wild-type TraR (data not shown).Strains expressing the T51I mutant retained levels of ligand indistinguishable from those expressing wild-type TraR. Thr-51 is predicted to form a van der Waals contact with the distal region of the acyl chain of the quormone (Fig. 6A) (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). That strains expressing the T51I mutant retained ligand indicates that the isoleucine substitution has little effect on signal binding. However, the mutant lost most of the dominant negativity of the parent (TableII) and did not form strong heterodimers with His6-TraR. Moreover, the C-terminally repaired T51I mutant was activable by excess quormone, but to levels only one-fourth that of wild-type TraR (Fig.5). These observations suggest that the isoleucine substitution, although having little effect on signal binding, interferes strongly with the formation or stability of the dimers. It is conceivable that replacing the hydrophilic threonine residue with the bulkier hydrophobic isoleucine introduces a steric perturbation that inhibits dimerization.Of the remaining nine dimerization-defective mutants, three, A149V, L155F, and S160F, map to α-helix 9 (Ref. 15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A.

Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). All three mutants bound quormone as well as wild-type TraR (Fig. 2) (data not shown). Moreover, all three retained some dominant negativity and, in their C-terminally repaired forms, activated the traG reporter, albeit to low levels, suggesting that they still form dimers (Table II). These properties are consistent with the analysis of the C-terminal deletion mutants; TraRΔC115, from which all of α-helix 9 was removed, retained some dominant negativity (Fig. 1), suggesting that it can form weak heterodimers with wild-type TraR. The response of the L155F mutant to cognate and non-cognate quormones emphasizes the importance of the α-helix 9 region; the mutant activated the reporter, but only to very low levels even at saturating amounts of signal (Fig. 5). Moreover, the mutant responded to the non-cognate quormones in a manner similar to that of the cognate acyl-HSL, consistent with our conclusion that the phenylalanine substitution alters dimerization of the protein, but not its signal-binding properties.Four mutants, L25F, H54Y, E88K, and S112F, map to the N-terminal region of TraR (Fig. 3), but are not predicted to contribute to dimerization or signal binding (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Vannini A.

All four mutant proteins bound quormone as well as wild-type TraR (Fig. 2) (data not shown), and all retained some biological activity (Table II). However, the mutants did not interact with His6-TraR (Fig. 4B) (data not shown). Leu-25 and Glu-88 lie within α-helices 2 and 6, respectively, and Ser-112 is located within β-sheet 4 (Fig. 6D) (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). His-54 is located within a group of residues involved in quormone binding (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar); but, in the three-dimensional structure, this amino acid is distant from the binding site (Fig. 6D). All four residues cluster in the same general region (Fig. 6D), and it is conceivable that steric effects induced by substitutions at these sites adversely alter the dimer properties of the protein.The remaining two mutations are located C-terminal to the linker joining the N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 3). E211K is altered in a residue located in the recognition helix of the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 6C). Zhang et al. (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) predicted a van der Waals interaction between Glu-211 and T-8. In agreement with this assignment, the mutation substantially inhibited the dominant-negative properties of TraRΔC1 (Table II). This defect is consistent with the observation that E211K formed weak heterodimers with His6-TraR (data not shown). Moreover, the C-terminally repaired mutant showed only weak activator activity (Table II). In contrast to these observations, an alanine substitution at Asn-220, the corresponding residue of LuxR, has little to no effect on transcriptional activation by this protein (35Egland K.R. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Trott A.E. Stevens A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The T190I mutant is unique among our isolates. Strains expressing this mutant retained normal levels of quormone, and the protein only weakly dimerized with His6-TraR. However, like the ligand binding-defective mutants, in its C-terminally reconstituted form, T190I failed to detectably activate the lacZ reporter even at high quormone concentrations (Fig. 5). Although Thr-190 is not predicted to participate in signal binding or dimerization (15Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S.C.

However, if this interaction is correct, it is difficult to understand how a substitution at this residue results in such a drastic loss of activity. Our analysis of the crystal structure predicts that the side group hydroxyl of Thr-190 forms a main chain hydrogen bond with the amide of Glu-193, which is located in α-helix 11, the scaffold component of the helix-turn-helix motif (Fig. 7C).

Recent work has shown that c-Abl and Arg are activated in the cellular response to oxidative stress. The present studies demonstrate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce the formation of c-Abl and Arg heterodimers. The results show that the c-Abl SH3 domain binds directly to a proline-rich site (amino acids 567–576) in the Arg C-terminal region. Formation of c-Abl·Arg heterodimers also involves direct binding of the Arg Src homology 3 domain to the C-terminal region of c-Abl. The results further demonstrate that the interaction between c-Abl and Arg involves c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Arg. The functional significance of the c-Abl-Arg interaction is supported by the demonstration that both c-Abl and Arg are required for ROS-induced apoptosis.

The N-terminal regions of c-Abl and Arg share ∼90% identity and, as found in members of the Src family, contain tandem Src homology 3 (SH3),1 SH2, and tyrosine kinase (SH1) domains.

In addition, the C-terminal region of c-Abl differs from that of Arg by the presence of a nuclear localization signal (7Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic c-Abl is activated in response to ROS production by a mechanism that depends on interactions with protein kinase Cδ (34Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujji M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N.

Activation of cytoplasmic c-Abl by ROS is associated with targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and induction of cell death (36Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S.

Other studies have shown that Arg is activated by oxidative stress and that this response involves Arg-mediated phosphorylation of the proapoptotic Siva-1 protein (38Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The finding that ROS-induced apoptosis is attenuated in arg−/− cells has supported a role for Arg in the cell death response to oxidative stress (38Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the available evidence indicates that cytoplasmic c-Abl and Arg are both functional in the oxidative stress response. The present studies demonstrate that c-Abl forms heterodimers with Arg in the response to oxidative stress. The functional significance of these findings is supported by the demonstration that both c-Abl and Arg are required for ROS-induced apoptosis. 293 cells, MCF-7, MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) (27Yuan Z. Huang Y.

Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with H2O2 (Sigma), menadione (Sigma), 20 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; Promega, Madison, WI), 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), or 0.1 μm Taxol (paclitaxel; Sigma). FLAG-tagged c-Abl, Arg, and their truncated variants were expressed by cloning into the pcDNA3.1-based FLAG vector. His/Exp-tagged constructs were prepared by cloning into pcDNA4HisMAX (Invitrogen). Myc-tagged constructs were prepared by cloning into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech). Retroviruses expressing FLAG-c-Abl(K-R) or FLAG-Arg(K-R) were prepared by cloning into a MSCV-based retroviral vector (MSCVpuro; Clontech). Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mmdithiothreitol; 10 mm sodium fluoride; and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Soluble protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc (Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG (M5, Sigma), anti-c-Abl (24–11, Santa Cruz) or anti-Exp (Invitrogen). Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, anti-Arg (38Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol.

The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were prepared as described (28Yuan Z.M. Shioya H.

Cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins conjugated to Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The adsorbates were washed with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. An aliquot of the total lysate (2% v/v) was included as a control. For direct binding assays, purified GST fusion proteins were incubated within vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins. The adsorbates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Recombinant GST-c-Abl was coupled to a carboxymethyl dextran sensor chip CM5 in the presence of EDC, ethanolamine HCl, and N-hydroxysuccinimide. Binding assays were performed in a Biocore 1000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified recombinant Arg (9Koleske A.J. Gifford A.M. Scott M.L. Nee M. Bronson R.T. Miczek K.A. Baltimore D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1259-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) diluted in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mmEDTA and 0.005% surfactant P20) was applied to the chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 35 °C. BIAevaluation software 3.0 and the 1:1 Langmuir binding model were used to assess binding kinetics. Lysates from c-abl−/− cells expressing FLAG-Arg were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG. The protein complexes were washed, normalized by immunoblotting, heat inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min, and then resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2) containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and kinase-active Abl (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed and citrate buffer-permeabilized cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The numbers of cells with sub-G1 DNA were determined with a MODFIT LT program. To determine whether c-Abl associates with Arg in vivo, lysates from MCF-7 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl or, as a control, mouse IgG. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-Arg demonstrated a low level of c-Abl·Arg complexes (Fig.1A). Significantly, treatment of the cells with 40 and 160 μmH2O2 was associated with detectable increases in c-Abl·Arg complexes (Fig. 1A). Exposure to 640 μm H2O2, however, resulted in an association between c-Abl and Arg which was comparable with that found in control cells (Fig. 1A). Based on the total amount of Arg in lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation, less than 1% of the Arg protein was complexed with c-Abl in control cells. Treatment with 40 μm H2O2 increased the formation of c-Abl·Arg complexes 3.2-fold such that ∼3% of the Arg protein was complexed with c-Abl. Although total cellular levels of Arg and c-Abl were similar in these cells, the fraction of c-Abl complexed to Arg was also ∼3% in response to H2O2. Similar findings were obtained in MEFs treated with H2O2 (Fig. 1B). The association between c-Abl and Arg was increased after exposure to 10, 40, and 160 μm H2O2, whereas treatment with 640 μm H2O2 had little effect (Fig. 1B). To determine whether c-Abl and Arg interact in response to other inducers of oxidative stress, wild-type MEFs were treated with menadione, a redox-cycling agent that increases ROS generation (39Klohn P.C. Neumann H.G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1997; 106: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Like H2O2, treatment with 25 μm menadione increased the formation of c-Abl·Arg complexes, whereas exposure to higher concentrations had less of an effect (Fig. 1C, left). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α to induce an endogenous oxidative stress response (40Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar, 41Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Arch R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42728-42736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C,right). As a control, anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates from c-abl−/−, and arg−/−MEFs showed no detectable signals when probed with anti-Arg (Fig.1D, left). As additional controls, anti-c-Abl reacted specifically with c-Abl, whereas anti-Arg reacted specifically with Arg in immunoblot analyses of arg−/− and c-abl−/− MEFs (Fig. 1D,right). To extend these findings, 293 cells were transfected to express Myc-tagged c-Abl (Myc-c-Abl) and FLAG-tagged Arg (FLAG-Arg). Immunoblot analysis of anti-Myc immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG demonstrated detection of complexes containing c-Abl and Arg (Fig.2A). In the reciprocal experiment, immunoblot analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-Myc provided further support for the association of c-Abl and Arg in cells (Fig. 2B). To define the kinetics of the interaction between c-Abl and Arg, the parameters for binding of Arg were determined using GST-c-Abl immobilized to the sensor chip in a BIAcore. Arg bound to c-Abl with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.05 μm (Fig.2C). These findings demonstrate that c-Abl binds to Arg in the response to oxidative stress and that the interaction is direct. To define the interaction between c-Abl and Arg, lysates from cells expressing FLAG-Arg were incubated with GST or GST fusion proteins containing the c-Abl SH3 or SH2 domains. The results show that FLAG-Arg associates with GST-c-Abl SH3 and not GST-c-Abl SH2 (Fig.3A). To assess whether the interaction between c-Abl SH3 and Arg is direct, the GST fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro translated35S-FLAG-Arg. The finding that GST-c-Abl SH3 associates with 35S-FLAG-Arg supported a direct interaction (Fig.3B). Moreover, the finding that there is no detectable binding of 35S-FLAG-Arg with the c-Abl SH2 domain supported specificity of the c-Abl SH3-Arg interaction (Fig. 3B). Other studies were performed with 35S-labeled Arg(1–501) or Arg(532–1182) to define regions of Arg responsible for binding to c-Abl SH3. The results demonstrate that GST-c-Abl SH3 binds to Arg(532–1182) and not Arg(1–501) (Fig. 3C). Arg(532–1182) contains six proline-rich sequences that could function as binding sites for the c-Abl SH3 domain (Fig. 3D). To define the Arg site(s) responsible for the c-Abl SH3 interaction, FLAG-Arg proteins mutated at each of the PXXP sequences were incubated with GST-c-Abl SH3. Analysis of the adsorbates with anti-FLAG demonstrated that binding of c-Abl SH3 is decreased, but not completely abrogated, with the Arg(P570A/P573A) mutant (Fig. 3D). By contrast, the other Arg mutants had little if any effect on c-Abl SH3 binding (Fig.3D). These findings demonstrate that the c-Abl SH3 domain interacts, at least in part, with the Arg proline-rich site at amino acids 567–576. To assess binding in vivo, lysates from 293 cells expressing FLAG-Arg(1–501) or FLAG-Arg(532–1182) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-c-FLAG demonstrated that c-Abl associates with Arg(1–501) (Fig. 4A,left) and Arg(532–1182) (Fig. 4A,right). In the reciprocal analysis, coexpression of Arg and c-Abl(1–486) or c-Abl(487–1130) demonstrated that Arg associates with the c-Abl N- and C-terminal regions (Fig. 4B). In studies performed with 293 cells expressing Exp-c-Abl(1–486) and Arg(532–1182), immunoblot analysis of anti-Exp immunoprecipitates with anti-Arg also demonstrated association of the c-Abl N-terminal and the Arg C-terminal regions (Fig. 4C). By contrast, when anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from 293 cells expressing FLAG-Arg(1–501) and Exp-c-Abl(1–486) were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Exp, there was no detectable interaction between these N-terminal regions of c-Abl and Arg (data not shown). Moreover, in similar experiments performed on 293 cells expressing FLAG-Arg(532–1182) and Exp-c-Abl(487–1130), there was no apparent association of these c-Abl and Arg C-terminal regions (data not shown). Taken together with thein vitro binding data, the results demonstrate that the c-Abl SH3 domain interacts with the Arg C-terminal region and that the c-Abl C-terminal region interacts with the Arg N-terminal region. To determine whether the Arg SH3 domain binds to c-Abl, GST-Arg SH3 was incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled FLAG-c-Abl. The results demonstrate that Arg SH3 binds directly to c-Abl (Fig. 5A). To extend this finding, we generated a c-Abl C-terminal (amino acids 487–1130) fragment. The results demonstrate that GST-Arg SH3 binds to35S-labeled c-Abl(487–1130) (Fig. 5B). These findings indicate that, in addition to binding of c-Abl SH3 to the Arg C terminus, a direct interaction between Arg SH3 and the c-Abl C-terminal region contributes to the formation of c-Abl·Arg complexes (Fig. 5C). To determine whether Arg is a substrate for c-Abl, in vitrotranslated/heat-inactivated Arg was incubated with a 45-kDa kinase-active Abl and [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products demonstrated that Abl phosphorylates the 145-kDa Arg protein (Fig. 6A). To assess tyrosine phosphorylation of Arg in vivo, a kinase-inactive FLAG-Arg(K-R) mutant was expressed in 293 cells. Immunoblot analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) demonstrated that ectopically expressed Arg is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 6B). To confirm that Arg is phosphorylated by c-Abl in cells, c-abl−/− and c-abl+ cells were infected with a retrovirus expressing FLAG-Arg(K-R). Immunoblot analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of FLAG-Arg(K-R) is substantially higher in c-abl+ compared with c-abl−/− cells (Fig. 6C). These findings indicate that Arg is phosphorylated, at least in large part, by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. To assess involvement of c-Abl and Arg in the response of cells to ROS, cells were studied for H2O2-induced apoptosis. Compared with MCF-7 cells expressing the empty vector, treatment of MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells with 250 μmH2O2 resulted in an attenuated apoptotic response (Fig. 7A). Similar findings were obtained in MCF-7 cells stably expressing Arg(K-R) (Fig.7A). In studies of MEFs, c-abl−/−cells exhibited little if any apoptosis in response to treatment with 40 or 250 μm H2O2 (Fig.7B). The finding that stable expression of c-Abl in the c-abl−/− cells reconstitutes the apoptotic response to ROS demonstrates dependence on c-Abl (Fig. 7B). The arg−/− cells were also less sensitive to ROS-induced apoptosis compared with arg+ cells (Fig. 7B). The results further demonstrate that compared with MCF-7 cells expressing the empty vector, menadione-induced apoptosis is attenuated in MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) and MCF/Arg(K-R) cells (Fig. 7C). Similar results were obtained when these cells were treated with TNF-α (Fig. 7C). By contrast, apoptosis induced by stabilization of microtubules with paclitaxel was unaffected by a expression of c-Abl(K-R) or Arg(K-R) (Fig. 7C). These findings collectively support a model in which both c-Abl and Arg are required for the apoptotic response to oxidative stress. Recent findings that c-Abl and Arg are both activated in the cellular response to oxidative stress suggested that these related proteins may share similar functions (36Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H.

Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The present studies were thus performed to determine whether c-Abl and Arg interact in ROS-induced signaling. The results of coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that endogenous c-Abl and Arg associate in the response to oxidative stress. These findings were confirmed by showing the association of ectopically expressed c-Abl and Arg in 293 cells. The results further demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg interact directly. The in vitro findings support direct binding of the c-Abl SH3 domain to a proline-rich site (amino acids 567–576) in the Arg C-terminal region. By contrast, there was no detectable binding of the c-Abl SH3 domain to the Arg N-terminal region. In concert with these results, expression of c-Abl(1–486) and Arg(572–1182) confirmed that the c-Abl N-terminal region associates with the Arg C-terminal region in cells. In addition, binding of c-Abl to the Arg(P570A/P573A) mutant was decreased compared with that found for wild-type Arg. The results also demonstrate that the Arg SH3 domain associates with the c-Abl C-terminal region. In concert with an interaction between c-Abl and Arg, we demonstrate that Arg functions as an in vitro substrate for c-Abl phosphorylation. Moreover, the results show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Arg in cells expressing c-Abl is substantially higher than that found in c-abl−/− cells. These findings demonstrate that c-Abl forms heterodimers with Arg in vivo by mechanisms involving intermolecular binding of the respective SH3 domains and C-terminal regions (Fig. 5C) and that Arg is phosphorylated by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. Certain insights into the involvement of c-Abl in the response of cells to oxidative stress came from the finding that ROS induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase Cδ (34Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujji M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In an apparent feedback mechanism, protein kinase Cδ activates c-Abl, and, in turn, c-Abl phosphorylates protein kinase Cδ on Tyr-512 (35Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Activation of c-Abl is associated with targeting to mitochondria, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and induction of apoptosis (36Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17281-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Arg is also activated in the oxidative stress response and contributes to the induction of apoptosis by interacting with the proapoptotic Siva-1 protein (38Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that oxidative stress induces the formation of c-Abl·Arg heterodimers. Moreover, the findings show that binding of c-Abl and Arg is dependent on the concentration of H2O2. Thus, treatment with 10 to greater than 160 μm H2O2 was associated with increases in c-Abl·Arg heterodimers, whereas treatment with 640 μm H2O2 resulted in binding of c-Abl and Arg at a level found in control cells. The finding that menadione and TNF-α also induce the formation of c-Abl·Arg heterodimers is in concert with the effects of these agents on redox cycling and ROS generation (39Klohn P.C. Neumann H.G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1997; 106: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 41Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Arch R.H. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Abl and Arg form heterodimers in response to diverse agents that induce oxidative stress. ROS have been implicated in the regulation of both mitogenic and apoptotic signaling pathways. Mitogenic signals induced by growth factors or activated Ras are mediated through ROS production (42Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T.

Other work has indicated that ROS induce topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of chromosomal DNA and thereby apoptosis (44Li T. Chen A. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.

Moreover, p53-induced apoptosis is mediated by ROS-dependent mechanisms (44Li T. Chen A. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.

The present results provide support for involvement of both c-Abl and Arg in the apoptotic response to oxidative stress. Stable expression of either kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) or Arg(K-R) blocked H2O2-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. In concert with these findings, the apoptotic response of MEFs to H2O2-induced oxidative stress was attenuated by targeted disruption of either c-abl or arg. Menadione- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis was also attenuated by expression of c-Abl(K-R) or Arg(K-R). The present results also demonstrate that, in contrast to oxidative stress, both c-Abl and Arg are dispensable for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. These findings thus provide the first evidence that c-Abl and Arg form heterodimers and that both c-Abl and Arg are required for the apoptotic response to oxidative stress.

Arguments are provided that the structures reported here are representative of a productive enzyme·NAD·d-G3P complex in the ground state (Michaelis complex). glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 3-dPG, 1,3-diphosphoglycerate polyethylene glycol Phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDH)1 are tetrameric enzymes that catalyze reversibly the oxidative phosphorylation ofd-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (d-G3P) into 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-dPG) in the presence of cofactor NAD(P) via a two-step chemical mechanism. This mechanism has been well documented for the homotetrameric GAPDHs involved in glycolysis (1Harris J.I. Waters M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-49Google Scholar). First, the acylation step leads to the formation of a thioacylenzyme intermediate and NADH. This step includes: 1) the binding of d-G3P to the binary complex GAPDH·NAD; 2) the formation of a covalent thiohemiacetal intermediate with d-G3P; and 3) the hydride transfer from the thiohemiacetal intermediate toward the C-4 position of the nicotinamide ring of NAD. Second, the phosphorylation step consists of a nucleophilic attack of inorganic phosphate toward the thioacylenzyme intermediate that leads to formation of 1,3-dPG. This step, which is rate-limiting, includes the binding of inorganic phosphate to the enzyme intermediate, possibly preceded by an isomerization step consisting of a replacement of NADH by NAD (2Harrigan P.J. Trenthan D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two amino acids are essential for the chemical mechanism, Cys149 and His176. The high catalytic efficiency of GAPDHs toward d-G3P implies prerequisites with respect to the chemical mechanism. First, Cys149 should be in a thiolate form within the ternary Michaelis complex to efficiently attack the C-1 aldehydic group ofd-G3P. This is ensured in part through the formation of an ion pair with His176, which decreases Cys149 pKapp from 8.0 to 5.9 (3Talfournier F. Colloc'h N. Mornon J.P. Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Second, the hydride transfer should be efficient. This is assisted by His176, which plays the role of a base catalyst. Moreover, the different intermediates and transition states, including the Michaelis complex, GAPDH·NAD·d-G3P, and the thioacylenzyme intermediate, should be stabilized within the active site. This is likely another role for His176(Fig. 1). The chemical nature of the substrates, G3P and inorganic phosphate, and the product, 1,3-dPG, implies the presence of two anion recognition sites in GAPDHs. These two anion binding sites have been tentatively identified within the active site from the location of two sulfate ions coming from the crystallization medium (4Moras D. Olsen K.W. Sabesan M.N. Buehner M. Ford G.C. Rossmann M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9137-9162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of model building of the lobster GAPDH thiohemiacetal intermediate, these two anion binding sites were postulated to correspond to those binding the C-3 phosphate group of d-G3P (Pssite) and the inorganic phosphate ion (Pi site) (4Moras D. Olsen K.W. Sabesan M.N. Buehner M. Ford G.C. Rossmann M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9137-9162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all bacterial and eukaryotic GAPDHs, the Ps site is composed of the side chains of residues Arg231 and Thr179 and the 2′-hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose when NAD is bound; the Pi site includes the side chains of residues Ser148 and Thr208 and the main chain nitrogen of Gly209. The Ps site has been found to occupy an identical location in all the crystal structures of eukaryotic and bacterial GAPDHs solved so far (4Moras D. Olsen K.W. Sabesan M.N. Buehner M. Ford G.C.

Hannaert V. Oliva G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). But, the “true” location of the Pi site remains a matter of debate. Indeed, depending on the considered structure, the β-strand-loop-α helix segment containing residues 206–210 (called loop 206–210) has been observed in two different conformations, giving rise to two alternative locations for the Pi site. The most common conformation is the one found in the holoenzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), whereas a second conformation is observed for instance in the holostructure from Leishmania mexicana and generates a Pi site that is located closer to the catalytic Cys149 residue and 2.9 Å away from the former position (9Kim H. Feil I.K. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Petra P.H. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14975-14986Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The contribution of the Ps and Pi sites during the two steps of the catalytic mechanism also remains a matter of debate. Taking into account the revised orientation of the side chain of His176 in the refined holostructure of B. stearothermophilus GAPDH, Skarzynski et al. (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) noticed that it was no longer possible to build a reasonable model of the hemithioacetal with its C-3 phosphate bound in the Ps site. They proposed that although the Pi site must be the location of the inorganic phosphate in the phosphorylation step, the C-3 phosphate of the substrate would bind first to the Pisite in the acylation step and then flip from the Pi site to the Ps site in the phosphorylation step. This hypothesis was supported by: 1) the inspection of the crystal structure of a ternary covalent complex, GAPDH·NAD·glycidol 3-phosphate, fromB. stearothermophilus, which localizes the C-3 phosphate of the inhibitor within the Pi site (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); and also 2) kinetic analyses showing that substitution of Arg231 of the Ps site with glycine or leucine does not significantly affect the first-order rate constants of the overall oxidoreduction step (15Corbier C. Michels S. Wonacott A.J. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in the Pi site decrease this constant 4–7-fold (mutants T150A and T208A, respectively; see Ref.16Michels S. Rogalska E. Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The recent structure of a binary complex between Escherichia coli apoGAPDH and d-G3P, in which the C-3 phosphate group of the substrate is bound in the so-called “new Pisite,” also supports this hypothesis (17Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Park H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10702-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present study, the crystal structures of two mutant GAPDHs fromB. stearothermophilus in complex with the physiological substrate, d-G3P, have been determined at 2.0–2.2 Å resolution with the aim of evaluating the different hypotheses on the contribution of both Ps and Pi sites along the catalytic pathway. For this purpose, the active site Cys149 residue has been substituted by Ala and Ser. The C149A mutant GAPDH is inactive, whereas the C149S mutant GAPDH possesses a low residual activity (18Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). New crystallization conditions have been set up in the absence of any anions to avoid competitive binding with the C-3 phosphate of d-G3P. The structures presented here constitute the first example of ternary complexes mimicking the Michaelis complex, wild-type GAPDH·NAD·d-G3P. The results strongly suggest that the C-3 phosphate of d-G3P binds to the Ps site at least in the Michaelis ternary complex. Overexpression and purification of C149S mutant GAPDH were carried out by a procedure similar to that described earlier (18Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For C149A mutant GAPDH, overexpression was carried out in E. coli HB101 strain (supE44, hsdS20 (r−, m−), recA13, ara-14,proA2, lacY1, galK2,rpsL20, xyl-5, mtl-1) transformed with a pBluescriptII-derived plasmid containing the gapA gene ofB. stearothermophilus under the control of thelac promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Purification of C149A mutant GAPDH was performed as described previously for otherB. stearothermophilus mutant GAPDHs (3Talfournier F. Colloc'h N. Mornon J.P. Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that a supplementary step was added to separate the B. stearothermophilus mutant GAPDH totally from the wild-typeE. coli GAPDH produced by the HB101 cells. For this, enzyme solution was applied onto a phenyl-Superose HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Tris-HCl 50 mm, EDTA 2 mm, (NH4)2SO4 1.7m, pH 8 buffer, followed by a linear gradient from 1.7 to 0.7 m (NH4)2SO4. Under these conditions, C149A mutant B. stearothermophilus GAPDH was eluted at 1070 mm(NH4)2SO4, and E. coliGAPDH at 850 mm. Both mutant GAPDHs were isolated as apoforms, as judged by theA280/A260 ratio of 2. The purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. Thermostatted sample holders using a circulating water bath for all of the measurements maintained the temperature of the solutions at 25 °C. The experimental conditions were 1 mm, d,l-G3P and 1 mm NAD in 40 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm K2HPO4buffer, pH 8.9. Protein concentrations were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.17.105m−1 cm−1. Activities were expressed per monomer in s−1. Crystals of the binary complexes I and II (C149A GAPDH·NAD and C149S GAPDH·NAD) were obtained at 293 K using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique (19MacPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Molecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1999: 165-167Google Scholar). Crystals of the C149A mutant protein were grown from a solution composed of 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 0.1 msodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1.5 mm NAD, whereas the C149S mutant protein crystallized in quite similar conditions but in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and with 10% (w/v) PEG 4000 as the precipitating agent. Ternary complexes I and II (C149A GAPDH·NAD·d-G3P and C149S GAPDH·NAD·d-G3P) were obtained by soaking the crystals for 10 min in the crystallization solution containing 1.9 mmd,l-G3P. The crystals were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen by using 25% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentadiol as a cryoprotectant. The four data sets were collected at 110 K on an area detector (DIP2030) with a Phi goniometer using CuKα radiation from a rotating anode generator (Model FR591, Nonius B. V.). The data sets were processed and scaled with the HKL suite (20Otwinowski Z,. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Binary complex I crystallized in space group P3121 with one homotetramer/asymmetric unit. The crystal of the monoclinic binary complex II belongs to space group C2 and contains two independent dimers in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2). The crystals of binary complex I and of ternary complex I diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution, whereas the crystals of binary complex II and ternary complex II diffracted to 2.1 and 2.0 Å, respectively.

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) using the wild-type holostructure (Protein Data Bank code 1gd1) as the starting model and data from the 10 to 5 Å resolution range. Cycles of refinement (crystallography NMR software (CNS) (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunsteleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

TURBO-FRODO, Silicon Graphics Applications Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar)) and inclusion of higher resolution data were carried out to improve the models. Finally, the ordered water molecules were added. Each peak contoured at 3ς in the Fo − Fc maps was identified as a water molecule, provided that hydrogen bonds would be allowed between this site and the protein. The models were then adjusted and refined up to a final convergence, using all of the reflections (sigma cut-off = 0.0) with R and R-free values of 17.7 and 21.0%, respectively, for the C149A binary complex and 19.8 and 24.9% for the C149S binary complex (Table I). The ternary complexes were refined from the final models of the binary complexes using an identical procedure. The R and R-free values were 18.0 and 21.4%, respectively, for the C149A ternary complex and 19.3 and 23.5% for the C149S ternary complex (Table I). The geometry of the models was checked with PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Statistics concerning the geometry of the final models are given in Table I. All non-glycine residues are located in favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot (25Ramakrisknan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), except Asp186 and Val237, which belong to external loops and have side chains that are very well defined in the (2Fo −Fc) density maps. The location of these residues outside the allowed regions has already been noticed in the crystal structures of GAPDHs isolated from other sources (11Duée E. Olivier-Deyris L. Fanchon E. Corbier C. Branlant G. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 814-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The coordinates and the structure factors of the binary and ternary complexes have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank at Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (ID codes 1NPT, 1NQ5, 1NQA, and 1NQO). Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 were drawn with MOLMOL (26Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) or TURBO-FRODO (23Roussel P.A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO, Silicon Graphics Applications Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). The B. stearothermophilus C149A mutant GAPDH was overproduced in E. coli cells, purified, and separated from the E. coli GAPDH by taking advantage of its lower hydrophobicity. This separation was accompanied by a drastic diminution of the activity from 5.10−4 s−1 to less than 1.10−6s−1. This result clearly shows that the C149A mutant GAPDH displays no significant dehydrogenase activity in contrast to theE. coli C149A mutant GAPDH, which was shown to display a significant non-phosphorylating activity (27Corbier C. Della-Seta F. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12532-12535Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This finding suggests subtle structural differences between the active sites of E. coli and B. stearothermophilus GAPDHs (see below). On the other hand, the C149S mutant GAPDH displayed, as already published (18Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a low but significant phosphorylating dehydrogenase activity with a kcat of 8.10−3s−1. All GAPDH structures solved thus far share a common conserved fold composed of a NAD(P) binding domain and a catalytic domain. The enzyme is active as a homotetramer in which four subunits, designated O, P, Q, and R, are related by three perpendicular 2-fold axes, P, Q, and R (for nomenclature, see Ref. 28Buehner M. Ford G.C. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Rossman M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 82: 563-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with the choice of the first monomer for denomination “O” being arbitrary. Because the crystals of the wild-type holoenzyme fromB. stearothermophilus (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) had been obtained in the presence of ammonium sulfate, which could have competed with the substrate for the binding to the anion recognition sites, new crystallization conditions had to be set up for the present study. Two new crystal forms have been obtained using PEG 4000 as the precipitant. The crystals of the binary complex C149A GAPDH·NAD (binary complex I) are trigonal and contain one typical homotetramer per asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit of the monoclinic crystals obtained from the binary complex C149S GAPDH·NAD (binary complex II) is composed of two independent dimers (Fig. 2). Although having a different orientation, these two dimers are equivalent and were thus called OQ and O′Q′. Two biological tetramers (called A and B) were generated from these dimers OQ and O′Q′ by using the crystallographic 2-fold axis. In tetramer A, the crystallographic axis is along the 2-fold axis P, whereas in tetramer B, it corresponds to the R axis. A striking feature of this monoclinic form is the high compactness of the tetramers in the unit cell (Matthews coefficient, (VM = 2.19 Å3/Da)) when compared with the trigonal form (VM = 2.92 Å3/Da). No significant structural differences are observed between the four monomers within each asymmetric unit. In the binary I and binary II complexes, the mean root-mean-square values obtained from the different pairwise superimpositions of the Cα atoms are 0.26 and 0.30 Å, respectively. For the ternary I and ternary II complexes, these values are 0.26 and 0.31 Å, respectively. In the four monomers of the binary or ternary complexes, the NAD molecule is well defined in the (2Fo − Fc) electron density maps (Fig. 3) and possesses average temperature factors similar to those of the protein (TableI). Because the structure of the wild-type holoenzyme revealed a quasi-perfect 222 symmetry (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the least-squares superimpositions involving the 334 Cα atoms of subunit O of the wild-type holoenzyme were realized with each subunit of the two binary complexes. The resulting root-mean-square differences are less than 0.45 Å, showing that the overall structures of the binary I and binary II complexes are very close to that of the wild-type holoenzyme. The largest differences mainly concern either solvent-exposed loops or regions involved in different contacts with symmetry-related molecules. In addition, differences can be noted for loop 206–210. This loop is located in the vicinity of the Pi site, which is “empty” in both the binary I and binary II complexes, whereas the side chain of Thr208 and the main chain nitrogen of Gly209 are directly involved in the binding of a sulfate anion in the structure of the wild-type holoenzyme (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The displacement of residues 206–210 range from 0.2 to 1.1Å depending on the subunit. Furthermore, the average temperature factors calculated for all the atoms of the loop is 5 Å2 higher than the average B-factor calculated for all the atoms of the subunit. These differences in B-values are not observed in the wild-type holostructure, in which the presence of the sulfate anion bound at the Pi site could stabilize the conformation of this loop. Nevertheless, the amplitude of the displacement remains small and insignificant when compared with that observed for the E. coli GAPDH·G3P binary complex (17Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y. Park H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10702-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present work, the main conformation of loop 206–210 is rather similar to that observed in the structure of B. stearothermophilus wild-type GAPDH (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), as confirmed by omit maps (not shown) calculated in this region. Therefore, the Pi site must still be structurally competent to bind sulfate (or phosphate) even if the Pi site does not contain any sulfate anion in the mutant structures, because of the crystallization conditions used in this study. In both binary complexes, a broad electron density peak, identified as a sulfate ion, is observed within the Ps site. Because the crystallization trials have been conducted in the absence of sulfate, this anion arises most probably from the ammonium fractionation step of the purification and has not been eliminated despite the extensive dialyses carried out prior to the crystallization experiments. The comparisons of each ternary complex with its corresponding binary complex give root-mean-square differences of less than 0.12 Å showing that no significant conformational changes have been induced upond-G3P binding. The analysis of the (Fo − Fc) maps of the two ternary complexes clearly revealed a peak of electronic density corresponding to the substrate d-G3P (Fig.4). The substrate adopts the same conformation in both structures and shares almost the same interactions with the enzyme (TableII). It is bound in a non-covalent way, its C-3 phosphate being positioned within the Ps site (Fig.5), whereas the Pi site is devoid of density. The oxygen atoms of the C-3 phosphate group form hydrogen bonds with the conserved side chains of the residues Arg231 and Thr179 of the Ps site and with the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose adjacent to the nicotinamide of NAD (Table II, Fig. 5). In the holostructure of the wild-type enzyme (7Skarzynski T. Moody P.C.E. Wonacott J.A. J. Mol.

This water molecule is present in the ternary complex I (WAT-440, see Table II) but is not found in the ternary complex II, although Arg195 occupies the same position as in the wild-type structure and in ternary complex I.

Although nitric oxide can block caspase-3 activation and promote cell survival, it can also induce apoptosis. We hypothesized that nitrosothiols that promote protein S-nitrosylation would reduce caspase-3 activation and cell survival, whereas nitric oxide donors (such as 1-propamine 3-(2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhydrazine (PAPA) NONOate and diethylamine (DEA) NONOate) that do not target thiol residues would not. Using human monocytes as a model, we observed that nitrosothiol donors S-nitrosoglutathione and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine suppressed caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, PAPA or DEA NONOate did not promote monocyte survival events and appeared to inhibit monocyte survival induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The caspase-3-selective inhibitor DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone reversed DNA fragmentation events, and the caspase-9 inhibitor LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone reversed caspase-3 activity in monocytes treated with PAPA or DEA NONOate in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These results were not caused by differences in glutathione levels or the kinetics of nitric oxide release. Moreover, S-nitrosoglutathione and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine directly blocked the activity of recombinant caspase-3, which was reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol, whereas PAPA or DEA NONOate did not block the enzymatic activity of caspase-3.

In contrast to cellular necrosis, apoptosis is an energy-requiring, non-inflammatory mechanism of programmed cell death. The apoptotic pathway can be extrinsic or intrinsic. The extrinsic pathway is regulated by cell receptors such as Fas, which is in the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Once clustered by Fas ligand, Fas activation leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling pathway (DISC). This complex contains the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain protein and cysteinyl-aspartic acid protease (caspase)-8 and caspase-10, which can activate cellular apoptosis. In type I cells, caspase-8 activation directly activates downstream caspases, resulting in cellular apoptosis. In contrast, type II cells rely on an amplification loop where caspase-8 cleaves and activates the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, inducing the release of cytochrome c and Diablo from the mitochondria. These events lead to caspase-3 activation, which induces the execution of cellular apoptosis. Moreover, active caspase-3 activates caspase-8, further amplifying this feedback loop. In contrast to the Fas receptor system, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c interacts with procaspase-9, APAF-1, and ATP to liberate active caspase-9. Active caspase-9 cleaves and activates caspase-3, leading to cellular apoptosis. As a family, these caspases exist as inactive procaspase zymogens that require activation by proteolytic or autocatalytic cleavage. Processing and activation of upstream caspases such as caspase-8 and/or caspase-9 lead to activation of executioner caspase-3, -6, and -7, which are responsible for the characteristic changes associated with apoptosis such as membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. Caspase-3 is a primary executioner caspase and inactivates ICAD (inhibitor caspase-activateddeoxyribonuclease) to induce the cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments (5Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These cysteine proteases are described as mammalian homologs to Caenorhabditis elegans CED-3 (C.elegansdeath gene3), originally discovered to be involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death (3Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 4Thornberry N.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide promotes cell survival by blocking caspase-3 activation byS-nitrosylating the cysteine residue in the catalytic site of caspase-3 (6Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been suggested that the binding of Fas to Fas ligand induces apoptosis by denitrosylating and activating caspase-3, providing a causal link between nitric oxide and cell survival (6Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Consistent with a key role for nitric oxide effects on caspase-3 function, S-nitrosylation of Cys-163 by nitric oxide specifically inhibits caspase-3 enzymatic activity (7Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Thus,S-nitrosylation is widely believed to be the primary mechanism by which nitric oxide prevents caspase-3 cleavage. Because certain nitric oxide donors such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)1 and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) promoteS-nitrosylation by transferring nitrosyl groups to protein thiol residues (8Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), we speculated that these nitrosothiol donors would reduce caspase-3 activation and promote survival of human monocytes. Paradoxically, nitric oxide can also induce apoptosis in certain cells (9Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 10Brune B. Sandau K.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The specific mechanism for this effect is not clear; however, nitric oxide reacts rapidly with superoxide (O2⨪) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (12Deiana M. Aruoma O.I. Bianchi M.D.P. Spencer J.P.E.

The monocyte survival factor macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) induces reactive oxygen species production (15Bhatt N.Y. Kelley T.W. Khramtsov V.V. Wang Y. Lam G.K. Clanton T.L. Marsh C.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and relies on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor to activate signaling pathways. We speculated that nitric oxide donors (such as 1-propamine 3-(2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhydrazine) (PAPA) NONOate and diethylamine (DEA) NONOate) that do not target thiol residues would interrupt phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues and reduce monocyte survival induced by M-CSF. Consistent with these hypotheses, we found that the nitrosothiol donors GSNO and SNAP inhibited caspase-3 activity and reduced DNA fragmentation in human monocytes, whereas the nitric oxide donors PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate did not consistently reduce caspase-3 activation or DNA fragmentation. Homeostasis of blood monocytes by these donors appeared to involve the activation state of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and correlated to modification of thiol residues by nitric oxide. RPMI 1640 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Fetal calf serum was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). GSNO and SNAP was obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PAPA NONOate was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). DEA NONOate was obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant human M-CSF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody used is a 30:30:1 ratio of clonal antibodies PY72, PY20, and 4G10 obtained from Dr. Bart Sefton (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-caspase-3 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The caspase inhibitors DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (FMK) and LEHD-FMK and the fluorogenic substrates DEVD-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) and LEHD-AFC were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). The active recombinant human caspase-3 enzyme was purchased from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Monocytes were isolated from buffy coats obtained from the American Red Cross according to a method described previously (16Kelley T.W. Graham M.M. Doseff A.I. Pomerantz R.W. Lau S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Franke T.F. Marsh C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26393-26398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For DNA fragmentation analysis, nitric oxide measurement, and caspase 3-like activity measurement, monocytes (5 × 106/sample) were treated in the indicated conditions immediately after monocyte isolation. In signaling experiments for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, monocytes were resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml of RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml polymyxin B, and 20 ng/ml recombinant human M-CSF. After 24 h in culture, the cells were serum-starved for 2 h, treated for 1 h with the indicated nitric oxide donors, and stimulated for 2 min with 100 ng/ml M-CSF. Apoptotic DNA fragments were purified using DNA isolation kits (Suicide-Track DNA isolation kit, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA). DNA fragments were resolved by 1.6% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA bands were visualized by staining with Syber Green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The DNA fragments were analyzed on a digital gel documentation system (Gel-Doc 1000, Bio-Rad). Apoptosis was measured by using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis dectection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmingen). Samples were analyzed by a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Monocytes were cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with the following NO donors at 2 μm to 2 mm concentrations: GSNO, SNAP, DEA NONOate, and PAPA NONOate. Nitrate and nitrite in the cultured supernatants were injected into a collection chamber and reduced to nitric oxide by VCl3 in 1 n HCl. The nitric oxide reacted with ozone, producing a chemiluminescent signal that was measured by a nitric oxide analyzer (Sievers NOA 280). Monocytes were collected by centrifugation and washed with KPM buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm PIPES, 10 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B, and a 2 μg/ml concentration of each the following protease inhibitors: chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain). The cell suspension was lysed by four cycles of freezing and thawing. The cytosolic protein was obtained after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The extracts were incubated with the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AFC for caspase-3-like activity or with LEHD-AFC for caspase-9 activity in a cyto-buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm PIPES, pH 7, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm DTT and 20 μm DEVD-AFC as previously described (16Kelley T.W. Graham M.M. Doseff A.I. Pomerantz R.W. Lau S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Franke T.F. Marsh C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26393-26398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For experiments using the active recombinant human caspase-3 enzyme, the NO donors were incubated with the protein at one-seventh of their half-lives in an attempt to control for the varying half-lives of the different nitric oxide donors, except GSNO. Because of its extremely long half-life, GSNO was incubated with recombinant caspase-3 at 1/242 of its half-life. DTT was omitted from KPM buffer to prevent denitrosylation of recombinant human caspase-3. DTT was added to the indicated samples for 15 min prior to measurement of caspase-3 activity to reverse S-NO formation. All conditions were assayed for caspase-3 activity by measuring the release of free AFC as determined with a Cytofluor 4000 fluorometer (filters, excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm; PerSeptive Diagnostics, Ramingham, MA). Stimulated samples were left on ice for 15 min in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of protein were used for each immunoprecipitation or whole cell lysate as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with the mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody mixture overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen), the immune complexes attached to the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the agarose beads and whole cell lysates and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 1× Tris-buffered saline and 1% Tween and probed with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. The membrane was evaluated by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were prepared as described (17Sen C.K. Roy S. Khanna S. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Glutathione was separated using a C18 column and detected using an HPLC colorimetric electrode array detector (Coularray Detector Model 5600 with 12 channels, ESA Inc., Chelmsford, MA). The mobile phase consisted of 50 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5 mm octanosulfonic acid, and 3% acetonitrile at pH 2.7 (18Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 using analysis of variance with post hoc testing (Minitab, College Park, PA). The spontaneous apoptosis of human monocytes appears to be partly regulated by the activation of caspase-3 (1Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). GSNO has been shown to S-nitrosylate the critical cysteine residue in the catalytic domain of caspase-3 to inhibit caspase-3 activation and to facilitate cell survival (6Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that nitrosothiol donors such as GSNO would suppress caspase-3 activation and facilitate cell survival. The nitrosothiol donor GSNO suppressed DNA fragmentation events (Fig. 1A) and inhibited the activation of native caspase-3 (Fig. 1B). Low concentrations of DEA NONOate and PAPA NONOate also reduced caspase-3 activation in human monocytes (Fig. 1, C and D), but did not appear to reduce DNA fragmentation. Higher concentrations of DEA NONOate and PAPA NONOate resulted in caspase-3 activation, whereas similar concentrations of GSNO did not. Compared with non-stimulated cells staining positive for annexin V/propidium iodide, GSNO and SNAP reduced annexin V/propidium iodide staining (p < 0.01 non-stimulatedversus GSNO or SNAP; non-stimulated, 84.8 ± 2.3%; GSNO, 39.8 ± 10.1%; SNAP, 53.2 ± 0.76%), whereas PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate did not (p > 0.4 non-stimulated versus PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate; non-stimulated, 84.3 ± 2.3%; PAPA NONOate, 71.52 ± 5.6%; DEA NONOate, 80.46 ± 6.6%). Previously, we demonstrated that M-CSF promotes the survival of human monocytes (15Bhatt N.Y. Kelley T.W. Khramtsov V.V. Wang Y. Lam G.K. Clanton T.L. Marsh C.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate would reverse the suppression of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation promoted by M-CSF in human monocytes. We found that PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate independently induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation in M-CSF-stimulated human monocytes (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast to the effects of PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate, GSNO did not promote DNA fragmentation or the activation of native caspase-3 in parallel samples of M-CSF-stimulated monocytes (Fig. 2, C and D). Because GSNO is an S-nitrosoglutathione, we first examined the possibility that enhanced glutathione stores resulting from treatment with GSNO in monocytes were responsible for differences seen between GSNO and NONOates. We found that intracellular glutathione levels were decreased in monocytes treated with PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate in the absence of M-CSF (Fig. 3A). However, replenishing intracellular glutathione withN-acetylcysteine (Fig. 3B) did not inhibit caspase-3 activation by these nitric oxide donors and even appeared to enhance caspase-3 activity in monocytes treated with M-CSF or GSNO (Fig. 3C). To ensure that the protective effect of GSNO was not related solely to increased glutathione levels donated by GSNO, we also used the nitrosothiol donor SNAP, which does not generate glutathione. Similar to GSNO, SNAP reduced DNA fragmentation over a 24-h period and reduced the activation of native caspase-3 in human monocytes (Fig. 4, A and B).Figure 4The nitrosothiol SNAP also blocks DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity in human monocytes. A, monocytes (5 × 106) were left non-stimulated (NS) or were treated with the Me2SO (DMSO) solvent control and assayed for DNA fragmentation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were treated with the nitric oxide donors SNAP and GSNO (20 and 200 μm and 2 mm). B, monocytes were incubated with the above controls and with 2 mm SNAP or GSNO. Lysates were assayed for caspase-3 activity by measuring the caspase-3 substrate DEVD-AFC. These data are representative of two separate experiments. ‡, p < 0.02 versusnon-stimulated and Me2SO controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next wanted to determine whether the dichotomous effects of the nitric oxide donors could be explained by quantitative differences in nitric oxide release by the donors. We found that, although GSNO blocked the activation of caspase-3, it produced less nitric oxide than DEA NONOate and PAPA NONOate measured at 24 h (TableI). To ensure that the higher amounts of nitric oxide delivered by DEA NONOate or PAPA NONOate did not independently injure the cells, lower concentrations of PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate were measured at 24 h (TableII), and they did not consistently prevent the activation of caspase-3 (Fig.5). Of note, using these lower concentrations of nitric oxide donors, only SNAP significantly suppressed caspase-3 activity.Table INitric oxide production in human monocytesNO donorNitric oxide productionμmNon-stimulated15.53 ± 4.43M-CSF, 100 ng/ml23.56 ± 0.59GSNO1-ap < 0.05; differences among GSNO, PAPA NONOate, and DEA NONOate compared with non-stimulated and M-CSF controls. 0.5 mm234.85 ± 17.50 1.0 mm512.12 ± 35.12 1.5 mm914.53 ± 73.00PAPA NONOate1-ap < 0.05; differences among GSNO, PAPA NONOate, and DEA NONOate compared with non-stimulated and M-CSF controls.,1-bp < 0.05; differences in DEA NONOate and PAPA NONOate compared with GSNO at equal concentrations of nitric oxide donor (0.5–1.5 mm). 0.5 mm677.3 ± 100.70 1.0 mm1294.44 ± 155.90 1.5 mm1988.68 ± 238.80DEA NONOate1-ap < 0.05; differences among GSNO, PAPA NONOate, and DEA NONOate compared with non-stimulated and M-CSF controls.,1-bp < 0.05; differences in DEA NONOate and PAPA NONOate compared with GSNO at equal concentrations of nitric oxide donor (0.5–1.5 mm). 0.5 mm830.60 ± 122.38 1.0 mm1099.912 ± 101.08 1.5 mm1369.71 ± 143.61Monocytes (5 × 106) were incubated for 24 h with the indicated nitric oxide donors in millimolar concentrations, with the exception of M-CSF.

We next sought to explain the mechanism of DEA NONOate and PAPA NONOate suppression of M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. Because we have shown that M-CSF induces reactive oxygen species production in monocytes (15Bhatt N.Y. Kelley T.W. Khramtsov V.V. Wang Y. Lam G.K. Clanton T.L. Marsh C.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we speculated that nitric oxide combined with reactive oxygen species forms peroxynitrite and suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation events in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes. As predicted, we found that each of the three nitric oxide donors reduced tyrosine phosphorylation events in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes (Fig. 6). Because GSNO and DEA NONOate or PAPA NONOate reduced cellular tyrosine phosphorylation events in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes, but only GSNO promoted monocyte survival events, we concluded that GSNO promoted cell survival by acting downstream of the receptor. In keeping with this hypothesis, only GSNO and SNAP blocked the cleavage of caspase-3 to its active 17-kDa subunit at 24 h of incubation, whereas cells incubated with DEA NONOate or PAPA NONOate or incubated alone did not (Fig.7A). The 17-kDa subunit was also measured by densitometry (Fig. 7B). In addition to reducing the activation of caspase-3, we next wanted to determine whether the nitrosothiol donors GSNO and SNAP could also interrupt the biological activity of active caspase-3. This prediction was based on the finding that the active cysteine site of caspase-3, which can be modified via S-nitrosylation, influences the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 (7Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first determined the kinetics of active recombinant caspase-3 and found that this enzyme spontaneously lost biological activity quickly after 15 min, but stabilized between 30 and 90 min of incubation (Fig. 8A). Using a time point of 40 min, we then added the nitric oxide donors SNAP, PAPA NONOate, and DEA NONOate at one-seventh of their respective half-lives and GSNO at 1/242 of its half-life. GSNO and SNAP reduced the enzymatic activity of active recombinant caspase-3, whereas DEA and PAPA NONOate did not (Fig. 8B). To determine whether the direct inhibition of caspase-3 by GSNO and SNAP was due to modification of the sulfhydryl group, the reducing agent dithiothreitol was added to remove NO modification of thiol residues by nitric oxide. In the presence of GSNO or SNAP, DTT restored caspase-3 enzymatic activity, suggesting that GSNO and SNAP modify active recombinant caspase-3 by S-nitrosylation of the active caspase (Fig. 8C). Because GSNO and SNAP appeared to reduce DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 in human monocytes, we next wanted to determine whether caspase-3 activation was involved in promoting DNA fragmentation in PAPA NONOate- and DEA NONOate-treated monocytes. The caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-FMK reduced oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes treated with DEA NONOate or PAPA NONOate (Fig. 9). To evaluate the role of caspase-9 in this pathway, we found that GSNO and SNAP also suppressed the activation of caspase-9 in human monocytes (Fig. 10A). Moreover, the caspase-9-selective inhibitor LEHD-FMK inhibited caspase-3 activation in monocytes incubated with PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate (Fig.10B), suggesting that caspase-3 is regulated by caspase-9 in this pathway.Figure 10GSNO and SNAP reduce caspase-9 activation, and blocking caspase-9 activation inhibits caspase-3 activity in monocytes treated with PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate. A, monocytes (5 × 106/condition) were incubated with 1.0 mm GSNO, 1.0 mm SNAP, 0.5 mm PAPA NONOate, or 0.5 mm DEA NONOate for 24 h. These concentrations of NO donors gave more equivalent concentrations of NO at 24 h.

Incubating human monocytes with the nitrosothiol donors GSNO and SNAP suppressed the activation of native caspase-3, reduced the enzymatic activity of active recombinant caspase-3, and reduced DNA fragmentation in monocytes incubated with or without M-CSF. In contrast, incubating parallel samples of these monocytes with the nitric oxide donor PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate, which do not target thiol groups, did not consistently suppress the activation of native caspase-3 or reduce the activity of active recombinant caspase-3. Furthermore, in the presence of M-CSF, PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate induced the activation of native caspase-3 and also induced cytosolic oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, it appears that the ability to donate nitric oxide to protein thiol residues is important in reducing caspase-3 activation and in promoting the survival of human monocytes. To support the hypothesis that the interruption of caspase-3 is important in monocyte survival, we found that the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-FMK blocked DNA fragmentation in monocytes treated with PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate in the presence of M-CSF, suggesting that caspase-3 activation regulates these apoptotic events. Moreover, the caspase-9-selective inhibitor LEHD-FMK suppressed caspase-3 activation in monocytes treated with PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate, suggesting that caspase-9 activation is involved as the upstream activator of caspase-3 in human monocytes. To confirm that caspase-9 is involved in GSNO- or SNAP-induced monocyte survival, we found that treating monocytes with the nitrosothiol donors GSNO and SNAP also suppressed native caspase-9 activity in the absence of M-CSF, suggesting that nitrosothiol donors interrupt the activation of caspase-9 upstream of caspase-3. These data suggest that modulating the activity of caspases is a critical determinant of monocyte survival by the nitrosothiol donors. We considered the possibility that intracellular glutathione depletion by PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate may lead to caspase activation, as glutathione depletion can induce the release of cytochromec, leading to caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation (19Bosca L. Hortelano S. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Other reports suggest that caspase-3 function may be impaired upon depletion of glutathione (20Ogura T. Tatemichi M. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consistent with the possibility that glutathione depletion by PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate promotes caspase-3 activity, monocytes treated with PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate had lower concentrations of intracellular glutathione than monocytes treated with GSNO. However, replenishing glutathione stores usingN-acetylcysteine did not reduce caspase-3 activation in monocytes stimulated with PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate. Moreover, the addition of N-acetylcysteine increased the activation of caspase-3 in GSNO-treated monocytes, suggesting that replenishment of glutathione is not responsible for the observed differences in cell survival mediated by the different nitric oxide donors. To confirm that glutathione is not directly responsible for monocyte survival or apoptosis, we incubated monocytes with the nitrosothiol donor SNAP, which can S-nitrosylate thiol residues without donating glutathione. SNAP also promoted monocyte survival and blocked the activation of caspase-3. We then considered the possibility that quantitative differences in nitric oxide delivered by the different donors determine cell fate and caspase-3 and caspase-9 inhibition. We found that the quantity of nitric oxide produced by GSNO, SNAP, and PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate did not correlate with the inhibition of caspase-9 or caspase-3. To determine the mechanism of caspase-3 inhibition by GSNO or SNAP, we found that these donors blocked the production of the 17-kDa caspase-3 cleavage product in human monocytes. Because these donors also blocked caspase-9 activation in human monocytes, we speculated that nitrosothiol donors inhibit the upstream activation of caspase-3 to block monocyte apoptosis. Interestingly, using active recombinant caspase-3, we found that GSNO and SNAP also blocked enzymatically active caspase-3. We next sought to understand how these nitrosothiol donors are able to block caspase-3 activity and found that the reducing agent DTT, which can regenerate disulfide bonds in modified thiol residues, reversed the effects of these nitrosothiol donors and restored caspase-3 activity. In composite, these data argue that GSNO and SNAP reduce caspase-3 activity by both blocking the upstream activation of caspase-3 by caspase-9 and blocking the biological activity of enzymatically active caspase-3, likely throughS-nitrosylation. We next wanted to understand why PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate did not promote monocyte survival, even though these donors augment theN-nitrosylation of proteins. We previously described that M-CSF stimulation augments the production of reactive oxygen species by human monocytes (15Bhatt N.Y. Kelley T.W. Khramtsov V.V. Wang Y. Lam G.K. Clanton T.L. Marsh C.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We speculated that PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate promote caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation by reducing tyrosine phosphorylation events in monocytes stimulated with M-CSF. Interestingly, we found that PAPA NONOate, DEA NONOate, and GSNO each reduced tyrosine phosphorylation events in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes, suggesting that the protective effects of GSNO are downstream of the receptor. We speculated that it is the ability of GSNO and SNAP to directly suppress caspase-3 activation that differentiates GSNO and SNAP from DEA NONOate or PAPA NONOate in promoting monocyte survival. However, it is also possible that GSNO and SNAP influence other signaling events that result in the suppression of caspase-9 or caspase-3 activation after M-CSF stimulation, and this is being actively investigated in our laboratory. It is interesting to note that, in the absence of M-CSF, PAPA NONOate and DEA NONOate were intermittently able to reduce the activation of caspase-3. These data are very interesting and suggest either that there is some targeting of thiol residues by PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate or that, perhaps more likely, N-nitrosylation events may play some role in caspase activation. We are investigating the mechanism of this observation. These findings may have relevance to inflammatory human diseases in which nitric oxide may be produced in a localized milieu. In the presence of superoxide, nitric oxide may combine to form peroxynitrite and block tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. In the absence of being able to suppress caspase activation, nitric oxide may lead to cellular apoptosis (21Feelisch M. Stamler J.S Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., West Sussex, England1995Google Scholar). This pathway may be important in the loss of left ventricular heart function after acute myocardial infarction, as inducible nitric-oxide synthase-deficient mice appear to be protected from cell death more than control animals (22Guo Y. Jones W.K. Xuan Y.T. Tang X.L. Bao W. Wu W.J. Han H. Laubach V.E. Ping P. Yang Z. Qiu Y. Bolli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, nitric oxide has been implicated in immune destruction of islet cells in the pancreas, leading to diabetes mellitus (25Lukic M.L. Stosic-Grujicic S. Ostojic N. Chan W.L. Liew F.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Muller-Quernheim J. Saltini C. Sondermeyer P. Crystal R.G. J.

Immunol. 1987; 138: 1109-1114PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, nitric oxide may also directly nitrosylate protein thiol residues regulating cell survival through suppressing caspase activation, favoring cell survival (6Mannick J.B. Hausladen A.

The resulting accumulation of inflammatory cells may create a burden for the involved organ and precipitate injury. Interestingly, correlating with the important in vitroeffects of GSNO, a GSNO reductase that is conserved from yeast to man has been identified recently (29Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), suggesting that GSNO likely has important biological functions in vivo. Thus, regulation of GSNO in mammalian cells appears to be of importance. In summary, the data generated in this study support the hypothesis that the presentation of nitric oxide plays an important role in determining cell fate. When SNAP or GSNO was used, each of which can S-nitrosylate protein residues, nitric oxide inhibited the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation in human monocytes. Moreover, these donors also suppressed the activity of active recombinant caspase-3. These data suggest that GSNO and SNAP can both inhibit the activation of casapse-3 and interfere with the biological activity of enzymatically active recombinant caspase-3, likely via protein S-nitrosylation. In contrast, the addition of PAPA NONOate or DEA NONOate, which primarily leads to N-nitrosylation of protein tyrosine residues in human monocytes, does not consistently reduce caspase-9 or caspase-3 activation or DNA fragmentation. These data begin to unravel the molecular details of how nitric oxide may be able to induce both cell survival and cell death. Our data suggest that the presentation of nitric oxide and the subsequent suppression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation determine whether nitric oxide promotes cell survival or cell death in human monocytes.

Although SNARE complexes appear to represent a universal membrane fusion machine, their role in determining the specificity of intracellular membrane fusion is still being established (3McNew J.A.

Each SNARE complex characterized to date appears to consist of a thermostable parallel helix bundle composed of four heptad repeat-containing SNARE motifs (5Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R.

Because the parallel SNARE motifs are anchored via transmembrane domains continuous with the carboxyl end of the SNARE motifs, the amino-to-carboxyl-terminal “zippering up” of the vesicle (v-) SNARE motif with the target membrane (t-) SNAREs draws the two membranes into close apposition and apparently drives lipid mixing and fusion between the opposing bilayers (3McNew J.A.

Interestingly, most SNAREs structurally related to syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 contain a glutamine at this conserved “zero layer” position (called “Q-SNAREs”), whereas SNAREs related to VAMP 2 contain an arginine at this position (“R-SNAREs”) (10Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Based upon protein profiling analysis, Q-SNAREs can be further subdivided into QA-SNAREs related to syntaxin and QB- and QC-SNAREs related to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal SNARE motifs of SNAP-25, respectively (11Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Notably, all of the characterized SNARE complexes and fusogenic subsets of SNAREs in liposome fusion to date contain one each of the QA-, QB-, QC-, and R-SNARE motifs. Several studies have investigated the function of this conserved central layer; although aspects of its composition are essential for proper SNARE function, its precise role(s) in complex formation, membrane fusion and/or SNARE recycling still remains unclear (reviewed in Ref. 2Hay J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In several systems it appeared that a reproducible pattern emerged concerning the subunit organization of SNARE four-helix bundles. The exocytic SNARE complex is well known to be comprised of a set of three interacting Q-SNARE helices anchored on one membrane that form a binding site for an R-SNARE helix anchored on an opposing membrane. In the endosomal complex, now known in atomic detail, the positions occupied by the amino- and carboxyl-terminal SNAP-25 helices in the exocytic complex are held by the QB-SNARE vti1b and the QC-SNARE syntaxin 8, respectively, whereas the R-SNARE VAMP 8 superimposes upon the VAMP 2 position, and syntaxin 7 is spatially equivalent to syntaxin 1A (6Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat Struct Biol. 2002; 14: 14Google Scholar). Thus, this crystal structure demonstrated that SNARE motif positions are highly superimposable between complexes and that the structural roles of the QA-, QB-, QC-, and R-SNARE motifs are likely to be conserved, at least between the synapse and endosomes. A similar assumption was made about the ER/Golgi quaternary complex because the R-SNARE sec22b bound strongly only to the combination of the QA-, QB-, and QC-SNAREs syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1. Thus, sec22b appeared to play an analogous role to VAMP 2 and was modeled to oppose the Q-SNAREs syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1 in ER/Golgi membrane fusion events (9Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, results fromin vitro liposome fusion with purified recombinant yeast ER/Golgi SNAREs suggested a different model of the putative first fusion event in the secretory pathway, because fusion did not occur when Sec22p opposed Sed5p, Bos1p, and Betlp on liposomes (13Parlati F. McNew J.A. Fukuda R. Miller R. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Instead, a membrane fusion signal was generated only when Bet1p opposed Sec22p, Bos1p, and Sed5p. This result was interpreted to mean that in vivo, Bet1p is the V-SNARE that opposes a t-SNARE complex composed of Sec22p, Bos1p, and Sed5p. According to this interpretation, the spatial organization and membrane topology of structurally related SNAREs in membrane fusion complexes is not conserved and instead must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Because of the specific intracellular localizations displayed by SNAREs and because their specific localizations and interactions appear to encode at least one layer of specificity in vesicle transport reactions (3McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), there has been considerable interest in understanding the intracellular targeting determinants within the SNAREs themselves. The results have been surprisingly variable. In the simplest cases, the subcellular localization information is apparently contained entirely within the transmembrane domain and may even be a simple function of transmembrane domain length. This is the case for the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 3 and 4 as well as for the ER/Golgi syntaxin 5, whose transmembrane domains are sufficient for proper localization (14Banfield D.K. Lewis M.J. Rabouille C. Warren G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Am. J.

Syntaxin 5 may also contain additional targeting information within its cytoplasmic domain, although results differ. On the other hand, syntaxin 6, which follows a complex itinerary that includes steady-state localization to the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (17Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and undergoes constitutive cycling to the plasma membrane, appears to be targeted by two distinct determinants within its cytoplasmic domain (18Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), one within the SNARE motif and the other within its amino-terminal domain, now known to represent a three-helix bundle (19Misura K.M. Bock J.B. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At least two other syntaxin family members also contain essential localization determinants within their cytoplasmic domains (16Kasai K. Akagawa K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3115-3124PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was speculated that the targeting via these determinants was accomplished by protein interactions, the binding partners required for localization were not identified. Similarly, the SNARE motif was required for efficient VAMP 2 recruitment onto synaptic vesicles (20Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this case, mutagenesis revealed that the capacity for synaptic SNARE interactions did not correlate with targeting to synaptic vesicles, implicating other potential SNARE motif binding partners for targeting (20Grote E.

Very recently, the mammalian R-SNARE ykt6 was demonstrated to be targeted to a very specific yet undescribed vesicular localization by virtue of its profilin-like amino-terminal domain, completely independently of its SNARE motif or hydrophobic anchor in membranes (22Hasegawa H. Zinsser S. Rhee Y. Vik-Mo E.O. Davanger S. Hay J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 698-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, as of yet SNARE targeting does not appear to follow a clear set of rules and may instead utilize several distinct classes of protein and/or membrane interactions. One question that has not been explored is whether SNAREs are trafficked individually or as complexes. This would be particularly relevant to t-SNAREs that undergo constitutive cycling, for example within the Golgi, between the ER and Golgi or between the Golgi and endosomes. Some cycling SNAREs may contain their own intrinsic targeting signals, whereas others could depend upon interactions with these SNAREs for their targeting. If Q-SNARE complexes are indeed an important intermediate in SNARE complex assembly, then one might expect these complexes to be efficiently recruited onto newly forming vesicles. On the other hand, one might expect used or aberrant SNARE complexes to be excluded from newly forming vesicles. Targeting determinants of the dynamically localized ER/Golgi QC-SNARE Bet1p and its rat ortholog rbet1 have not been defined. rbet1 is a small SNARE consisting of a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain attached to a 95-amino acid cytoplasmic domain with no predicted structure other than the SNARE motif of residues 27–90. In mammals, rbet1 displays a steady-state localization to VTCs and early Golgi and undergoes rapid constitutive cycling between the ER and Golgi (23Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Direct interactions between the yeast Bet1p SNARE motif and the COPI and COPII coat machinery have been described (24Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Rein U. Andag U. Duden R. Schmitt H.D. Spang A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interactions of Bos1p and Sec22p with COPII components were sufficient to produce a 3–4-fold enrichment of the SNAREs in COPII vesicles budded from chemically defined liposomes (26Matsuoka K. Morimitsu Y. Uchida K. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions between the rbet1 SNARE motif and COP coats could be important for its steady-state localization and for its constitutive ER/Golgi cycling. On the other hand, correct recruitment to budding vesicles may be more complex in vivo than simple interactions with coats; for example, it may also involve determinants that localize the protein to vesicle budding sites or membrane domains. This may be the case for the erv41p-erv46p complex, another rapidly cycling vesicle membrane protein (27Otte S. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent findings in yeast indicated that ARF-GAP bound transiently to the Bet1p SNARE motif in vitro and induced a conformational state required for its interaction with COPI machinery (25Rein U. Andag U. Duden R. Schmitt H.D. Spang A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the known conformational states for SNARE motifs are unstructured coils and helical bundles, one suggestion was that ARF-GAP may facilitate Bet1p hetero- or homo-oligomeric bundling and that oligomeric bundles are the preferred substrate for coat binding and uptake into vesicles. These speculations highlight our lack of information about the role of the SNARE motif and SNARE protein interactions in the targeting, dynamics, and life cycle of the SNAREs themselves. Using purified SNAREs and simple protein interaction assays and mutagenesis, we have further investigated the organization of the ER/Golgi quaternary complex in vitro. In contrast to results with liposome fusion, our results demonstrate that membrin and rbet1 play the structural roles of t-SNAREs, with membrin being spatially analogous to the amino-terminal helix of SNAP-25 and rbet1 occupying a position very similar to the carboxyl-terminal helix of SNAP-25. In addition, we demonstrated the importance to SNARE complex assembly of a conserved salt bridge on the surfaces of the synaptic and ER/Golgi SNARE complexes. In a second set of experiments, we examined the potential role of the rbet1 SNARE motif and SNARE interactions in rbet1 localization and dynamics. We found that, in contrast to what has been observed for its binding partner syntaxin 5, the rbet1 SNARE motif was absolutely essential for proper targeting. For a clean test of the role of SNARE interactions in rbet1 targeting or dynamics, we created charge repulsion mutant rbet1 K47D at the conserved salt bridge position that rendered rbet1 defective for heteromeric SNARE interactions in vivo. Interestingly, the steady-state localization of rbet1 K47D was indistinguishable from wild type. Furthermore, the intracellular dynamics of the mutant, its interactions with the COPI machinery, and its recruitment to coated vesicles were all indistinguishable from wild type. We conclude that the SNARE motif but not SNARE interactions is essential for the targeting and dynamics of rbet1. Monoclonal and affinity-purified polyclonal anti-SNARE antibodies were described previously (23Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J.

An anti-hexahistidine monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. β-COP antiserum was raised in a rabbit by injection of the peptide CKKEAGELKPEEEITVGPVQK conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. p24α2 antiserum was raised in a rabbit by injection of the peptide CQMRHLKSFFEAKKLV conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. An anti-rsec23 antibody (which recognizes all isoforms) was raised in a rabbit against the peptide CQQNEERDGVRFSWNVWPSSR conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and then affinity-purified using the peptide. Glucosidase IIα and protein disulfide isomerase antibodies were purchased from Stressgen (catalog numbers VAP-PT034 and SPA-890, respectively). Anti-calnexin was from Dr. Ari Helenius, and anti-GM130 was from Dr. Martin Lowe. Anti-syntaxin 6 monoclonal antibody (clone 3A10) was from Drs. Richard Scheller and Jason Bock. The following bacterially expressed protein constructs were either described previously (9Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or created for this study. GST-membrin encoded essentially the full-length protein (amino acids 2–212) including the transmembrane domain and was mutated at residue 139 with a QuikChange kit from Stratagene. GST-syntaxin 5 included the entire cytoplasmic domain of the smaller 34-kDa syntaxin 5 isoform (residues 55–333 of the entire syntaxin 5 open reading frame); however, we used a natural internal thrombin cleavage site within this construct (9Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to produce a fragment containing just the SNARE motif, residues 252–333 for binding studies. GST-rbet1 encoded the entire cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–95) and was mutated using the QuikChange kit to produce the rbet1 mutations employed in the experiments. GST-SNAP-25 encoded either the entire protein (residues 1–206), the amino-terminal SNARE motif (residues 1–93), or the carboxyl-terminal SNARE motif (residues 120–206). We also employed three hexahistidine-tagged constructs: mouse sec22b cytoplasmic domain (residues 2–196), yeast Sec22p cytoplasmic domain (residues 2–193), and rbet1 cytoplasmic domain (residues 2–95). The mouse sec22b construct was mutagenized with the QuikChange kit as indicated in the text. All of the constructs and mutants were verified by sequencing at the University of Michigan DNA sequencing core. For binding studies, the SNARE proteins were purified as described earlier (9Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In short, Escherichia coli cultures were resuspended in French press buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (for His6-containing constructs, we used the same medium without dithiothreitol), lysed by French press, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant (S1) was recovered. For His6-sec22b, GST, GST-rbet1, and GST-SNAP-25 constructs, the S1 was immediately centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was collected (S2). For GST-syntaxin 5 (55- 333), the S1 was adjusted to 0.35% sodium sarkosyl, mixed gently for 30 min, and then supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant was collected. For GST-membrin, the S1 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant (S2) was discarded, and the pellet (P2) was homogenized in the original volume of French press buffer. This was treated with sarkosyl, glycerol, and Triton X-100 and centrifuged as above, and the 100,000 ×g supernatant was retained. All of the final 100,000 ×g supernatants were then purified on columns of either glutathione-Sepharose (GST constructs) or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (His6constructs). Purified fractions eluted with glutathione were cleaved with thrombin in the case of GST fusion proteins. The purified, cleaved proteins were dialyzed into Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.15 m KCL, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol), supplemented with protease inhibitors, and stored at −80 °C. The proteins were quantified by comparison with BSA standards on Coomassie-stained SDS gels, employing an Agfa Arcus 1200 flatbed scanner and Kodak 1D Image gel analysis software. rbet1 employed for analytical ultracentrifugation (AU) experiments was purified by more rigorous procedures. The first stages of purification were identical to above. However, after elution from glutathione-Sepharose, GST-rbet1 fusion proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences). After elution with a continuous KCl gradient, the peak of the desired protein was pooled and cleaved with thrombin, diluted 2-fold with low salt buffer, and passed over a column of Q-Sepharose to retain GST and residual fusion protein. The flow-through from the Q-Sepharose, containing cleaved rbet1, was concentrated using a YM-3 membrane on an Amicon stirred cell concentrator and then further purified by velocity gradient fractionation as described earlier (9Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The final homogeneous rbet1 was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for AU analysis. All of the binding incubations were conducted in buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For solution binding assays, 300-μl reactions containing ∼2 μm of each protein were incubated for varying time periods (see each figure legend) on ice, 250 μl of which was injected onto a 24-ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) run in Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 30 μg/ml BSA. Individual column fractions were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or were precipitated with acetone prior to gel and Western analysis. For the binary and ternary bead binding assays, a typical binding reaction consisted of 20 μl of 20 mg/ml BSA, 20 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads containing ∼124 pmol (620 nmfinal concentration in binding reaction) of the immobilized protein, and varying amounts of the soluble binding partners in a final volume of 200 μl of Buffer A plus 0.1% Triton X-100. The binding reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant agitation, and then the beads were washed three times with Buffer A containing 0.1% BSA in the case of binary binding reactions and Buffer A plus 0.1% Triton X -100 in the case of ternary bead binding assays. The beads were resuspended in denaturing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, scanning, and quantitation. NRK cells seeded on coverslips were transfected with wild type Myc-rbet1 or Myc-rbet1 K47D using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). In some experiments the cells were co-transfected with a commercial CFP-tagged galactosyltransferase localization domain construct (Living Colors CFP-Golgi from Clontech). For brefeldin A treatment, the cells were incubated for 60 min in growth medium containing 10 μg/ml of brefeldin A (Calbiochem). To allow the BFA-treated cells to recover from treatment, the BFA containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with non-BFA containing growth medium and then incubated with fresh growth medium for the indicated amounts of time. For the low temperature treatment, the cells were incubated at 15 °C in precooled growth medium for the indicated amounts of time. To fix cells for microscopy, the growth medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, followed by quenching twice for 10 min each with 0.1 m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were permeabilized by incubation with permeabilization solution (0.4% saponin, 1% BSA, and 2% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline) for 15 min. They were then incubated with permeabilization solution containing the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with permeabilization solution, and the purified fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) in permeabilization solution was added to the cells for 30 min. The cells were finally washed three times with permeabilization solution and mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Labs) on glass slides. Microscopy was conducted on a Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscope with Texas Red and fluorescein filter sets, a Hamamatsu Orca II camera, and Improvision Openlab software. NRK cells were transfected with either wild type Myc-rbet1 or Myc-rbet1 K47D constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in KCl Buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmGTPγS. The extract obtained was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The clarified supernatants"
https://openalex.org/W1964611584,"To analyse individual factors that may contribute to leukemic transformation in vivo, we have developed a murine model of leukemogenesis based on the early hematopoietic precursor cell FL5.12. FL5.12 cells are interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent for growth, proliferation, and survival. Relative resistance to cell death following IL-3 withdrawal can be conferred by either overexpression of the Bcl-x(L) apoptotic inhibitor, or constitutive activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. The ability of Bcl-x(L) or a constitutively active myristylated Akt to promote leukemic transformation of FL5.12 cells was compared in athymic nu(+)/nu(+) mice. Bcl-x(L) alone could not promote leukemic transformation, but mice injected with FL5.12 cells overexpressing Bcl-x(L) and a dominant-negative p53 construct developed leukocytosis and blastic infiltration of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver with features of a high-grade lymphoid malignancy. In contrast to the cells injected into these animals, cell lines derived from the mice were able to proliferate in the absence of IL-3, and were found to have constitutively activated Akt. This constitutive activation was associated with a variety of alterations of the signaling pathway regulating Akt activity, including alterations of PTEN mRNA and protein expression. In addition, some of these leukemic clones demonstrated concurrent constitutive upregulation of ERK activity. A constitutively active Akt construct introduced into FL5.12 cells promoted similar clonal expansion in vivo, with emergence of clonal IL-3-independent proliferation. Bcl-x(L) and Akt appeared to function cooperatively in this model, enhancing rapid clonal outgrowth in vivo relative to Akt alone. These results implicate activated Akt and growth-factor independence in leukemogenic transformation, and demonstrate the potential for in vivo analysis of genetic determinants of leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061904421,"The genes involved in the transformation of kidney blastema cells were searched for in avian nephroblastomas induced by the MAV2 retrovirus. The twist gene was identified as a common site of provirus integration in tumor cells. Twist was rearranged by the MAV2 provirus in three out of 76 independent nephroblastoma samples. The MAV2 integration sites were localized within 40 nucleotides of the twist 5'UTR region, right upstream from the ATG initiation codon. The integrated proviruses were deleted at their 5'ends. As a consequence, twist transcription became controlled by the retroviral 3'LTR promoter and was strongly upregulated, more than 200 times. In addition, 2-100 times elevated twist transcription was also detected in the majority of other nephroblastoma samples not containing MAV2 in the twist locus. We propose that chicken nephroblastoma originates from a single blastemic cell in which the MAV retrovirus, through its integration, has deregulated specific combinations of genes controlling proliferation and differentiation. The activation of the twist gene expression appears to contribute to tumorigenesis, as there is an in vivo positive selection of tumor cell clones containing the twist gene hyperactivated by MAV2 sequences inserted within the twist promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2066663194,"The sequence of non-contacted bases at the center of the 434 repressor binding site affects the strength of the repressor-DNA complex by influencing the structure and flexibility of DNA (Koudelka, G. B., and Carlson, P. (1992) Nature355, 89–91). We synthesized 434 repressor binding sites that differ in their central sequence base composition to test the importance of minor groove substituents and/or the number of base pair hydrogen bonds between these base pairs on DNA structure and strength of the repressor-DNA complex. We show here that the number of base pair H-bonds between the central bases apparently has no role in determining the relative affinity of a DNA site for repressor. Instead we find that the affinity of DNA for repressor depends on the absence or presence the N2-NH2 group on the purine bases at the binding site center. The N2-NH2 group on bases at the center of the 434 binding site appears to destabilize 434 repressor-DNA complexes by decreasing the intimacy of the specific repressor-DNA contacts, while increasing the reliance on protein contacts to the DNA phosphate backbone. Thus, the presence of an N2-NH2 group on the purines at the center of a binding site globally alters the precise conformation of the protein-DNA interface."

Within this functional domain, syndecan-1 promotes cell-cell adhesion and concentration of heparin binding growth factors. The present study reveals the surprising finding that targeting of syndecan-1 to uropods is mediated by its heparan sulfate chains and that targeting is regulated by cell surface events rather than solely by intracellular mechanisms. The addition of exogenous heparin or the treatment of polarized cells with heparitinase initiates a rapid and dramatic redistribution of uropod syndecan-1 over the entire cell surface, and a mutated syndecan-1 lacking heparan sulfate chains fails to concentrate within uropods. Interestingly, the heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycans glypican-1 and betaglycan fail to concentrate in uropods, indicating that targeting may require heparan sulfate structural motifs unique to syndecan-1 or that the core protein of syndecan-1 participates in specific interactions that promote heparan sulfate-mediated targeting. These findings suggest functional specificity for syndecan-1 within uropods and, in addition, reveal a novel mechanism for the targeting of molecules to discrete membrane subcellular domains via heparan sulfate.

Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate can act in diverse roles as either an inhibitor or a promoter of protein function or, in some instances, it may act simply to sequester and protect certain proteins at the cell surface. This ability to fine tune protein function is dependent on the structure of the heparan sulfate chain, the binding site for heparan sulfate on the protein, and the availability of the protein-heparan sulfate complex to interact with other molecules such as high affinity receptors for growth factors (2Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S.

Often these high affinity receptors must be cross-linked to initiate signaling, and the concentration of heparan sulfate proteoglycans within specific domains on the cell surface may aid in this process (6Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans can exist on the cell surface in discrete subcellular domains, but our knowledge is limited as to how their specific localization is controlled. For example, in neurons syndecan-2 localizes specifically to synapses, whereas syndecan-3 is concentrated in axons (7Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7415-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, syndecan-1 localizes to the basolateral surface and is absent from the apical cell surface (8Mertens G. Van der Schueren B. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Intracellular sorting mechanisms apparently regulate localization of syndecans in these cells, because the concentration of syndecan-2 on dendritic spines at the synapse is dependent on regions within the cytoplasmic domain (9Ethell I.M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of the last 12 amino acids of the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain results in the expression of the mutant proteoglycan at both the apical and basolateral surfaces of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (10Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1571-1581PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to proteoglycan core protein domains, heparan sulfate apparently can affect intracellular sorting mechanisms, because the amount of glypican-1 present on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells is inversely related to the heparan sulfate content of the proteoglycan (8Mertens G. Van der Schueren B. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, heparan sulfate on glypican may interfere with its intracellular sorting to apical compartments, or perhaps heparan sulfate acts to direct sorting specifically to basolateral compartments. In contrast to intracellular interactions that regulate proteoglycan targeting to specific domains, much less is known regarding extracellular events at the cell surface that direct proteoglycan distribution. Studies have shown that cross-linking of syndecan-1 or syndecan-4 extracellular domains at the cell surface can promote sequestering of these molecules within cholesterol-rich, detergent-insoluble lipid rafts (11Fuki I.V. Meyer M.E. Williams K.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Tkachenko E. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19946-19951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, a role for heparan sulfate in proteoglycan targeting at the cell surface has not been described, although such activity seems likely based on heparan sulfate's capacity to bind many proteins resident at the cell surface. Migration of immune cells involves cell polarization, whereby distinct subcellular domains are formed. The leading edge of the migrating cell is termed the lamellipodium, and the trailing edge is called the uropod (13Sanchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Receptors that detect and respond to chemoattractant gradients are located within the lamellipodia, whereas adhesion molecules such as ICAMs,1 CD44, and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) are located within the uropod (14del Pozo M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Nieto M. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition to normal lymphoid cells, we previously reported that myeloma cells exhibit polarization and that syndecan-1 localizes specifically to the uropod of these cells (15Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the uropod, syndecan-1 promotes homotypic cell adhesion and adhesion to the extracellular matrix and can also interact with and concentrate heparin-binding growth factors. It was recently shown that osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds specifically to the uropods of myeloma cells through interaction with the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1 (16Standal T. Seidel C. Hjertner O. Plesner T. Sanderson R.D. Waage A. Borset M. Sundan A. Blood. 2002; 100: 3002-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Following binding, the OPG is taken up by the cell and degraded, implying a mechanism by which myeloma cells can enhance bone turnover. Thus, the subcellular localization of syndecan-1 to the uropod has an important and distinct impact on the behavior of tumor cells and, perhaps, on that of other cells in the tumor microenvironment. The present study reveals that syndecan-1 is targeted to the uropod via its heparan sulfate chains. Surprisingly, neither the cytoplasmic nor the transmembrane domains of syndecan-1 are required for targeting, but the extracellular core protein domain is important because other heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycans (betaglycan and glypican-1) fail to target specifically to uropods. These results provide further evidence for functional specificity among genetically distinct heparan sulfate proteoglycans and demonstrate that heparan sulfate chains can participate in regulating the localization of proteoglycans to specific sites on the cell surface, thereby compartmentalizing their function.

Triton X-100, cholera toxin beta-FITC, cytochalasin-D, and heparin isolated from porcine intestinal mucosa were purchased from Sigma. ARH-77 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. These cells are Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoblastoid cells established from a patient with plasma cell leukemia. CAG cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were established at the Arkansas Cancer Research Center from Histopaque-1077-separated bone marrow aspirates taken from a myeloma patient. Constructs used in transfections were prepared, cloned into expression vectors, and transfected into cells as described previously (Fig. 1). Cells expressing the transfected proteoglycans were enriched and purified either by cell sorting or panning using the appropriate antibody. Cells (5 × 104) were harvested from culture and gently fixed in pre-warmed (37 °C) formaldehyde (final concentration, 3.7%) and fixed for 5 min. Cells were washed twice by adding 1 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min, followed by resuspension in 100 μl of either FITC-conjugated or unconjugated primary antibodies at room temperature for 45 min. When unconjugated primary antibodies were used following removal of the primary antibody and washing, FITC-labeled secondary antibodies were incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in one drop of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), mounted on glass slides, and analyzed for proteoglycan distribution to uropods as described previously (15Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy using an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a BX-FLA reflected light fluorescence attachment (Olympus America, Melville, NY) and a Nikon digital camera. For disruption of syndecan-1 targeting using heparin, exogenous heparin (10 μg/ml) was added to cells for 30 min at 37 °C followed by fixation and immunostaining. In some studies following incubation of cells for 30 min in heparin, the heparin was washed out, and the cells were resuspended in PBS followed by incubation in PBS at 37 °C. Analysis of syndecan-1 localization was performed at 1, 2, and 4 h after removal of the heparin. To remove heparan sulfate chains from the cell surface, cells were sequentially treated twice with heparitinase (1 milliunit/ml; Seikagaku America) at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed for syndecan-1 localization. Polarized myeloma cells exhibit a clearly defined morphological protrusion known as the uropod (Fig.2A). Immunofluorescence staining of polarized myeloma cells demonstrates that syndecan-1 concentrates on uropods on the surface of myeloma cells (Fig.2B). Staining of these cells with antibody to ICAM-1, a well characterized marker for uropods (21del Pozo M.A. Cabanas C. Montoya M.C. Ager A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), demonstrates co-localization of syndecan-1 and ICAM-1 on uropods and confirms that syndecan-1 indeed is localized predominantly on the uropod (Fig. 2, C and D). This, together with our previous study, confirms that under physiological conditions syndecan-1 is a marker for uropods present on polarized myeloma cells (15Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, following exposure of the cells to exogenous heparin, a dramatic redistribution of syndecan-1 occurs, resulting in relatively equal distribution of syndecan-1 over the entire cell surface (Fig. 2E) rather than concentration predominantly on uropods (note uniform cell surface staining of syndecan-1 in Fig. 2E compared with intense staining on uropods in Fig. 2, B and C). Removal of heparan sulfate chains from the cell surface with heparitinase also promotes redistribution of syndecan-1 over the entire cell surface (Fig.2F). This redistribution occurs even though the cells clearly retain their uropods and polarized morphology. Dual staining with antibodies to syndecan-1 and ICAM-1 confirms that uropod integrity is maintained in the presence of heparin and that, although syndecan-1 becomes distributed over the entire cell surface, ICAM-1 is retained predominantly on uropods (Fig. 2, G and H). The effect of heparin or heparitinase on syndecan-1 distribution is not limited to a few cells; rather, almost all of the cells treated exhibit a loss of syndecan-1 concentration within the uropod (TableI). To confirm that heparan sulfate is required for syndecan-1 targeting to the uropod, ARH-77 cells were employed. These cells are often polarized, although we have previously established that the uropods on ARH-77 cells are not as prominent as those of CAG cells (15Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARH-77 cells lack syndecan-1 expression, but, following transfection with a cDNA coding for syndecan-1, the proteoglycan localizes in the uropod (Fig. 2I). In contrast, when ARH-77 cells are transfected with a cDNA coding for a mutated form of the syndecan-1 core protein lacking all three heparan sulfate attachment sites (Syn-1TDM; triple deletion mutant) (22Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the core protein does not concentrate in uropods but is distributed over the entire cell surface (Fig. 2J). Together, these findings demonstrate that heparan sulfate chains are required for targeting of syndecan-1 to uropods.Table ISyndecan-1 redistributes following the addition of exogenous heparin or treatment of cells with heparitinaseTreatmentPattern of syndecan-1 expressionUropodPartial uropodEntire cell surfaceNone9217Heparin1990Heparitinase0793Cells were treated with heparin or heparitinase and immunostained for syndecan-1 expression using antibody B-B4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were examined for the pattern of syndecan-1 expression on the cell surface, and the percentage of cells exhibiting uropod, partial uropod, or distribution over the entire cell surface was determined.

For each assessment, over 100 cells were examined and counted. Open table in a new tab Cells were treated with heparin or heparitinase and immunostained for syndecan-1 expression using antibody B-B4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were examined for the pattern of syndecan-1 expression on the cell surface, and the percentage of cells exhibiting uropod, partial uropod, or distribution over the entire cell surface was determined. These patterns of expression were defined as follows: uropod, heavy concentration of staining on uropods and either no staining or very weak staining over the remaining cell surface; partial uropod, focal concentration of staining in uropods but also weaker staining over the entire cell surface; entire cell surface, equal staining of syndecan-1 over the entire cell surface with no concentration in uropods. For each assessment, over 100 cells were examined and counted. To determine whether the effects of heparin on the distribution of syndecan-1 at the cell surface are reversible, cells were incubated with heparin for 30 min, washed three times in PBS to remove exogenous heparin, resuspended in PBS at 37 °C, and analyzed for syndecan-1 distribution. Two hours after the removal of heparin, an accumulation of syndecan-1 is detected within the uropod and, by 4 h after removal of heparin, the majority of syndecan-1 is detected solely in the uropod (Fig. 3,A–C). The finding that syndecan-1 relocalizes to the uropod when cells are suspended in PBS in the absence of serum suggests that targeting to the uropod is not mediated by serum proteins that cross-link syndecan-1 to each other or to other cell surface molecules. It is possible that some or all of the syndecan-1 that concentrates in the uropod following removal of exogenous heparin is actually newly synthesized rather than redistributed syndecan-1 (i.e. the syndecan-1 that exits the uropod in the presence of exogenous heparin could be shed or recycled, and the syndecan-1 that accumulates in the uropod over 4 h could be newly synthesized). Thus, to further examine syndecan-1 redistribution to uropods following incubation of cells with exogenous heparin, FITC-labeled antibody to syndecan-1 was added to cells as a tracer of the cell surface molecule. As expected, immediately after labeling with antibody, the syndecan-1 is seen over the entire cell surface (Fig. 3D). However, after only 30 min almost all of the labeled syndecan-1 is detected within uropods (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, the presence of antibody bound to syndecan-1 appears to accelerate the targeting process as compared with relocalization to uropods in the absence of antibody (compare Fig. 3, E and B). A similar acceleration of targeting to the uropod is seen with CD43 when it is engaged by antibody (23del Pozo M.A. Nieto M. Serrador J.M. Sancho D. Vicente-Manzanares M. Martinez C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Together, the results support the conclusion that syndecan-1, once on the cell surface, is actively targeted to the uropod and that the heparin-mediated disruption of syndecan-1 localization to uropods is dynamic and reversible. To examine how the actin cytoskeleton effects syndecan-1 localization on these cells, we employed cytochalasin D, which blocks actin polymerization. When cells were exposed to cytochalasin D after removal of heparin, the syndecan-1 remains distributed over the entire cell surface even 4 h after removal of heparin (Fig. 3F). Cytochalasin D is known to disrupt the polarized morphology of lymphocytes, causing cells to round up and abolish uropods. Thus, this result indicates that, in the absence of uropods, syndecan-1 fails to concentrate within any specific region of the cell surface. Recent studies show that lipid rafts comprise subdomains within uropods of T lymphocytes (24Millan J. Montoya M.C. Sancho D. Sanchez-Madrid F. Alonso M.A. Blood. 2002; 99: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether the addition of heparin disrupts lipid rafts within the uropod, cells were stained with the FITC-labeled cholera toxin beta. Staining of uropods with cholera toxin remained prominent in the presence of heparin, indicating that lipid rafts remained unperturbed, even though the syndecan-1 escapes the uropod (Fig. 3G). Thus, heparin apparently does not alter uropod morphology or disrupt lipid raft organization within the uropod. To determine whether other heparan sulfate proteoglycans would target specifically to the uropod, ARH-77 cells transfected with a cDNA for either glypican-1 or betaglycan were examined. Neither of these proteoglycans share significant homology to the syndecan-1 core protein, yet both bear heparan sulfate chains (25López-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massagué J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 26David G. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, neither of these heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycans localize specifically to uropods (Fig. 4,A and C), rather, they are detected over the entire cell surface, even on those cells with clearly distinguishable uropods (arrows). In fact, some of the cells appear to have proteoglycan concentrated in areas distinct from uropods. Staining with antibody specific for heparan sulfate chains confirms that these proteoglycans bear heparan sulfate and that this heparan sulfate is not concentrated within uropods (Fig. 4, B and D). Moreover, the lack of detection of any focal concentration of heparan sulfate in the uropods and the lack of intense staining over the entire cell surface (Fig. 4, B and D) indicate that the heparan sulfate-dependent targeting mechanism to the uropod has not been saturated. One possible explanation for the difference between syndecan-1 and these other proteoglycans in their localization could be the number of heparan sulfate chains present on the core protein. Glypican-1 has three closely grouped heparan sulfate attachment sites in a region of the core protein close to the cell membrane (27Litwack E.D. Stipp C.S. Kumbasar A. Lander A.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3713-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how many heparan sulfate chains are actually present on each glypican-1 molecule. Betaglycan bears only one heparan sulfate chain (28Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, syndecan-1 has three sites for heparan sulfate attachment and is known to have multiple heparan sulfate chains on each core protein (29Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To determine whether localization of syndecan-1 to the uropod requires multiple heparan sulfate chains, we utilized a mutated form of syndecan-1 having two of its three heparan sulfate attachment sites mutated. This mutated syndecan-1 is composed of a core protein having a single heparan sulfate chain attachment site at amino acid 47 (22, 30). Although it is not as strongly associated with the uropod as wild-type syndecan-1, most of the proteoglycan does appear to concentrate in uropods (Fig. 4E). This suggests that the failure of glypican-1 and betaglycan to localize specifically to uropods is not due to the fact that they may bear only one heparan sulfate chain. The syndecan-1 core protein is composed of a cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and heparan sulfate-bearing extracellular domain. To determine whether the cytoplasmic and/or transmembrane domains are required for targeting of syndecan-1 to the uropod, cells were transfected with either a mutated form of syndecan-1 lacking the coding region for the cytoplasmic domain (Syn279, see Fig. 1) or with a chimeric proteoglycan composed of the syndecan-1 extracellular domain linked to the GPI anchor of glypican-1 (Syn/glyp). Both of these proteoglycans are known to bear heparan sulfate chains (22Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When expressed in either ARH-77 cells or CAG cells, the Syn279 and Syn/glyp proteoglycans are found concentrated in uropods (Fig.5). Moreover, a chimera composed of the glypican-1 extracellular domain linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of syndecan-1 (Glyp/syn) fails to concentrate in uropods. Staining with antibody to heparan sulfate confirms that heparan sulfate chains are present on the Glyp/syn chimeric proteoglycan (Fig. 5G). Thus, the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of syndecan-1 are not required for targeting syndecan-1 to the uropod, and the addition of these domains to glypican-1 does not promote its concentration within uropods. When cells are extracted with Triton X-100 at 37 °C, syndecan-1 is retained within the uropod (Fig. 6,A and B). We have previously demonstrated that cooling cells on ice for 30 min results in the loss of syndecan-1 from the uropod, with subsequent redistribution of the proteoglycan over the entire cell surface (15Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon brief cooling on ice for 5 min, some of the syndecan-1 remains in the uropod, whereas some is lost to surrounding membrane surfaces (Fig. 6C). Extraction of these cells with Triton X-100 results in specific removal of only the non-uropod syndecan-1 (Fig. 6D). Thus, at 4 °C, syndecan-1 looses its association with the uropod and becomes easily extractable with detergent. Similarly, following the addition of exogenous heparin and redistribution of syndecan-1, the proteoglycan is readily extracted with detergent, as is the form of syndecan-1 that lacks heparan sulfate chains (Fig. 6, E and F). These results indicate that the loss of syndecan-1 localization to uropods is associated with a change in the way that syndecan-1 is anchored to the cell. Localization of syndecan-1 to the uropods of B lymphoid cells is functionally important, because it promotes both tight cell adhesion and concentration of growth factors (15Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we describe the surprising finding that this localization requires the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1. Either the addition of exogenous heparin or the removal of heparan sulfate from the cell surface results in the loss of specific localization of syndecan-1 to the uropod and the rapid redistribution of the proteoglycan over the entire cell surface. In addition, when a mutated form of syndecan-1 lacking heparan sulfate chains is expressed on cells, it fails to target specifically to uropods. Although little is known regarding mechanisms that direct targeting of heparan sulfate proteoglycans to discrete subcellular domains, our findings clearly establish that heparan sulfate can play a determining role in this process. Intracellular sorting of proteoglycans to distinct cell surface compartments can be influenced by both core protein structure and heparan sulfate chains (8Mertens G. Van der Schueren B. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1571-1581PubMed Google Scholar). However, intracellular sorting mechanisms do not explain targeting to, and retention of, syndecan-1 within the uropods because, when dispersed by exogenous heparin, the syndecan-1 relocalizes to the uropod once heparin is removed. Moreover, if the syndecan-1 is tagged with antibody after it is dispersed by heparin, the labeled syndecan-1 rapidly relocalizes to the uropod. Together, these results indicate that targeting of syndecan-1 to uropods involves events occurring at the cell surface and is not solely due to targeted delivery of intracellular syndecan to the uropod compartment. Furthermore, in parallel to what we have demonstrated here for B lymphoid cells, Triton X-100 extraction of syndecan-1 from Chinese hamster ovary cells is also facilitated by removal of heparan sulfate chains or addition of exogenous heparin (10Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1571-1581PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our discovery that syndecan-1 organization on the cell surface is regulated by heparan sulfate may apply to non-lymphoid cells as well. Interestingly, glypican-1 and betaglycan, two heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycans unrelated to syndecan-1, fail to localize to uropods. Thus, the presence of heparan sulfate chains alone is not sufficient for targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans to uropods. The finding that syndecan-1 targets to uropods, and other heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycans do not, suggests that the core protein of syndecan-1 participates in localization of the proteoglycan, perhaps by complexing with other molecules. This could occur via interactions between the syndecan-1 ectodomain and other cell surface molecules. In support of this is evidence that both syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 ectodomain core proteins have domains that can interact with other molecules (22Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28270-28276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is speculated that these ectodomains interact with ligands on the cell surface as part of the formation of molecular complexes, thereby generating signaling events that influence cell adhesion and motility. If this is the case in uropods, syndecan-1 could play a pivotal role in the formation of multi-molecular complexes. This could be critical in triggering specific signaling pathways as a result of syndecan-1-mediated adhesion that occurs via the uropod interaction with adjacent cells or the extracellular matrix. The localization of syndecan-1 within uropods apparently is not dependent on a direct interaction between syndecan-1 and the cytoskeleton. This is supported by the finding that syndecan-1 lacking its cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (Syn/glyp) localizes to the uropod. Nonetheless, when wild-type syndecan-1 is localized within uropods, it apparently does associate with the cytoskeleton. This is indicated by the finding that syndecan-1 within the uropod is not extracted with detergent at 37 °C. Further analysis is necessary to determine the functional relevance of syndecan-1 interactions with the cytoskeleton within uropods and the nature of the associations between wild-type syndecan-1 and the cytoskeleton (and whether these associations occur directly or via molecular complexes within the membrane or intracellular domains). An alternative explanation for the difference in localization between syndecan-1 and the other proteoglycans (glypican-1 and betaglycan) is that these other proteoglycans bear heparan sulfate chains that lack structural features necessary to promote their localization to uropods. Heparan sulfates are linear polysaccharides containing highly sulfated domains. The exact pattern of sulfation within a sulfated domain and the number and spacing of sulfated domains along a heparan sulfate chain are highly variable, thereby generating vast structural and functional heterogeneity among heparan sulfate chains (3Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 32Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Although the structure and function of heparan sulfate chains on identical core proteins can differ between cell types (33Kato M. Wang H.M. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), little is known regarding differences in heparan sulfate among distinct proteoglycans within the same cell type. A recent study showed only slight structural differences between the heparan sulfates of syndecan-4 and glypican-1 isolated from rat embryo fibroblasts but no difference in the ability of the heparan sulfates to bind the Hep II domain of fibronectin (35Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9410-9417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that, when expressed in B lymphoid cells, betaglycan, like syndecan-1, can mediate cell adhesion via its heparan sulfate chains (36Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These findings support the notion that different proteoglycan core proteins on the same cell type have heparan sulfate chains that are functionally similar. However, it remains to be determined if structural differences in heparan sulfate account for differences between the localization of syndecan-1 and other heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In conclusion, the present study establishes that the targeting of syndecan-1 to uropods requires the presence of heparan sulfate chains on the syndecan-1 core protein. Targeting of syndecan-1 to uropods is reversible and dynamic and requires the syndecan-1 ectodomain core protein but not the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The finding that betaglycan and glypican-1 fail to target to uropods provides further rationale for the existence of multiple genetic forms of heparan sulfate-bearing proteins and suggests a unique function of syndecan-1 within this subcellular membrane domain.

Normal cells progress through a well-defined cell cycle consisting of four distinct stages, G1, S, G2, and M. Progression from one stage to the next is regulated in part by cyclins that bind and activate cyclin dependent kinases, an event necessary to drive cells through the proliferation cycle (1Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1993Google Scholar). Cyclin protein levels oscillate throughout the cell cycle and are thought to be controlled, in part, at the level of transcription. In support of this model, the deregulated expression of cyclins A and D1 has been found in several human tumors (2Yam C.H. Fung T.K. Poon R.Y. J. Cell. Mol.

The overexpression of cyclin D1 is found in many breast cancers (∼50%), mantle cell lymphomas (∼100%), and squamous cell carcinomas (∼64%) and is often associated with a poor prognosis (4Musgrove E.A.

Therefore, a better understanding of the regulatory pathways governing cyclin D1 promoter activity may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets for the development of anti-cancer drugs. RNA polymerase II-dependent gene transcription requires the assembly of more than 20 proteins at the promoter region to form a functional preinitiation complex.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The recruitment of TFIID to the promoter is the first step in the assembly of the preinitiation complex. At promoters that contain a TBP binding site, the mode of recruitment is at least partly via TBP binding to the TATA element. DNase I protection studies have shown that TFIID, in contrast to TBP, protects an extended region that includes sequences ∼30 bp downstream of the TATA box (8Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). These data suggest that one or more of the TAF subunits most likely contact DNA (9Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, the precise function of the TAF components of TFIID in the transcription process still remains to be elucidated. Many promoters, including cyclin D1, lack a consensus TATA element. Under these circumstances the TAFs may be more actively involved in the recruitment of TFIID to promoter sequences. Several TAFs have been shown to interact directly with promoter DNA (9Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 11Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking experiments with purified TFIID reveal that TAF1 and TAF2 are in close contact with the core promoter region (9Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In a random site selection screen, TAF1-TAF2 heterodimers, but not the individual TAFs, were found to preferentially bind to DNA sequences that fit the initiator consensus motif (11Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TAF1 and TAF2 could play an important role in TFIID binding under conditions suboptimal for TBP binding. The ts13 cell line, derived from BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) cells, is a temperature-sensitive mutant that arrests in late G1 at the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 °C) due to a missense mutation in the TAF1 protein (12Talavera A. Basilico C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 92: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Ruppert S. Wang E.H. Tjian R.

Nature. 1993; 362: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The single base pair change identified in ts13 cells results in a glycine to an aspartic acid substitution at amino acid 690 of the hamster TAF1 protein (15Hayashida T. Sekiguchi T. Noguchi E. Sunamoto H. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expression of wild-type human TAF1 is sufficient to complement the ts13 cell cycle arrest phenotype, suggesting that the point mutation is responsible for the proliferation defect (16Wang E.H. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Despite having a mutation in a component of the general transcriptional machinery, ts13 cells do not display a global defect in gene expression (16Wang E.H. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Liu H.T. Gibson C.W. Hirschhorn R.R. Rittling S. Baserga R. Mercer W.E. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 687-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki-Yagawa Y. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Instead, transcription from a subset of genes, including the cell cycle regulators cyclins A, D1, and E, is dramatically reduced at 39.5 °C. Transfection of wild-type human TAF1 into ts13 cells not only complements the G1 arrest but also overcomes the cyclin A and D1 transcriptional defect (20Wang E.H. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conditional mutations in yeast TAF1 (yTAF1) also induce cells to arrest in G1 and to exhibit defects in gene transcription (21Walker S.S. Shen W.-C. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 607-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). DNA microarray analysis of yTAF1 mutant strains under permissive and restrictive conditions revealed that ∼16% of yeast genes display a requirement for TAF1 function (22Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Studies carried out with ts13 mRNA hybridized to a more limited mouse DNA microarray generated similar results (23O'Brien T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2456-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data provide additional evidence that inactivation of the TAF1 subunit of TFIID leads to gene-specific defects in mRNA synthesis. Our current working hypothesis is that the inability of ts13 cells to progress through the G1/S phase checkpoint can be attributed to a disruption in TAF1 function, which compromises the transcription of a select group of cell cycle control genes. The availability of the ts13 cell line provides a unique model system to identify and characterize the specific activity of TAF1 required for cell cycle gene transcription and ultimately cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 is a G1/S phase cell cycle regulatory protein that was isolated from murine bone marrow macrophages as an early responsive gene after stimulation with colony stimulating factor 1. Among the cyclin proteins, expression of the d-type cyclins is one of the earliest events to occur during the G1 phase of the cell cycle leading to cell division. Cyclin D1 has been shown to be transcriptionally up-regulated by numerous growth factors, including nerve growth factor in PC12 cells, estrogen and gestergen in endometrial cells, and epidermal growth factor in prostate cancer cells (24Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6122-6132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sabbah M. Courilleau D. Mester J. Redeuilh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11217-112122Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 26Perry J.E. Grossmann M.E. Tindall D.J. Prostate. 1998; 35: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The 5′-regulatory region of the cyclin D1 gene has been isolated from a number of species, including rat, mouse, and human (27Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kitazawa S. Kitazawa R. Maeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28787-28793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Eto I. Cell. Prolif. 2000; 33: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It consists of a TATA-less promoter with a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and multiple Sp1 binding sites, through which several growth factors exert their proliferative effect (30Nagata D. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For our studies, we have elected to focus on the cyclin D1 promoter, because decreases in cyclin D1 mRNA levels occur relatively quickly after ts13 cells have been shifted to 39.5 °C (19Suzuki-Yagawa Y. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The rapid response suggests that transcription of cyclin D1 is directly affected by the ts13 mutation in TAF1. Studies in yeast with conditional alleles of yTAF1 mapped the TAF1-dependent phenotype to the core promoter region of CLN2 (31Shen W.-C. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The analysis of chimeric promoter constructs between the TAF1-dependent cyclin A and TAF1 independent c-fos genes has revealed that the core promoter elements of cyclin A are also sufficient for temperature-sensitive expression in ts13 cells (20Wang E.H. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results indicate that TAF1 has a unique function at the core promoter of a subset of genes. The goal of our studies is to elucidate the function of TAF1 required for efficient promoter activity. We report here that in vivo protein-DNA interactions within a 33-bp region of the cyclin D1 core promoter, the TDE1 (for TAF1-dependent element 1), are altered under conditions where TAF1 activity is compromised. We demonstrate that TFIID binds to the TDE1 of cyclin D1 in gel mobility shift assays. The DNA binding ability of TFIID as well as TAF1-TAF2 heterodimers is compromised at 37 °C in vitro by the ts13 mutation in TAF1. These results have led us to conclude that the lack of cyclin D1 transcription can be attributed at least in part to the inefficient recruitment of TFIID to the core promoter. The introduction of a properly positioned consensus TATA element in the minimal cyclin D1 core promoter is able to fully restore basal transcriptional activity at 39.5 °C in ts13 cells. However, full recovery of activated transcription was not observed when similar experiments were carried out with a longer cyclin D1 promoter fragment containing the upstream activating Sp1 sites. These findings suggest a dual function for TAF1 in cyclin D1 transcription, one of which is required for efficient TFIID binding to the core promoter to initiate the transcription cycle. ts13 and ts13R3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified incubator containing 10% CO2 at 33.5 °C and 39.5 °C, respectively. To inactivate TAF1 and induce cell cycle arrest, ts13 cells were shifted to 39.5 °C. ts13 and ts13R3 cells that constitutively express HA-epitope-tagged ts13 and wild-type alleles of human TAF1, respectively, were established as follows. Cells were transfected with a cytomegalovirus expression vector for the HA-tagged mutant or wild-type TAF1 protein along with a neomycin expression plasmid at a ratio of 10 to 1. After 24 h, cells were plated into media containing 1 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant colonies were isolated and clonally expanded, and the expression of the HA-tagged TAF1 was determined by Western blotting with the anti-HA mAb 12CA5. HA-positive cell lines were passaged in 200 μg/ml G418 to maintain expression of the HA-tagged TAF1. Sf9 insect cells were propagated in Hanks' TNM-FH insect media (JRH Biosciences) containing 10% FBS,l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cultures were grown in spinner flasks at 27 °C in the absence of CO2. An upstream fragment of the hamster cyclin D1 promoter was PCR amplified from ts13 genomic DNA using the following primer pair: 5′-AGGAAATAATGGCCACCATCTTG-3′ and 5′-CTTTCAATTTCATCAACAGTG-3′, designed from alignment of rat, mouse, and human cyclin D1 promoter sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AF148946, AF212040, andZ29078, respectively). A hamster-specific primer 5′-TCTTGAGCTGTTGCTGGGATTTT-3′, based on the above PCR product, and a primer (5“-GTCAGGGTACGCGCGGC-3′) from alignment of downstream rat, mouse, and human cyclin D1 gene sequences available in GenBankTM (accession numbers AB042564, AF212040, andZ29078, respectively) were used to PCR-amplify an 895-bp fragment representing the hamster cyclin D1 promoter from ts13 genomic DNA. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pCRII TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence was determined. The sequence of the hamster promoter fragment has been deposited into GenBankTM under accession number AF539477. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-TGCCTCGCGCTCTACTGCC-3′), complementary to the hamster cyclin D1 sequence, was used in reverse transcription reactions with 5 μg of total RNA from either asynchronously growing ts13 cells or ts13 cells synchronized in G1 ∼ 8 h after release from serum starvation. Reaction products were separated on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Promoter fragments to be examined in transient transfection assays were subcloned into pGL2-basic (Promega), a reporter plasmid that contains the luciferase coding region. Mouse c-fos reporter contains −356 to +58 of the mouse gene as previously described (16Wang E.H. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The 895-bp PCR fragment representing the hamster cyclin D1 promoter was restriction digested with NotI to remove the translational start codon, blunt-ended with Klenow, and subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL2-basic to produce −714/+109 cycD1-luc. The following cyclin D1 promoter fragments were also introduced into the SmaI site of pGL2-basic. The BstXI to NotI fragment from the cyclin D1 promoter was used to construct −439/+109 cycD1-luc. −55/−22 cycD1-luc was generated by annealing 5′-AGGGGAGTTTTGTTGAAGTTGCAAAGTCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGACTTTGCAACTTCAACAAAACTCCCCT-3′ and subcloning the double-stranded oligonucleotide into pGL2-basic. The remaining cyclin D1 deletion constructs were generated by PCR. The fragment for −183/+109 cycD1-luc was amplified using 5′-CGCTTTGGGCTTGTCCCCCT-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGGTACGCGCGGC-3′ and digested with NotI, and the ends were blunted with Klenow. The fragment for −183/+21 cycD1-luc was amplified using the primers 5′-CGCTTTGGGCTTGTCCCCCT-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCCGCTCTCTGCTACGCG-3′. Primers 5′-TTCTCTGCCGGGCTTTGATC-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCCGCTCTCTGCTACGCG-3′ were used to synthesize the promoter fragment for −107/+21 cycD1-luc. −183/+21 wtTATA cycD1-luc and −183/+21 mtTATA cycD1-luc were constructed as follows. APstI site was introduced into −183/+21 cycD1-luc upstream of the TDE1 by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers 5′-GTCACACGGACTGCAGGGGAGTT-3′ and 5′-AACTCCCCTGCAGTCCGTGTGAC-3′. The wild-type TDE1 was dropped out as a PstI fragment and replaced with a double-stranded oligonucleotide derived from one of the following two primer sets: (for wild-type TATA) 5′-GTATAAAGGGGAGTTTTGTTGAAGTTGCAAAGTCCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GCAGGACTTTGCAACTTCAACAAAACTCCCCTTTATACTGCA-3′; (for mutant TATA) 5′-GGAGAAAGGGGAGTTTTGTTGAAGTTGCAAAGTCCTGCA-3′; and 5′-GCAGGACTTTGCAACTTCAACAAAACTCCCCTTTCTCCTGCA-3′. −107/+21 wtTATA cycD1-luc and −107/+21 mtTATA cycD1-luc were generated using −183/+21 wtTATA cycD1-luc and −183/+21 mtTATA cycD1-luc, respectively, and primers 5′-TTCTCTGCCGGGCTTTGATC-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCCGCTCTCTGCTACGCG-3′ in PCR reactions. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL2-basic. Before the introduction of DNA, ts13 cells, seeded into 24-well plates, were maintained at 33.5 °C or shifted to 39.5 °C for 2 h. Cells were then switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no FBS and no antibiotics. 0.1 μg of SV40-β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and 0.25 μg of the cyclin D1 or c-fos reporter constructs were transfected into cells using the LipofectAMINE and Plus reagents as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) with the following modification: the amount of Plus reagent used was reduced by 50%. After 3 h, FBS to 10% final concentration and antibiotics were added to the cell culture media. Whole cell lysates were prepared using Report Lysis buffer (Promega) between 16 and 18 h post-serum addition. The amount of luciferase activity was determined using thePromega luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described (32Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was used to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. ts13 and ts13R3 cells were arrested in G0 by serum starvation for 36 h at 33.5 °C, then released at either 33.5 °C or 39.5 °C by the addition of serum. Approximately 8 h post-serum addition, cells were treated with 0.01% DMS for 2 min. Genomic DNA was isolated and methylated at guanine/adenine nucleotides as described with the following minor modifications (33Mueller P.R. Wold B. Garrity P.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Boston, MA1992: 15.5.8-15.5.13Google Scholar). For the preparation of genomic DNA, the ethyl ether extraction was eliminated from the protocol, and the isopropanol precipitation was replaced with an ethanol precipitation. Sites of guanine and adenine methylation were chemically cleaved and sites of cleavage in the hamster cyclin D1 promoter were mapped using the technique of ligation-mediated PCR (34Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. Methods. 1997; 11: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of genomic DNA served as template in a first-strand synthesis reaction with the following primers: upper strand, 5′-CTGCCTCGCCGTCTACTGCC-3′; lower strand, 5′-TCCCGAGCCCCCTCCCCCT-3′. Linkers were then ligated onto the blunt-ended products. Next, a linker and nested gene-specific primer (upper strand, 5′-GTCTCCGAGCGCGCGAATCT-3′; lower strand, 5′-GCGCCCGCCCAGTCCTTCC-3′) were used to amplify the cleavage products. The resulting PCR products were end-labeled with the following 32P-labeled primers (upper strand, 5′-ATCTGCCGCTCTCTGCTACGCG-3′; lower strand, 5′-CCCCTCCCTTTCTCTGCCTGGCT-3′). Reaction products were separated on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. ts13 and ts13R3 nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (16Wang E.H. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) from synchronized cells that had been serum-starved and released into the cell cycle for 8–12 h by serum addition. The preparation of HeLa nuclear extracts and fractionation of the extracts on phosphocellulose to obtain the TFIID-depleted extract and a partially purified TFIID fraction were carried out following the protocol of Dignam et al.(35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). ts13 or ts13R3 nuclear extracts to be used in binding reactions were equilibrated at 25 °C or 37 °C. Twenty micrograms of each extract was then preincubated at the appropriate temperature for 20 min in 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% polyethylene glycol 6000, 5 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 1 μg of dG-dC, and 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides encompassing the cyclin D1 TDE1 (5′-AGGGGAGTTTTGTTGAAGTTGCAAAGTCCTGCA-3′) or c-foscore promoter (5′-TTCTATAAAGGCACCGGCTGAGGCGCCTACTACTCCAACCGCGACTGCAG-3′) were added, and the reaction continued at 25 °C or 37 °C for an additional 20 min. Reaction mixtures containing the c-fosprobe were separated on high ionic strength 1.2% Mg2+-agarose gels as described previously (36Mantovani R. Tora L. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4873-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and those containing the cyclin D1 TDE1 were run on 1.2% agarose/0.5× TBE gels (37Zerby D. Lieberman P.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Agarose gels were run at 140 v for ∼90 min. Mobility-shifted complexes were detected by autoradiography after the gels were dried onto DE81 filter paper. For the competition assays, 20 μg of extract was preincubated with the indicated molar excess of competitor for 20 min at 25 °C. 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added, and the reaction continued at 25 °C for an additional 20 min. The sequences of the competitor DNAs are as follows: c-fos INR (5′-GGCACCGGCTGAGGCGCCTACTACTCCAACCGCGACTGCAG-3′), c-fos core (5′-TTCTATAAAGGCACCGGCTGAGGCGCCTACTACTCCAACCGCGACTGCAG-3′), NS (5′-AGCTAGGCCGCGAGCGCTTTCATTGGTCCATT), and TDE1 mtINR (5′-AGGGGAGTTTTGTTGAAGTTGCAAAGGGCTGCA-3′). Binding reactions with recombinant HA-TAF1, FLAG-TAF2, and HA-TAF1/FLAG-TAF2 heterodimers were performed essentially as described above and separated on 1.5% agarose/0.5× TBE gels. Recombinant baculovirus vectors used to express HA-tagged TAF1 and FLAG-tagged TAF2 have been previously described (9Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 38Chen J.-L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For protein production, Sf9 cells were seeded at ∼7.5 × 106cells/10-cm dish and infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1–2. Approximately 48 h post-infection, whole cell lysates were prepared by sonication in HEMG buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.4 m KCl. HA-TAF1 and FLAG-TAF2 monomers were immunoaffinity purified from Sf9 whole cell extracts using the anti-HA (mAb 12C5) and anti-FLAG (M2 antibody) antibodies, respectively. TAF1-TAF2 heterodimers were assembledin vitro using the anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies as previously described (39Chen J.-L. Tjian R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 208-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For gel mobility shift assays, all proteins were eluted under native conditions with peptides corresponding to the appropriate antibody epitope (HA: YPYDVPDYA; FLAG: DYKDDDDK) in HEMG buffer containing 0.1 m KCl. To investigate the function of TAF1 in the transcription of cyclin D1 in ts13 cells, we cloned a fragment of the hamster cyclin D1 promoter using a PCR-based approach. Analysis of the endogenous promoter will avoid limitations that may be inherent to the study of a human promoter in hamster cells. A short stretch of the hamster cyclin D1 promoter was PCR-amplified from ts13 genomic DNA using primers designed to regions of high sequence identity between the human, mouse, and rat promoters. To eliminate errors generated during the amplification reaction, several independent PCR products were subcloned and subjected to DNA sequencing. The sequence information available in GenBankTM and obtained from the PCR products were used to design hamster-specific primers that amplified a single 895-bp fragment from ts13 genomic DNA (data not shown). Comparison of this putative hamster cyclin D1 promoter fragment with the previously described human, rat, and mouse genes (27Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kitazawa S. Kitazawa R. Maeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28787-28793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Eto I. Cell. Prolif. 2000; 33: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) revealed a remarkable 65.5%, 83.3%, and 83.7% sequence identity, respectively, in the noncoding region, with even greater sequence identity between −183 and +1, the region of transcriptional initiation (data not shown). The lower percentage of sequence identity found for the human promoter is primarily due to the insertion of short stretches of sequence unique to the human gene. Consistent with the cyclin D1 sequences isolated from other species, the hamster promoter lacks a consensus TBP binding site or TATA element. It also contains numerous binding sites for transcription factors, including the E-box proteins, Oct-1, Sp1, NF-κB, and CREB, most of which are conserved in other mammals, although their exact placements vary slightly (Fig.1). We also mapped the sites of transcription initiation by primer extension. Similar to the rat, mouse, and human promoters, hamster cyclin D1 utilizes multiple transcription initiation sites in ts13 cells (Fig. 2). As a reference point, we defined the most downstream transcriptional start site as +1, which is 124 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon. This numbering system places all identified transcriptional initiation sites between +1 and −32. The two clusters at positions −32 to −29 and −13 to −12 appear to be the preferred sites of transcriptional initiation. We found that the same set of"

In the search for these specific functions, our previous results have demonstrated that the expression of K10, a keratin expressed in postmitotic suprabasal cells of the epidermis, prevents cell proliferation through the inhibition of Akt kinase activity. Given the roles of Akt in NF-κB signaling and the importance of these processes in the epidermis, a study was made into the possible alterations of the NF-κB pathway in transgenic mice expressing K10 in the proliferative basal layer. It was found that the inhibition of Akt, mediated by K10 expression, leads to impaired NF-κB activity. This appears to occur through the decreased expression of IKKβ and IKKγ. Remarkably, increased production of tumor necrosis factor α and concomitant JNK activation was observed in the epidermis of these transgenic mice. These results confirm that keratin K10 functions in vivo include the control of many aspects of epithelial physiology, which affect the cells not only in a cell autonomous manner but also influence tissue homeostasis.

Remarkably, increased production of tumor necrosis factor α and concomitant JNK activation was observed in the epidermis of these transgenic mice. These results confirm that keratin K10 functions in vivo include the control of many aspects of epithelial physiology, which affect the cells not only in a cell autonomous manner but also influence tissue homeostasis.

The functions of these proteins were clarified when human epithelial fragility syndromes were attributed to mutations of epidermal keratin genes (for reviews see Refs. 1Fuchs E.V. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 2McLean W.H.I. Lane E.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E.V. Mol.

However, this shared function does not clearly explain the great diversity of these proteins, which suggests they may have additional family member-specific functions. In the search for possible specific keratin functions, a study was made of keratin K10. This protein is expressed in postmitotic differentiating keratinocytes in epidermis in vivo (5Fuchs E.V. Green H. Cell. 1980; 19: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), and its expression is severely reduced in hyperproliferative situations, including skin tumors (6Toftgard R. Yuspa S.H. Roop D.R. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5845-5850PubMed Google Scholar, 7Roop D.R. Krieg T.M. Mehrel T. Cheng C.K. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3245-3252PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of this keratin inhibits cell proliferation in cultured cells and in transgenic mice (8Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The modulation of cell growth by keratin K10 is linked to the retinoblastoma (pRB) protein and the molecular machinery controlling cell cycle progression during G1, in particular cyclin D1 expression (8Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This activity appears to be promoted by the sequestration of Akt to the keratin cytoskeleton, mediated by keratin K10 through its amino terminus. This leads to decreased Akt kinase activity (9Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). More recently these results have been amplified to include in vivo situations (10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated in which human keratin K10 gene expression was targeted to the basal layer of the epidermis by using the bovine keratin K5 promoter (11Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). These animals displayed severe alterations in the epidermis, including decreased proliferation, which results in hypoplastic epidermis, associated with impaired activation of Akt kinase activity in the skin. Finally, by using chemical skin carcinogenesis protocols, it was demonstrated that K10 expression reduces the formation of tumorsin vivo (10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with the recently described fundamental roles of Akt kinase in mouse skin carcinogenesis (12Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Perez P. Murga C. Santos M. Budunova I.V. Martinez J. Larcher F. Slaga T.J. Gutkind J.S. Jorcano J.L. Paramio J.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role not only in tumorigenesis but also in many aspects of cell physiology (reviewed in Refs. 13Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 14Testa J.R. Bellacosa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 15Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

This kinase phosphorylates many cellular substrates involved in the control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Its role in activating Akt in NF-κB signaling has recently been demonstrated, which may be an essential antiapoptotic event. However, the mechanism responsible for the activation of NF-κB by Akt remains uncertain and may depend on the cell type analyzed (17Factor V. Oliver A.L. Panta G.R. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Arsura M. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The canonical activation of NF-κB requires the phosphorylation of the inhibitory IκB protein by a high molecular weight complex that includes IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ1 proteins. This allows the NF-κB to move to the nucleus and activate target genes. In this context, it has been shown that Akt may increase the transactivation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, without interfering with its nuclear localization (20Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 21Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Similarly, the increased transactivation of p50 subunit by Akt phosphorylation has been reported (23Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzzese J.L. Yung W.K. Reddy S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11402-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of IKK proteins by Akt, leading to increased phosphorylation and thus degradation of IκB proteins, has been widely reported (24Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 25Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8027-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Finally, in breast cancer lines, it has been suggested that Akt mediates the calpain degradation of IκB protein instead of the consensus ubiquitin pathway (28Pianetti S. Arsura M. Romieu-Mourez R. Coffey R.J. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1287-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Collectively, all these studies demonstrate the importance of Akt in activating NF-κB signaling, but also emphasize the controversy in identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for such activation. The importance of NF-κB signaling in epidermis has been highlighted in recent years (reviewed in Ref. 29Kaufman C.K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This stems from findings obtained in transgenic mice ectopically expressing a non-degradable IκBα protein (IκBαM), or which overexpress p50 and/or p65 subunits in the epidermis (30Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In these animals, increased NFκB activity leads to epidermal hypoplasia and growth inhibition, probably in association with p21waf/cip1 expression (30Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 31Seitz C.S. Deng H. Hinata K. Lin Q. Khavari P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4085-4092PubMed Google Scholar). The repression of NF-κB activity, on the other hand, produces epidermal hyperplasia (30Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and may cause spontaneous squamous cell carcinomas in transgenic mice (32van Hogerlinden M. Rozell B.L. Ahrlund-Richter L. Toftgard R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3299-3303PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we have observed increased endogenous NF-κB activity during chemically induced mouse skin tumorigenesis or upon UV treatment of mouse skin (33Budunova I.V. Perez P. Vaden V.R. Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Jorcano J.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7423-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34Perez P. Page A. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 27: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy might be explained in that the overexpression of regulatory molecules used in earlier transgenic studies may differ from those involved in endogenous activity. In this regard, one has to take into account that dominant negative IκBα expression does not generate a true NF-κB null phenotype and that nuclear accumulation of Bcl-3 and its interaction with other NF-κB dimers is independent of inhibition by other IκB proteins and IKK stimulation. In agreement with this, neither tumors nor phenotypic alterations were observed in the absence of IκBM overexpression in epidermis (32van Hogerlinden M. Rozell B.L. Ahrlund-Richter L. Toftgard R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3299-3303PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that a threshold in the level of expression of this protein is required to produce the phenotype. More recently, using a knock inapproach, which does not produce massive overexpression, it has been shown that the repression of NF-κB promotes severe epidermal defects affecting hair follicle development and increased apoptosis but not increased proliferation or abnormalities in differentiation (35Schmidt-Ullrich R. Aebischer T. Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Klemm U. Scheidereit C. Development. 2001; 128: 3843-3853PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the epidermal-specific ablation of IKKβ, which is accompanied by a deficiency in NF-κB activation, results in a TNF-mediated inflammatory skin disease but does not led to hyperproliferation or impaired keratinocyte differentiation (36Pasparakis M. Courtois G. Hafner M. Schmidt-Supprian M. Nenci A. Oksoy A. Krampert M. Goebeler M. Gillitzer R. Israel A. Kireg T. Rajewsky K. Haase I. Nature. 2002; 417: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Another line of information on the roles of NF-κB signaling in keratinocytes comes from the strong phenotypes observed in the epidermis of mice lacking the IKKγ or IKKα subunits of the IKK complex (37Makris C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In the case of IKKα, the abnormalities are not only due to the possible alterations of NF-κB signaling but also to the decreased production of a yet-unidentified soluble factor capable of inducing keratinocyte differentiation (42Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K.I. Yoshida K. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Given the above importance of Akt modulation of NF-κB activity in a range of systems, and the importance of NF-κB in epidermal physiology, an investigation was made into the possible alterations in this pathway that might arise as a consequence of keratin K10 ectopic expression in the basal layer of the epidermis. A dramatic decrease was seen in NF-κB activity in both transgenic skin and cultured mouse keratinocytes. This decrease is attributed to the inhibition of IKK activity associated with decreased expression of IKKβ and IKKγ. Remarkably, the transgenic animals showed aberrant overproduction of TNFα, and concomitant increased JNK activity, which may account for some of the phenotypic characteristics observed in bK5hK10 transgenic mice. The plasmid bK5hK10 was used to generate transgenic mice in a (C57 BL/10 × BALB/c) F1 and (C57BL/10 × DBA/2) F1 genetic background as previously described (10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The presence of the transgene was analyzed by Southern blots. Homozygous and heterozygous mice were identified using a PhosphorImager scanner (Bio-Rad) as reported (10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocyte cultures were established isolating keratinocytes from newborn mice cultured in Eagle's minimal medium containing 8% Chelex-treated serum and 0.03 mm Ca2+ as previously described (43Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Dorsal skin samples and tumors were fixed either in formalin or ethanol and embedded in paraffin prior to sectioning. 4-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Immunodetection of dermal inflammatory cells including T lymphocytes (anti-CD3e), granulocytes (anti-Ly-6G/Gr-1), and macrophages (anti-CD11b/Mac1) was performed in frozen sections using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled specific rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies (145-2C11, RB6–8C5, and M1/70 clones, respectively; Amersham Biosciences). Sections were also stained for the expression of K10 as previously described (10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The localization of TNFα and IL-6 was carried out in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from transgenic and non-transgenic littermates using specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies purchased from Calbiochem and diluted 1/100, followed by horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, diluted 1:2000). Positive staining was determined using diaminobenzidine as a substrate (diaminobenzidine kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. For ultrastructural analysis, skin samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide prior to dehydration and embedding in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The 8xκB-Tk-CAT plasmid reporter gene used for transfection assays contained eight copies of the Igκ enhancer NF-κB binding site. The expression vectors for IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ containing the open reading frame of the indicated genes, and cloned in pCDNA3 under the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer were a generous gift of Dr. A. Israël. The plasmid coding for hK10 has been described previously (8Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for wt and dominant-negative Akt were a generous gift of Dr. J. S. Gutkind. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed using an ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Retrovirus coding for wt Akt or dominant negative Akt were generated by subcloning the corresponding cDNAs into pStMCS vector (kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Segovia, CIEMAT). These plasmids were transfected into Nxe cells and the supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection. For infections, exponentially growing PB keratinocytes were cultured in the presence of retroviral supernatants for 3 h, and afterward fresh medium was added and the cultures were further incubated overnight. Protein extracts were collected after 48 h and used in Western blotting analyses as commented below. The antibodies used included rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p50 (sc-114), p65/RelA (sc-372), IκBα (sc-371), IKKα (sc-7182), IKKγ (sc-8032) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and IKKβ (Imgenex IMG-19). Antibodies against JNK, RIP, TRAF2, and TRADD were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies against phosphorylated ATF2 and JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling. An anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G and anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences, Aylesbury, UK) were used for immunoblotting. IL-1α, was purchased from Endogen and IL-1β and TNFα from Sigma. All cytokines were used at 10 ng/ml. Protein extracts (20 μg) were boiled in Laemmli buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Aylesbury, UK). Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight, washed three times in PBS/0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with the indicated antibodies. After washing, membranes were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed again, and analyzed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (West Picosignal, Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were stripped by incubation with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7)/2% SDS/100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min and reprobed with different antibodies. No cross-reactivity with other NF-κB/IκB/IKK proteins was detected. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed by incubating whole cell extracts from mouse skin with a labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to a palindromic κB site as previously described (44Perez P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3523-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the κB oligonucleotide coding strand was: 5′-GATCCAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTTA-3′ (44Perez P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3523-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes were separated on 5.5% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences) at −70 °C. The composition of the κB complexes in newborn mouse skin has been previously described (34Perez P. Page A. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 27: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whole skin extracts from newborn mice were obtained in buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm disodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The kinase activity for Akt and IKK complexes was determined by immunoprecipitation of the endogenous kinase proteins using anti Akt1/2 antibody or a mixture of different IKKα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Histone H2B was used as a substrate for Akt, and full-length IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for IKK in in vitro kinase assays (essentially as described in Refs. 12Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Perez P. Murga C. Santos M. Budunova I.V. Martinez J. Larcher F. Slaga T.J. Gutkind J.S. Jorcano J.L. Paramio J.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and 45Tanaka M.

Jun kinase assay was performed essentially as described (46Okubo Y. Blakesley V.A. Stannard B. Gutkind S. Le Roith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25961-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) upon immunoprecipitation of JNK using GST-c-Jun (kindly provided by Dr. J. S. Gutkind) as substrate. Total RNA from freshly harvested mouse epidermis and frozen tumors was isolated by guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction. Northern blots containing total RNA (15 μg/lane) were probed for expression of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1 employing DNA probes prepared by random primed reactions using the complete sequences. The membranes were also hybridized with a keratin K14 cDNA probe to verify that equal amounts of mRNA were loaded and transferred. The quantification of TNFα in mouse serum and in the culture supernatant from primary keratinocytes was performed using an ELISA kit (R&D) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Transgenic mice ectopically expressing K10 in the basal layer of the epidermis display severe epidermal abnormalities associated with decreased proliferation in close conjunction with Akt kinase activity inhibition (10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Given the importance of Akt in the activation of NF-κB (see the introduction), the present study was designed to investigate NF-κB binding activity in the epidermis of transgenic mice through electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using a κB-labeled oligonucleotide. In non-transgenic samples, two retarded complexes were observed (Fig.1A, lanes 1 and 2) that were identified as p50-p50 homodimers and p50-p65 heterodimers by supershift experiments using specific antibodies (not shown; see also Ref. 34Perez P. Page A. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 27: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Severely decreased DNA binding activity was observed in heterozygous transgenic mice (Fig. 1A,lanes 3 and 4). The κB binding activity in homozygous animals was barely detectable (Fig. 1A,lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, the inhibition of Akt kinase activity runs in parallel with the increased K10 expression observed in heterozygous and homozygous transgenic mice (Fig.1A′) (not shown, see also Ref. 10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Given that we used whole skin extracts for these experiments, and to rule out the possibility that other cell types were actually responsible for the observed effect, similar analysis were performed using primary keratinocytes derived from wt and bK5hK10 transgenic mice. In addition, we also tested whether stimulation with IL-1α could induce increased DNA binding in these cells. IL-1α treatment led to increased NF-κB activity in non-transgenic keratinocytes but not in keratinocytes derived from transgenic animals (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis against keratin K14 (Fig. 1B′) also demonstrated that this effect was not due to different amounts of keratinocyte protein in the assays. These data show that the expression of K10 leads to a dramatic reduction in NF-κB activity in keratinocytes and impedes the activation of this complex on stimulation. Experiments were then performed to see whether this decreased NF-κB activity was due to K10 expression and K10-mediated Akt inhibition. PB mouse keratinocytes were transfected with a NFκB reporter element (8xκBCAT) plus empty vector, K10, or K10 plus an expression vector for wt Akt (Fig. 1C). It has previously been shown that co-expression of wt Akt is sufficient to override K10-induced cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes (10Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The expression of K10 produced a severe inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity induced either by IL-1β or TNFα (Fig. 1, C and C′, respectively), whereas co-expression of Akt almost completely abolished such inhibition (Fig. 1, C and C′). Finally, to determine whether the inhibition of Akt activity might be sufficient to account for the decreased NF-κB activity, the reporter plasmid was co-transfected with a dominant negative form of Akt, resulting in almost complete inhibition of NF-κB activity in response to TNFα or IL-1β (Fig. 1, C and C′). Together, these results demonstrate that K10-mediated Akt inhibition leads to impaired NF-κB basal activity and NF-κB activation in cultured keratinocytes and in epidermis in vivo. A study was then undertaken to determine whether the decreased NF-κB activity found in the transgenic mouse epidermis was due to altered expression of different NF-κB family members (Fig. 2A). No major alterations in p65 (RelA) or IκBα protein levels were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2A), and a decrease in only p50 was observed in whole skin extracts from homozygous transgenic mice (Fig.2A). Because the NF-κB activity is dependent on the activity of the IKK complex, the expression of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ was analyzed. Surprisingly, in homozygous transgenic mice there was a significant decrease in IKKβ and IKKγ levels (Fig.2A′). Because these two components of the IKK complex are essential for IκB phosphorylation and for NF-κB activation (47Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp.

In this study, we used analytical ultracentrifugation, differential scanning calorimetry, and intrinsic fluorescence to demonstrate that in the presence of the lysine analog ε-aminocaproic acid, apo(a) undergoes a substantial conformational change from a “closed” to an “open” structure that is characterized by an increase in the hydrodynamic radius (∼10%), an alteration in domain stability, as well as a decrease in tryptophan fluorescence. Although ε-aminocaproic acid is a well characterized inhibitor of the non-covalent interaction between apo(a) and low density lipoprotein, we report the novel observation that this ligand at low concentrations (100 μm-1 mm) significantly enhances covalent Lp(a) assembly by altering the conformation of apo(a). We developed a model for the kinetics of Lp(a) assembly that incorporates the conformational change as a determinant of the efficiency of the process; this model quantitatively explains our experimental observations. Interestingly, an analogous conformational change has been previously described for plasminogen resulting in an increase in the hydrodynamic radius, an increase in tryptophan fluorescence, and an acceleration of the rate of plasminogen activation. Although the functions of apo(a) and plasminogen have diverged considerably, elements of structural and conformational homology have been retained leading to similar regulation of two unrelated biological processes.

Lp(a) is comprised of a low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like domain that is covalently attached to a unique glycoprotein, termed apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)). Lp(a) is similar to LDL both in lipid composition and in the presence of apolipoproteinB-100 (apoB-100). As such, the presence of apo(a) likely confers the unique functional and structural properties attributable to Lp(a). Lp(a) is assembled extracellularly (2Koschinsky M.L. Cote G.P.

It is well known that Lp(a) assembly occurs by a two-step process in which non-covalent interactions between apo(a) and apoB-100 precede specific disulfide bond formation (5Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J.

Plasminogen consists of an N-terminal “tail” domain, followed by five distinct kringle domains followed by a trypsin-like latent protease domain. Apo(a) contains multiple repeats of sequences that resemble plasminogen kringle IV, followed by sequences that are homologous to the kringle V and protease domains of plasminogen. The kringle IV domains of apo(a) are further classified into 10 distinct subclasses; the kringle IV type 2 domain (KIV2) is present in variable copy number, which forms the basis for the observed isoform size heterogeneity of apo(a), while the other nine kringle IV types are each present in single copy (8van der Hoek Y.Y. Wittekoek M.E. Beisiegel U. Kastelein J.J.P. Koschinsky M.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The differences in biological function between apo(a) and plasminogen are a function both of the very different domain composition of the two proteins as well as more subtle sequence differences between individual domains. Individual kringle domains in apo(a), as well as the protease-like domain, display striking sequence similarity to the analogous domains in plasminogen (up to 90%). For numerous reasons, the protease domain in apo(a) cannot be activated by activators of plasminogen (9Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L.

As such, it is not surprising that lysine and lysine analogs such as ε-aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA) are effective inhibitors of Lp(a) assembly through inhibition of the non-covalent association between apo(a) and apoB-100 (12Becker L.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Kringle IV type 9 (KIV9) contains an unpaired cysteine residue that mediates disulfide bond formation with apoB-100 to form covalent Lp(a) particles (2Koschinsky M.L. Cote G.P. Gabel B. van der Hoek Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19819-19825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Brunner C. Kraft H.-G. Utermann G. Muller H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Apo(a) also contains a “strong” lysine-binding pocket within kringle IV type 10 (KIV10), that does not contribute to binding to LDL, but rather may mediate binding of apo(a) and Lp(a) to other physiological ligands such as fibrin (14Sangrar W. Koschinsky M.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Harpel P.C. Gordon B.R. Parker T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 10: 3847-3851Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The structure of Lp(a) has been investigated using a variety of biophysical techniques. Electron microscopy studies indicate that Lp(a) is a spherical particle in which apo(a) is in close association with LDL (16Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Woodhead J.L. Higazi A.A. Cain W.J. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Cines D.B. Bdeir K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10424-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a result that is consistent with both the covalent and non-covalent interactions that characterize the process of Lp(a) assembly. Upon the addition of ε-ACA, however, Lp(a) undergoes a dramatic conformational change in which the non-covalent interactions between apo(a) and apoB-100 are disrupted and the apo(a) component dissociates away from the LDL particle; the dissociation is not complete as apo(a) remains anchored to LDL through the disulfide linkage with apoB-100. This change in conformation has been visualized as a decrease in the sedimentation coefficient in the analytical ultracentrifuge (17Fless G.M. Furbee J. Snyder M.L. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2289-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in the appearance of long extended tails on the Lp(a) particles when viewed under the electron microscope (16Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Woodhead J.L. Higazi A.A. Cain W.J. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Cines D.B. Bdeir K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10424-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The conformational change observed in these studies, however, results from a disruption of non-covalent interactions between apo(a) and apoB-100 in the presence of ε-ACA and thus represents an intermolecular structural change rather than an intramolecular conformational change in apo(a). Such an intramolecular conformational switch has been previously described for Glu-plasminogen, resulting in a transition from a “closed” to “open” conformation (18Mangel W.F. Lin B.H. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 1990; 248: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Given the structural homology between apo(a) and plasminogen, we performed a thorough examination of the effect of ε-ACA on the structure of apo(a). Fluorescence spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to determine whether apo(a) undergoes a ε-ACA-induced conformational change, while the significance of this conformational change was assessed with respect to non-covalent binding between apo(a) and LDL as well as covalent Lp(a) assembly. A 17-kringle (17K)-containing form of recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) as well as a construct encoding the weak lysine-binding kringles present within apo(a) KIV5–8were constructed and expressed as previously described (19Koschinsky M.L.

Both r-apo(a) derivatives were purified from the conditioned media (CM) of a stably expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line (19Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of r-apo(a) were performed using an LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 17K or KIV5–8 r-apo(a) (70 nm) was titrated with a range of ε-ACA concentrations. Titrations were performed in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.01% Tween 20 in a quartz cuvette that had been preconditioned with this buffer. Apo(a) tryptophan excitation was performed using a wavelength of 280 nm and a slit width of 2.5 nm, while tryptophan emission was detected at a wavelength of 340 nm and a slit width of 5 nm with a 290-nm cutoff filter placed in the emission beam. Ligand solutions, containing 70 nmr-apo(a) to eliminate dilution effects, were added in a stepwise manner until saturation of the fluorescence change was attained. The resultant fluorescence changes were subsequently subjected to non-linear regression analysis according to equilibrium equations describing one or two binding sites for ε-ACA, as appropriate. Sedimentation experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with a four-hole rotor and 12-mm carbon-filled epoxy double-sector centerpieces for velocity analysis or six-channel centerpieces for equilibrium analysis. The temperature was kept constant at 20 °C. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a rotor speed of 22,500 rpm. Radial scans, at a wavelength of 280 nm, were taken at 5-min intervals, and the data were analyzed with Origin software provided by Beckman-Coulter. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses were preformed at rotor speeds of 4000 and 6000 rpm. The data were analyzed with software provided by Beckman-Coulter. The buffer utilized was HBS in the presence of 0–100 mm ε-ACA. A previously reported value for the partial specific volume of apo(a) (ρ = 0.69) (21Phillips M.L. Lembertas A.V. Schumaker V.N. Lawn R.M. Shire S.J. Zioncheck T.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3722-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used.Sapp values were converted toSw, 20 values by correcting for buffer density and viscosity using the standard equations (22Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). The dependence of ΔSw, 20 on the concentration of ε-ACA was modeled by regression of the data to a simple hyperbolic equation. All differential scanning calorimetry experiments were conducted using a VP-DSC calorimeter (Microcal). Experiments were performed with a scan rate of 90 °C/hr from 10 °C to 110 °C. 17K r-apo(a) was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of HBS prior to use. The dialysis buffer was passed through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore) and used in an initial buffer-buffer scan to obtain a baseline. At this time, the solutions were replaced and protein-buffer scans were performed. Apo(a) was used at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the presence of different concentrations of ε-ACA (0, 5, 10, 50, and 100 mm). After correcting for the buffer-buffer scan and subtracting a progress baseline, the data were modeled according to a non-two-state model using Origin 5.1 software, using equations appropriate for either one or two thermal transitions. The dependence of the ratio of ΔH*mA and ΔHmA, corresponding to the temperature-independent van't Hoff and calorimetric heat changes, respectively, for the second (ε-ACA-dependent) thermal transition of 17K r-apo(a) on the concentration of ε-ACA was modeled according to a simple hyperbolic relationship. LDL was purified from human plasma and labeled with 5′-iodoacetamido-fluorescein as previously described (12Becker L. McLeod R.S. Marcovina S.M. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36155-36162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The concentrations of LDL and fluorescently labeled LDL (flu-LDL) were determined using a modified Bradford assay, and the protein was stored at 4 °C for no longer than 3 days prior to use. Fluorescein fluorescence measurements of flu-LDL were performed using an LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Flu-LDL (50 nm) was titrated with 17K r-apo(a). Titrations were performed in HBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 in a quartz cuvette that had been conditioned with this buffer prior to use. Fluorescein was excited at a wavelength of 495 nm and a slit width of 2.5 nm, while fluorescein emission was detected at a wavelength of 530 nm and a slit width of 5 nm with a 510-nm cutoff filter placed in the emission beam. Ligand solutions, containing 50 nm flu-LDL to eliminate dilution effects, were added in a stepwise manner until saturation of the fluorescence change was attained. At this time, the concentrations of apo(a) (227 nm) and flu-LDL (50 nm) were held constant and ε-ACA was titrated until the reversal of the fluorescence change reached saturation. The fluorescence changes from the apo(a) titration were subjected to non-linear regression according to Equation 1, ΔI=0.5*dI*(KD+[A]0+[B]0−(KD+[A]0+[B]0)2−4[A]0[B]0)(Eq. 1) where ΔI is the measured fluorescence change,dI is the difference between the fluorescence coefficient for LDL in the free and the apo(a)-bound states, KDis the dissociation constant for the flu-LDL:apo(a) interaction, and [A]0 and [B]0 are the total concentrations of 17K r-apo(a) and flu-LDL, respectively. The reversal of the fluorescence change was modeled independently according to Equation 2,ΔI=0.5*dI*(KD+[A]0+[B]0+[E]0KDKE−(KD+[A]0+[B]0+[E]0KDKE)2−4[A]0[B]0)(Eq. 2) where [E]0 is the total concentration of ε-ACA, KE is the dissociation constant for the interaction between ε-ACA and the site(s) on apo(a) that mediates non-covalent association to LDL; all of the other parameters are the same as for Equation 1. HEK 293 cells, grown to 60% confluence in 100-mm plates, were transfected with 10 μg of a plasmid encoding for 17K r-apo(a) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 6 ml of Cys-/Met-DMEM (ICN) and the cells were further incubated for 1 h. At this time, 300 μCi of [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each of three plates, and the labeled protein was allowed to accumulate in the CM for 36 h. After a brief centrifugation at 1000 × g, the CM was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and concentrated 18-fold using a 100-kDa cutoff centricon (Millipore). The concentration of 35S-labeled apo(a) in the CM was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified apo(a) as a standard, and the protein was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until needed. In vitro covalent Lp(a) assembly assays were performed essentially as previously described (11Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 12: 1559-1567Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Purified native LDL (50 nm) was incubated with conditioned media containing 4 nm35 S-labeled 17K r-apo(a) in the presence of a wide range of ε-ACA concentrations (0, 100 nm, 1 μm, 10 μm, 100 μm, 1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 100 mm, 250 mm, 500 mm) at 37 °C in a total volume of 50 μl. Experiments in which the concentration of LDL was varied (80, 70, 50, 20, 10 nm), were conducted as described above with a slightly different ε-ACA concentration range (0, 1 μm, 10 μm, 100 μm, 1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 25 mm, 100 mm). After a 4-h incubation, the reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) sample buffer in the absence of a reducing agent and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were placed in fixing solution (25% methanol, 12.5% acetic acid in double distilled H2O) for 20 min followed by incubation in Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The gels were then dried and exposed onto an Imaging Screen (BioRad) for 16 h. The screen was developed using a BioRad Molecular Imager FX, and the bands were quantified using Quantity One 4.0.1 densitometry software. The extent of r-Lp(a) particle formation was quantified according to the following formula: % Lp(a) = 100 × [ Lp(a)]/([ Lp(a)] + [ apo(a)]). The initial rate of covalent Lp(a) assembly (V0) was estimated by dividing the concentration of Lp(a) by the time of incubation. The initial reaction rates were subsequently modeled with respect to the concentration of ε -ACA using the following relationship in Equation 3, V0[A]0=A+B[E]0C+D[E]0+[E]02(Eq. 3) where V0 is the initial rate of covalent Lp(a) formation (nm Lp(a)/hr), [A]0 and [E]0 are the total concentrations of 35S-labeled 17K r-apo(a) and ε-ACA, andA=LKE1KE2KDk1KINT+k2(Eq. 4) B=Lk2KE1KD(Eq. 5) C=KE1KE21+1KINT+LKD+LKDKINT(Eq. 6) D=KE2+KE1+KE2KINT+KE1LKD(Eq. 7) where L is the total concentration of LDL,KE1 and KE2 are the dissociation constants for the binding of ε-ACA to site 1 and site 2 on apo(a), respectively, KD is the dissociation constant for the interaction between LDL and apo(a),KINT is the intrinsic equilibrium constant between the closed and open conformations of apo(a), andk1 and k2 represent the rate constants for covalent Lp(a) particle formation for the closed and open forms of apo(a), respectively. Equation 3 was derived from first principles and describes a model (see Fig. 6) in which apo(a) contains two classes of sites for ε-ACA; binding at site(s) 1 inhibits the non-covalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB-100, while binding at site(s) 2 is responsible for the enhancement of covalent Lp(a) particle formation by altering the conformational status of apo(a). Titration of a form of recombinant apo(a) consisting of 17 kringle IV domains followed by the kringle V and protease-like domains (17K r-apo(a)) with ε-ACA results in a substantial decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of r-apo(a) as illustrated in Fig.1. Furthermore, the titration profile consists of multiple phases (Fig. 1A). To assist in resolving the phases, we performed a second experiment in which a construct consisting of only the weak lysine-binding kringles (KIV5–8) of apo(a) were titrated with ε-ACA. Titration of KIV5–8 with ε-ACA yielded an increase in tryptophan fluorescence that followed a simple hyperbolic relationship (Fig.1B). Non-linear regression of the fluorescence changes yielded a KD values of 567 ± 49 μm, which is consistent with values previously reported for the weak lysine-binding sites in apo(a) (24Rahman M.N. Becker L. Petrounevitch V. Hill B.C. Jia Z. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Hrzenjak A. Frank S. Maderegger B. Sterk H. Kostner G.M. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Given the fluorescence profile observed with KIV5–8, we modeled the 17K r-apo(a) titration as a combination of two classes of ε-ACA binding sites; the first class of sites corresponds to the initial increase in fluorescence and the second to the subsequent decrease in fluorescence. Regression of the 17K binding data to the model corresponding to two classes of ε-ACA binding sites resulted in a very good fit and yielded KD values of 455 ± 20.7 μm and 69 ± 7.3 mm for the first and second class, respectively (Fig. 1A). It is difficult to ascertain whether the fluorescence changes observed are attributable to quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon binding of ε-ACA to individual kringle domains or whether they are reporting a larger conformational change that may ensue upon ε-ACA binding. To differentiate between these two alternatives, we used analytical ultracentrifugation and differential scanning calorimetry to measure changes in the structural properties of apo(a) in the presence of ε-ACA. Sedimentation velocity experiments demonstrated that the addition of ε-ACA elicits a non-linear decrease in the sedimentation coefficient of 17K r-apo(a) (TableI). The change inSw, 20 is indicative of a conformational change in which the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of apo(a) increases as the addition of 50 mm ε-ACA did not alter the molecular weight of apo(a) in sedimentation equilibrium experiments (Table I). Using the change in Sw, 20(ΔSw, 20) as a signal, the data were modeled according to a simple hyperbolic equation, and a KDof 8.05 ± 2.77 mm was obtained for the interaction between ε-ACA and the site(s) on apo(a) that is involved in an intermolecular interaction(s) (Fig. 2). It is important to note that the dissociation constant obtained using this approach is an apparent KD(KD(app)) as the replacement of an internal ligand by ε-ACA is presumably being measured. Interestingly, an apoB-derived peptide (apoB680–704), which had been previously demonstrated to bind the weak lysine-binding sites in apo(a) with high affinity (12Becker L. McLeod R.S. Marcovina S.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36155-36162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), had no effect on the sedimentation coefficient of 17K r-apo(a) (data not shown). In differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments, the thermal denaturation of 17K r-apo(a) was characterized by a single thermal transition (Tm = 55.2 °C), which was mostly reversible and did not result in an appreciable amount of protein aggregation. The thermal denaturation profile was modeled according to a non-two-state model yielding a temperature-independent calorimetric heat change (ΔHm) of 1.2 × 106kcal/mol, a temperature-independent van't Hoff heat change (ΔH*m) of 6.2 × 104kcal/mol, and a ΔHm/ΔH*m of 19.4. The ratio ΔHm/ΔH*m is indicative of the number of structural units undergoing a particular thermal transition (26Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The 17K r-apo(a) derivative contains 19 total domains (18 kringles and 1 protease domain), which is in good agreement with the experimental value (19.4) obtained. Given the complexity of 17K r-apo(a) (19 domains in total), the single thermal denaturation transition observed in DSC experiments in the absence of ε-ACA suggests that some of the domains within this protein are involved in intramolecular interactions. The addition of ε-ACA resulted in a dose-dependent appearance of an additional thermal transition at a melting temperature that saturated at ∼69 °C with a ΔH*mB/ΔHmBratio of ∼5.3 (Fig. 3,A–E), a result that can be accounted for by two alternative explanations: the binding of ε-ACA results in a stabilization in some of the domains in apo(a) without any accompanying conformational change and/or the addition of ε-ACA leads to a disruption of an intramolecular interaction, which liberates some of the domains in apo(a) resulting in the appearance of a second thermal transition. A simple hyperbolic relationship was used to describe the dependence of ΔH*mB/ΔHmB for 17K r-apo(a) with respect to ε-ACA concentration, yielding aKD(app) value of 7.44 ± 3.06 mm(Fig. 2). The similarity between the KD(app) values obtained using the independent approaches of analytical ultracentrifugation and differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. 2) suggests that these values represent the same physical phenomenon, namely the ability of ε-ACA to stimulate the conversion of apo(a) from a closed to an open conformation. We assume that this conformational change is represented by the substantial decrease in intrinsic fluorescence that characterizes the titration of 17K r-apo(a) with ε-ACA (Fig. 1A).Table IAnalytical ultracentrifugation of 17K r-apo(a) in the presence of ɛ-ACA[ɛ-ACA]Sw,20(sedimentation velocity)ΔSw,20MW (kDa) (sedimentation equilibrium)mm09.210418 ± 2119.040.17NA1-aNA, not applicable. 108.810.40NA 508.530.68420 ± 351008.470.74NA1-a NA, not applicable.

Sixteen amino acids, defined as Spot critical residues (SCR), were identified on the basis of a 50% decrease in CD4 binding to alanine analogs of reactive peptides. Recombinant Fab 13B8.2 mutants were constructed with alanine residues in place of each of the 16 SCR, expressed in the baculovirus cell system, and purified. CD measurements indicated that the mutated proteins were conformationally intact, with a β-sheet secondary structure similar to that of wild-type Fab. Compared with the CD4-binding capacity of wild-type Fab 13B8.2, 11 light (Y32-L, W35-L, Y36-L, H91-L, and Y92-L) and heavy chain (H35-H, R38-H, W52-H, R53-H, F100K-H, and W103-H) Fab single mutants showed a decrease in CD4 recognition as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, BIAcore, and flow cytometry analyses. The five remaining Fab mutants showed antigen-binding properties similar to those of wild-type Fab. Recombinant Fab mutants that showed decreased CD4 binding also lost their capacity to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus promoter activation and the antigen-presenting ability that wild-type Fab displays. Molecular modeling of the 13B8.2 antibody paratope indicated that most of these critical residues are appropriately positioned inside the putative CD4-binding pocket, whereas the five SCR that were not confirmed by mutagenesis show an unfavorable positioning. Taken together, these results indicate that most of the residues defined by the Spot method as critical matched with important residues defined by mutagenesis in the whole protein context. The identification of critical residues for CD4 binding in the paratope of anti-CD4 recombinant Fab 13B8.2 provides the opportunity for the generation of improved anti-CD4 molecules with more efficient pharmacological properties.

To this end, we previously characterized CD4-immunoreactive peptides in the 13B8.2 variable regions using the Spot method of parallel peptide synthesis (13Bès C. Briant-Longuet L. Cerutti L. De Berardinis P. Devauchelle G. Devaux C. Granier C. Chardès T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whereas the Spot method has often been used to map interaction sites in epitopes (14Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (924) Google Scholar), study of the antibody paratope (15Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Villard S. Bès C. Rieunier F. Chardès T. Granier C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 53-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by probing overlapping peptides covering the variable regions of an antibody with labeled antigen was contrary to accepted dogma, probably due to the widely held view that the three-dimensional structure of the antibody is absolutely required for antigen binding. Initial experiments on defining residues critical for lysozyme binding in the HyHEL-5 antibody paratope (16Laune D. Molina F. Ferrières G. Mani J.-C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by the Spot method indirectly suggested that Spot critical residues (SCR) are involved in the “true” antibody paratope because ∼65% of the identified SCR correlated with contributing residues previously defined by x-ray crystallography of the lysozyme-HyHEL-5 complex (17Sheriff S. Silverton E. Padlan E. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S. Finzel B. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8075-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 18Cohen G.H. Sheriff S. Davies D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Until now, no direct demonstration by simultaneous investigation using site-directed mutagenesis of the whole protein and Spot technology has shown that SCR from a given antibody actually belong to the paratope. In this study on the mapping of key residues of Fab 13B8.2 involved in CD4 recognition, we first identified residues important for binding by the Spot approach; then, we used this information to design recombinant Fab 13B8.2 single mutants. These mutated recombinant molecules showed far-UV CD spectra similar to that obtained for wild-type Fab 13B8.2. Replacement of 11 of the 16 SCR with alanine resulted in impaired CD4 binding, thus confirming the results of the Spot antibody mapping. This impaired CD4 binding led to a loss of biological function of the recombinant Fab single mutants with respect to CD4-mediated immune responses. Based on a predicted three-dimensional model, all of these critical residues showed appropriate positioning inside the putative CD4-binding pocket. These results led to a view of the functional paratope of an anti-CD4 antibody and could further lead to a Spot-guided reshaping of anti-CD4 recombinant Fab 13B8.2. CD4-inserted recombinant baculovirus was constructed and further used for the production of recombinant human soluble CD4 as described (8Bès C. Cerutti M. Briant-Longuet L. Bresson D.

In 202 overlapping dodecapeptides frameshifted by one residue, corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence of variable regions from the 13B8.2 antibody, anti-CD4 immunoreactivity was previously observed (13Bès C.

Seventeen hexapeptides covering those immunoreactive amino acid sequences and the six alanine analogs of each peptide were synthesized by the Spot method. Antigen reactivity of cellulose-bound peptides was assayed with biotinylated CD4 (1 μg/ml) under conditions that yielded a blue precipitate on reactive spots as described (13Bès C. Briant-Longuet L.

The reactivity of the spots was evaluated by scanning the membrane and measuring the intensities of the spots with NIH Image Version 1.61 software. The SCR of the 13B8.2 paratope were identified on the basis of decreased antigen-binding capacity equal or superior to 50% of that of the unmodified peptide sequence. The general procedures concerning the cloning and sequencing of mAb 13B8.2 variable regions have been described (8Bès C. Cerutti M. Briant-Longuet L. Bresson D. Péraldi-Roux S. Pugnière M.

The sixteen amino acids demonstrated to be SCR by alanine scanning analysis, two additional residues (Thr53 from the light chain and Val61 from the heavy chain) as controls, and Asn95 in the heavy chain were mutated to alanines. Each mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. For the preparation of heavy chain genes, the PstI/SacI-linearized variable heavy chain fragments were cloned into the plasmid cassette transfer vector pBHuFdγ1, which contains the upstream pre-installed first domain of human Cγ1(Fdγ1), allowing the insertion and expression of the 13B8.2 heavy chain under the control of the polyhedrin promoter (8Bès C.

Irrelevant anti-digoxin Fab 1C10 was expressed similarly in the baculovirus/insect cell system. Each recombinant Fab 13B8.2 mutant was protein G-immunopurified from a 400-ml supernatant of Sf9 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1711) infected with recombinant baculovirus as previously described (8Bès C.

Purified recombinant Fab was quantified by a sandwich ELISA using sheep anti-human Fdγ1 antibody (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) as the capture reagent and peroxidase-conjugated anti-human κ light chain antibody (Sigma) as the detection reagent. Antibody samples were further checked for purity by electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Far-UV CD spectra were measured at 20 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan). The spectra represent an average of two scans recorded at a speed of 20 nm/min and a resolution of 0.1 nm. The antibody concentration was ∼0.5 mg/ml. A cell with a 0.1-cm optical path length was used. Stability was characterized by further examination of the temperature dependence of the CD spectra in the range of 20–80 °C. An ELISA method was performed to screen Fab 13B8.2 mutants for their ability to bind soluble CD4. A 1:500 dilution of the baculovirus-expressed CD4 fraction (8Bès C. Cerutti M. Briant-Longuet L.

Four washes with 160 mm PBS (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS/T) were performed before and after saturating plates in 1% nonfat powdered milk in PBS/T for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, 100 μl of 2-fold serial dilutions of a 2.5 μg/ml antibody solution was added to each well. Following incubation for 2 h and four washes with PBS/T, bound antibodies were detected by addition of 100 μl of a 1:1000 solution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-human κ light chain antibody, followed by subsequent addition of peroxidase substrate. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm. A similar ELISA experiment was performed to study the pH dependence of CD4 binding to wild-type Fab 13B8.2, except that the antibody was diluted in 0.2m sodium phosphate buffer at various pH values, obtained by mixing different volumes of 0.2 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate and 0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate stock solutions. The kinetic parameters of the binding of CD4 to Fab 13B8.2 were determined at 25 °C by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Baculovirus-expressed CD4 was covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip surface using the amine coupling method according to the manufacturer's instructions. A control reference surface was prepared using the same chemical treatment of the flow cell surface without injection of CD4. Recombinant Fab mutants in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 3 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% nonionic surfactant P20 (BIAcore AB) were then injected at concentrations between 5 and 20 μg/ml over the flow cell, and the dissociation phase was followed by a regeneration step with 5 mm HCl solution. The flow rate was 30 μl/min. All the sensorgrams were corrected by subtracting the low signal from the control reference surface. The data were globally fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding isotherm using BIAevaluation Version 3.2 software (26Karlsson R. Roos H. Fägerstam L. Persson B. Methods (Orlando). 1994; 6: 99-110Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The binding of wild-type or mutated Fab to membrane CD4 was evaluated by flow cytometry. A2.01/CD4 T cells (1 × 106) were incubated with PBS containing 0.2% BSA (PBS/BSA) or with PBS/BSA supplemented with each recombinant Fab 13B8.2 mutant or irrelevant anti-digoxin Fab 1C10 expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system. A similar experiment was performed with A2.01 T cells (a CD4-negative cell line). After three washes with PBS/BSA, bound antibodies were revealed by incubation of 50 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human κ light chain antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After three subsequent washes with PBS/BSA, the fluorescence intensity was measured on an EPICS cytofluorometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Peptide-pulsed EBV-Lu antigen-presenting cells (105/well) were co-cultured with pdb10F responder T cells (2 × 104/well) as described (8Bès C. Cerutti M. Briant-Longuet L. Bresson D. Péraldi-Roux S.

Wild-type or mutated Fab 13B8.2 (20 μg/ml) was then added to the cells, which were subsequently cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, 100 μl of supernatant was harvested and tested for IL-2 secretion using a commercial ELISA kit (Pharmingen). HeLa P4 indicator cells (8 × 104/ml) were cultured in medium supplemented or not with infectious HIV-1Lai in the presence or absence of Fab (20 μg/ml) for 3 days, harvested, and lysed. β-Galactosidase activity was then determined as previously described by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm (27Monnet C. Laune D. Laroche-Traineau J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Briant L. Bès C. Pugnière M. Mani J.-C. Pau B. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Devaux C. Granier C. Chardès T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3789-3796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of the variable heavy and light chains of the 13B8.2 antibody was obtained using the research version of the antibody modeling software AbM (Accelrys, Cambridge, UK) (28Rees A.R. Martin A.C.R. Pedersen J.T. Searle S.M.J. AbM, a Computer Program for Modeling Variable Regions of Antibodies. Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar) running on an O2 R5000 Silicon Graphics work station. The CDR-L2, -L3, -H1, and -H2 loops were constructed using canonical class 1 frameworks and the CDR-L1 loop using a canonical class 2 framework, as defined by AbM. The CDR-H3 loop was built up using the combined data base/CONGEN search, a conformational generator program implemented in AbM, combined with a three-dimensional structural data base search. Hydrogens were added to the model using SYBYL software (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO), and the model was minimized during 100 iterations with the Tripos force field and the conjugate gradient method to eliminate all small steric conflicts. The solvent-accessible surface areas of 13B8.2 residues were calculated on the three-dimensional model by the SALVOL program (29Pearlman R.S. Natl. Inst. Drug Abuse Res. Monogr. 1991; 112: 62-77Google Scholar) and implemented in SYBYL. Seventeen hexapeptides from previously identified antigen-binding sequences from the variable regions of the 13B8.2 antibody (13Bès C. Briant-Longuet L. Cerutti L. De Berardinis P. Devauchelle G. Devaux C. Granier C. Chardès T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and sets of alanine analogs were synthesized onto a cellulose membrane by the Spot method to identify antibody residues critically involved in CD4 binding. A detailed study of the reactivity of sequence 49–57 from the CDR-H2 region of the 13B8.2 antibody is shown as an example in Fig.1 (A and B). Substituting Trp52 of peptide49GVIWRS54 (designated as control peptide 1) with alanine led to a 50% decrease in CD4-binding capacity, whereas changing Arg53 led to an almost complete loss of antigen reactivity. The four other alanine replacements in peptide49GVIWRS54 did not modify CD4-binding ability. The contribution of Trp52 and Arg53 to CD4 binding was confirmed by alanine scanning of peptide52WRSGIT57 (Fig. 1, A andB), designated as control peptide 2. Similar experiment using alanine analogs of hexapeptides61VPFMSR66 and65SRLSIT70 from the CDR-H2 region identified Arg66 as another CD4-binding residue (data not shown). Thus, the key residues from the H2 region were determined to be Trp52 and Arg53 (belonging to the CDR) and Arg66 (Fig. 1C). In a similar manner, Phe32, His35, Trp36, and Arg38 were determined by alanine scanning analysis of the three hexapeptides31TFGVHW36, 34VHWVRQ39, and 36WVRQSP41 from the H1 region of the 13B8.2 antibody, with two residues (Phe32 and His35) being involved in the H1 region (Fig. 1C). The CD4-binding residues Cys92, Phe100K, Tyr102, and Trp103 (Phe100K and Tyr102 from CDR-H3 and the two other residues from frameworks) were determined from the three hexapeptides 90YYCAKN95,92CAKNDP97, and99TGFAYW103 from the H3 region. Study of the four hexapeptides 19VTFTCR24,21FTCRAS26, 32YLAWYQ37, and 35WYQQKQ40 from the L1 region identified Arg24, Tyr32, Trp35, Tyr36, and Lys39 as contributing to CD4 binding. Because no reactivity was observed in the L2 region (13Bès C. Briant-Longuet L. Cerutti L. De Berardinis P. Devauchelle G. Devaux C. Granier C. Chardès T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), no critical residue could be identified. The motif88C- -HY92 contributed to CD4 binding, as defined by Spot alanine scanning analysis of the three hexapeptides85TYYCQH90,88CQHHYG93, and91HYGNPP96 from the L3 region, with His91 and Tyr92 belonging to CDR-L3 (Fig.1C). Taken together, 19 residues from the 13B8.2 variable heavy and light chain sequences were identified as contributing to CD4 binding by alanine scanning of previously identified CD4-binding peptides. These residues, defined on the basis of their importance in the Spot assay, were named SCR. However, among them, Arg66from the heavy chain and Arg24 and Lys39 from the light chain were systematically found not to be accessible to the solvent in the three-dimensional structure of antibodies and have never been previously identified as critical residues for antigen binding (30MacCallum R.M.

To date, the kinetics of interaction of only one of these sites has been characterized. Using C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine in both [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel experiments we characterized another site on the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) with which ryanoids interact. Competitive binding of this ryanoid to RyR2 implied a minimal two-site binding model. At the single channel level, C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine induced three distinct effects. At nanomolar concentrations, it increased channel open probability severalfold without inducing a subconductance. This effect was independent of membrane holding potential. As for other ryanoids, low micromolar concentrations of C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine readily induced a subconductance state. The major subconductance had a current amplitude of 52% of fully open, it was reversible, and its time to induction and duration were voltage- and concentration-dependent, affording Hill slopes of >2. At higher micromolar concentrations C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine induced long lasting, yet reversible shut states. Using a pharmacological strategy we have discerned an additional ryanoid-binding site on RyR2 that triggers an increase in channel activity.

They play an integral role in releasing calcium ions from the internal sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum to mediate distinct cascades of events that culminate in such vital functions as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion, and lymphocyte activation (1Meissner G.

In calcium efflux assays using junctional sarcoplasmic reticular membrane vesicles from fast skeletal muscle, low micromolar concentrations of ryanodine activate (i.e. open) RyR1, whereas higher concentrations deactivate or close them (8Meissner G.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 412-421PubMed Google Scholar). At the single channel level two effects of ryanodine are typically observed, namely induction of a persistent subconductance state and long-lasting channel closure (11Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tinker A. Sutko J.L. Ruest L. Deslongchamps P. Welch W. Airey J.A. Gerzon K. Bidasee K.R.

Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The latter is termed the shut state to distinguish it from brief closures that occur spontaneously (14Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12176-12186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These two effects are reminiscent of channel activation and deactivation seen at the aggregate channel level in membrane vesicles. In a recent study using frog twitch fibers we observed that prior to induction of the subconductance state (seen as a steady glow in this preparation) and channel shutting (recorded as inhibition of depolarization-evoked calcium release), ryanodine increased the frequency of spontaneous sparks (15Hui C. Bidasee K.R. Besch H.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 327-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This increase in sparking frequency, similar to that reported by Gonzales et al. (16Gonzalez A. Kirsch W.G. Shirokova N. Pizarro G. Brum G. Pessah I.N. Stern M.D. Cheng H. Rios E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4380-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggests that in addition to the two well documented effects, ryanodine may also induce an earlier effect, namely an increase in channel gating frequency. Two prior studies suggested that nanomolar concentrations of ryanodine may increase the probability of RyR opening (Po) without inducing the subconductance state (17Buck E. Zimanyi I. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23560-23567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bull R. Marengo J.J. Suarez-Isla B.A. Donoso P. Sutko J.L. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 749-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because none of these earlier studies recorded dose dependence, ryanodine per se appears unable to discriminate between functional sites that induce increases in channel gating and those producing the subconductance state. Identifying ryanoids that can discriminate between sites having different functional effects is key to elucidating the phenomena behind ryanoid-induced changes in RyR properties. In a previous study we found that pyridylryanodine (C3-O-[pyridylcarbonyl]ryanodol) has activating potency and efficacy similar to those of ryanodine, despite its lower affinity (14Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12176-12186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data suggested that pyridylryanodine or a derivative thereof might be able to discriminate between putative subpopulations of binding sites on RyR. It is also likely that a ryanoid belonging to this group might bind reversibly to RyR2, because like three other reversible ryanoids reported in the literature, it too has a substituent on the A-ring (C3 carbon) that differs from that of ryanodine (6Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tinker A. Sutko J.L. Ruest L. Deslongchamps P. Welch W. Airey J.A. Gerzon K. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2110-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also reasoned that additional reversibility and subsite selectivity might be engineered into pyridylryanodine by relaxing a ring constraint of its skeleton backbone. In the present study we used binding and single channel experiments to show that a modified congener of pyridylryanodine, namely C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine (C3-O-[pyridylcarbonyl]C4,C12-seco-C4,C12-dioxoryanodol) induces three distinct and separate concentration-dependent effects on canine RyR2. For comparison, we also detail the binding and single channel properties of its parent ryanoid, pyridylryanodine. The pyridylryanodine used in this study was isolated from chipped Ryania wood supplied by Integrated Biotechnology Corporation (Carmel, IN) and purified by chromatography to ≥99% (19Bidasee K.R.

[3H]Ryanodine (specific activity 87 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Precoated silica gel plates (with fluorescence indicator) were obtained from Sigma. Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents, buffers and solvents used were of analytical grade. Synthesis of C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine (for structure, see Fig. 1) was carried out as described (20Kelly I.R.B. Whittingham D.J. Wiesner K. Can. J. Chem. 1951; 29: 905-910Crossref Google Scholar, 21Jefferies P.R. Lehmberg E. Lam W.W. Casida J.E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 mg (49 μmol) of pyridylryanodine was dissolved in 2 ml of methanol and 113 mg (588 μmol) of periodic acid was added. The solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, at the end of which 1 ml of water was added. The reaction mixture was then extracted with 3 × 25 ml of methylene chloride. The pooled methylene chloride fractions were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and rotary evaporated to dryness. The residue was redissolved in 2 ml of methylene chloride and chromatographed on a silica gel column (20 g), eluting sequentially with 100 ml each of methylene chloride, methylene chloride/2% methanol, and methylene chloride/4% methanol. The fractions containing the product of interest were pooled and rotary evaporated to dryness before being redissolved in dioxane for freeze drying. The structure of the product was confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry. Purity was ascertained using thin layer chromatography (spraying with 5% ceric ammonium nitrate in 80% phosphoric acid and charring), analytical high performance liquid chromatography, and electrospray mass spectrometry. Animal procedures used in this study were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Crude sarcoplasmic reticular membrane vesicles (a mixture of junctional and longitudinal) were prepared from canine heart as described previously (22Bidasee K.R. Maxwell A. Reynolds W.F. Patel V. Besch Jr., H.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1074-1083PubMed Google Scholar), except that aprotonin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (0.5 μg/ml), and benzamide (80 μm) were added to isolation, homogenization, and storage buffers. These vesicles were used for [3H]ryanodine displacement binding affinity assays to determine the affinity of ryanoids for RyR2. Junctional sarcoplasmic reticular membrane vesicles were prepared in the presence of the protease inhibitors, using discontinuous sucrose gradients as described previously (23Meissner G. Lai F.A. Anderson K. Xu L. Liu Q.Y. Herrmann-Frank A. Rousseau E. Jones R.V. Lee H.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 304: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Junctional sarcoplasmic reticular membrane vesicles were solubilized with CHAPS and 30 S RyR2 complexes were isolated by rate density gradient centrifugation and reconstituted into proteoliposomes (24Lee H.B. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13305-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinities of ryanodine and pyridylryanodine for RyR2 were determined from their ability to compete with [3H]ryanodine for binding sites on the receptor (20Kelly I.R.B. Whittingham D.J. Wiesner K. Can. J. Chem. 1951; 29: 905-910Crossref Google Scholar, 22Bidasee K.R. Maxwell A. Reynolds W.F. Patel V. Besch Jr., H.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1074-1083PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine for RyR2 was determined as described previously, except that 1 μmryanodine was used to determine nonspecific binding to accommodate the lower affinity and limited aqueous solubility of the diketone. The binding displacement data were fit by nonlinear regression to one- and two-site competition models given by equations, Y=Ymin+(Ymax−Ymin)/(1+10(X−logEC50))(Eq. 1) Y=Ymin+(Ymax−Ymin)*[fraction1(1+10(X−logEC50(1)))+fraction2/(1+10(X−logEC50(2)))](Eq. 2) where Y is specific binding, X is the logarithm of the concentration of the unlabeled ligand, and log EC50 is the competitor concentration that displaces half of the specifically bound [3H]ryanodine. Goodness of fit was evaluated by F tests and the simpler model was chosen unless the more complex model provided a better fit at p < 0.05. Equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values were ascertained using the Cheng-Prusoff relationship (25Cheng Y-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12222) Google Scholar) given by,Kd=IC50/(1+(L)/KL)(Eq. 3) where L is the concentration of [3H]ryanodine used (6.7 nm) andKL is the equilibrium dissociation constant of [3H]ryanodine (1.2 nm for RyR2 (22Bidasee K.R. Maxwell A. Reynolds W.F. Patel V. Besch Jr., H.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1074-1083PubMed Google Scholar)). Phospholipid bilayers were formed from a suspension of phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine inn-decane (in a ratio of 5:3:2 in a total of 35 mg of phospholipid/ml of n-decane) across a 200-μm diameter hole. Proteoliposomes containing the purified RyR2 were fused with the bilayer. The side of the bilayer to which the proteoliposomes were added was designated the cis side. The trans side was defined as ground. Single channels were recorded in symmetric KCl buffer solution (0.25 m KCl, 20 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.4) with 2 μm calcium or as specified. In this study, free calcium concentrations were titered against EGTA. Ryanoids were made up in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide at concentrations up to 500 times higher than that anticipated for use in the bilayer bath. Accordingly, after dilution in recording buffer the dimethyl sulfoxide concentration in the bath was always less than 1%. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (23–25 °C) and for all data shown, the drugs were added only to the cis chamber. Electrical signals were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed as described (26Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,27Tripathy A. Resch W. Xu L. Valdivia H.H. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Data acquisition and analyses were performed using commercially available instruments and software packages (Axopatch 1D, Digidata 1200A or 1322A and pClamp 8.2, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Normal gating mode is defined to include periods of rapid channel transitions between the closed and full open states, and subconductance mode is defined to include periods in which the channel exhibits a persistent reduced conductance. At high ryanoid concentrations the channel may transition into the shut state and this is distinguished from the brief normal forays to the closed state in the absence of ryanoid. The magnitude of the subconductance state was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the subconductance induced by the ryanoid by the conductance of the channel prior to ryanoid interaction (full conductance). Amplitudes were monitored by manual positioning of cursors at each level corresponding to closed, subconductance, and open conductance states. The probability of the subconductance state (Ps) was calculated from the dwell time in the subconductance divided by the sum of times in normal gating and subconductance modes. Cumulative dwell time histograms in normal gating and in the subconductance mode were obtained by nonlinear regression fits to single and dual phase exponential functions given by the equations,Y=Ymax(1−exp(−KT))(Eq. 4) Y=Ymax1(1−exp(−K1T))+Ymax2(1−exp(−K2T))(Eq. 5) where K is the time constant and T is time. τnorm and τsub are calculated as 0.69/K. Goodness of fit was evaluated by F tests and the simpler model was chosen unless the more complex model provided a better fit at p < 0.05. From the single exponential fit, Kon and Koff were obtained, according to the following defining equations,Kon(V)=(τnorm)−1(Eq. 6) Kon′(V)=Kon/[X](Eq. 7) Koff(V)=(τsub)−1(Eq. 8) where X is the concentration of ryanoid andV is the transmembrane holding potential. At a given ryanoid concentration in solution and at a fixed holding voltage, the apparent dissociation constant is defined by the following.KH(V)=Koff/Kon′(Eq. 9) Dose-response relationships to determine apparent dissociation constants KH(V) at voltages other than 0 mV and Hill slopes (nH) were determined by nonlinear regression fit to the general four parameter logistic equation,PS=Ps(min)+(Ps(max)−Ps(min))/(1+10(KH(V)−X)nH)(Eq. 10) where Ps is the probability of occurrence of the subconductance state (at a given holding potential),Ps(min) and Ps(max) are minimum and maximum probability of substate occurrences, Xis the log concentration of the drug, KH(V) is the log concentration of drug required to elicitPs(0.5) and nH is the Hill slope (28Motulsky H.

Goodness of fit was evaluated by Ftests and the simpler model was chosen unless the more complex model provided a better fit at p < 0.05. The relationships between Kon andKoff and holding potentials were fitted using the defining following equations.Kon(V)=Kon(0)exp(Zon(FV/RT))(Eq. 11) Koff(V)=Koff(0)exp(−Zoff(FV/RT))(Eq. 12) The relationship between Ps and holding potential was fit to the Boltzmann equation,Ps=exp((ztotalFV­Gi)/RT)(Eq. 13) where ztotal is the voltage dependence of the subconductance state induced by ryanoid interacting with RyR2,F is the Faraday constant, V is the transmembrane voltage, and Gi/RT is constant at a holding potential of 0 mV. A strategy similar to that used for the synthesis of C4,C12-diketoryanodine and C4,C12-diketo-9,21-didehydroryanodine (20Kelly I.R.B. Whittingham D.J. Wiesner K. Can. J. Chem. 1951; 29: 905-910Crossref Google Scholar, 21Jefferies P.R. Lehmberg E. Lam W.W. Casida J.E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used for the synthesis of C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine (Fig.1). Using this method pyridylryanodine underwent rapid and selective modification with periodic acid yielding C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine as the primary product. Using gravity silica gel chromatography, the product eluted from the column with methylene chloride/4% methanol and after rotary evaporation and freeze-drying afforded 18 mg (72% yield). The structure of this compound was confirmed using 1H and13C NMR. The purity of C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine was determined to be greater than 99.5% using analytical high performance liquid chromatography (methanol/water, 1:1 as mobile phase, UV detection at 260 nm). Non-UV active contaminants were sought using thin layer chromatography (after spraying the plate with 5% ceric ammonium nitrate in 80% phosphoric acid and charring) and electrospray mass spectrometry. None of these methods revealed contaminants. We have yet to synthesize radiolabeled forms of pyridylryanodine or its congener C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine. As such, the affinities of these ryanoids for RyR2 were determined from their ability to compete with 6.7 nm [3H]ryanodine for binding to RyR2 using equilibrium displacement binding affinity assays. The affinity data for all three ryanoids used in this study were fit by nonlinear regression to one- and two-site competition models given by Equations 1 and 2 under “Experimental Procedures.” The data for ryanodine and pyridylryanodine fit well to the one-site binding model (r2 > 0.99 andsyx < 3.7 for both) yielding IC50 of values of 7.8 ± 0.4 nm (Kd = 1.2 nm ± 0.2 nm) for unlabeled ryanodine and 716.8 ± 13.3 nm (Kd = 108.8 ± 5.4 nm) for unlabeled pyridylryanodine (Fig.2). For C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine, however, the two-site model given in Equation 2 provided a significantly better fit (p = 0.005). The higher affinity site comprises 21% of the total binding sites and has an IC50 of 299.5 ± 49.1 nm (Kd = 45.4 ± 10.4 nm) while the second site constitutes the remainder having an apparent IC50 of 72,170 ± 2169 nm(Kd = 10,962.5 ± 452.8 nm). Extension of the two-site model to a three-site model failed to improve the fit. Also, in preliminary experiments incubation was stopped after 1 and 3 h. Results obtained were similar to those after 2 h, although Bmax was optimal after 2 h incubation. From previous studies we hypothesized that the biphasic effects of ryanoids on RyRs represent interactions with two functionally distinct binding site classes (10Humerickhouse R.A. Besch Jr., H.R. Gerzon K. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Emmick J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 412-421PubMed Google Scholar, 29Humerickhouse R.A. Bidasee K.R. Gerzon K. Emmick J.T. Kwon S. Sutko J.L. Ruest L. Besch Jr., H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30243-30253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pyridylryanodine is unique among ryanoids investigated so far in that with calcium flux assays it functionally separates activation from deactivation while preserving the full extent of both. So separate are the dual concentration-effect curves of pyridylryanodine that their intersection presents a plateau, in marked contrast to the peak typical of other ryanoids (14Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12176-12186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present studies on single RyR2 in bilayers provide an explanation for the plateau: pyridylryanodine increasesPo in two concentration-dependent steps as described below. At the threshold concentration of 500 nm pyridylryanodine (in a final concentration of 0.02% dimethyl sulfoxide in thecis recording bath) channel Po was significantly increased within 2 min (Fig.3) from 0.05 ± 0.01 to 0.14 ± 0.02 at +60 mV, and from 0.06 ± 0.01 to 0.22 ± 0.5 at −60 mV, in four of five experiments. The Po increase resulted from increases in both the frequency of transitions between closed and full open states (number of events increased from 60 ± 5 to 200 ± 18 per s) and the mean dwell time in the open state (from 0.5 ± 0.1 to 1.5 ± 0.3 ms). Poincreases were seen equally at positive and negative holding potentials. This effect was not observed when dimethyl sulfoxide alone (with 1.0% dimethyl sulfoxide Po increased by 126 ± 32% as of control, n = 7) or when lower concentrations of pyridylryanodine (50–200 nm in dimethyl sulfoxide) were added to the cis chamber, even after 15 min. Doubling the cis concentration of pyridylryanodine to 1 μm readily induced a persistent subconductance state of RyR2 (Fig. 4). The current amplitude of this subconductance state was 0.32 ± 0.01 (n = 12) of fully open (764 ± 6 versus 246 ± 9 pS). Whereas the subconductance amplitude characterizes different ryanoids, the appearance of a subconductance is common among all ryanoids. Induction of the subconductance state of pyridylryanodine was more likely to occur and persisted for longer times at positive holding potentials. In fact, the time to modification and probability of occurrence of this subconductance state was about 6.5 times more likely to occur at positive holding potentials than at negative potentials. It should be pointed out that in most experiments (five of seven), thePo of RyR2 in the normal gating mode immediately prior to and after reversal of the subconductance state was higher than the channel Po prior to addition of the drug (Fig. 4A, lower panels). As with most other ryanoids, detailed kinetic analyses of the interaction of pyridylryanodine with the site that induces the subconductance state were precluded by its slow dissociation kinetics. In one of five experiments pyridylryanodine (10 μm) produced an alternate subconductance state, which had a current amplitude of 60% of full open (data not shown). The dwell time in this subconductance state lasted tens of seconds to minutes. This second subconductance state could not have been due to an impurity because three sensitive analytical techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”) all indicated the presence of only pyridylryanodine in solution. At concentrations greater than 10 μm, pyridylryanodine readily induced a reversible shut state of the channel (Fig.5). Although induction of this shut state occurred both at −60 and +60 mV, the dwell time was shorter at +60 mV (1.1 ± 0.2 compared with 1.9 ± 0.3 s,n = 6). Mechanistic interpretation of the shorter dwell time at positive holding potentials is confounded by the voltage dependence of induction of the subconductance state. At −60 mV,Ps is small so that shutting can occur without prior intervention of the subconductance state. As shown in Fig. 5, at +60 mV the channel reverts from shut back to the subconductance state, whereas at −60 mV it reverts from shut back to the normal gating mode. Taken together, these results show that pyridylryanodine is able to induce three distinct dose-dependent effects on single RyR2 channels. At nanomolar concentrations it increasesPo without altering unitary conductance, at low micromolar concentrations it induces a major subconductance state, and at higher concentrations it causes a persistent but nevertheless reversible shut state. These three functional effects were not predicted from the binding studies with RyR2 in vesicles, perhaps because of its weak subsite selectivity. Moreover, high affinity of pyridylryanodine precluded detailed kinetic analyses. A pyridylryanodine derivative with greater subsite selectivity and faster kinetics was therefore desirable. We reasoned that both might be achieved by reducing the rigidity of the ryanoid skeletal backbone. Two principal ways to relax the skeletal backbone of pyridylryanodine are through partial oxidation of either (i) the vicinyl diols on C4 and C12 with concomitant breakage of the carbon-carbon bond that is shared by the A and B rings, or (ii) the hemiacetal moiety of the d-ring, leading to breakage of the C1,C15 carbon-carbon bond and thereby eliminating the E ring (20Kelly I.R.B. Whittingham D.J. Wiesner K. Can. J. Chem. 1951; 29: 905-910Crossref Google Scholar, 21Jefferies P.R. Lehmberg E. Lam W.W. Casida J.E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study we used the former, affording C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine (Fig.1). As shown in the example records of Fig.6A, addition of 50 nm C4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine to the cis chamber approximately doubled the channelPo at holding potentials of +35 and −35 mV (184% at +35 mV and by 212% at −35 mV). This increasedPo was independent of the concomitant addition of 0.02% dimethyl sulfoxide. Closer examination of the recordings showed that the increase in Po resulted from increases in gating frequency (the number of events/time) and mean open time (Table I). Data from nine experiments show that the normalized Po was significantly increased by 50 nmC4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine equally at both holding potentials, to mean values of 165 ± 30% at +35 mV and 183 ± 30% at −35 mV (Fig. 6B).Table IChannel parameters that are altered by 50 nmC4,C12-diketopyridylryanodine−35 mV+35 mVPo (as % of control)239 ± 361-aSignificantly different from control atp < 0.05.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). The Cdks active in G1 include the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex and cyclin D complexes with Cdk4 and Cdk6 (2Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of a Cdk can be regulated at three levels (3Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar): cyclin binding and activation, subunit phosphorylation, and inhibition by one of a group of small regulatory proteins, called Cdk inhibitors (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex plays an important role in oncogenesis.Cyclin D1 and Cdk4 genes are often amplified or overexpressed in many types of cancer (5Bartek J. Staskova Z. Draetta G. Lukas J. Stem Cells (Dayt.). 1993; 11 Suppl. 1: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, experimental overexpression of cyclin D1 can induce oncogenic transformation both in cultured cells and in transgenic mice (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 7Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V.

Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). One of the targets of cyclin D-Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) is pRB, the product of a known tumor suppressor gene. p16ink4a (referred to hereafter as p16), a regulator of cyclin D-Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), is also an important tumor suppressor gene product. It is noteworthy that very few human tumors have mutations in more than one of these elements. For example, mutations in p16 and Rb seem to be mutually exclusive, with very few tumors carrying mutations in both genes (9Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This has been taken as evidence that p16-cyclin D-Cdk4-pRB form part of a biological pathway. Alteration of this path contributes to the oncogenic phenotype of the cancer cell, but once the path is altered, the mutation of another element confers no further selective advantage to the cell bearing it. Despite the relevance of the cyclin D-Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) complex in tumorigenesis, its role in cell cycle progression is still not clear. This complex can in principle play two different roles in this respect. On one side, it has a kinase activity per se that is known to phosphorylate some substrates, at least pRB and its two related proteins, p107 and p130 (10Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H.

On the other hand, it can bind to the kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 and sequester them from Cdk2-containing complexes (13Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14McConnell B.B. Gregory F.J. Stott F.J. Hara E. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative importance of these two activities in cell cycle progression is still not completely settled. Several experiments support the idea that an important role of cyclin D-Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) in cell cycle progression is to be a titrator of Cdk2 inhibitors. The Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) inhibitor p16 not only can inhibit the Cdk4 and Cdk6 kinase activity; it also disrupts cyclin D-Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) complexes and displaces the p27 bound by these complexes, leaving it free to inhibit Cdk2 (14McConnell B.B. Gregory F.J. Stott F.J. Hara E. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indirect inhibition of Cdk2 is essential for p16-mediated growth arrest (13Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of Cdk4, Cdk4N158 (dnCdk4), can inhibit the kinase activity of endogenous Cdk4, but it does not induce displacement of p27 to Cdk2 complexes, and it does not induce growth arrest when overexpressed (13Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15van den Hueven S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of cyclin E can override the growth arrest imposed by p16 (16Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These results suggest that growth arrest mediated by p16 is due to its inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes. Fibroblasts derived from Cdk4 knockout mice show a delay in G1 progression when stimulated to proliferate from quiescence that has also been suggested to be related to the displacement of p27 to Cdk2-containing complexes (17Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Furthermore, substitution of the cyclin D1 gene with cyclin E restores the defects caused by cyclin D1 deficiency in mice, showing that if there is cyclin E activity, cyclin D1 is dispensable (18Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some experiments suggest that the kinase activity of cyclin D-Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) plays a role in cell cycle progression, even if it is not essential for the completion of the cell cycle. Specifically, overexpression of dnCdk4 induces a delay in G1 progression in quiescent cells stimulated to proliferate (13Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a result that we have reproduced in our system. However, the mechanism that mediates this effect has not been studied in detail. p27kip1 (p27) is a Cdk inhibitor that plays a role in the establishment of quiescence. The levels of p27 are elevated in quiescence (19Millard S.S. Yan J.S. Nguyen H. Pagano M. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7093-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanisms that mediate this induction are still not completely understood. The levels of this protein can be regulated in several different ways (19Millard S.S. Yan J.S. Nguyen H. Pagano M. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7093-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Kolluri S.K. Weiss C. Koff A. Gottlicher M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1190-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The best studied of them is the modulation of its half-life. Nevertheless, regulation of p27 translation has also been suggested as an important means of p27 induction during quiescence (19Millard S.S. Yan J.S. Nguyen H. Pagano M. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7093-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this work, we report that inhibition of Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) kinase activity induces accumulation of p27 in quiescent cells and a delay in cell cycle progression through G1 in serum-stimulated cells. p27 accumulation is produced by enhanced translational activity of its mRNA, an effect mediated by the 3′-untranslated region of the p27 mRNA. These results show that the kinase activity of Cdk4 (6Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) is important for cell cycle progression at least in part because it modulates the translation efficiency of an important cell cycle regulator, p27.

To obtain a G0 arrest, cells were allowed to reach confluence and then starved in medium with 0.1% serum for 48 h. Serum-deprived cells were stimulated to reenter the cycle by the addition of medium with 20% serum. When specified, aphidicolin was added at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. For synchronization of continuously proliferating cells, cells were arrested in mitosis by treatment with 0.4 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for a maximum of 12 h. Mitotic cells were collected by shake off, washed, and replated to enter the cell cycle in a synchronized form. For flow cytometry analysis of DNA content, cells were stained with propidium iodide, and DNA fluorescence was measured with a Becton Dickinson device. To determine incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), cells plated on coverslips were incubated with BrdUrd for 1 h, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (in situ cell proliferation kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For retroviral infections, human p16 or Cdk4N158were cloned into the retroviral vector pBABEpuro by standard techniques. The resulting construct was transfected into Phoenix cells. Retroviral supernatants were obtained and used to infectRb−/− 3T3 (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Rb−/−3T3 cells were selected in 4.5 μg/ml puromycin, and clones were isolated from the resulting populations by limiting dilution. Transient transfections were performed with FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the plasmids pRcCMV-p16, pCMV dnCdk4 (15van den Hueven S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), and pCMVβ (Clontech), together with the SvL series of vectors (27Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed with standard methods. The p27 depletion experiments were performed using the pECE-ASp27 plasmid (34Rivard N. Allemain G. Bartek J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18337-18341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were used: anti-Cdk4 (sc-260); cyclin D1 (sc-450); cyclin E (sc-481); p107 (sc-318); human p16 (sc- 468); Cdk2 (sc-163); p27kip1 (sc-528); Sp1 (sc-59). Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 120 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmorthovanadate, aprotinin, 50 mm NaF) and cleared by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, equal protein quantities were incubated with appropriate antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads (AP Biotech) and washed three times with EBC buffer. Resuspended samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Detection of the immune complexes was performed with a chemiluminescence assay (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detection of proteins in cell lysates, a 100-μg sample of the total cell lysate was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed for Western blotting. Cells were growth-arrested and then preincubated for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pulse-labeled for 90 min with fresh medium containing 1.5 mCi/ml Redivue Promix L-35S (AP Biotech), and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At the time points shown, samples of cells were collected and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (in phosphate-buffered saline; 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein extracts were used for protein immunoprecipitation. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%), and the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and exposed. Cyclin E kinase assays were performed as described (28Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1217-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Cdk4 kinase assays and preparation of substrate glutathione S-transferase-RB were carried out essentially as described by Matsushime et al. (29Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). In both assays, the phosphorylated substrate was detected initially by autoradiography and quantitated by cutting bands off the gel and measuring their radioactivity. Northern blot was performed by standard techniques using the appropriate cDNA probes. 18 S RNA analysis was performed with an oligonucleotide probe as described (30Carneiro C. Alvarez C.V. Zalvide J. Vidal A. Dominguez F. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Luciferase, β-galactosidase, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNAs were quantitated by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, using oligonucleotides derived from the coding sequence of the three genes for the PCR. We began this work trying to determine whether p16 overexpression had an effect in cell cycle progression in Rb-negative cells, even if this effect was not a complete arrest of the cycle. To this end, we have used Rb−/− 3T3 cells as a model system (25Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This is a cell line derived from mice in which theRb gene has been deleted by genetic targeting (31Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Contrary to Rb-negative tumor cells, Rb−/−3T3 cells show cell cycle regulation similar to normalRb-positive cells. Specifically, they can be arrested in G0 when serum-deprived and can also be contact-inhibited (25Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, they seem to be a good model to study cell cycle regulation of Rb-negative cells. Rb−/− 3T3 cells have endogenous p16 (data not shown). Nevertheless, they also have cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes formed in a cell cycle-dependent fashion and active as a kinase (see Fig. 1, B and C, first two lanes of each). However, both the amount of cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes and the activity of Cdk4 as a kinase are clearly lower in Rb−/− 3T3 cells than in NIH3T3 cells, which are known to be functionally p16-negative (data not shown). We infected Rb−/− 3T3 cells with a retrovirus encoding human p16 and isolated individual colonies from the transduced populations. These clones expressed the exogenous p16 at high levels (Fig. 1A). The two clones shown in Fig.1A were chosen for in-depth study of their cell cycle regulation. These cells had disrupted cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes compared with parent cells (Fig. 1B), and their Cdk4 activity was not detectable above background levels, defined as the kinase activity of immunoprecipitates in which the anti-Cdk4 antibody had been preincubated in the presence of a Cdk4-blocking peptide (Fig.1C). We repeated this experiment three times. The average kinase activity of Cdk4 in p16.1 cells was 5.5% that of controlRb−/− 3T3 cells, with an upper 95% confidence interval of 22.2%, whereas the kinase activity of p16.2 cells was 0.67% that of control Rb−/− 3T3 cells, with an upper 95% confidence interval of 4.2%. The kinase activity of cyclin E-containing complexes in serum-stimulated cells overexpressing p16 was clearly lower than in parent cells, but it was not completely inhibited (Fig. 1D). In p16 overexpressors, p27 was displaced from cyclind-containing to cyclin E-containing complexes in p16-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1E). We concluded that p16 was acting as described (13Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14McConnell B.B. Gregory F.J. Stott F.J. Hara E. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), displacing p27 from cyclin D to cyclin E, and this was contributing to the inhibition of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity. Overexpression of p16 also affected the phosphorylation of a cyclin D-Cdk4 target, theRb-related protein p130 (data not shown), which shows that the inhibition of this complex was functionally significant in vivo as well as in vitro. We then studied the effect of p16 overexpression on the cell cycle of proliferating Rb-negative cells. Specifically, we determined the length of G1 in control and p16 cells. For this, we synchronized cells by nocodazole treatment followed by mitotic shake off and measured DNA synthesis at different times after mitotic release by incorporation of BrdUrd. Fig.2A shows that the behavior of control and p16 cells was identical. However, the situation was different in cells that had been made quiescent and then stimulated to proliferate. As shown in Fig. 2B, when cells were synchronized using this protocol and analyzed by flow cytometry, those that overexpressed p16 progressed through the cell cycle clearly slower than control cells. In fact, at 23 h after stimulation, between 25 and 30% of control cells had already attained the 4n DNA content characteristic of G2/M cells, but there was no enrichment of cells with 4n DNA content in cells overexpressing p16, even 26 h after serum stimulation. The same difference was seen when we analyzed another p16-overexpressing colony, compared with a different control (data not shown). We also determined the moment of the beginning of DNA synthesis by measuring BrdUrd incorporation in control and p16 cells, at different times after serum stimulation. We used the two colonies that had been analyzed previously, together with a third colony, and another control (a puromycin-resistant colony from an infection of Rb−/− 3T3 cells with empty pBABEpuro). This experiment showed that the delay occurred before S phase entry in p16 cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the effect was evident in the three colonies analyzed, which showed a delay of several h with respect to the two control cell lines (Rb−/− 3T3 and puro), despite the slight variability in S phase entry between these two. We concluded that p16 induced a marked delay in cell cycle progression in serum-stimulated,Rb-negative cells. The delay in cell cycle progression in serum-stimulated cells we observed was very similar to that reported in cells overexpressing a dominant negative Cdk4 mutant or derived from Cdk4−/−mouse embryos (13Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We wanted to know whether the effect could be reproduced by affecting only the kinase activity of Cdk4. We infected Rb−/− cells with Cdk4N158, a dominant negative Cdk4 (dnCdk4) that has been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of Cdk4 but not to affect the distribution of p27 between Cdk4 and Cdk2 complexes (13Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and studied the cell cycle of the resulting colonies. Inhibition of Cdk4 kinase activity had the same effect on the cell cycle as overexpression of p16. Cells overexpressing a dominant negative version of the kinase showed a delay in cell cycle progression when serum-stimulated and entered S phase several h later than control cells (Fig.3). We then studied the regulation of cell cycle-regulated genes and proteins in cells overexpressing p16 or dnCdk4. The most striking difference we found between these cells and controls related to p27. The levels of this protein were higher in quiescent than in proliferating cells, as has been described (see Fig.4C). Surprisingly, its levels in quiescence were higher in p16 and dnCdk4 cells than in parental cells (Fig. 4A) or cells that had been transduced with an empty vector (Fig. 4C). Given that the levels of this protein are induced upon entry into quiescence, we determined whether the inhibition of Cdk4 activity influenced the withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle when serum was removed. We measured BrdUrd incorporation by immunofluorescence in cells at different times after serum withdrawal. A slightly higher percentage of parental cells (Rb−/− cells) incorporated BrdUrd in the first 12 h of serum deprivation, compared with cells without Cdk4 activity. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between cells transduced with p16 or dnCdk4 and cells transduced with an empty vector (puro cells). At later times, the differences were no longer evident, and from 48 h onward, there were no cells positive for BrdUrd in any of the populations tested (Fig. 4B). Despite the fact that the differences in parental and transduced cells in serum deprivation were very small, we were concerned about the effects that difference might have on the regulation of p27. For this reason, we used a puromycin-resistant cell line (puro) as a control in the following experiments. We performed a time course of the induction of the p27 in puro cells and two cell lines overexpressing either dnCdk4 or p16 (Fig. 4C). The induction of p27 with respect to proliferating cells was evident after only 3 h of serum withdrawal in the three cell lines, but there was no appreciable difference between the control and transduced cells until 48 h of serum deprivation had passed. We concluded that the higher levels of p27 in cells overexpressing p16 or dnCdk4 were unlikely to be a consequence of different rates of cell cycle withdrawal upon serum deprivation. We then began to study the mechanisms that mediate the induction of p27 in p16 and dnCdk4 cell lines. We first determined the levels of the p27 mRNA in quiescent parental and transduced cells. To our surprise, the levels of p27 mRNA were clearly lower in quiescent p16 and dnCdk4 cells than in parental cells (Fig.5A). We are at present studying the reason for this difference. Nevertheless, it is clear that the high levels of p27 in transduced cells are not a consequence of higher levels of p27 mRNA. It is known that an important mechanism of regulation of the levels of p27 depends on the modulation of its half-life. We suspected that the effect we were seeing was due to differences in protein stability and determined the half-life of p27 in our cells with a pulse-chase experiment using medium labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Fig. 5B). p27 was very stable in the three cell lines analyzed, consistent with previous reports on its half-life in serum-deprived cells (23Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del S.G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar, 32Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The experiment clearly showed that the differences in p27 protein levels were not the consequence of its differential stability. In fact, the half-life of p27 was longer in puro cells (>12 h), than in either p16.1 cells (half-life of 8 h) or Cdk4dn.1 cells (half-life of 7.5 h). Surprisingly, however, the intensity of the band at time 0 was clearly hig"
