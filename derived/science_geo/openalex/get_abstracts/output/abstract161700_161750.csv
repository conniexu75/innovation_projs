https://openalex.org/W2104721579,"Homogalacturonan (HG) is a multifunctional pectic polysaccharide of the primary cell wall matrix of all land plants. HG is thought to be deposited in cell walls in a highly methyl-esterified form but can be subsequently de-esterified by wall-based pectin methyl esterases (PMEs) that have the capacity to remove methyl ester groups from HG. Plant PMEs typically occur in multigene families/isoforms, but the precise details of the functions of PMEs are far from clear. Most are thought to act in a processive or blockwise fashion resulting in domains of contiguous de-esterified galacturonic acid residues. Such de-esterified blocks of HG can be cross-linked by calcium resulting in gel formation and can contribute to intercellular adhesion. We demonstrate that, in addition to blockwise de-esterification, HG with a non-blockwise distribution of methyl esters is also an abundant feature of HG in primary plant cell walls. A partially methyl-esterified epitope of HG that is generated in greatest abundance by non-blockwise de-esterification is spatially regulated within the cell wall matrix and occurs at points of cell separation at intercellular spaces in parenchymatous tissues of pea and other angiosperms. Analysis of the properties of calcium-mediated gels formed from pectins containing HG domains with differing degrees and patterns of methyl-esterification indicated that HG with a non-blockwise pattern of methyl ester group distribution is likely to contribute distinct mechanical and porosity properties to the cell wall matrix. These findings have important implications for our understanding of both the action of pectin methyl esterases on matrix properties and mechanisms of intercellular adhesion and its loss in plants.

The pectic matrix contributes to both the physical integrity and physiological status of cell walls, but the functional implications of the structural complexity of this matrix are poorly understood. Typically, heterogeneous populations of pectic polymers are present in primary cell walls, and our present understanding is that all essentially consist of galacturonan backbones with or without various side chain additions (1Pilnik W.

Backbone domains consist of either contiguous 1,4-linked α-d-galacturonic acid (homogalacturonan, HG)1 or repeats of the disaccharide (→4)-α-d-GalA-(1→2)-α-l-Rha-(1→) (rhamnogalacturonan, RG). GalA residues in HG may be methyl-esterified, acetylated, and/or substituted with xylose or apiose (2O'Neill M.A. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Dey P.M. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. 2.

Oligosaccharide side chains may be attached to both RG and HG domains to form the branched domains known as RG-I and RG-II, respectively (2O'Neill M.A. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Dey P.M.

The HG domain of the pectic network is implicated in influencing a range of cell wall properties that impact upon cell expansion, cell development, intercellular adhesion, and defense mechanisms. Stretches of HG with un-esterified GalA residues can associate by calcium cross-linking (7Jarvis M.C. Plant Cell Environ. 1984; 7: 153-164Google Scholar). Such association promotes the formation of supramolecular pectic gels, which are important in controlling the porosity and mechanical properties of cell walls and contribute to the maintenance of intercellular adhesion (8Knox J.P. Plant J. 1992; 2: 137-141Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Carpita N.C. Gibeaut D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar). Plant cells are adhered by contact across middle lamellae, which are HG-rich regions of the cell wall developed from cell plates formed at cytokinesis. In plants, cell adhesion is a default state and cell separation an active process that is under developmental control (8Knox J.P. Plant J. 1992; 2: 137-141Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Roberts J.A. Whitelaw C.A. Gonzalez-Carranza Z.H. McManus M.T. Ann. Bot. 2000; 86: 223-235Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition to the roles of the HG polysaccharide domain, HG-derived oligogalacturonides generated by pectinolytic cleavage are involved in signaling processes during development and in defense responses to plant pathogens (11Eberhard S. Doubrava N. Marfà V. Mohnen D. Southwick A. Darvill A. Albersheim P. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 747-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dumville J.C. Fry S.C. Plant Physiol.

It is thought that HG is highly methyl-esterified when exported into cell walls and is subsequently de-esterified by the action of pectin methyl esterases (PMEs) in the cell wall (3Mohnen D. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1999: 497-527Google Scholar, 14Zhang G.F. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1070-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). PME genes occur in multigene families and encode isoforms with differing action patterns with respect to the removal of methyl esters. However, the specific functions of PME populations in the context of cell expansion and other processes are not well understood (15Bordenave M. Breton C. Goldberg R. Huet J.C. Perez S. Pernollet J.C.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 220: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Methyl esters can be distributed in diverse patterns along HG chains and it is clear that the action patterns of plant PMEs (pPMEs) can be influenced by local cell wall pH, the existing balance of methyl and free carboxyl groups on HG substrates, and metal ion concentration (16Catoire L.

Voragen A.G. J Schols H.A. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 326: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to plants, some fungi and bacteria also produce PMEs, and it is significant that the action patterns of plant and fungal PMEs are thought to be different. It is generally proposed that pPMEs remove methyl esters in a processive blockwise fashion (single chain mechanism), giving rise to long contiguous stretches (blocks) of un-esterified GalA residues in HG domains of pectin (23Massiot P. Perron V. Baron A. Drilleau J.F. Lebensm. Wiss. U. Technol. 1997; 30: 697-702Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Limberg G. Körner R. Bucholt H.C. Christensen T.M.I.E Roepstorff P. Mikkelsen J.D.

Res. 2000; 327: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, the action of fungal PMEs (fPMEs) is generally regarded as random (or multiple chain mechanism), resulting in the de-esterification of single GalA residues per enzyme/substrate interaction (23Massiot P. Perron V. Baron A. Drilleau J.F. Lebensm. Wiss. U. Technol. 1997; 30: 697-702Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Limberg G. Körner R. Bucholt H.C. Christensen T.M.I.E Roepstorff P. Mikkelsen J.D.

Res. 2000; 327: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the precise nature of the action patterns of fPME and pPME are far from clear, and some pPMEs appear to have the capacity to remove a limited number of methyl esters per reaction, giving rise to short un-esterified blocks (20Denès J.-M. Baron A. Renard C.M.G.C Péan C. Drilleau J.-F. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, recently developed procedures for the enzymatic fingerprinting of pectic fragments have indicated that the action patterns of fPMEs are non-blockwise, but probably not in fact random (24Limberg G. Körner R. Bucholt H.C. Christensen T.M.I.E Roepstorff P. Mikkelsen J.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this report, the action pattern of an orange pPME is referred to as blockwise, whereas the action pattern of an Aspergillus fPME and the chemical process of base catalysis are referred to as non-blockwise. Previous investigations of the action patterns of PMEs have focused on the action of isolated PMEs on pectin substrates in vitro(16Catoire L. Pierron M. Morvan C. Hervé du Penhoat C. Goldberg R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33150-33156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the use of anti-HG monoclonal antibodies with appropriate binding specificities allows the products of de-esterification processes to be analyzed in planta in the context of cell wall architecture and cell development. We have used monoclonal antibodies with differing binding requirements with respect to the distribution of methyl ester groups to investigate the spatial regulation of HG with blockwise and non-blockwise methyl group distributions in pea. The monoclonal antibody PAM1 (which binds specifically to long stretches of un-esterified HG produced most readily by blockwise de-esterification) and JIM5 (which binds to a range of partially methyl-esterified HG domains) have been described previously (26Knox J.P. Linstead P.J. King J. Cooper C. Roberts K. Planta. 1990; 181: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 27Willats W.G.T. Gilmartin P.M. Mikkelsen J.D. Knox J.P.

Knox J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Non-blockwise de-esterification of HG has been analyzed using a monoclonal antibody (LM7) described for the first time in this report. In addition, we have investigated the functional implications of varying degrees and patterns of methyl-esterification of HG in the context of the physical and physiological properties of calcium-HG gels. Taken together, the results indicate that wall-based pPMEs with a range of action patterns can produce HG with non-blockwise and blockwise distributions of methyl esters at discrete cell wall microdomains, resulting in distinct spatially regulated matrix properties. Monoclonal antibody LM7 was generated using hybridoma technology subsequent to the immunization of a group of rats with lime pectin with a degree of methyl-esterification (DE) of 22.9%, a degree of amidation of 27.3% and an average molecular mass of 84 kDa. Immunization, hybridoma preparation, and cloning procedures were performed as described previously (29Willats W.G. T Marcus S.E. Knox J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 308: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). LM7 was selected by differential immuno-dot assay (IDA) screens of a series of pectin samples differing in DE with blockwise and non-blockwise patterns of de-esterification (see below). Monoclonal antibodies JIM5 and PAM1 were produced by hybridoma and phage display technologies, respectively (26Knox J.P. Linstead P.J. King J. Cooper C. Roberts K. Planta. 1990; 181: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 27Willats W.G.T. Gilmartin P.M. Mikkelsen J.D. Knox J.P. Plant J. 1999; 18: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Willats W.G. T Limberg G. Buchholt H.C. van Alebeek G.J. Benen J. Christensen T.M.I.E. Visser J. Voragen A. Mikkelsen J.D. Knox J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A series of lime pectins with different patterns (blockwise and non-blockwise), and defined DE were prepared by enzymatic and chemical treatments of a commercial highly methyl-esterified (81%) lime pectin (E81, GRINDSTED™ Pectin URS 1200) as described previously (24Limberg G. Körner R. Bucholt H.C. Christensen T.M.I.E Roepstorff P. Mikkelsen J.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, one series was produced by blockwise de-esterification of E81 with a pPME isolated from orange peel (P-series), while another series was produced by non-blockwise de-esterification of E81 with a fPME fromAspergillus niger (F-series). A further set of samples was also produced by non-blockwise de-esterification of E81 by base catalysis (B-series). A sample of completely de-esterified pectin (E0) was prepared by treatment with fPME followed by base catalyzed de-esterification. Pectin sample B34 (prepared by base catalysis and with a DE of 34%) was digested with PL (EC3.2.1.15) or PG II (EC 4.2.2.10), both from Aspergillus niger. B34 was dissolved in 50 mm NaOAc (pH 5.0 for PL and pH 4.2 for PG II) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml by overnight rocking at room temperature. 0.1 unit of PL or 0.2 unit of PG II was added to 1 ml of the above pectin solution and in both cases incubated at room temperature for 20 h. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. The effect of PL and PG II digestion of B34 on the binding of LM7 was assessed by ciELISAs with untreated B34 as the immobilized antigen. Untreated B34 (50 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) was coated (100 μl/well) overnight at 4 °C onto microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Denmark). The coating solution was removed, and plates were blocked at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS (3%BSA/TBS) for 2 h (200 μl/well). Following washing, competitor solutions (untreated B34, B34 digested with PL, and B34 digested with PG II) were applied (100 μl/well) as 5-fold serial dilutions in 3%BSA/TBS. All competitor solutions also contained LM7 at a final level of 1/100 dilution of hybridoma supernatant (corresponding to ∼90% maximal binding on antibody capture ELISAs). After 2 h of incubation, plates were washed and secondary antibody (anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) diluted 1/1000 in 3%BSA/TBS applied (100 μl/well) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, plates were developed with a tetramethyl benzidine-based substrate (150 μl/well). After stopping the reaction with 2 m H2SO4 (35 μl/well), absorbances were read at 450 nm. Concentrations of competitors resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) of antibody binding were determined. Values from controls with no competitor were taken as 0% inhibition of antibody binding, and values from controls with no LM7 antibody represented 100% inhibition of binding. In some cases, CaCl2 or MgCl2 were added to competitor solutions to a maximum level of 1 mm. Pectins were dissolved in water to a concentration of 5 mg/ml or 10 mg/ml and applied as 1-μl aliquots to nitrocellulose (Scheicher & Schuell) in a 5- or 10-fold dilution series. Nitrocellulose membranes were air-dried at room temperature for at least 30 min. After blocking for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% (w/v) fat-free milk powder (5%M/PBS), membranes were incubated for 1 h in primary antibodies diluted in 5%M/PBS. JIM5 and LM7 were used as 1/10 dilutions of hybridoma supernatants while PAM1 was used at a concentration of ∼1 × 1011 phage particles/ml (∼1/100 dilution of phage prepared by polyethylene glycol precipitation; Ref. 27Willats W.G.T. Gilmartin P.M. Mikkelsen J.D. Knox J.P. Plant J. 1999; 18: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In all cases, membranes were incubated in primary antibodies for 1.5 h. After washing, membranes were incubated for 1.5 h in secondary antibody (anti-rat horseradish peroxidase conjugate (for JIM5 and LM7) (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) or anti-M13 horseradish peroxidase conjugate (for PAM1) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1/1000 in 5%M/PBS. Membranes were briefly washed prior to development in substrate solution (25 ml of de-ionized water, 5 ml of MeOH containing 10 mg/ml 4-chloro-1-naphthol, 30 μl 6% (v/v) H2O2). In some cases, immobilized pectin samples were chemically de-esterified by incubation of membranes in 0.1 mNa2CO3 for 1 h prior to processing. Pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Avola) seeds were imbibed overnight in tap water, sown in sterile vermiculite, and grown for 7–15 days. Regions (0.5 cm long) of stem, petiole, or root were excised and sectioned by hand to a thickness of ∼100–300 μm. Sections were placed immediately in fixative consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde in 50 mm PIPES, 5 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm EGTA. Following 30 min of fixation, sections were washed in the PIPES buffer and then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody diluted in 5%M/PBS. JIM5 and LM7 were used as 10- and 3-fold dilutions of hybridoma supernatants, respectively. PAM1 was used at a concentration of ∼5 × 1011 phage particles/ml (∼ 1/20 dilution of phage prepared by polyethylene glycol precipitation; Ref. 27Willats W.G.T. Gilmartin P.M. Mikkelsen J.D. Knox J.P. Plant J. 1999; 18: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sections were washed by gently rocking in PBS prior to incubation for 1 h in secondary antibody. For visualization of LM7 and JIM5 binding, the secondary antibody was anti-rat IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma). For visualization of PAM1 binding, a secondary antibody was prepared by conjugating an anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to fluorescein isothiocyanate using a protein conjugation kit (Sigma). All secondary antibodies were used at dilutions of 1/100 in 5%M/PBS. After washing in PBS, sections were mounted in anti-fade agent (Citifluor, Agar Scientific) and examined on a microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination (Olympus BH-2). In some cases, hand sections were chemically de-esterified by incubation in 0.1 m Na2CO3 for 1 h prior to processing. In certain cases plant material was embedded in resin for electron microscopy. Regions (2 mm long) of stem were fixed in 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 4 °C, then washed extensively in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer. Material was then post-fixed in 0.1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, for 1 h at 4 °C, washed extensively with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, and then dehydrated in an ethanol series. Dehydrated material was infiltrated with resin (LR White) (London Resin, Reading, United Kingdom), then placed in gelatin capsules containing resin and allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 5 days. Material used for transmission electron microscopy but not immunogold labeling, was stained en bloc with 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate in distilled water overnight at 4 °C, then washed extensively with water before being dehydrated and embedded as described above. For immunogold labeling, sections obtained from resin-embedded material (∼0.1 μm thick) were incubated in 3%BSA/TBS for 30 min. Sections were then incubated in a solution containing JIM5 or LM7 diluted 1/10 in 3%BSA/TBS for 1.5 h. The sections were washed with 3%BSA/TBS, and then incubated in secondary antibody (anti-rat monoclonal antibody conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold (Sigma) diluted 1/40 in 3%BSA/TBS for 1.5 h. Section were washed with TBS and post-stained with 4% uranyl acetate in distilled water for 15 min, and then washed extensively with distilled water. Sections were observed with an electron microscope (1200ex, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). All incubations were at room temperature. A subset of the P-, F-, and B-series of lime pectins that contained the epitopes recognized by LM7 or PAM1 to various levels were selected for analysis of the effects of the degree and pattern of methyl-esterification on the physical properties of calcium-mediated gels. Gels were prepared from E0, F11, F31, P41, F43, and B34, essentially as described elsewhere (30MacDougall A.J. Needs P.W. Rigby N.M. Ring S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 293: 235-249Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Pectin solutions (2% (w/v) in de-ionized water) were prepared with gentle rocking at 4 °C for at least 18 h. For casting gels, 900 μl of pectin solution was transferred to a 2-ml syringe (with an internal diameter of 8.6 mm) from which the nozzle end had been removed. 67 μl of 500 mm CaCl2 was added as a layer to the top of the pectin solution (to give a final CaCl2 concentration of 35 mm) and the cut end of the syringe sealed with tape. Gels were left to equilibrate for 24–48 h at 4 °C. Polymerized gels were removed using the syringe plunger and cut to a uniform height using a custom-made nylon cutting block with guide slots. Gel samples prepared as described above were subjected to compressive tests to determine their elasticity under low strain and their yield points under high strain. Compression tests were performed using an in-house texture measuring device, known as the “Ministron,” constructed in the University of Leeds Department of Food Science instrument workshop. This device was used to analyze the controlled compression of gel samples between two parallel stainless steel plates at a precisely defined speed. The lower plate, on which the sample rested, is mounted on a high precision load cell (Maywood Instruments, Basingstoke, United Kingdom). The gap between the plates and the force, F, on the load cell are electronically logged throughout the experiment at a suitable frequency. For all experiments, at least four samples from different gel preparations were analyzed. Gels were compressed by reducing the gap between the plates at a rate of 0.1 mm s−1. The elasticity, E, of the gels in the low strain region was calculated from Equation1.E=F/(A·s)Equation 1 s is the strain, and A is sample cross-sectional area. The strain is given by Equation 2.s=Δh/h0Equation 2 h 0 is the initial height of the sample, and Δh is the change in height due to compression. The line of best fit to the plot of F versus s, in the region 0.1 < s < 0.2, was used to calculate E. Below this range samples did not always compress uniformly, due to not having exactly parallel sides, whereas at higher strains there were significant increases in cross-sectional area and/or water loss from the sample, contributing to non-linearF versus s plots. Up tos = 0.2 the change in A was negligible for all samples, and for 0.1 < s < 0.2 the line of best fit to the data always had a regression coefficient of at least 0.95. It was observed that there were significant differences in the water expelled from gel samples during compression. The final percentage of water lost was calculated from the change in the volume of the gels after compression up to a force of 9.82 N (E0, F11, and F31) or by the force that resulted in yielding (P41, F43, and B34). The yield point was taken as the point when the gradient of F versus s became negative. Yielding was sometimes also accompanied by visible splitting of the gel piece. The porosity of gels to protein was determined by incubating gels in a solution of BSA and measuring the incorporation of protein into gels over time. For each time point, two gel blocks (prepared as described previously) above were incubated with gentle rocking in 2 ml of BSA solution (5 mg/ml in de-ionized water). Following incubation, the two gel blocks were washed briefly in de-ionized water, briefly blotted dry on filter paper to remove surface liquid, and incubated with gentle rocking in 2 ml of 50 mm calcium chelator (CDTA) (pH 7) until gels were completely dissolved (∼30 min). The protein concentration of the solutions were then analyzed using Bradford protein assays. For each pectin gel sample, four replicates of the protocol described were analyzed for each time point. Monoclonal antibody LM7 was generated subsequent to immunization with a lime pectin (containing 88.3% GalA) and selected by IDA screening on the basis of its specific binding to a subset of F-series and B-series pectins that have non-blockwise patterns of methyl-esterification as shown in Fig.1 a.

Both the degree and the pattern of de-esterification influence the capacity of these antibodies to bind to HG domains. LM7 did not bind at the highest level tested (1 μg) to any of the P-series pectins or to F-series pectins with DE of 76%, 69%, or 11% (Fig. 1 a). LM7 did bind to F-series pectins with DE from 58% to 31% with increasing avidity, and LM7 bound to F31 with a detection limit of <0.2 μg (Fig. 1 a). LM7 bound weakly, at the highest level tested (1 μg), to a B-series sample with a DE of 43% and bound to B-series pectins with DEs of 34 and 15% with detection limits of <0.2 μg.

Regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been suggested to involve distinct signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated the regulation of the human IL-10 (hIL-10) promoter in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 following activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Analysis of hIL-10 promoter sequences revealed that DNA sequences located between base pairs −652 and −571 are necessary for IL-10 transcription. A computer analysis of the promoter sequence between base pairs −652 and −571 revealed the existence of consensus sequences for Sp1, PEA1, YY1, and Epstein-Barr virus-specific nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA-2)-like transcription factors. THP-1 cells transfected with a plasmid containing mutant Sp1 abrogated the promoter activity, whereas plasmids containing the sequences for PEA1, YY1, and EBNA-2-like transcription factors did not influence hIL-10 promoter activity. To understand the events upstream of Sp1 activation, we investigated the role of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases by using their specific inhibitors. SB202190 and SB203580, the p38-specific inhibitors, inhibited LPS-induced IL-10 production. In contrast, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases, failed to modulate IL-10 production. Furthermore, SB203580 inhibited LPS-induced activation of Sp1, as well as the promoter activity in cells transfected with a plasmid containing the Sp1 consensus sequence. These results suggest that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase regulates LPS-induced activation of Sp1, which in turn regulates transcription of the hIL-10 gene.

An appropriate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory influences in the immune response is critical in the resolution of many pathological conditions. Interleukin-10 (IL-10),1 a cytokine that inhibits inflammatory and cell-mediated immune responses (1Moore K.W. O'Garra A. de Waal M. Vieira P. Mosmann T.R. Annu. Rev.

The major biological effects of IL-10 include inhibition of antigen-presenting cell-dependent cytokine synthesis by Th1 cells, costimulation of mast cell growth, and costimulation of thymocyte growth in the presence of IL-2 and/or IL-4 (1Moore K.W.

In mice, IL-10 administration has been shown to inhibit a number of immunological effects, including delayed type hypersensitivity, alterations in vascular permeability, and increases in footpad cytokine production (15Li L. Elliott J.F. Mosmann T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3967-3978PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, IL-10 transgenic mice were shown to be unable to limit the growth of immunogenic tumor cells (16Hagenbaugh A. Sharma S. Dubinett S.M. Wei S.H.Y. Aranda R. Cheroutre H. Fowell D.J. Binder S. Tsao B. Locksley R.M. Moore K.W. Kronenberg M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2101-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-10 knockout mice demonstrate a state of chronic inflammation (12Yang X. Gartner J. Zhu L. Wang S. Brunham R.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1010-1017PubMed Google Scholar), severe disease in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (13Bettelli E. Das M.P. Howard E.D. Weiner H.L. Sobel R.A. Kuchroo V.K. J.

Med. 1997; 185: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that IL-10 plays a beneficial role in controlling the harmful inflammatory response in these conditions. In humans, high levels of IL-10 have been shown to be produced in patients with HIV infection (17Kumar A. Angel J. Daftarian M.P. Parato K. Cameron W.D. Filion L. Diaz-Mitoma F. Clin. Exp.

Byl B. De G.D. Vincent J.L. Goldman M. Lancet. 1994; 343: 707-708Abstract PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest that polymorphism in the hIL-10 promoter region is associated with altered IL-10 expression in autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (21Turner D.M. Williams D.M. Sankaran D. Lazarus M. Sinnott P.J. Hutchinson I.V. Eur. J. Immunogenet. 1997; 24: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cytokine synthesis in mononuclear phagocytes are not fully known. LPS is perhaps the best characterized monocytic mitogen, which, following interaction with its receptor CD14, induces first proinflammatory (IL-1, TNF-α, etc.) and then anti-inflammatory (IL-10, sTNF-R, and IL-1R antagonist) cytokines (7de Waal M.

Mauz-Korholz C. Burdach S. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LPS-induced cell signaling is known to activate protein-tyrosine kinases (23Stefanova I.

A recent report has indicated that IL-10 production is dependent on protein-tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C activation in a murine cell line (28Meisel C. Vogt K. Platzer C. Randow F. Liebenthal C. Volk H.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, factors that elevate cAMP have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of monocytic IL-10 synthesis, primarily at the mRNA level (29Kambayashi T. Jacob C.O. Zhou D. Mazurek N. Fong M. Strassmann G. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 30Platzer C. Meisel C. Vogt K. Platzer M. Volk H.D. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that p38 MAPK is involved in the regulation of IL-10 production (31Foey A.D. Parry S.L. Williams L.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. Brennan F.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 920-928PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of gene expression for several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been studied. Transcription factors including Rel, C/RBP, AP-1, and NF-κB have been implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine genes (32Lindroos P.M. Rice A.B. Wang Y.Z. Bonner J.C. J.

However, very little is known about the regulation of the hIL-10 gene and the involvement of MAP kinases in this process. To gain insight into hIL-10 gene regulation, we have employed promonocytic THP-1 cells that produce IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α following LPS stimulation as do normal human monocytes. Using mutagenesis, we analyzed the promoter sequence of the hIL-10 gene, and we present evidence that an element located at −650 bp, encompassing a Sp1 consensus sequence is involved in the transcription of the hIL-10 gene. This was further demonstrated by introducing a mutation in the Sp1 consensus sequence that abrogated IL-10 promoter activity. Furthermore, the Sp1 transcription factor is induced by LPS stimulation and is selectively regulated by the p38 MAP kinase. THP-1, a promonocytic cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). 5–15% of these cells express CD14 on their surface. THP-1 cells transfected with a plasmid containing CD14 cDNA sequences (THP-1/CD14) were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Ulevitch (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) (Fig. 1). Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm glutamine. PD98059 (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 kinase, selectively blocks the activity of ERK MAP kinase and has no effect on the activity of other serine threonine protein kinases including Raf-1, p38, and JNK MAP kinases, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A (24Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). The pyridinyl imidazoles SB202190 and SB203580 (Calbiochem), potent inhibitors of p38 and p38β MAP kinases, have no significant effect on the activity of the ERK or JNK MAP kinase subgroups (24Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). LPS was purchased from Sigma. THP-1 cells were cultured at concentrations of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well culture plates (Falcon, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were left unstimulated or were treated for 48 h with various agents for different periods of time, following which they were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS. The supernatants were frozen at −70 °C and thawed at the time of analysis. IL-10 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by using two different monoclonal antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes, as described (17Kumar A. Angel J. Daftarian M.P. Parato K. Cameron W.D. Filion L. Diaz-Mitoma F. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 114: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Daftarian P.M. Kumar A. Kryworuchko M. Diaz-Mitoma F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted as described (40Daftarian P.M. Kumar A. Kryworuchko M. Diaz-Mitoma F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar) using a monophase solution containing guanidine thiocyanate and phenol (Tri Reagent solution; Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Equal aliquots (5 μl) of cDNA equivalent to 100 ng of RNA were subsequently amplified for IL-10 and β-actin. The oligonucleotide primer sequences for IL-10 and β-actin (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) are as follows: IL-10 sense (5′-GCC TAA CAT GCT TCG AGA TC-3′); IL-10 antisense (5′-TGA TGT CTG GGT CTT GGT TC-3′); β-actin sense (5′-TGA CGG GGT CAC CCA CAC TGT GCC CAT CTA-3′); β-actin antisense (5′-CTA GAA GCA TTT GCG GTG GAC GAT GGA GGG-3′). The amplification conditions for IL-10 and β-actin have been described (40Daftarian P.M. Kumar A. Kryworuchko M. Diaz-Mitoma F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified products IL-10 (204 bp) and β-actin (610 bp) were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis as described (17Kumar A. Angel J. Daftarian M.P. Parato K. Cameron W.D. Filion L. Diaz-Mitoma F. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 114: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Daftarian P.M. Kumar A. Kryworuchko M. Diaz-Mitoma F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with 3 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies (Becton Dickinson) along with isotype (IgG2b)-matched control antibodies (Becton Dickinson). The gates were set in accordance with gates obtained with the isotype-matched control antibodies. Population data were acquired on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer, and figures were generated using the WinMDI software package (J. Trotter, Scripps Institute, San Diego, CA). Cells (107) were harvested in Tris-EDTA-saline (TES) buffer, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C with buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet containing the nuclei was suspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol) at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was collected and frozen at −80 °C. Both buffers A and B contained the proteolytic inhibitors dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and spermidine at 0.5 mm as well as 0.15 mm spermine and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Nuclear proteins (5 μg) were mixed for 20 min at room temperature with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe Sp1, and the complexes were subjected to nondenaturing 17% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 90 min. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. The oligonucleotide sequences for Sp1 are as follows: 5′-d(ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C)-3′ and 3′-d(TAA GCT AGC CCC GCC CCG CTC G)-5′ (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A series of hIL-10 promoter fragments (see Fig. 3; fragment −890 to +120; GenBankTM accession number X78437) were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. The primers with restriction sites used to amplify the hIL-10 promoter fragments from genomic DNA are shown in TableI. The amplification consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified promoter products were subcloned into the PCRII-TOPO vector, and the sequences were confirmed. The correct insertions were subcloned into the XhoI polylinker site of pGL3B, the basic luciferase reporter plasmid, and sequences were confirmed again. All DNA sequencing was performed by the Biotechnology Research Institute (University of Ottawa). A site-directed mutation of the Sp1-binding sequence (cccgcc) was generated by PCR using mutagenic primers (TableI) to substitute cytosine with guanine at −631 and cytosine with adenine at −636 (see Fig. 6A). The fragment containing the Sp1 mutation (−650 to +120 bp) was inserted into the pGL3B reporter vector.Table IPrimers for amplification of IL-10 promoter fragments and sizes of the PCR products generated from genomic DNAPrimer namePrimer sequenceRegion amplifiedProduct lengthbpbpSense primersIL-10 PromGR5′-TTACTCGAGGAATGAGAACCCACAGCTG-3′−384 /+120504IL-10 PromcA5′-TTCCTCGAGGGCAATTTGTCCACGTC-3′−432 /+120552IL-10 PromNF5′-ATCCTCGAGGAAGTCTTGGGTATTC-3′−490 /+120610IL-10 PromGM5′-AACCTCGAGGGATATTTAGCCCAC-3′−571 /+120691IL-10 PromEB5′-ATCCTCGAGGCTGCTTGGGAACTTTGAG-3′−589 /+120709IL-10 PromSpM5′-ACACATCCTGTGACCCAGCGTGTCCTGTAGGAAGC-3′ (Sp1 mutant)−650 /+120770IL-10 PromSp5′-ATTCTCGAGGAACACATCCTGTGACC-3′−652 /+120772IL-10 PromST5′-AACCTCGAGCAGCAAGTGCAGACTAC-3′−768 /+120888IL-10 PromYY5′-AGCTCGAGAGTTGGCACTGGTGTACC-3′−890 /+1201100Antisense primer5′-ACTTCGAAGTTAGGCAGGTTGCCTG-3′ Open table in a new tab Figure 6The effect of a mutant Sp1 binding site on hIL-10 promoter activity in LPS-stimulated THP-1/CD14 cells.A, a site-directed mutation of the Sp1 consensus sequence within the hIL-10 promoter is shown with respect to the wild type Sp1 sequence.

These complexes were added to the cell suspension in each well, and cells were cultured for 24 h. Following incubation, cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS and were cultured for another 24 h. Cells were harvested and then assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity by using a luciferase assay kit and β-galactosidase assay kit purchased from Promega in a Bio Orbit 1250 Luminometer (Fisher). Cell pellets were lysed for 30 min with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 100 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.7). Total protein lysates (2 mg) were precleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads and antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Anti-p38 and anti-p42/44 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Immune complexes were washed three times with the lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide SDS gels. Proteins were transferred to ImmobilonTM-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the membranes were probed for phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 proteins using anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (UBL) antibodies. The immunoblots were developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer's instructions. All transfection studies were performed in triplicate dishes in 3–5 separate experiments. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. To understand LPS-induced IL-10 regulation in human monocytes, we employed two promonocytic cell lines, THP-1 and THP-1/CD14. CD14 was found to be expressed on ∼10–15% of THP-1 cells, and this number increased to more than 50% after stimulation with LPS (Fig.1). Since production of cytokines by LPS-stimulated monocytic cells lines is critically dependent on the level of CD14 expression, we employed THP-1 cells transfected with CD14 (THP-1/CD14) for analysis of the regulation of IL-10 production. All THP-1/CD14 cells constitutively expressed very high levels of CD14 on their surfaces compared with untransfected cells (15%) (Fig. 1). Stimulation of THP-1/CD14 cells with LPS induced IL-10 expression as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig.2A) and reverse transcriptase-based PCR analysis (Fig. 2B, C). Maximal levels of IL-10 mRNA were detected within 4 h after stimulation of THP-1 (Fig. 2B) and THP-1/CD14 (Fig.2C) cells. Production of IL-10 protein was elevated in THP-1/CD14 cells compared with THP-1 cells, an observation that correlated with CD14 surface expression. Production of IL-10 was dependent on the concentration of LPS used for cell stimulation, and 1 μg of LPS produced maximal levels of IL-10 (data not shown). Inducible genes, including cytokine genes, contain DNA sequences within their promoter region that are responsible for regulating transcription. The human IL-10 promoter was recently cloned and characterized (41Kube D. Platzer C. von Knethen A. Straub H. Bohlen H. Hafner M. Tesch H. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To understand the regulation of IL-10 gene transcription in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, we used PCR to clone the hIL-10 promoter fragment encompassing nucleotide residues from −890 to +120 bp relative to the +1 transcription site (Fig. 3). The amplified promoter fragment was subcloned into the XhoI polylinker site of the luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3B. THP-1/CD14 cells were transiently transfected with the IL-10-promoter/luciferase reporter construct (pIL-10Pr-GL3B). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were stimulated with LPS for varying periods of time ranging from 6 to 36 h, following which relative luciferase activity was assessed. The results show that luciferase activity could be detected by 12 h and peaked at 24 h following stimulation with LPS (Fig. 4A). The maximum increase in luciferase activity ranged from 6- to 8-fold relative to the unstimulated cells. The cells transfected with the promoterless plasmid pGL3B did not show any increase in luciferase activity following stimulation with LPS (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained for THP-1 cells, although the increase in luciferase activity was relatively lower than for the THP-1/CD14 cells transfected with the pGL3B containing the IL-10 promoter (Fig. 4B).

Here, we report that BACE can be phosphorylated within its cytoplasmic domain at serine residue 498 by casein kinase 1. Phosphorylation exclusively occurs after full maturation of BACE by propeptide cleavage and complex N-glycosylation. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation affects the subcellular localization of BACE. BACE wild type and an S498D mutant that mimics phosphorylated BACE are predominantly located within juxtanuclear Golgi compartments and endosomes, whereas nonphosphorylatable BACE S498A accumulates in peripheral EEA1-positive endosomes. Antibody uptake assays revealed that reinternalization of BACE from the cell surface is independent of its phosphorylation state. After reinternalization, BACE wild type as well as BACE S498D are efficiently retrieved from early endosomal compartments and further targeted to later endosomal compartments and/or the trans-Golgi network. In contrast, nonphosphorylatable BACE S498A is retained within early endosomes. Our results therefore demonstrate regulated trafficking of BACE within the secretory and endocytic pathway. β-Secretase (BACE) is a transmembrane aspartyl protease, which generates the N terminus of Alzheimer's disease amyloid β-peptide.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is pathologically characterized by the invariant accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in certain areas of the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The major constituent of senile plaques is the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ),1 which derives from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) by endoproteolytic processing (2Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). β-Secretase cleaves βAPP at the N terminus of the Aβ-domain, resulting in the generation of soluble APPS-β and a membrane-associated C-terminal fragment bearing the complete Aβ-domain. Subsequent cleavage of this fragment by γ-secretase, which appears to be identical with the presenilins, results in the release and secretion of Aβ (3Haass C. De Strooper B. Science. 1999; 286: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).Recently, an aspartyl protease with β-secretase activity was identified in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and was initially called BACE (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme, Asp2, or memapsin 2) (4Hussain I.

While BACE-2 is predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues, BACE is highly expressed in neurons, the major site of Aβ generation. However, it appears that βAPP is not the only substrate for BACE. In fact, mouse βAPP is a very poor substrate for β-secretase activity (10De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). “Humanizing” the Aβ domain of mouse βAPP by three amino acid substitutions resulted in efficient cleavage by β-secretase (10De Strooper B.

However, other physiological substrates of BACE remain to be identified.BACE is cotranslationally modified by N-glycosylation and further maturates by complex glycosylation as well as proteolytic removal of its prodomain by a furin-like protease (11Bennett B.D.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It has recently been reported that BACE is reinternalized from the cell surface to early endosomes and can recycle back to the cell surface, a process that depends on a dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of BACE (14Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This signal is located close to a negatively charged domain, which contains a potential phosphorylation site. We found that BACE is indeed phosphorylated within its C-terminal domain and that the biological function of BACE phosphorylation resides in the regulation of the retrieval of reinternalized BACE from endosomes.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed the subcellular trafficking of BACE dependent on its phosphorylation state. A single phosphorylation site was identified by mutagenesis of serine residue 498 in the C-terminal domain of BACE (Fig. 1 A). By testing several protein kinasesin vitro, we found that CK-1 can phosphorylate BACE at thein vivo phosphorylation site at serine residue 498. HD, which preferentially inhibits CK-1 beside glycogen synthase kinase 3β and cyclin-dependent kinases (29Meijer L. Thunnissen A.M. White A.W. Garnier M. Nikolic M. Tsai L.H. Walter J. Cleverley K.E. Salinas P.C. Wu Y.Z. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Kim S.H. Pettit G.R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), significantly reduced phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of BACE in cellular extracts. The phosphorylation site identified at serine residue 498 is preceded by a stretch of acidic amino acid residues (Fig. 1 A) representing a canonical recognition motif for CK-1, but not for glycogen synthase kinase 3β or cyclin-dependent kinases. Taken together, these data indicate that CK-1 or a CK-1-like kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of BACE in vivo. Phosphorylation occurs exclusively on the fully maturated BACE after propeptide removal and complexN-glycosylation. This indicates that phosphorylation of BACE takes place selectively after its exit from the ER, presumably in Golgi or post-Golgi compartments. CK-1 occurs in several isoforms, and some have been shown to be associated with the plasma membrane and synaptic vesicles and to selectively phosphorylate a subset of membrane proteins (36Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). CK-1 is implicated in the regulation of vesicular trafficking in yeast presumably by phosphorylating components of clathrin adaptor proteins (37Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2591-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a CK-1 isoform with a particular subcellular distribution (i.e. in late Golgi and/or endosomal compartments) might be responsible for the highly selective phosphorylation of mature BACE. It has been reported that CK-1 is significantly elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains (39Schwab C. DeMaggio A.J. Ghoshal N. Binder L.I. Kuret J. McGeer P.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Yasojima K. Kuret J. DeMaggio A.J. McGeer E. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 2000; 865: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aβ has been shown to activate CK-1 in vitro(41Chauhan A. Chauhan V.P. Murakami N. Brockerhoff H. Wisniewski H.M. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined if phosphorylation of BACE is altered during pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.In order to investigate the cellular function of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on the trafficking of BACE, we generated mutants in which the phosphorylation site at serine residue 498 has been substituted by an alanine or an aspartate residue to mimic nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of BACE, respectively. The major advantage of this strategy is to circumvent the use of agents modulating kinase or phosphatase activities that might cause nonspecific or indirect effects (42Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 43Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BACE carrying the S498D substitution was predominantly localized in juxtanuclear compartments, where it partially colocalizes with the Golgi marker protein giantin.

In contrast, the nonphosphorylated form BACE S498A showed less localization in juxtanuclear structures but pronounced localization in vesicular compartments including EEA1 positive early endosomes. It was demonstrated previously that the complete deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of BACE results in its retention within the ER and in impaired maturation (12Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M.

However, the phosphorylation site mutants BACE S498A and BACE S498D mature normally by complex N-glycosylation and proteolytic removal of the prodomain as compared with BACE WT. Therefore, the significant differences in subcellular localization of the mutant variants of BACE are due to distinct sorting. Consistent with previous results (12Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M.

BACE WT as well as the mutant derivatives S498A and S498D were efficiently endocytosed, indicating that phosphorylation of BACE does not determine its reinternalization from the cell surface. Rather, we found that phosphorylation of BACE is functionally required for efficient retrieval of the enzyme from early endosomes to later endosomal and/or TGN compartments from which BACE might be recycled into the secretory pathway.Interestingly, phosphorylation of reinternalized BACE affected its colocalization with its protein substrate βAPP in juxtanuclear structures. However, overexpressing BACE WT or the phosphorylation site mutants led to increased secretion of Aβ as compared with untransfected control cell lines (data not shown). This may reflect that expression of exogenous BACE leads to saturated levels of Aβ generation, regardless of the differences in subcellular localization of the BACE variants. Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that βAPP could be cleaved by β-secretase activity in distinct compartments, including endosomes and late Golgi compartments (16Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A.

In addition, all variants of BACE undergo normal maturation by complex N-glycosylation. These data indicate that at least two major sites of β-secretase activity, endosomes and secretory vesicles, can be reached by BACE independent of its phosphorylation state. However, it might be possible that regulation of subcellular trafficking of endogenously expressed BACE by phosphorylation affects proteolytic processing of other, yet unknown, protein substrates. In addition, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that phosphorylation may have subtle effects on βAPP processing.The regulatory mechanism of subcellular trafficking of BACE is highly reminiscent to that of furin. Retrieval of furin from endosomal to TGN compartments was also shown to be dependent on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain (45Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C.

Therefore, the subcellular localization of BACE is regulated in a remarkably similar fashion like furin, a protease that has recently been demonstrated to be required for propeptide cleavage of BACE (11Bennett B.D.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is pathologically characterized by the invariant accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in certain areas of the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The major constituent of senile plaques is the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ),1 which derives from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) by endoproteolytic processing (2Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). β-Secretase cleaves βAPP at the N terminus of the Aβ-domain, resulting in the generation of soluble APPS-β and a membrane-associated C-terminal fragment bearing the complete Aβ-domain. Subsequent cleavage of this fragment by γ-secretase, which appears to be identical with the presenilins, results in the release and secretion of Aβ (3Haass C. De Strooper B.

While BACE-2 is predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues, BACE is highly expressed in neurons, the major site of Aβ generation. However, it appears that βAPP is not the only substrate for BACE. In fact, mouse βAPP is a very poor substrate for β-secretase activity (10De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). “Humanizing” the Aβ domain of mouse βAPP by three amino acid substitutions resulted in efficient cleavage by β-secretase (10De Strooper B.

However, other physiological substrates of BACE remain to be identified. BACE is cotranslationally modified by N-glycosylation and further maturates by complex glycosylation as well as proteolytic removal of its prodomain by a furin-like protease (11Bennett B.D. Denis P.

This is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that β-secretase cleavage of βAPP can occur in all of these acidic compartments (15Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J.

It has recently been reported that BACE is reinternalized from the cell surface to early endosomes and can recycle back to the cell surface, a process that depends on a dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of BACE (14Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This signal is located close to a negatively charged domain, which contains a potential phosphorylation site. We found that BACE is indeed phosphorylated within its C-terminal domain and that the biological function of BACE phosphorylation resides in the regulation of the retrieval of reinternalized BACE from endosomes. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed the subcellular trafficking of BACE dependent on its phosphorylation state. A single phosphorylation site was identified by mutagenesis of serine residue 498 in the C-terminal domain of BACE (Fig. 1 A). By testing several protein kinasesin vitro, we found that CK-1 can phosphorylate BACE at thein vivo phosphorylation site at serine residue 498. HD, which preferentially inhibits CK-1 beside glycogen synthase kinase 3β and cyclin-dependent kinases (29Meijer L. Thunnissen A.M. White A.W. Garnier M. Nikolic M. Tsai L.H. Walter J. Cleverley K.E. Salinas P.C. Wu Y.Z. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Kim S.H. Pettit G.R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), significantly reduced phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of BACE in cellular extracts. The phosphorylation site identified at serine residue 498 is preceded by a stretch of acidic amino acid residues (Fig. 1 A) representing a canonical recognition motif for CK-1, but not for glycogen synthase kinase 3β or cyclin-dependent kinases. Taken together, these data indicate that CK-1 or a CK-1-like kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of BACE in vivo. Phosphorylation occurs exclusively on the fully maturated BACE after propeptide removal and complexN-glycosylation. This indicates that phosphorylation of BACE takes place selectively after its exit from the ER, presumably in Golgi or post-Golgi compartments. CK-1 occurs in several isoforms, and some have been shown to be associated with the plasma membrane and synaptic vesicles and to selectively phosphorylate a subset of membrane proteins (36Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). CK-1 is implicated in the regulation of vesicular trafficking in yeast presumably by phosphorylating components of clathrin adaptor proteins (37Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2591-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a CK-1 isoform with a particular subcellular distribution (i.e. in late Golgi and/or endosomal compartments) might be responsible for the highly selective phosphorylation of mature BACE. It has been reported that CK-1 is significantly elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains (39Schwab C. DeMaggio A.J. Ghoshal N. Binder L.I. Kuret J. McGeer P.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Yasojima K. Kuret J. DeMaggio A.J. McGeer E. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 2000; 865: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aβ has been shown to activate CK-1 in vitro(41Chauhan A. Chauhan V.P. Murakami N. Brockerhoff H. Wisniewski H.M. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined if phosphorylation of BACE is altered during pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.In order to investigate the cellular function of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on the trafficking of BACE, we generated mutants in which the phosphorylation site at serine residue 498 has been substituted by an alanine or an aspartate residue to mimic nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of BACE, respectively. The major advantage of this strategy is to circumvent the use of agents modulating kinase or phosphatase activities that might cause nonspecific or indirect effects (42Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 43Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A single phosphorylation site was identified by mutagenesis of serine residue 498 in the C-terminal domain of BACE (Fig. 1 A). By testing several protein kinasesin vitro, we found that CK-1 can phosphorylate BACE at thein vivo phosphorylation site at serine residue 498. HD, which preferentially inhibits CK-1 beside glycogen synthase kinase 3β and cyclin-dependent kinases (29Meijer L. Thunnissen A.M. White A.W. Garnier M. Nikolic M. Tsai L.H. Walter J. Cleverley K.E.

Biol. 2000; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), significantly reduced phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of BACE in cellular extracts. The phosphorylation site identified at serine residue 498 is preceded by a stretch of acidic amino acid residues (Fig. 1 A) representing a canonical recognition motif for CK-1, but not for glycogen synthase kinase 3β or cyclin-dependent kinases. Taken together, these data indicate that CK-1 or a CK-1-like kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of BACE in vivo. Phosphorylation occurs exclusively on the fully maturated BACE after propeptide removal and complexN-glycosylation. This indicates that phosphorylation of BACE takes place selectively after its exit from the ER, presumably in Golgi or post-Golgi compartments. CK-1 occurs in several isoforms, and some have been shown to be associated with the plasma membrane and synaptic vesicles and to selectively phosphorylate a subset of membrane proteins (36Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). CK-1 is implicated in the regulation of vesicular trafficking in yeast presumably by phosphorylating components of clathrin adaptor proteins (37Faundez V.V. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2591-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a CK-1 isoform with a particular subcellular distribution (i.e. in late Golgi and/or endosomal compartments) might be responsible for the highly selective phosphorylation of mature BACE. It has been reported that CK-1 is significantly elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains (39Schwab C. DeMaggio A.J. Ghoshal N. Binder L.I. Kuret J. McGeer P.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Yasojima K. Kuret J. DeMaggio A.J. McGeer E. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 2000; 865: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aβ has been shown to activate CK-1 in vitro(41Chauhan A. Chauhan V.P. Murakami N. Brockerhoff H. Wisniewski H.M. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined if phosphorylation of BACE is altered during pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In order to investigate the cellular function of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on the trafficking of BACE, we generated mutants in which the phosphorylation site at serine residue 498 has been substituted by an alanine or an aspartate residue to mimic nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of BACE, respectively. The major advantage of this strategy is to circumvent the use of agents modulating kinase or phosphatase activities that might cause nonspecific or indirect effects (42Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 43Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BACE carrying the S498D substitution was predominantly localized in juxtanuclear compartments, where it partially colocalizes with the Golgi marker protein giantin. A very similar distribution was observed for BACE WT, which is consistent with previous results (7Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P.

In contrast, the nonphosphorylated form BACE S498A showed less localization in juxtanuclear structures but pronounced localization in vesicular compartments including EEA1 positive early endosomes. It was demonstrated previously that the complete deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of BACE results in its retention within the ER and in impaired maturation (12Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M.

However, the phosphorylation site mutants BACE S498A and BACE S498D mature normally by complex N-glycosylation and proteolytic removal of the prodomain as compared with BACE WT. Therefore, the significant differences in subcellular localization of the mutant variants of BACE are due to distinct sorting. Consistent with previous results (12Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M.

BACE WT as well as the mutant derivatives S498A and S498D were efficiently endocytosed, indicating that phosphorylation of BACE does not determine its reinternalization from the cell surface. Rather, we found that phosphorylation of BACE is functionally required for efficient retrieval of the enzyme from early endosomes to later endosomal and/or TGN compartments from which BACE might be recycled into the secretory pathway. Interestingly, phosphorylation of reinternalized BACE affected its colocalization with its protein substrate βAPP in juxtanuclear structures. However, overexpressing BACE WT or the phosphorylation site mutants led to increased secretion of Aβ as compared with untransfected control cell lines (data not shown). This may reflect that expression of exogenous BACE leads to saturated levels of Aβ generation, regardless of the differences in subcellular localization of the BACE variants. Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that βAPP could be cleaved by β-secretase activity in distinct compartments, including endosomes and late Golgi compartments (16Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A.

In addition, all variants of BACE undergo normal maturation by complex N-glycosylation. These data indicate that at least two major sites of β-secretase activity, endosomes and secretory vesicles, can be reached by BACE independent of its phosphorylation state. However, it might be possible that regulation of subcellular trafficking of endogenously expressed BACE by phosphorylation affects proteolytic processing of other, yet unknown, protein substrates. In addition, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that phosphorylation may have subtle effects on βAPP processing. The regulatory mechanism of subcellular trafficking of BACE is highly reminiscent to that of furin. Retrieval of furin from endosomal to TGN compartments was also shown to be dependent on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain (45Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

PAK4 differs from other members of the PAK family both in sequence and function.

Studies with a constitutively active PAK4 mutant have shown that it also has a role in promoting anchorage-independent growth, an important hallmark of oncogenic transformation. Here we show that another function of PAK4 is to protect cells against apoptotic cell death. Expression of wild-type or constitutively active PAK4 delays the onset of apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor α stimulation, UV irradiation, and serum starvation. Consistent with an antiapoptotic function, expression of PAK4 leads to an increase in phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad and an inhibition of caspase activation.

Normal development requires a carefully controlled balance between cell survival and cell death. Throughout development excess cells are eliminated by the process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. A number of different stimuli can trigger apoptosis in cells in culture including Fas ligand, UV irradiation, serum deprivation, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα).1 Exposure to apoptosis-inducing agents triggers a series of events, often involving the caspase cysteine proteases. For example, Fas ligand induces the activation and cleavage of initiating caspases such as caspase-8, which in turn leads to activation of downstream caspases including caspases-3 and -9. Caspase-3 as well as other effector caspases in turn cleave a number of different target proteins that play important roles in mediating the apoptotic response (1Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 2Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar).Caspase-8 can also activate a signaling pathway that leads to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Release of cytochrome c leads to activation of caspase-9 followed by cleavage and activation of caspase-3, leading to apoptosis (2Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 3Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is governed largely by Bid and members of the Bcl-2 family. Members of the Bcl-2 family can have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activities. For example Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, A1, and Bag-1 promote survival, whereas Bcl-xS, Bad, Bax, and Bak promote apoptosis (4Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). The interactions between the different BCL-2 family members play an important role in determining cell fate. For example Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which are located at the mitochondrial outer membrane, promote cell survival by inhibiting cytochromec release. In contrast Bad can interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and prevent their inhibitory activities. Thus binding of Bad to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL stimulates the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. One way that the activities of the Bcl-2 family members are regulated is by phosphorylation. When Bad is phosphorylated on serines 136 and 112 it can no longer interact with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, cytochromec release is inhibited, and apoptosis is prevented (5Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A number of survival signals including growth factors can lead to phosphorylation of Bad at both serines 136 and 112. Some of these signals are mediated by the survival factor Akt, which phosphorylates Bad on serine 136 (6Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4913) Google Scholar). In addition to Akt other protein kinases can phosphorylate Bad. For example constitutively active PAK1, a member of the PAK family of serine/threonine kinases, was shown recently to stimulate Bad phosphorylation at both serines 136 and 112 (7Schurmann A.

At present four major members of the PAK family have been identified in mammalian cells, which seem to fall into two categories based on their structures. The first category includes the closely related human PAK1, human PAK2, and mouse PAK3 and the corresponding rat homologues αPAK, γPAK, and βPAK, respectively (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H.

Each of these proteins contains an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. Within the regulatory domain is a GTPase binding domain (GBD) that mediates binding to Cdc42 and Rac. Also within the regulatory domain are two to five proline-rich regions that bind to SH3 domain-containing proteins such as the adaptor protein Nck (18Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr.

Carboxyl-terminal to the kinase domain is a motif that can interact with yeast G protein βγ subunits, suggesting that the PAKs might be regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins in mammalian cells (22Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23Leberer E. Dignard D. Leeuw T. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2000; 381: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The most recently identified member of the PAK family is PAK4, which falls into a second category of PAKs (14Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Like the other PAKs, PAK4 contains an amino-terminal GBD and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. Unlike other PAKs, however, PAK4 does not have SH3-domain recognition sites or a G protein βγ binding domain, and it does not bind to PIX or Nck ( Ref.14Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). 2C. Dan and A. Minden, unpublished results. 2C. Dan and A. Minden, unpublished results. Furthermore the GBD and kinase domains of PAK4 have only ∼50% identity with those of PAKs 1, 2, and 3, and the regulatory domain of PAK4 outside of the GBD is completely different from the other PAKs.One important function of the PAK proteins is the regulation of cytoskeletal architecture (24Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

PAK1 has been reported to induce filopodia and membrane ruffles by a mechanism that is independent of its ability to bind the Rho GTPases and partially independent of its kinase activity (28Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 29Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Others have found that αPAK and PAK2 do not induce filopodia or lamellipodia but instead have a role in the dissolution of stress fibers, down-regulation of focal adhesions, and cell retraction (30Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More recently the PAKs have been shown also to have important roles in regulating the apoptotic response, although the different PAKs have different functions. For example γPAK and PAK2 get cleaved during apoptosis most likely by caspase-3. This leads to their activation, and the activated kinases in turn are thought to contribute to morphological and membrane changes that occur during apoptosis (31Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 32Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

In contrast PAK1, which is not cleaved by caspases, was reported to protect cells from apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in fibroblasts and interleukin-3 withdrawal in lymphoid cells (7Schurmann A.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The survival signal induced by PAK1 is apparently due to phosphorylation of Bad on both serines 112 and 136 (7Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol.

It is the first member of the PAK family that was shown to be a link between Cdc42 and filopodia formation (14Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). More recently we have found that PAK4 also has a role in regulating cell growth. In fact a constitutively active mutant of PAK4 can induce anchorage-independent growth, one of the hallmarks of oncogenic transformation. 3Qu, J., Cammarano, M. S., Shi, Q., Ha, K., de Lanerolle, P., and Minden, A., (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. in press. 3Qu, J., Cammarano, M. S., Shi, Q., Ha, K., de Lanerolle, P., and Minden, A., (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. in press.Here we have investigated another role for PAK4: the induction of cell survival pathways in response to apoptotic stimuli. We have found that cells overexpressing either wild-type or constitutively active PAK4 have a survival advantage during apoptosis. PAK4 protects cells from apoptosis not only in response to serum withdrawal but also in response to TNFα treatment or UV irradiation. Expression of PAK4 inhibits activation of caspase-3-like enzymes and specifically promotes the phosphorylation of Bad on serine 112.DISCUSSIONThe PAK4 serine/threonine kinase was identified originally as a molecular target of the Rho GTPase Cdc42, and one function of PAK4 is to mediate the induction of filopodia in response to Cdc42 (14Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells, another function of PAK4 is to protect cells against apoptosis. We have found that overexpression of PAK4 protects cells against apoptosis induced by three different stimuli: serum withdrawal, TNFα/CHX treatment, and UV irradiation. PAK4 causes a delay in caspase activation, a corresponding delay in apoptosis, and an increased overall cell survival rate in response to these stimuli. The antiapoptotic function of PAK4 seems to be correlated with its kinase activity because a constitutively active PAK4 mutant has a stronger protective effect than wild-type PAK4 (see Fig. 4), although even wild-type PAK4 has kinase activity and protects cells from apoptosis.Although all members of the PAK family are thought to be involved in the apoptotic response, the different family members have quite different roles. During apoptosis γPAK and PAK2 are activated by caspase cleavage and are thought to be involved in promoting the apoptotic response because activated forms induce morphological changes that are typical of the onset of apoptosis (31Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 32Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

In contrast PAK1 is not cleaved by caspases, and expression of activated PAK1 protects cells from apoptosis triggered by serum and interleukin-3 withdrawal (7Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have found that PAK4 cleavage is not induced upon apoptotic stimulation and that it is not cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro (data not shown). Likewise, we have found that both wild-type and activated PAK4 protects cells from apoptosis. Not only does PAK4 protect cells from serum withdrawal, but it also protects cells from TNFα- or UV irradiation-induced apoptosis.Because PAK4-overexpressing cell lines were resistant to apoptotic stimuli we have examined a number of different signaling pathways that have important roles in cell growth and apoptosis including the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and NF-κB pathways (Refs. 39Minden A. Karin M. O'Malley B.W. Hormones and Signaling. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 209-233Google Scholar and 40Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar; data not shown). However, none of these pathways were significantly elevated or inhibited in the PAK4-overexpressing cells. In contrast phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad was elevated in the cell lines expressing PAK4. Phosphorylation of Bad on two critical sites, serines 112 and 136, inhibits its activity and therefore protects cells against apoptosis (5Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A number of different stimuli including growth factors lead to phosphorylation of Bad via a pathway that requires the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates Bad on serine 136 (5Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently PAK1 was shown to be activated by Akt and to phosphorylate Bad on both serines 112 and 136 (7Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast to PAK1 we have found that PAK4 phosphorylates Bad specifically on serine 112 in in vitro kinase assays. In the stable PAK4-expressing cell lines, however, Bad phosphorylation on both serines 112 and 136 are increased. The reason for the increase in phosphorylation of serine 136 in the PAK4-expressing cell lines is not clear but is more likely to be an indirect effect rather than direct phosphorylation by PAK4. One possibility is that Akt may be responsible for Bad phosphorylation on this residue. In fact we have found that in contrast to PAK1-expressing cells (7Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) cells expressing PAK4 show an increase in Akt phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting a possible increase in Akt activity. Thus although expression of PAK4 leads to Bad phosphorylation on both serines 112 and 136, the two sites are most likely phosphorylated by different mechanisms. Although serine 112 can be phosphorylated directly by PAK4, serine 136 is most likely phosphorylated by an indirect mechanism.Caspase activation triggered by either TNFα or UV irradiation is prevented or delayed in PAK4 cell lines, as detected by PARP cleavage. This is the first demonstration that caspase activity can be regulated by expression of a PAK protein. Because PAK4 phosphorylates Bad the most likely explanation for this is that PAK4 prevents the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria by inhibiting Bad activity and thereby inhibits the activation of caspase-3, an effector caspase in this pathway. Another possibility, however, is that initiator caspases are affected. Death ligands such as TNFα activate initiator caspases such as caspase-8, which in turn can trigger apoptosis by either mitochondria-dependent or -independent mechanisms (41Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Therefore protection from TNFα-induced cell death by PAK4 could also potentially occur at the level of initiator caspases such as caspase-8 by a mechanism that does not strictly require Bad phosphorylation. Although the mechanism by which TNFα induces apoptosis is relatively well understood (41Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar), the molecular events that mediate UV irradiation-induced apoptosis are quite complex. UV irradiation can stimulate apoptosis by triggering the activation of death receptors such as TNF receptor and thereby activate a pathway similar to the one described above for TNFα (42Sheikh M.S. Antinore M.J. Huang Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, UV can also induce apoptosis by other mechanisms such as by DNA damage-dependent pathways (43Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 44Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus although we have found that PAK4 inhibits caspase cleavage induced by UV irradiation, the exact role for PAK4 in UV-induced apoptosis remains to be fully clarified.The finding that PAK4 can cause a protective effect in cells is especially interesting because PAK4 is a target for Cdc42. Cdc42 and other members of the Rho GTPase family have important roles in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and oncogenic transformation (45Michiels F. Habets G.G.

Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Recently we have found that constitutively active PAK4(S445N,S474E) can induce anchorage-independent growth3an important hallmark of oncogenic transformation similar to activated mutants of Cdc42 (50Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 51Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dominant negative PAK4 mutant can inhibit transformation by oncogenic Dbl, an exchange factor for Cdc423 These results suggest that similar to Cdc42, PAK4 also has an important role in oncogenic transformation. The mechanisms by which PAK4 can regulate oncogenic transformation are not entirely clear. Although changes in cytoskeletal architecture and cell adhesion are likely to be involved,3 another important aspect of transformation is the inhibition of apoptosis. It will be interesting to determine whether the antiapoptotic function of PAK4 plays a direct role in the oncogenic process.The regulation of apoptosis also has important implications in normal development, where extra cells are being discarded continuously. This process is especially pronounced during neuronal development. It is interesting that the closest known homologue to PAK4 is aDrosophila protein called Mushroom Body Tiny (MBT; Ref. 53Melzig J. Rein K.H. Schafer U. Pfister H. Jackle H. Heisenberg M. Raabe T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1223-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Drosophila lacking the mbt gene show a reduced number of Kenyon cells in the mushroom body, a structure inDrosophila brain. These studies suggest that MBT has a role in promoting either proliferation or survival of cells in the mushroom body. Although PAK4 is ubiquitously expressed, it will be interesting to see whether PAK4 and MBT share a common role in regulating cell survival either in neuronal or nonneuronal cells.Finally, the extracellular stimuli that regulate the activity of endogenous PAK4 are not yet known. Although PAK4 is a target for Cdc42, we do not rule out the possibility that it can also be regulated by Cdc42-independent stimuli. Other members of the PAK family can be regulated in fact by different types of stimuli and can be activated by Rho GTPase-dependent and -independent mechanisms (15Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 16Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In future work it will be important to determine what types of stimuli can activate kinase activity in endogenous PAK4, and specifically whether it is activated by stimuli that have a protective effect against apoptosis. Normal development requires a carefully controlled balance between cell survival and cell death. Throughout development excess cells are eliminated by the process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. A number of different stimuli can trigger apoptosis in cells in culture including Fas ligand, UV irradiation, serum deprivation, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα).1 Exposure to apoptosis-inducing agents triggers a series of events, often involving the caspase cysteine proteases. For example, Fas ligand induces the activation and cleavage of initiating caspases such as caspase-8, which in turn leads to activation of downstream caspases including caspases-3 and -9. Caspase-3 as well as other effector caspases in turn cleave a number of different target proteins that play important roles in mediating the apoptotic response (1Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 2Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 can also activate a signaling pathway that leads to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Release of cytochrome c leads to activation of caspase-9 followed by cleavage and activation of caspase-3, leading to apoptosis (2Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 3Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is governed largely by Bid and members of the Bcl-2 family. Members of the Bcl-2 family can have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activities. For example Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, A1, and Bag-1 promote survival, whereas Bcl-xS, Bad, Bax, and Bak promote apoptosis (4Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). The interactions between the different BCL-2 family members play an important role in determining cell fate. For example Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which are located at the mitochondrial outer membrane, promote cell survival by inhibiting cytochromec release. In contrast Bad can interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and prevent their inhibitory activities. Thus binding of Bad to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL stimulates the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. One way that the activities of the Bcl-2 family members are regulated is by phosphorylation. When Bad is phosphorylated on serines 136 and 112 it can no longer interact with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, cytochromec release is inhibited, and apoptosis is prevented (5Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A number of survival signals including growth factors can lead to phosphorylation of Bad at both serines 136 and 112. Some of these signals are mediated by the survival factor Akt, which phosphorylates Bad on serine 136 (6Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4913) Google Scholar). In addition to Akt other protein kinases can phosphorylate Bad. For example constitutively active PAK1, a me"
https://openalex.org/W2006403834,"Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) binds pro-urokinase plasminogen activator (pro-uPA) and thereby localizes it near plasminogen, causing the generation of active uPA and plasmin on the cell surface. uPAR and uPA are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines, and expression of uPAR and uPA is highly correlated to tumor invasion and metastasis. To exploit these characteristics in the design of tumor cell-selective cytotoxins, we constructed mutated anthrax toxin-protective antigen (PrAg) proteins in which the furin cleavage site is replaced by sequences cleaved specifically by uPA. These uPA-targeted PrAg proteins were activated selectively on the surface of uPAR-expressing tumor cells in the presence of pro-uPA and plasminogen. The activated PrAg proteins caused internalization of a recombinant cytotoxin, FP59, consisting of anthrax toxin lethal factor residues 1–254 fused to the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, thereby killing the uPAR-expressing tumor cells. The activation and cytotoxicity of these uPA-targeted PrAg proteins were strictly dependent on the integrity of the tumor cell surface-associated plasminogen activation system. We also constructed a mutated PrAg protein that selectively killed tissue plasminogen activator-expressing cells. These mutated PrAg proteins may be useful as new therapeutic agents for cancer treatment."

Anesthesia. Churchill Livingstone, New York1990: 51-83Google Scholar). Our laboratory exploits a very simple animal model, the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, to investigate the molecular mechanism of volatile anesthetic action. We have established that the interactions of multiple genes are crucial in controlling the behavior of C. elegans in volatile anesthetics (3Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Meneely P.M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 2965-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Anesthesiology. 1994; 81: 888-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At least seven genes interact to control the response of C. elegans to volatile anesthetics (3Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Meneely P.M. Proc. Nat. Acad.

Mutations in one gene,gas-1 (for generalanesthetic-sensitive)1cause hypersensitivity to all inhalation anesthetics tested as well as to ethanol. gas-1 overrides the effects of the other genes on sensitivity to volatile anesthetics. Nematodes with this mutation are also temperature-sensitive embryonic lethals, have a reduced life span, slow growth rates, and an increased sensitivity to the deleterious effects of free radicals and hyperoxia (5Hartman, P. S., Ishii, N., Kayser, E.-B., Morgan, P. G. and Sedensky, M. M. (2000) Mech. Ageing Dev., in press.Google Scholar). However, they move quite normally in air, indicating a functional neuromuscular system. Previously, we cloned the gas-1 gene and identified a point mutation in the allele fc21 (6Kayser E.-B. Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Anesthesiology. 1999; 90: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison strongly suggested that gas-1 encoded a homologue of the bovine 49-kDa(IP) subunit of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), the first protein complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Previous studies from other investigators indicated that Complex I was the most sensitive complex to inhibition by volatile anesthetics (7Cohen P.J. Anesthesiology. 1973; 39: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Harris R.A. Munroe J. Farmer B. Kim K.C. Jenkins P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 49-kDa(IP) proteins are common to both the very complicated eukaryotic Complex I (41 different subunits) and to the much simplerParacoccus enzyme (only 15 subunits). Both enzyme complexes catalyze the same reaction, i.e. proton-pumping across the mitochondrial membrane, driven by the transfer of electrons from NADH to a quinone (9Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 10Xu X. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6925-6932Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A knockout mutant of the “49-kDa(IP) gene” inNeurospora completely lacked NADH-dehydrogenase activity, because the “matrix arm” of the enzyme complex failed to assemble (11Preis D. van der Pas J.C. Nehls U. Rohlen D.-A. Sackmann U. Jahnke U. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All of the Complex I mutants in Neurosporawere reported to have reduced growth rates, and their conidia were less viable. This is reminiscent of the reduced growth rate, life span, and brood size of fc21. The matrix arm of Complex I contains the binding site for NADH as well as all but one of the redox centers. Lastly, the 49-kDa(IP) subunit from Rhodobacter has been implicated in binding the head group of quinones (such as the electron acceptor, ubiquinone) and quinone-like inhibitors of Complex I. Thus, 49-kDa(IP) proteins seem to be essential for the core function of Complex I (10Xu X. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6925-6932Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Anderson W.M. Trgovcich-Zacok D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). gas-1(fc21) is the first known mutation of this subunit in animals. The fact that, in gas-1(fc21) animals, a strictly conserved amino acid residue is affected in a subunit essential for Complex I function suggests that the activity of the mutant Complex I is decreased or abolished. However, it has not been proven that the GAS-1 protein has a mitochondrial function. In addition, during the sequencing of the genome of C. elegans a second homologue of the 49 kDa(IP) subunit, T26A5.3, was identified (13The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium.Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). Because the relative importance of these two genes in mitochondrial function is not known, we studied their expression and the effects of thegas-1(fc21) mutation on mitochondrial function. In these studies we show that gas-1 is abundantly expressed in multiple tissues, including those most likely to confer anesthetic-induced immobility: neurons and body wall muscle. Expression of the second homologue of the 49-kDa(IP) subunit, T26A5.3, could not be detected via a promoter reporter. Pharmacological studies with aldicarb (14Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12593-12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) indicate that the effect of gas-1 on anesthetic sensitivity is partially presynaptic and most consistent with neuronal effects. We also show that isolated mitochondria fromgas-1 animals have reduced Complex I enzymatic activities, as measured by rates of both oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport. An increase in Complex II-dependent metabolism also is seen in gas-1(fc21) animals. These results confirm that GAS-1 is the major isoform of the 49-kDa(IP) subunit in Complex I, and that it is a crucial component of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in C. elegans. The conventions for C. elegansnomenclature have been followed throughout (15Horvitz H.R. Brenner S. Hodgkin J. Herman R.K. Mol. Gen.

This designation can also specify worms homozygous for a mutation in this gene, e.g. gas-1, the mutant worm.

Individual allele names are represented by a combination of one or two letters and a number, either alone or added in parentheses, e.g. fc21 or ingas-1(fc21). Non-italicized, all capital letters indicate the protein, e.g. the protein GAS-1. Brackets indicate transgenic constructs. For example, [gas-1 +] are animals carrying the wild type gas-1 gene as a result of microinjection into a mutant gas-1 background.

Standard techniques were used for growing and maintaining cultures of C. elegans and for constructing double mutants,e.g. unc-7 gas-1 (16Brenner S.

Aldicarb and levamisole were added to agar plates on which an Escherichia coli lawn had been grown as in previous studies (14Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc.

Genetics. 1995; 140: 527-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after addition of the drugs, nematodes were placed on the agar plates. Nematodes were scored through a dissecting microscope for contracted immobility 2 h after exposure to the drugs, during which a steady-state response had been reached. They were scored as immobile if no locomotion was seen for 10 s. EC50 values were determined as described previously (3Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Meneely P.M. Proc. Nat. Acad.

At least 50 animals were scored at each concentration of drug and the EC50 values were calculated from the responses to five different drug concentrations, done in duplicate, bracketing the EC50 values. Transgenic nematodes such asunc-7 gas-1 [gas-1 +;rol-6(su1006)] have been created by microinjection as previously described (6Kayser E.-B. Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M.

A plasmid containing rol-6(su1006) (gift of Michael Krauss) was coinjected with the test gene to provide an easily visible phenotype for selection of successful transformants. The genomic DNA sequence immediately upstream of the gas-1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the cosmid K09A9 as a template. The primers introduced an artificial ApaI site on one end of the resulting 818-bp PCR fragment and a BamHI site on the other. This sequence was cloned directionally into theApaI-BamHI-linearized vector pEGFP1(CLONTECH) upstream of a promoterless gene for “enhanced green fluorescent protein” (EGFP) (Fig. 1 A). The resulting plasmid pPrKE together with arol-6-containing plasmid were microinjected into wild type N2 hermaphrodites. Transformed offspring were selected by picking rolling F1 larvae. Stable transformants were picked in the F2 generation. In these transformants, transcriptional activity of thegas-1 promoter was reported by green fluorescence, which was observed by epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioscope, Chroma long-pass filter set 41018). The filter set allows one to distinguish yellowish gut granule autofluorescence from EGFP's green fluorescence. This distinction is lost in pictures taken with a “colorblind” confocal microscope. In this study a translational fusion construct was made consisting of: 1) the 818-bp gas-1 promoter region and the first 123 bp of thegas-1 coding sequence covering the translational start through 9 codons past a predicted cleavage site for a mitochondrial transit peptidase; 2) the complete coding sequence of EGFP omitting the stop codon; and 3) the genomic sequence of the gas-1 locus, starting with the first codon after the predicted cleavage site and extending 451 bp past the stop codon (Fig. 1 A). These three subfragments were generated by PCR using primers having 15-mer overhangs with the sequence of the respective neighboring fragment. PCR with a mix of fragments 1, 2, and 3 as template and the forward primer to fragment 1 and the reverse primer to fragment 3 assembled the entire gene. The complete gene was cloned into vector pBluescript II K+ (Stratagene) and named pKEK. Correct assembly of pKEK was confirmed by sequencing the construct. pKEK was microinjected into mnDp1; unc-7 gas-1yielding unc-7 gas-1[pKEK, rol-6] offspring, which were tested for sensitivity to halothane. For a detailed description of the rationale behind using the nematode strain, mnDp1; unc-7 gas-1 to demonstrate mutant rescue of gas-1 (see Ref.6Kayser E.-B. Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Anesthesiology. 1999; 90: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The localization of the GAS-1::EGFP internal fusion protein in animals that were mobile in 2% halothane was determined by epifluorescence microscopy. All preparations were done at 4 °C. Clean worms were suspended in MSM-E (220 mmmannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, pH to 7.4 with KOH). A polytron (Brinkman Instruments) was used for initial rupture: 20 s at 14,000 rpm. 5 mg/(g of worms) proteinase type XXVII (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the homogenate and stirred for 10 min. Immediately afterward the slurry was homogenized in a glass Potter/Elvehjem tissue grinder with a Teflon pestle. After adding 1 volume of MSM-E containing 0.4% BSA, the homogenate was centrifuged (300 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered through three layers of gauze and recentrifuged (7000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in MSM-E and washed twice by centrifugation (7000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The final mitochondria pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of MSM-E. Total protein was determined by the Lowry assay with BSA as a standard (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Rose J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polarigraphic measurement of oxidative phosphorylation was performed as previously described (22Gudz T.I. Tserng K.Y. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24154-24158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Briefly, oxygen uptake was followed with a Clark type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments, YSI) connected to a chart recorder via a YSI Oxygen monitor. 500 μg of mitochondria was injected into 500 μl of air saturated incubation media (100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mg/ml defatted BSA) kept at 30 °C. The following substances were added sequentially: 50 nmol of ADP allowing the mitochondria to exhaust internal substrates; either 10 mmmalate, 10 mm glutamate, or 20 mm succinate providing a defined substrate in saturating concentration, then 50–100 nmol of ADP to determine state 3 and state 4 respiration rates; 100 nmol of 2,4-dinitrophenol to uncouple the mitochondria; and 5 mm ascorbate with 0.5 m TMPD as an electron donor for cytochrome c and to quickly determine the point of 0% oxygen saturation for each run. Oxygen uptake rates, respiratory control ratio, and ADP/O were calculated according to previous studies (23Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 217: 409-427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Frozen (−60 °C) samples of mitochondria preparations were solubilized with cholate, and zero order rates were determined spectrophotometrically for the following enzyme activities: Citrate synthase, rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome-c reductase, succinate-cytochrome-c reductase, antimycin A-sensitive decylubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase, NADH-ferricyanide reductase, rotenone-sensitive NADH-decylubiquinone reductase, succinate-DCPIP reductase, and duroquinone-stimulated TTFA-sensitive succinate DCPIP reductase. The first order rate constant was determined for cytochrome-c oxidase. Assays and calculations were performed as described by Hoppel et al. (25Hoppel C.L. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Turkaly J. Tandler B.

Freshly prepared mitochondria were prepared for transmission electron microscopy as described by Hoppel et al. (25Hoppel C.L. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Turkaly J. Tandler B. J. Biol.

Using contracted immobility as an end point, sensitivity to aldicarb was decreased in gas-1animals, whereas sensitivity to levamisole was unchanged from that of N2 (Table I). Levamisole is a cholinergic agonist, whereas aldicarb inhibits acetylcholine degradation. These agents are used in C. elegans to distinguish pre- from post-synaptic effects of mutations. Our results indicate that at least part of the effect of gas-1 results from a presynaptic effect (18Nguyen M. Alfonso A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B.

Values are given ± S.D. Values were compared using student's t test. Previously, we were able to rescue the hypersensitivity of gas-1(fc21) to halothane by introducing a 4.6-kb SfuI restriction fragment from the cosmid K09A9 into an unc-7 gas-1(fc21) animal (6Kayser E.-B. Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. Anesthesiology. 1999; 90: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the fragment contained not only the wild type coding sequence forgas-1 but also a functional promoter. To visualize the tissues in which this gas-1 promoter is active, the 818-bp sequence immediately upstream of the gas-1 start codon (gas-1 promoter) was cloned in front of the promoterless coding sequence of a green fluorescence protein, EGFP. Wild type nematodes made transgenic for this reporter construct show green fluorescence in tissues that normally express the gas-1gene. The strongest fluorescence was regularly observed in the pharyngeal muscles and widely distributed in the tail. Body wall muscles, vulva muscles, and parts of the nervous system were also labeled, although with more variability (Fig. 1). Autofluorescence of the gut granules made it impossible to determine whether EGFP was expressed in the intestinal cells. Gonads and eggs never expressed the reporter, suggesting silence of the microinjectedgas-1 promoter in these tissues. All developmental stages of larvae expressed the construct, which was seen as early as L1. To assess whether GAS-1 is indeed directed into mitochondria, a plasmid, pKEK, was constructed that expressed an EGFP-labeled GAS-1 protein under the control of the gas-1 promoter. We reasoned that to rescue the mutant phenotype, the GAS-1::EGFP fusion protein must reach the mitochondria. All mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nucleus require an N-terminal transit peptide to be routed into the mitochondrion; this peptide is believed to be cleaved off once the protein reaches its destination. In the case of GAS-1, an algorithm described by Gavel and von Heijne (26Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) predicted such a cleavage site after amino acid residue number 32. Thus, the EGFP tag had to be inserted downstream of this site. On the other hand, inserting the tag into the sequence of the mature part of GAS-1 might disrupt GAS-1's function. To solve this potential dilemma, the fusion inpKEK was designed to repeat the first 9 amino acids beyond the cleavage site with EGFP sandwiched between these repeats (Fig.2 A). The rationale was to provide the transit peptidase with a familiar peptide sequence around its cleavage site and to have the full sequence of the mature GAS-1 downstream of the tag. EGFP-containing transformants, unc-7 gas-1 [gas-1 + -egfp; rol-6], showed subcellular punctate green fluorescence rather than the fluorescence-filled cells seen with the promoter reporter transformants (Fig. 2 B). In body wall muscle these fluorescing dots are neatly arranged in lines parallel to the myofibrils. This suggests mitochondrial localization of the fusion protein. This pattern was seen in all stages of development, as early as L1. A simpler construct with the EGFP appended to the C terminus of GAS-1 yielded a comparable staining pattern but did not rescue the anesthetic phenotype (data not shown). The C. elegans sequencing consortium (13The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium.Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar) identified a potential isogene to gas-1. Because no mutations of this gene are known, it is designated by its associate cosmid name: T26A5.3. The predicted gene product would be a protein that is 96% identical to GAS-1 and is 65% identical to the bovine homologue (transit peptides excluded). Worms transgenic for T26A5.3 (unc-7 gas-1 [T26A5.3; rol-6], originating frommnDp1; unc-7 gas-1 microinjected with the cosmid T26A5), were immobile in 2% halothane in all (12 out of 12) transformed lines. In contrast, worms transgenic for a chimeric gene consisting of T26A5.3 coding sequence under the control of the gas-1 promoter were rescued to normal anesthetic behavior (data not shown). Thus, when under the control of the gas-1 promoter, the T26A5.3 protein can functionally replace GAS-1. To rule out that T26A5.3 is a non-transcribed pseudogene, RNA from a mixed stage culture of wild type worms was amplified using RT-PCR with primer pairs designed to either specifically amplify thegas-1 mRNA or the presumed T26A5.3 mRNA. In both cases products of the expected size were obtained (1633 and 1423 bp, respectively), indicating that T26A5.3 is transcribed (data not shown). Re-amplification of the products with nested primers was successful if primers specifically designed for the respective cDNA were employed. However, amplification failed when gas-1 primers were used on the PCR product obtained with T26A5.3 primers (and vice versa). This ruled out cross-reactivity of the primers with the mRNA from either gene. To visualize where and when T26A5.3 is expressed, a promoter reporter construct was made analogous to the one for gas-1. We assumed that the promoter of T26A5.3 is situated upstream of the predicted start codon but no farther away than the next predicted gene upstream of T26A5.3; this entire 1.5-kb fragment was placed upstream of the EGFP code. When this construct was introduced into a wild type nematode, no fluorescence above background could be detected in the transformants at any stage of development (data not shown). We conclude that T26A5.3 is naturally expressed at very low levels or in tissues where the assay cannot detect it, such as the germline or gut. Oxidative phosphorylation allows assessment of the impact of gas-1 on the proton transport capacity of the whole respiratory chain. In intact mitochondria, electron transport, as measured by oxygen uptake (respiration), and generation of ATP (phosphorylation) are tightly coupled by the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria from wild type nematodes can metabolize malate, glutamate, pyruvate, or succinate (27Murfitt R.R. Vogel K. Sanadi D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1976; 53B: 423-430Google Scholar). Oxidative phosphorylation, measured as oxygen uptake, is maximal when electron donor substrates (malate, glutamate, pyruvate, or succinate) and substrates for the F0F1-ATPase (ADP and inorganic phosphate) are present in saturating concentrations (state 3 respiration). Thus, the state 3 rate represents the maximum respiratory capacity of the mitochondrion. Malate, glutamate, and pyruvate are oxidized by mitochondrial enzymes, which produce NADH, which in turn feeds electrons into the respiratory chain via Complex I. When Complex I is blocked by rotenone, none of these substrates promotes oxygen uptake (data not shown). In gas-1 state 3 respiration with either glutamate, malate, or pyruvate/malate as the substrate is lower than in the wild type by 66%, 64%, and 62%, respectively (Fig.3 A and TableII). Similarly, the ADP/O ratio was decreased in the gas-1 mutant (Fig. 3 B and Table II). On the other hand, in mitochondria fromgas-1animals, succinate-dependent state 3 respiration is enhanced relative to that of N2. Succinate is directly oxidized by Complex II rather than Complex I (28Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).Table IIOxidative phosphorylationSubstrateStrainState 3DNPRCRADP/Onmol atom oxygen/min/mg proteinGlutamateN272.9 ± 19.0 (14)127.9 ± 26.3 (13)3.6 ± 0.8 (14)2.9 ± 0.6 (14)Malate108.1 ± 26.0 (16)109.4 ± 38.6 (16)3.6 ± 0.5 (16)3.3 ± 0.7 (12)Pyruvate + malate145.0 ± 16.7 (6)127.0 ± 33.3 (5)3.1 ± 0.5 (6)2.9 ± 1.0 (5)Succinate124.6 ± 37.7 (13)84.8 ± 40.3 (10)1.6 ± 0.2 (13)2.1 ± 1.7 (10)Succinate/rotenone156.5 ± 39.3 (10)141.6 ± 40.2 (9)1.7 ± 0.2 (10)1.9 ± 2.0 (8)Glutamategas-124.6 ± 5.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(11)25.5 ± 10.02-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(11)1.6 ± 0.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(11)1.9 ± 0.72-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(9)Malate38.5 ± 5.72-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(11)31.9 ± 6.62-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(11)1.9 ± 0.42-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(11)2.0 ± 0.52-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(6)Pyruvate + malate54.5 ± 9.22-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(5)43.4 ± 9.92-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(5)2.1 ± 0.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(5)1.9 ± 0.62-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(3)Succinate254.8 ± 40.52-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(10)228.1 ± 44.02-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(10)1.9 ± 0.3 (10)1.3 ± 0.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(6)Succinate/rotenone234.5 ± 21.72-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(9)221.6 ± 15.82-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(9)1.9 ± 0.2 (9)1.2 ± 0.3 (5)Glutamateunc-7 gas-123.4 ± 1.22-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(4)25.4 ± 9.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(4)1.5 ± 0.12-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(4)1.9 ± 0.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(3)Malate34.3 ± 7.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(5)29.2 ± 4.12-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(5)1.9 ± 0.32-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(5)1.6 ± 0.12-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(2)Pyruvate + malate50.5 ± 11.82-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(4)37.9 ± 14.52-aValues different from N2,p < 0.05.(4)2.1 ± 0.22-aValues"

We confirmed the interaction between TLS and p65 by the pull-down assay in vitro and by a coimmunoprecipitation experiment followed by Western blot of the cultured cell in vivo. TLS was originally identified as part of a fusion protein with CHOP arising from chromosomal translocation in human myxoid liposarcomas. TLS has been shown to be involved in TFIID complex formation and associated with RNA polymerase II. However, the role of TLS in transcriptional regulation has not yet been clearly elucidated. We found that TLS enhanced the NF-κB-mediated transactivation induced by physiological stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and overexpression of NF-κB-inducing kinase. TLS augmented NF-κB-dependent promoter activity of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene and interferon-β gene.

The second transactivation domain, TA2, is located within the N-terminally adjacent 90 amino acids and contains TA1-like domain and leucine-rich regions. Since the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB were not sufficient for gene induction (17Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y.Q. McCall C.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) might play a critical role. It has been previously reported that transcriptional activation of NF-κB requires multiple coactivator proteins including CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (19Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 20Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These coactivators have histone acetyltransferase activity to modify the chromatin structure and also provide molecular bridges to the basal transcriptional machinery. Recently, p65 was also found to interact specifically with a newly identified coactivator complex, activator-recruited cofactor/vitamin D receptor-interacting protein, which potentiated chromatin-dependent transcriptional activation by NF-κBin vitro (22Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition to general coactivators, the transcriptional activation of gene-specific activators can be mediated by basal transcription factors through direct interaction with the activation domain. In the case of NF-κB, the association of p65 with basal transcription factors such as TFIIB, TAFII105, and TBP has been demonstrated (15Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M.

It is thus postulated that specific protein-protein interactions with NF-κB determine its transcriptional competence: up-regulation of the NF-κB transcriptional activity is mediated by interaction with basal factors and coactivators, and its down-regulation is mediated by interaction with inhibitors and corepressors at multiple levels. In our previous studies, yeast two-hybrid screen yielded two novel regulators of NF-κB. RelA-associated inhibitor was found to interact with the central region of p65 (RelA) and block DNA binding in the nucleus, similar to the action of cytoplasmic inhibitors IκBs (8Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The other proteins found to interact with p65 belong to the Grg (Groucho-related genes) family, including amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES) and transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE1) (7Tetsuka T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4383-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), previously known as nuclear corepressors (28Parkhurst S.M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 130-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Translocated in liposarcoma (TLS), also known as FUS, was originally identified through its fusion to CHOP, a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors, in human myxoid liposarcoma with the t(12;16) chromosomal translocation (30Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 31Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). TLS has high homology to hTAFII68/RBP56, EWS, andDrosophila protein SARFH (collectively called the “TET” family (32Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)). These genes were found to be involved in carcinogenesis through chromosomal translocation with other genes of transcription factors; normally the N-terminal region of these proteins provides a transcriptional activator domain, and the moiety of counterpart proteins provides a DNA-binding domain (DBD), thus making these fusion proteins constitutively active for their transcriptional activities (33Prasad D.D. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bertolotti A. Bell B. Tora L.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of TLS spanning the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence domain is usually excluded by translocation, and tumorigenic transformation is associated with the fusion of the N-terminal portion to the DNA-binding domain of a given transcription factor (30Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 31Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat.

Interestingly, TLS was shown to associate with a subpopulation of the TFIID complex in cells (32Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 37Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Moreover, SARFH, a Drosophila homologue of TLS, was colocalized with RNA polymerase II at the active chromatin (38Immanuel D. Zinszner H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In fact, TLS was shown to be associated with RNA polymerase II through its N-terminal domain (39Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that TLS interacts with NF-κB p65 through the C-terminal transactivation domain and activates NF-κB-mediated transcription. The yeast two-hybrid interaction assay revealed that the region between two core transactivation domains of p65, TA1-like and TA1, is required for the interaction with TLS. We confirmed the interaction between p65 and TLS in vitro using the bacterially expressed fusion proteins and in vivocoimmunoprecipitation/Western blot assay. In transient transfection assays, TLS showed transactivation potential and activated NF-κB-dependent gene expression. These data indicate that TLS mediates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Mammalian expression vector plasmids pCMV-TBP, Gal4-Sp1, pCMV-NIK, ICAM-1-luc (positions −339 to −30), and IFN-β-luc were generous gifts from Drs. T. Tamura (Chiba University), S. T. Smale (UCLA School of Medicine), D. Wallach (Weitzmann Institute of Science), L. A. Madge and J. S. Pober (Yale University School of Medicine), and T. Taniguchi (Tokyo University), respectively. pCMV-p65, pGBT-p65-(1–286), pGBT-p65-(286–551), pGBT-p65-(286–521), pGBT-p65-(286–470), pGBT-p65-(286–442), pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521), and pGBT-p65-(473–522) have been described previously (7Tetsuka T.

To generate the mammalian expression plasmid for TLS, the full-length TLS cDNA fragment was excised from pACT2-TLS with the BamHI and XhoI site, and ligated in frame into pcDNA3.1/HisA vector at theBamHI–XhoI site to form pCMV-TLS. To create a dominant negative form of TLS-(274–525), the TLS cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pACT2-TLS as a template with oligoncleotides containing the BamHI–XhoI site. These products were digested withBamHI–XhoI and subcloned in frame into pcDNA3.1/HisA vector at the BamHI–XhoI site to form pCMV-TLS-(274–525). To construct pM-p65-(1–551), which expresses the fusion protein of Gal4-DBD and p65, the cDNA of human p65 (amino acids 1–551) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pCMV-p65 as a template with oligonucleotides containingBamHI sites (forward, 5′-CCCCCGGATCCCCGGCCATGGACGAACTGTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCAGGGATCCGGGGAGGGCAGGCGTCACCC-3′). This fragment was digested withBamHI and ligated in frame into the BamHI site of pM (CLONTECH). To generate pM-p65-(1–286) and pM-p65-(286–551), p65 cDNA fragments excised from pGBT-p65-(1–286) with EcoRI and pGBT-p65-(286–551) withBamHI/EcoRI were ligated in frame into the corresponding sites of pM. Construction of a luciferase reporter plasmid, 4κBw-luc or 4κBm-luc, containing four tandem copies of the human immunodeficiency virus-κB sequence upstream of minimal SV40 promoter has been described previously (40Sato T.

The other luciferase reporter plasmid, 5×Gal4-luc (pFR-luc) was purchased from Stratagene. This plasmid contains five tandem copies of the Gal4 binding site upstream of the TATA box. The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as previously described (7Tetsuka T. Uranishi H. Imai H. Ono T. Sonta S. Takahashi N. Asamitsu K. Okamoto T. J. Biol.

The various portions of the p65 C-terminal regions corresponding to amino acids 286–551, 286–521, 286–470, 286–442, 286–442/477–521, and 473–522 were fused in-frame to Gal4 DNA binding domain (positions 1–147) using the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH). They were tested for activation of Gal4-dependent lacZ expression (β-galactosidase activity). Among them, pGBT-p65 (286–442/477–521) was chosen as a bait for library screening, since it had undetectable background in the β-galactosidase assay. Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521), and the human placenta cDNA expression library was fused to the Gal4 transactivation domain in the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). Approximately one million transformants were screened for the ability to grow on the plates with medium lacking tryptophan/leucine/histidine and containing 25 mm3-aminotriazole. Plasmids were rescued from clones that were positive for β-galactosidase activity and identified by nucleotide sequencing. cDNA sequences and their amino acid sequences were compared with GenBankTM and SwissProt data bases for identification of the interacting proteins. 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected using Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and the extracts were prepared for luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was measured by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (8Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was monitored by Renilla luciferase activity using the pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) as an internal control. The data are presented as the -fold increase in luciferase activities (means ± S.E.) relative to control of three independent transfections. Human recombinant TNF-α and IL-1β were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bacterial expression of GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins utilize pGEX expression vectors. To generate pGEX-TLS-(1–273) and pGEX-TLS-(274–525), which express GST-TLS-(1–273) and GST-TLS-(274–525), the TLS cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pACT2-TLS as a template with oligonucleotides containing aBamHI–XhoI site. These products were digested with BamHI–XhoI and subcloned in frame into pGEX-5X-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at theBamHI–XhoI site. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purified as described (8Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In vitro protein-protein interaction assays were carried out as described previously (7Tetsuka T.

Approximately 20 μg of GST fusion proteins were immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed two times with 1 ml of modified HEMNK buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were left in 0.6 ml of HEMNK after the final wash and were incubated with the radiolabeled proteins for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of HEMNK buffer and two times with 1 ml of HEMNK buffer containing 150 mm KCl. Bound radiolabeled proteins were eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After transfection of relevant plasmids, 293 cells were cultured for 48 h and then harvested with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was incubated with 1 μg of anti-p65 (NLS) mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or control mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-p65 (C-terminal) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads were added, and the reaction was further incubated for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Antibody-bound complexes were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Supernatants were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was incubated with anti-TLS antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal; Pierce) as described previously (41Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D.

Ohki (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). This antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant GST-TLS (amino acids 8–134). To evaluate the level of exogenous p65 expressed by pCMV-p65 containing the His epitope tag, rabbit polyclonal anti-His6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. To identify proteins interacting with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screen using the unique C-terminal region of NF-κB p65 as a bait (TableI and Fig.1). As depicted in Fig. 1 A, various portions of p65 (i.e. amino acids 286–551, 286–521, 286–470, 286–442, 473–522, 286–442/477–521, and 473–522) were fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-DBD) in the pGBT9 vector. Among these clones, pGBT-p65 (286–442/477–521) was chosen as a bait for the screening, since it had no detectable background in β-galactosidase assay (Table I). Yeast strain Y190 was used to screen human placenta cDNA library fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain in the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). From ∼1.0 × 106 Y190 yeast transformants, 90 colonies grew on selective medium and turned blue when tested in a filter lift β-galactosidase assay. Each plasmid, purified from the positive colonies, was cotransfected with bait plasmid into the yeast to confirm the specific interaction. DNA sequencing and comparison with GenBankTM and SwissProt data bases revealed the gene for TLS (one clone) in addition to Bcl-3 (one clone) and the IκB family including Iκβα/MAD3 (five clones), which were previously shown to interact with p65.Table IYeast two-hybrid interaction assays between p65 and TLSGal4-DBD hybridGal4-AD hybridpACT2pACT2-TLSpACT2-IκBαpGBT9−−−pGBT-p65-(1–286)−−−pGBT-p65-(286–551)+NDNDpGBT-p65-(286–521)+NDNDpGBT-p65-(286–470)+NDNDpGBT-p65-(286–442)−−+pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521)−++pGBT-p65-(473–522)−+−Yeast Y190 cells were cotransformed with expression vectors encoding various proteins fused to Gal4-DBD and Gal4-AD. pACT2-TLS is a rescued clone that encodes TLS fused to Gal4-AD. pACT2-IκBα encodes full-length IκBα (amino acids 1–317) fused to Gal4-AD.

At least three colonies of each transformant were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside colony filter assay (Clontech). +, positive for β-galactosidase activity (blue colony) after 2–3 h; −, no β-galactosidase activity (white colony) after 24 h; ND, activity not determined.

To determine the region of p65 involved in the binding to TLS, various regions of the protein were fused to Gal4-DBD in the pGBT9 vector and cotransfected with pACT2-TLS, encoding TLS fused to Gal4 transcriptional activation domain. Interactions were tested by β-galactosidase activity (Table I) and by growth of yeast cells on plates with medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole (Fig. 1 B). pGBT-p65-(1–286), pGBT-p65-(286–442), pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521), and pGBT-p65-(473–522) alone did not show any background in the prototrophic selection or in the β-galactosidase assay. Among these, pGBT-p65-(286–442/477–521) and pGBT-p65-(473–522) were shown to be positive for the interaction with pACT2-TLS (Table I and Fig.1 B). These results indicate that the minimal region of p65 responsible for the interaction with TLS resides within the amino acid sequence 477–521. It was previously implicated that the N-terminal portion of TLS might act as a transcriptional activator in fusion with other transcription factors such as CHOP and ERG (33Prasad D.D. Ouchida M.

Here we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a 21.5-kDa human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (hITPase), an enzyme whose activity has been reported in many animal tissues and studied in populations but whose protein sequence has not been determined before. At the optimal pH of 10.0, recombinant hITPase hydrolyzed ITP, dITP, and xanthosine 5′-triphosphate to their respective monophosphates whereas activity with other nucleoside triphosphates was low. K m values for ITP, dITP, and xanthosine 5′-triphosphate were 0.51, 0.31, and 0.57 mm,respectively, and k cat values were 580, 360, and 640 s−1, respectively. A divalent cation was absolutely required for activity. The gene encoding the hITPase cDNA sequence was localized by radiation hybrid mapping to chromosome 20p in the interval D20S113-D20S97, the same interval in which the ITPAinosine triphosphatase gene was previously localized. A BLAST search revealed the existence of many similar sequences in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. The function of this ubiquitous protein family is proposed to be the elimination of minor potentially mutagenic or clastogenic purine nucleoside triphosphates from the cell.AF219116 ITP and dITP exist in all cells. dITP is potentially mutagenic, and the levels of these nucleotides are controlled by inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (EC3.6.1.19).

The gene encoding the hITPase cDNA sequence was localized by radiation hybrid mapping to chromosome 20p in the interval D20S113-D20S97, the same interval in which the ITPAinosine triphosphatase gene was previously localized. A BLAST search revealed the existence of many similar sequences in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. The function of this ubiquitous protein family is proposed to be the elimination of minor potentially mutagenic or clastogenic purine nucleoside triphosphates from the cell.AF219116 inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine xanthosine 5′-triphosphate polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ITP has been found in many animal tissues. It is generated by pyrophosphorylation or stepwise phosphorylation of IMP, an essential metabolite of purine biosynthesis and a precursor of both AMP and GMP (1Vanderheiden B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 21: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Zachara B. Lewandowski J. Biochim. Biophys.

The deoxyribonucleotide dITP may be generated from dATP by slow, non-enzymatic hydrolysis or by reduction of ITP (3Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 99: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Normally, the cellular ITP/dITP concentration is very low. The inability to demonstrate the synthesis of ITP/dITP in cellular preparations has been attributed to the presence in the cytoplasm of an inosine triphosphatase (ITPase),1 an enzyme that does not permit accumulation of these nucleotides (2Zachara B. Lewandowski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 353: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ITPase hydrolyzes ITP/dITP to IMP/dIMP and PPi. XTP is also a substrate, but activity toward other purine nucleoside triphosphates is low, whereas no activity is found with IDP or IMP (2Zachara B. Lewandowski J. Biochim. Biophys.

The range of ITPase activity in erythrocytes from Caucasian populations has been measured as 120–320 μmol of IMP produced/h/g Hb. In one population study, evidence was presented that a deficiency of ITPase was responsible for the high level of ITP found in 7 of >6,000 samples from mainly unrelated individuals. The frequency of heterozygosity for ITPase deficiency in Caucasian populations is estimated to be ∼5% (6Holmes S.L. Turner B.M. Hirschhorn K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1979; 97: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Vanderheiden B.S. Biochem. Genet. 1969; 3: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14van Waeg G. Niklasson F.

Acta. 1990; 188: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The gene coding for ITPase, ITPA, is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 (16Mohandas T. Sparkes R.S. Passage M.B. Sparkes M.C. Miles J.H. Kaback M.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1980; 26: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although mammalian ITPase activities have been identified in human erythrocytes (9Vanderheiden B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 215: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), rabbit liver (10Wang J.K. Morris A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 118-124Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and several rat tissues (17Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 86: 165-175Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), no gene has been cloned and characterized. Recently a novel bacterial nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase Mj0226, fromMethanococcus jannaschii, was revealed by structure-based identification and subsequent biochemical analysis (18Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.-H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions Mj0226 can efficiently hydrolyze non-standard nucleotides such as XTP to xanthosine 5′-monophosphate and ITP to IMP but not the canonical standard nucleotides. A yeast protein, Ham1p, was reported to be the product of a gene controlling sensitivity of yeast strains to 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) (19Noskov V.N. Staak K. Shcherbakova P.V. Kozmin S.G. Negishi K. Ono B.C. Hayatsu H. Pavlov Y.I. Yeast. 1996; 12: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This yeast protein is homologous to the Mj0226 protein, with about 30% sequence identity. Experiments with yeast HAM1− mutants have shown that adenine-requiring haploid strains are unable to grow on HAP as the sole adenine source (19Noskov V.N. Staak K. Shcherbakova P.V. Kozmin S.G. Negishi K. Ono B.C. Hayatsu H. Pavlov Y.I. Yeast. 1996; 12: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Kozmin S.G. Schaaper R.M. Shcherbakova P.V. Kulikov V.N. Noskov V.N. Guetsova M.L. Alenin V.V. Rogozin I.B. Makarova K.S. Pavlov Y.I. Mutat. Res. 1998; 402: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas Escherichia coli transformed with the HAMI gene are resistant to HAP mutagenesis (21Kozmin S.G. Leroy P. Pavlov Y.I. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This phenomenon presumably occurs because the conversion of HAP to HAP triphosphate and subsequent incorporation into DNA is lethal (20Kozmin S.G. Schaaper R.M. Shcherbakova P.V. Kulikov V.N. Noskov V.N. Guetsova M.L. Alenin V.V. Rogozin I.B. Makarova K.S. Pavlov Y.I. Mutat. Res. 1998; 402: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on biochemical information and sequence similarity, these two proteins may be microbial ITP hydrolases that can convert mutagenic, non-canonical purine nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates and thus protect DNA from the incorporation of modified purine bases. Here we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a human ITPase, hITPase, that converts ITP and dITP to their respective monophosphates and PPi. The RNA transcription profiles of hITPase were determined by Northern blot and cDNA microarray analysis. The chromosomal localization of the hITPase gene, ITPA, is also described. dITP was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and other dNTPs were from Promeaga. ITP, XTP, IDP, IMP, and other NTPs were from Sigma. Advantage cDNA polymerase mix was fromCLONTECH, and all other enzymes were from New England Biolabs. A high quality cDNA library was constructed using human fetal brain poly(A)+ RNA and a SMART PCR cDNA library construction kit (CLONTECH). cDNA synthesis was performed from 100–200 ng of mRNA, followed by 20–24 cycles of PCR amplification. The cDNAs were inserted into the pBlueScript SK plasmid vector and transformed into E. coli DH5α by electroporation (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad). A 96-well R.E.A.L. plasmid kit (Qiagen) was used to prepare double-stranded plasmid DNA. Sequencing reactions were performed with Big-Dye primer cycle sequencing and Big-Dye terminator cycle sequencing Kits (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the −21M13 or M13Rev primers to obtain the 5′ or 3′ sequences. The complete sequences were determined and confirmed by primer walking using the Big-Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit. Sequencing was performed on a PE-ABI 377 sequencer. The Acembly program was used to assemble the full-length cDNA sequences. Vector sequences were removed, and data base searches were performed with the BLAST using the NCBI web site. The hITPase cDNA was cloned between theBamHI and HindIII sites of the bacterial expression vector pQE31 (Qiagen) after PCR amplification. Transformants of E. coli M15/pREP4 with the resulting pQE31- hITPase construct were grown at 30 °C in 100 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The plasmid pREP4 constitutively expresses the Lac repressor protein encoded by thelacI gene to reduce the basal level of expression (Qiagen). When the culture had grown to an A 600 of 0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After inducing the expression of the hITPase protein for 4 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. The cell suspension was sonicated, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × gand 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was then poured into a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, washed with phosphate buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, and eluted with buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The purity of the eluted protein was checked by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the recombinant hITPase were dialyzed overnight against two changes of 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50% glycerol. Dialyzed samples were stored at −20 °C. Substrates were screened, and kinetic parameters for substrate hydrolysis were determined by measuring the Pi released in a coupled assay by coincubation of substrate with hITPase and inorganic pyrophosphatase (22Alexander R.R. Griffiths J.M. Wilkinson M.L. Basic Biochemical Methods. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 182-186Google Scholar). The standard assay (800 μl) for triphosphate nucleotide substrates involved incubation of 1.25 mm substrate with 15 ng of hITPase and 1 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase for 10 min at 37 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol. The Pi released was measured colorimetrically. Pi released from triphosphate nucleotide substrates in control assays without hITPase was subtracted. Reaction products were identified by high performance liquid chromatography. Reaction mixtures described above but without inorganic pyrophosphatase were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in a volume of 800 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots (10 μl) were injected onto a 4.6 × 250 mm Zorbax 300SB-C18 5-μm column (Hewlett Packard) at 30 °C. Chromatography conditions were as described previously (23Decosterd L.A. Cottin E. Chen X. Lejeune F. Mirimanoff R.O. Biollaz J. Coucke P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Multiple tissue Northern (MTNTM) blots containing 2 μg of poly(A+) mRNA isolated from a variety of human tissues were purchased fromCLONTECH. Blots were probed with a full-length human ITPase cDNA that had been radioactively labeled with [α−32P]dCTP by random priming using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The blot was hybridized at 68 °C overnight and washed in solution 1 (2× SSC and 1% SDS) three times at 65 °C and twice in solution 2 (0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS) at 50 °C. The blot was stripped by incubation for 10 min in 0.5% SDS at 95 °C and reprobed with radiolabeled β−actin cDNA as an indicator of mRNA loading. To determine the chromosomal localization of the human ITPA gene, the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics) consisting of 83 hybrid cell lines was screened by PCR. The PCR primer pair used for amplification was 5′-CTCTGAGAAACTCTGGCAAGTGGACG−3′ (forward primer) and 5′−CACGCCCTCACTCCCACCAAGTAC-3′ (reverse primer), derived from the 3′−untranslated region of the human ITPA gene. PCR products, 133 base pairs in length, were identified by electrophoresis on a high resolution agarose gel. The results were submitted to the Stanford Human Genome Center for statistical evaluation. The GenBankTM non-redundant and EST data bases were searched with individual sequences from our collection of full-length assembled cDNAs using the NCBI BLAST server to identify sequences of interest to our laboratories. One such sequence, represented in our collection by three clones, was found to encode a putative protein similar to theM. jannaschii Mj0226 and Saccharomyces cerevisiaeHam1p proteins (amino acid identities of 33 and 42% and E-values of 5 × 10−21 and 2 × 10−29, respectively). We then searched the UniGene data base and found a cluster of similar expressed sequence tags located at chromosome 20p. A search of the OMIM data base with the terms nucleotide and 20p revealed that the previously described, but unsequenced, inosine triphosphatase ITPA gene mapped to 20p by population analysis. This suggested that our protein may be the ITPA gene product. Based on the confirmatory evidence outlined below, we have named this putative protein human inosine triphosphatase, or hITPase. The longest hITPase cDNA clone we obtained had 1085 base pairs containing an open reading frame of 585 nucleotides from the first translation initiation codon ATG to the termination codon TAA (nucleotides 105–689; GenBankTM accession numberAF219116). The 3′-end of the sequence contains a poly(A) stretch, preceded by a putative polyadenylation signal AATAAA (nucleotides 1062–1067). The open reading frame encodes a 194-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 21,501 Da and pI of 5.50. There is an in-frame stop codon upstream of the open reading frame whereas the proposed initiating ATG is in the highly favorable sequence context ACCATGG, indicating that the predicted sequence probably represents the full-length protein. After E. coli M15/pQE31-ITPase was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the 6× His-tagged recombinant hITPase yielded a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel corresponding to about 15–20% of the total applied protein (Fig. 1). Purification by binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin and elution with buffer containing 500 mm imidazole resulted in a near homogeneous preparation (Fig. 1). To confirm that this was the expected expression product, an accurate molecular mass of 23,072 Da was determined by mass spectrometry (data not shown). This result is very close to the predicted mass of 23,069 Da for the recombinant hITPase, which includes the N-terminal vector-derived tag sequence MRGSHHHHHHTDP. The larger apparent molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE may be because of incomplete heat denaturation and SDS binding. Activity of the hITPase toward inosine nucleotides (ITP, IDP, IMP, and dITP), XTP, and the eight canonical ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates was determined. At a fixed concentration of 1.25 mm, ITP, dITP, and XTP were the best substrates for the recombinant hITPase followed by GTP and dGTP (Fig. 2). In the absence of inorganic pyrophosphatase, no Pi production was detected by the colorimetric assay. The hITPase showed very low activity toward other nucleoside triphosphates; UTP, (d)CTP, TTP, and (d)ATP were hydrolyzed 10–100-fold less than dITP (Fig. 2). IDP and IMP were not hydrolyzed at all, showing that hITPase is a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the production of IMP and dIMP as primary products; no IDP or dIDP was observed (data not shown). Similar to the purified human erythrocyte ITPase, recombinant hITPase had an absolute requirement for Mg2+ ions and a high Mg2+ optimum (6Holmes S.L. Turner B.M. Hirschhorn K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1979; 97: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Activity increased sharply up to about 10 mm MgCl2 and reached a plateau between about 30 and 100 mm (data not shown). The recombinant hITPase also had a markedly high pH optimum of ∼10.0 in glycine buffer, similar to the value of 9.6 from previous reports (12Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Activity in the absence of 1 mm dithiothreitol was about half that in its presence indicating a requirement (though not absolute) for reducing conditions (data not shown). When analyzed by gel filtration, the recombinant 23-kDa tagged hITPase behaved as a homogeneous 45-kDa dimer (Fig. 3). With ITP, dITP, and XTP as substrates, the recombinant hITPase followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics but with clear evidence of inhibition at higher substrate concentrations, most easily seen in reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data (Fig.4). Both substrate inhibition and inhibition by contaminating (deoxy)nucleoside diphosphates have been documented before for this enzyme (6Holmes S.L. Turner B.M. Hirschhorn K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1979; 97: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For this reason, kinetic parameters were calculated by non-linear regression using data points only at concentrations that did not appear to result in inhibition according to visual analysis of the reciprocal plots (Table I). Within the errors of the k cat/K m values calculated in this way, all three substrates appear to be used with similar efficiencies.Table IKinetic parameters of recombinant human ITPaseSubstrateK mV maxk catk cat/K mmmμmol·min−1·mg−1s−1103m−1·s−1ITP0.51 ± 0.101520 ± 195580 ± 751140 ± 270dITP0.31 ± 0.10940 ± 160360 ± 601160 ± 420XTP0.57 ± 0.211680 ± 370640 ± 1401120 ± 480Kinetic constants were determined from data obtained using the colorimetric assay described under “Experimental Procedures” using data points only at concentrations that did not appear to result in substrate or product inhibition according to visual analysis of reciprocal plots.

Figures are mean ± S.D. (n = 4). To determine the size and distribution of hITPase mRNA transcripts, Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from different adult human tissues were probed with [32P]dCTP-labeled hITPase cDNA. This revealed a transcript of about 1.4 kb in all 24 adult human tissues examined, with the most abundant expression in heart, liver, sex glands, thyroid, and adrenal gland (Fig.5). These results were largely confirmed by cDNA microarray analysis, which showed heart, liver, thyroid, and thymus tissues to have the highest normalized expression ratios of those examined compared with housekeeping genes (all >2.6; data not shown). There are more than 40 protein and putative protein sequences in GenBankTM that have moderate similarity to human ITPase. All of these proteins are about 200 amino acids long and have similar secondary structures as predicted by the PHDsec program (24Rost B. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of hITPase and related sequences revealed a new conserved protein family representing inosine triphosphatases from bacteria to mammals. In the alignment (Fig.6), the amino acid residues corresponding to positions comprising the nucleotide binding site predicted by three-dimensional structural analysis of Mj0226 are shown (18Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.-H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Not all are conserved; however, in some cases the side chain may be of lesser importance than the backbone amide in binding the substrate (18Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.-H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the dendrogram of the alignment results generated by the TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 program (25Strimmer K. von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 946-969Crossref Scopus (2276) Google Scholar). For each internal branch, the bootstrap proportion was estimated by the Dayhoff method with 1000 replications (26Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence Structure. 5, Suppl. 3. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar). It is clear that these homologues fall into three divisions representing the three superkingdoms of eukaryota, archaea, and eubacteria and that the ITPase family, therefore, has an ancient origin and function. The chromosomal location of the human ITPA gene was determined with the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid panel with a 3′-untranslated region-specific primer pair for human ITPA gene. The expected 133-base pair PCR product was amplified from 12 of 83 DNAs from the hybrid cell lines. Data were submitted to the Stanford Human Genome Center for statistical evaluation. The human ITPA gene was located on chromosome 20, close to markers SHGC-14786, SHGC-2800, and SHGC-21112 from the Stanford G3 chromosome 20 radiation hybrid map data and between microsatellite marker AFM240zf4 (D20S181) and microsatellite anchor marker AFM036ya3 (D20S97). Our cDNA clone corresponds to NCBI Unigene Hs.6817, which was located on the same interval D20S113-D20S97 on GeneMap '99. We found two genes, PTPRA (protein tyrosinephosphatase, receptor type, alpha polypeptide) and CENPB (centromere proteinB), upstream and downstream, respectively, of Unigene Hs.6817 on the same region. These genes also flank the mouseItpa gene. This result confirmed our conclusion that the cDNA clone encodes the human ITPA gene product, hITPase (Table II).Table IIHuman ITPA and mouse Itp chromosome linkage mapsMouse symbolMouse posn. on Chr2Mouse STS markersHuman symbolHuman cytogenetic positionHuman STS markersHuman physical map cR3000cmPtpns173.1Ptpns1, 147092PTPNS120p13SGC31938, RH6830913.18Avp73.2AVP20p13Pdyn73.3PDYN20pter-p12Oxt73.5OXT20p13Ptpra73.5PTPRA20p13sts-M34668, WI-901513.45Itp73.6ITPA20pstSG3495720.20Cenpb73.9CENPB20p13Bdyc4e1020.88Sn73.9Z36233, Z36293SN20p13Atrn73.9ATRN20stSG40821.61Genetic and physical map locations of ITPA, Itp, and surrounding genes are shown.

In this report, we have described the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding a human ITP/dITP/XTP pyrophosphatase, hITPase, from a human fetal brain cDNA library. Initially, the library was searched for potential homologues of theM. jannaschii nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase Mj0026. The cDNA thus obtained encodes a 195-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 21,501 Da and 33% amino acid identity to Mj0026. The chromosomal localization of the cDNA clone matches that of the previously described ITPA locus on the short arm of chromosome 20 between the PTPRA and CENPB genes. These results confirm our view that this clone encodes the humanITPA gene product. The presence of hITPase mRNA in all human tissues examined and its high expression in endocrine glands was shown by Northern blot analysis and by cDNA microarray hybridization. The distribution of ITPA transcripts in human tissues agrees with the distribution of ITPase enzyme activity in different rat tissues (17Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 86: 165-175Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These and other studies also suggested that the enzyme was located in the cytoplasm (6Holmes S.L. Turner B.M. Hirschhorn K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1979; 97: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 86: 165-175Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this location by transfection of COS-7 cells with a construct in which hITPase was fused to the C terminus of green fluorescent protein. A diffuse but clearly non-nuclear distribution of fluorescence was observed. 2S. Lin and J. Shi, unpublished observations. Enzymological analysis of the recombinant human protein expressed from this cDNA clone showed a high specificity for the hydrolysis of ITP, dITP, and XTP to their respective monophosphates. Characteristics of the recombinant enzyme were similar to those from earlier reports of ITPase isolated from human tissues, except the K mvalue for ITP, which at 0.51 mm was higher than those previously reported, 0.13 (12Vanderheiden B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 0.07 mm (6Holmes S.L. Turner B.M. Hirschhorn K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1979; 97: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for this discrepancy are (i) different levels of inhibitory IDP in the substrate preparations used, (ii) lack of a post-translational modification in the recombinant enzyme that is present in the enzyme isolated from tissues, or (iii) reduced affinity for ITP and other substrates caused by the N-terminal tag. Three different human populations have been reported with respect to their ITPase activity. The first has high activity, the second has a mean activity exactly 25% that of the first, whereas the third population has very low activity. A theoretical explanation of this study is that normal (active) and mutant (inactive) alleles exist in the population and that the ITPase is only active as a dimer with two normal subunits (14van Waeg G. Niklasson F. Ericson A. Deverdier C.H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 171: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Duley J.A. Simmonds H.A. Hopkinson D.A. Levinsky R.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 188: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In heterozygotes, only one of the four hypothetical dimers would be composed of two normal monomers, leading to 25% activity. Consistent with this hypothesis is our finding that recombinant hITPase behaves as a homogeneous dimer under physiological conditions. This agrees with results generated by structural analysis"

To elucidate these mechanisms, we challenged human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines with paclitaxel and investigated its effects upon signal transduction pathways. Physiologically relevant concentrations of paclitaxel (1–1,000 nm) induced apoptosis. All three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were activated upon paclitaxel treatment. Interestingly, JNK activation and p38 MAPK activation were delayed and peaked at 48 h, whereas ERK activity was sustained over 72 h. In addition, Ras activation and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) phosphorylation were observed in concordance with ERK activation. While ERK activation was completely ablated by MEK inhibitors, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis revealed that neither MEK-1 nor MEK-2 was involved, but instead another member of the MEK family may potentially participate. Although pretreatment with a general caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone rescued the cell death, it did not prevent Ras or ERK activation. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK, p38 MAPK, or MEK did not alter PARP cleavage and the cell death induced by paclitaxel. These results in aggregate suggest that the delayed activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK was not linked to activation of the cell death machinery.

Although these actions were implicated as the mechanisms through which paclitaxel induces apoptosis, these studies were impaired by the employment of high concentrations of paclitaxel.Akt (protein kinase B), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has a pivotal role in exerting an antiapoptotic effect against various stimuli (12Franke T.F.

Thus, it is unclear whether paclitaxel causes apoptosis through modulation of the Akt survival pathway.The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 family comprises c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The ERK pathway is known to be activated by various stimuli including growth factors (15McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Hudson L.G. J. Biol.

The JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are also activated by various and overlapping stimuli such as heat or osmotic shock, radiation, and growth factors (15McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the precise roles of these activated kinases in this context remain obscure.It has been reported that paclitaxel enhances ERK activity in various cell lines (10Subbaramaiah K.

Lai Y.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 767-776PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, paclitaxel attenuated ERK activity in some reports (24Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Wu-Wong J.R. Chiou W.J. Wang J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 514-521PubMed Google Scholar). Since abrogation of the MEK/ERK pathway delayed paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (23Lieu C.H. Liu C.C., Yu, T.H. Chen K.D. Chang Y.N. Lai Y.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 767-776PubMed Google Scholar) or failed to prevent it (26Kalechman Y. Longo D.L. Catane R. Shani A. Albeck M. Sredni B. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), ERK activation by paclitaxel and its relationship to apoptosis requires elucidation. Investigation of the relationship of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and activation of the MAP kinases serves as the basis of our studies and provides a venue to understand the interrelationship or independence of MAPKs and apoptosis.By utilizing human esophageal squamous cancer cells challenged with physiological concentrations of paclitaxel, we demonstrate herein that paclitaxel induces apoptosis, which is accompanied by delayed JNK and p38 MAPK activation and prolonged ERK activation lasting over 72 h. Our studies, employing pharmacological inhibitors for MEK or caspases, revealed that prolonged ERK activity was not mediated via the same pathway as the apoptosis machinery and that MEK/ERK blockade did not modify the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel, indicating that the prolonged ERK activation may be secondary to cell death. The prolonged ERK activation appeared to be mediated through a Ras- and MEK-dependent pathway, in which neither the MEK-1 nor the MEK-2 isoform was involved. This suggests that a different MEK family member might be responsible for the prolonged ERK activity observed with paclitaxel.DISCUSSIONWe observed that physiologically relevant concentrations of paclitaxel induced cell death with features characteristic of apoptosis. Although pretreatment with a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, inhibited PARP cleavage induced by paclitaxel, cell death was rescued partially by Z-VAD-FMK, implying that paclitaxel caused cell death via both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. The caspase-independent pathway may be analogous with so-called “slow cell death,” which is often observed by chemotherapeutic drugs (39Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1502-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Since caspase-3 is considered to be central to the apoptosis machinery (Ref. 40Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 31Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar), it was surprising that we observed caspase-7, not caspase-3, activation upon paclitaxel treatment. Our novel finding is nevertheless consistent with a report demonstrating that upon VP-16 treatment, PARP was cleaved by caspase-7 but not caspase-3 (30Germain M. Affar E.B. D'Amours D. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Since caspase-3 knockout mice have normal apoptotic response (41Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar), and deficiency of a caspase member can be compensated by activation of other caspases (42Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Momoi T. Srinivasan A. Nicholson D.W. Lazebnik Y. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), there may be regulatory mechanisms that preferentially utilize different caspase members in response to apoptotic stimuli, and caspase-3 activation may be dispensable in some cellular contexts. It is tempting to speculate that caspase-7 may be preferentially activated by certain chemotherapeutic agents.Paclitaxel has been reported to activate various signal transduction pathways including JNK (22Shtil A.A.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 767-776PubMed Google Scholar), but the primary target for the paclitaxel action is not defined. Although microtubules are the well documented cellular targets of paclitaxel (3Diaz J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), CD18 (43Bhat N. Perera P.Y. Carboni J.M. Blanco J. Golenbock D.T. Mayadas T.N. Vogel S.N. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and Bcl-2 (45Rodi D.J. Janes R.W. Sanganee H.J. Holton R.A. Wallace B.A. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), all have the potential to bind to paclitaxel. In addition, Taxol mediates serine phosphorylation of shc (46Yang C.P. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5171-5178PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that paclitaxel activated the ERK pathway at the level of Ras or, not inconceivably, upstream of Ras. However, since Ras and ERK can co-localize with microtubules (47Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 48Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that paclitaxel, when bound to microtubules, induces ERK activation directly or via a Ras-dependent signaling pathway.It has been reported that PARP cleavage may be suppressed by a MEK inhibitor, demonstrating that the caspase cascade is downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway (49Mohr S. McCormick T.S. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5045-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). By contrast, in our model systems, when cells were pretreated with MEK inhibitors or SB202190, which inhibited both JNK and p38 MAPK at 50 μm, cell death induced by paclitaxel was unaltered. When these compounds were added simultaneously prior to paclitaxel treatment, cell viability was also unaffected (data not shown). Kinase assays revealed that these compounds efficiently suppressed ERK activity. JNK and p38 MAPK kinase activities were partially suppressed. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the residual kinase activity contributed to cell death, we conclude that the delayed or prolonged activation of the JNK, p38 MAPK, and MEK/ERK kinases occurred independently of cell death, which is underscored by several independent experiments. In concert with this notion, anisomycin has been demonstrated to induce JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK activation independently of apoptosis (50Torocsik B. Szeberenyi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Since we observed that MEK phosphorylation upon paclitaxel treatment showed a distinct migration on Western blotting with the phospho-MEK1/2 antibody from that upon EGF stimulation, we sought to identify the MEK isoform(s) involved. Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and kinase assays using anti-MEK-1 and MEK-2 antibodies revealed that neither MEK-1 nor MEK-2 appeared to be responsible for ERK activation by paclitaxel. Although among the MEK family members identified thus far, MEK-5 is the member most closely structurally related to MEK-1 and MEK-2, it is not known to activate ERK-1 or ERK-2 (51English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that another member of the MEK family, perhaps a novel one, modulates ERK activation that is induced by paclitaxel. The identification of a novel MEK member is currently under investigation.Sustained activation of the MEK/ERK pathway has been reported upon stimulation with growth factors such as nerve growth factor (52Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar), insulin (53Zhu X. Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4354-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), EGF (15McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Hudson L.G. J. Biol.

Heads R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Postulated roles for sustained MEK/ERK pathway activation include mediation of neuronal cell differentiation (52Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 induction (38Genersch E. Hayes K. Neuenfeld Y. Haller H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4319-4330PubMed Google Scholar). However, the duration of ERK activation in their reports is less than 24 h. We observed that ERK was activated in a MEK-dependent fashion, and to our surprise, it was sustained even after 72 h of paclitaxel treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating such a prolonged ERK activation with some form of extracellular stimulation. Although the time course of MEK activation preceded ERK activation, there was a time lag between MEK and ERK activation, and ERK activation was still observed even after MEK activity decayed (Fig. 6, A andB). The significance of the time lag between MEK and ERK activation and sustained versus transient ERK activation, however, are not clear. Ultimately, the effects of delayed or prolonged activation of different MAP kinases in the face of cell death may be a means by which the host cell is attempting to maintain cellular homeostasis (Fig. 8).Impaired CL100/MKP-1 activation upon cisplatin treatment was recently demonstrated to be responsible for sustained JNK activation (55Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and negative feedback inhibition of the ERK pathway has been implicated to be the most important factor for sustained ERK activation (56Brightman F.A. Fell D.A FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that regulators of MAPKs, such as JNK/SAPK-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) (57Kuboki Y. Ito M. Takamatsu N. Yamamoto Ki. Shiba T. Yoshioka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39815-39818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and CL100/MKP-1 (55Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), might be deregulated by paclitaxel and thus contribute to the sustained MAPK activations observed in our study. Since a small GTP-binding protein, Rap1, has been shown to mediate sustained ERK activation induced by nerve growth factor (58York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the involvement of a specific molecule in sustained MAPK activations needs to be taken into account as well. The clarification of such modulators may open new avenues to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a chemotherapeutic agent utilized for the treatment of breast, ovarian, lung, and esophageal cancers (1Crown J. O'Leary M. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1176-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Weiner L.M. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 106-108PubMed Google Scholar).

Testa J.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5390-5394PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether paclitaxel causes apoptosis through modulation of the Akt survival pathway. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 family comprises c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The ERK pathway is known to be activated by various stimuli including growth factors (15McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Hudson L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4347-4353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), lipopolysaccharide (16Foey A.D. Parry S.L. Williams L.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. Brennan F.M. J.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) influence depending upon the cellular context and by as yet unclarified regulatory mechanisms. The JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are also activated by various and overlapping stimuli such as heat or osmotic shock, radiation, and growth factors (15McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Hudson L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4347-4353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Paumelle R. Tulasne D. Leroy C. Coll J. Vandenbunder B. Fafeur V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3751-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although JNK and p38 MAPK have been reported to be activated by paclitaxel (10Subbaramaiah K. Hart J.C. Norton L. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14838-14845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 22Shtil A.A. Mandlekar S., Yu, R. Walter R.J. Hagen K. Tan T.H. Roninson I.B. Kong A.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the precise roles of these activated kinases in this context remain obscure. It has been reported that paclitaxel enhances ERK activity in various cell lines (10Subbaramaiah K. Hart J.C. Norton L. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14838-14845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 23Lieu C.H. Liu C.C., Yu, T.H. Chen K.D. Chang Y.N. Lai Y.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 767-776PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, paclitaxel attenuated ERK activity in some reports (24Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Wu-Wong J.R. Chiou W.J. Wang J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 514-521PubMed Google Scholar). Since abrogation of the MEK/ERK pathway delayed paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (23Lieu C.H. Liu C.C., Yu, T.H. Chen K.D. Chang Y.N. Lai Y.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 767-776PubMed Google Scholar) or failed to prevent it (26Kalechman Y. Longo D.L. Catane R. Shani A. Albeck M. Sredni B. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), ERK activation by paclitaxel and its relationship to apoptosis requires elucidation. Investigation of the relationship of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and activation of the MAP kinases serves as the basis of our studies and provides a venue to understand the interrelationship or independence of MAPKs and apoptosis. By utilizing human esophageal squamous cancer cells challenged with physiological concentrations of paclitaxel, we demonstrate herein that paclitaxel induces apoptosis, which is accompanied by delayed JNK and p38 MAPK activation and prolonged ERK activation lasting over 72 h. Our studies, employing pharmacological inhibitors for MEK or caspases, revealed that prolonged ERK activity was not mediated via the same pathway as the apoptosis machinery and that MEK/ERK blockade did not modify the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel, indicating that the prolonged ERK activation may be secondary to cell death. The prolonged ERK activation appeared to be mediated through a Ras- and MEK-dependent pathway, in which neither the MEK-1 nor the MEK-2 isoform was involved. This suggests that a different MEK family member might be responsible for the prolonged ERK activity observed with paclitaxel. DISCUSSIONWe observed that physiologically relevant concentrations of paclitaxel induced cell death with features characteristic of apoptosis. Although pretreatment with a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, inhibited PARP cleavage induced by paclitaxel, cell death was rescued partially by Z-VAD-FMK, implying that paclitaxel caused cell death via both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. The caspase-independent pathway may be analogous with so-called “slow cell death,” which is often observed by chemotherapeutic drugs (39Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1502-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Since caspase-3 is considered to be central to the apoptosis machinery (Ref. 40Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 31Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar), it was surprising that we observed caspase-7, not caspase-3, activation upon paclitaxel treatment. Our novel finding is nevertheless consistent with a report demonstrating that upon VP-16 treatment, PARP was cleaved by caspase-7 but not caspase-3 (30Germain M. Affar E.B. D'Amours D. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Since caspase-3 knockout mice have normal apoptotic response (41Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar), and deficiency of a caspase member can be compensated by activation of other caspases (42Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Momoi T. Srinivasan A. Nicholson D.W. Lazebnik Y. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), there may be regulatory mechanisms that preferentially utilize different caspase members in response to apoptotic stimuli, and caspase-3 activation may be dispensable in some cellular contexts. It is tempting to speculate that caspase-7 may be preferentially activated by certain chemotherapeutic agents.Paclitaxel has been reported to activate various signal transduction pathways including JNK (22Shtil A.A.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 767-776PubMed Google Scholar), but the primary target for the paclitaxel action is not defined. Although microtubules are the well documented cellular targets of paclitaxel (3Diaz J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), CD18 (43Bhat N. Perera P.Y. Carboni J.M. Blanco J. Golenbock D.T. Mayadas T.N. Vogel S.N. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and Bcl-2 (45Rodi D.J. Janes R.W. Sanganee H.J. Holton R.A. Wallace B.A. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), all have the potential to bind to paclitaxel. In addition, Taxol mediates serine phosphorylation of shc (46Yang C.P. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5171-5178PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that paclitaxel activated the ERK pathway at the level of Ras or, not inconceivably, upstream of Ras. However, since Ras and ERK can co-localize with microtubules (47Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 48Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that paclitaxel, when bound to microtubules, induces ERK activation directly or via a Ras-dependent signaling pathway.It has been reported that PARP cleavage may be suppressed by a MEK inhibitor, demonstrating that the caspase cascade is downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway (49Mohr S. McCormick T.S. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5045-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). By contrast, in our model systems, when cells were pretreated with MEK inhibitors or SB202190, which inhibited both JNK and p38 MAPK at 50 μm, cell death induced by paclitaxel was unaltered. When these compounds were added simultaneously prior to paclitaxel treatment, cell viability was also unaffected (data not shown). Kinase assays revealed that these compounds efficiently suppressed ERK activity. JNK and p38 MAPK kinase activities were partially suppressed. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the residual kinase activity contributed to cell death, we conclude that the delayed or prolonged activation of the JNK, p38 MAPK, and MEK/ERK kinases occurred independently of cell death, which is underscored by several independent experiments. In concert with this notion, anisomycin has been demonstrated to induce JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK activation independently of apoptosis (50Torocsik B. Szeberenyi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Since we observed that MEK phosphorylation upon paclitaxel treatment showed a distinct migration on Western blotting with the phospho-MEK1/2 antibody from that upon EGF stimulation, we sought to identify the MEK isoform(s) involved. Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and kinase assays using anti-MEK-1 and MEK-2 antibodies revealed that neither MEK-1 nor MEK-2 appeared to be responsible for ERK activation by paclitaxel. Although among the MEK family members identified thus far, MEK-5 is the member most closely structurally related to MEK-1 and MEK-2, it is not known to activate ERK-1 or ERK-2 (51English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that another member of the MEK family, perhaps a novel one, modulates ERK activation that is induced by paclitaxel. The identification of a novel MEK member is currently under investigation.Sustained activation of the MEK/ERK pathway has been reported upon stimulation with growth factors such as nerve growth factor (52Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar), insulin (53Zhu X. Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4354-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), EGF (15McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Hudson L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4347-4353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and hepatocyte growth factor (15McCawley L.J. Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Hudson L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4347-4353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as well as during recovery from cardiac ischemia (54Punn A. Mockridge J.W. Farooqui S. Marber M.S. Heads R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Postulated roles for sustained MEK/ERK pathway activation include mediation of neuronal cell differentiation (52Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 induction (38Genersch E. Hayes K. Neuenfeld Y. Haller H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4319-4330PubMed Google Scholar). However, the duration of ERK activation in their reports is less than 24 h. We observed that ERK was activated in a MEK-dependent fashion, and to our surprise, it was sustained even after 72 h of paclitaxel treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating such a prolonged ERK activation with some form of extracellular stimulation. Although the time course of MEK activation preceded ERK activation, there was a time lag between MEK and ERK activation, and ERK activation was still observed even after MEK activity decayed (Fig. 6, A andB). The significance of the time lag between MEK and ERK activation and sustained versus transient ERK activation, however, are not clear. Ultimately, the effects of delayed or prolonged activation of different MAP kinases in the face of cell death may be a means by which the host cell is attempting to maintain cellular homeostasis (Fig. 8).Impaired CL100/MKP-1 activation upon cisplatin treatment was recently demonstrated to be responsible for sustained JNK activation (55Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and negative feedback inhibition of the ERK pathway has been implicated to be the most important factor for sustained ERK activation (56Brightman F.A. Fell D.A FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that regulators of MAPKs, such as JNK/SAPK-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) (57Kuboki Y. Ito M. Takamatsu N. Yamamoto Ki. Shiba T. Yoshioka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39815-39818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and CL100/MKP-1 (55Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), might be deregulated by paclitaxel and thus contribute to the sustained MAPK activations observed in our study. Since a small GTP-binding protein, Rap1, has been shown to mediate sustained ERK activation induced by nerve growth factor (58York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the involvement of a specific molecule in sustained MAPK activations needs to be taken into account as well. The clarification of such modulators may open new avenues to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. We observed that physiologically relevant concentrations of paclitaxel induced cell death with features characteristic of apoptosis. Although pretreatment with a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, inhibited PARP cleavage induced by paclitaxel, cell death was rescued partially by Z-VAD-FMK, implying that paclitaxel caused cell death via both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways.

Since caspase-3 knockout mice have normal apoptotic response (41Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and negative feedback inhibition of the ERK pathway has been implicated to be the most important factor for sustained ERK activation (56Brightman F.A. Fell D.A FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that regulators of MAPKs, such as JNK/SAPK-associated protein 1 (JSAP1) (57Kuboki Y. Ito M. Takamatsu N. Yamamoto Ki. Shiba T. Yoshioka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39815-39818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and CL100/MKP-1 (55Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), might be deregulated by paclitaxel and thus contribute to the sustained MAPK activations observed in our study. Since a small GTP-binding protein, Rap1, has been shown to mediate sustained ERK activation induced by nerve growth factor (58York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the involvement of a specific molecule in sustained MAPK activations needs to be taken into account as well. The clarification of such modulators may open new avenues to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. We are indebted to members of the Rustgi laboratory for discussion and support."
https://openalex.org/W2116811320,"Spheroplasts were used to study the early interactions of newly synthesized outer membrane protein PhoE with periplasmic proteins employing a protein cross-linking approach. Newly translocated PhoE protein could be cross-linked to the periplasmic chaperone Skp at the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. To study the timing of this interaction, a PhoE-dihydrofolate reductase hybrid protein was constructed that formed translocation intermediates, which had the PhoE moiety present in the periplasm and the dihydrofolate reductase moiety tightly folded in the cytoplasm. The hybrid protein was found to cross-link to Skp, indicating that PhoE closely interacts with the chaperone when the protein is still in a transmembrane orientation in the translocase. Removal of N-terminal parts of PhoE protein affected Skp binding in a cumulative manner, consistent with the presence of two Skp-binding sites in that region. In contrast, deletion of C-terminal parts resulted in variable interactions with Skp, suggesting that interaction of Skp with the N-terminal region is influenced by parts of the C terminus of PhoE protein. Both the soluble as well as the membrane-associated Skp protein were found to interact with PhoE. The latter form is proposed to be involved in the initial interaction with the N-terminal regions of the outer membrane protein.

To reach their final conformation and destiny they need to be prevented from premature folding and degradation in the cytoplasm. It is well established that molecular chaperones and folding catalysts are required to channel proteins into productive export, folding, and assembly pathways. In the cytoplasm one of the first events that takes place when a nascent PhoE emerges from the ribosome is the interaction with trigger factor, a cytoplasmic chaperone. Using a cross-linking approach, the latter protein was found to interact with nascent PhoE chains as short as 57 amino acids (1Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W.L. vonHeijne G.

Subsequently, at a late co-translational or early post-translational stage the precursor protein interacts with SecB (4Lecker S. Lill R. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. Bassford P.J. Kumamoto C.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2703-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 5Kusters R. de Vrije T. Breukink E. de Kruijff B. J. Biol.

This SecB·precursor complex is then targeted to SecA, the peripheral subunit of the membrane-embedded SecYEG complex (7Driessen A.J. Fekkes P.,. van der Wolk J.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PhoE precursors are then translocated across the IM in a non-native state. When appearing at the periplasmic side of the IM, these polypeptides undergo complex folding processes and have to be prevented from misfolding, aggregating, and degrading. Proteins destined for the outer membrane or the extracellular environment require correct targeting to these locations. Periplasmic chaperones and folding catalysts have been implicated to be involved in the folding and assembly pathway of OMPs. It was demonstrated previously that OMPs are exposed to the periplasmic chaperones during the assembly process (8Eppens E.F. Nouwen N. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A periplasmic system consisting of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts has been described (9Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Among them, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (FkpA, SurA, RotA, and PpiD) carry out the isomerization around the Xaa-Pro peptide bond. In addition to the isomerase activity the FkpA and SurA proteins were found to posses chaperone activity (11Ramm K. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Behrens S. Maier R. De Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The second type of folding catalysts are the protein disulfide isomerases (Dsb proteins) carrying out disulfide bond formation and thiol-disulfide exchanges (13Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, Skp functions as a molecular chaperone in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, possibly specifically required for the biogenesis of OMPs. Skp is a basic soluble protein in the periplasm, but it was also found in IM fractions (14Thome B.M. Müller M. Mol. Micobiol. 1991; 5: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Schäfer U. Beck K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24567-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The protein exists in two different states as was demonstrated by their different sensitivity toward proteases (16de Cock H. Schafer U. Potgeter M. Demel R. Muller M. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The conversion between these states can be modulated in vitro by phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides, and bivalent cations (16de Cock H. Schafer U. Potgeter M. Demel R. Muller M. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The function of these two different forms of Skp in vivo is not yet known. Previously, it was demonstrated that Skp binds selectively to OmpA and proteins of the bacterial porin family (16de Cock H. Schafer U. Potgeter M. Demel R. Muller M. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Chen R. Henning U. Mol. Micobiol. 1996; 19: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, non-OMPs seem to act as a substrate for binding (18Bothmann H. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Skp interacts with OmpA in close vicinity of the IM, and it was found to be involved in the release of the OMP from this membrane (15Schäfer U. Beck K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24567-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, cells defective in Skp and the periplasmic protease DegP accumulate protein aggregates in the periplasm (15Schäfer U. Beck K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24567-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Skp is a molecular chaperone involved in generating and maintaining solubility of early folding intermediates of OMPs in the periplasm. The molecular mechanism of the PhoE assembly pathway has been investigated extensively in vivo and in vitro. However, little is known about which periplasmic chaperones and folding catalysts are involved in the late stages of translocation over the IM, in the release from the IM, and in the early stages of folding in the periplasm. Furthermore, the order of interactions with accessory proteins and the timing of the various reactions are largely unknown. In the studies described in this report, we used an unbiased approach to study these processes. We present evidence that the initial interaction of the non-native porin protein PhoE at the periplasmic side of the IM is with Skp. This interaction occurs already early during translocation of PhoE, i.e. when PhoE is still in a transmembrane orientation in the translocase. At the N terminus of PhoE, two Skp-binding sites could be identified. In contrast to OmpA, release of PhoE from the IM appeared not to be dependent on Skp. The E. coli K12 strain MC4100 (F− ΔlacU169araD136 rpsL thi relA) was used for the spheroplast labeling experiments and for the isolation of lysate and inner membrane vesicles (19Vrije G.J. d. Batenburg A.M. Killian J.A. Kruijff B.d. Mol. Micobiol. 1990; 4: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MC4100 and RC354c, containing a deletion in the skp gene (17Chen R. Henning U. Mol. Micobiol. 1996; 19: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), were used for the isolation of periplasmic extracts (20Mol O. Oud R.P.C. Degraaf F.K. Oudega B. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 18: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). BG87 (21Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the isolation of trigger factor-depleted lysate as described before (2Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Vrije G.J. d. Batenburg A.M. Killian J.A. Kruijff B.d. Mol. Micobiol. 1990; 4: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Top10F′ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for routine cloning procedures. Strains were routinely grown in LB medium and the appropriate antibiotics. For pulse labeling experiments a GB1 minimal medium was used (22Den Blaauwen T. Buddelmeijer N. Aarsman M.E.G. Hameete C.M. Nanninga N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% maltose as the carbon source and an 18-amino acid mixture (0.1 mm) (without Met andCys). Plasmid pNN100 containing the phoE gene under control of the tac promoter was constructed previously (23Nouwen N. Tommassen J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16029-16033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pC4Meth300PhoE, pC4Meth100PhoEΔss, and pC4Meth137PhoEΔss were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pVG01 (24Van Gelder P. De Cock H. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as a template essentially as described in a previous study (2Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The latter two plasmids contain instead of a signal sequence a Met and a Ser residue just as in pJP370 (25de Cock H. Hekstra R.E.W. Tommassen J. Biochemistry. 1990; 72: 177-182Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Construction of plasmid pAra300PhoE.DHFR was as follows: pC4Meth300PhoE was digested with BamHI andHindIII and ligated to theBamHI-HindIII fragment of pGEM4.DHFR containing the mouse dhfr gene (a gift from T. Langer, München, Germany). Subsequently, the phoE-dhfr fusion gene was cloned downstream of the arabinose promoter on plasmid pMPMK4 (26Mayer M.P. Gene. 1995; 163: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGAH317, carrying the wild-type skp gene, has been described (27Holck A. Kleppe K. Gene. 1988; 67: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For pulse labeling of spheroplasts cells were grown in GB1 medium with casamino acids during 7 h and then diluted for overnight growth in such a way that the culture turbidity reached a value of ∼0.5 (at 660 nm) the next morning. 1.5 ml of cells was collected at 10,000 ×g for 2 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and resuspended in 250 μl of 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0). After addition of 250 μl of 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m sucrose, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 0 °C. After addition of EDTA (4 mm) and lysozyme (50 μg/ml), 500 μl of cold H2O was added immediately. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min, and the formation of spheroplasts was followed by phase contrast microscopy. MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 20 mm to stabilize the spheroplasts, which were subsequently collected at 10,000 × g for 2 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of spheroplast labeling medium (GB1 medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2). After 10-min incubation at 30 °C the spheroplasts were induced for the synthesis of PhoE by adding 1 mm IPTG or of PhoE-DHFR by adding 0.1% arabinose. After 5-min incubation with IPTG or 10 min with arabinose, the spheroplasts were pulsed for 1 min with 16.5 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by a 5-min chase with 2 mm cold methionine. During the chase 50 μl of periplasmic proteins (∼1 mg/ml) were added when indicated, and in the case of a cross-link experiment also 1 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) dissolved in labeling medium (Pierce). After 10 min the cross-linking reaction was quenched on ice with quench buffer (0.1 m glycine, 10 mmNaHCO3, 250 mm sucrose, pH 8.5). The spheroplasts were subsequently collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 × g. Pellet and supernatant were either trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and immunoprecipitated or used for flotation gradient centrifugation. In release experiments the samples were not treated with a cross-linker. The pellet and supernatant fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and either directly loaded (1/15 of the total material) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PhoE) or immunoprecipitated (OmpA). The release values for PhoE presented in the text are an average of at least three experiments. Cells were grown exactly as described above and pulsed for 30 s with [35S]methionine (30 μCi per ml of cells) followed by a chase with cold methionine (final concentration, 2 mm). Samples were taken at several time intervals and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. To purify membranes and membrane-associated protein complexes; crude membranes were subjected to flotation gradient analysis as described previously (28Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Pellet fractions from the spheroplast labeling experiment were resuspended in spheroplast-labeling medium and subsequently osmotically lysed by dilution with 9 volumes of cold water. The lysed cells were sonicated three times for 10 s. Non-lysed cells were removed by low speed centrifugation (6000 × g for 2 min). Subsequently, membranes were pelleted by centrifugation in a TLA120.2 rotor for 30 min at 300,000 × g and loaded onto the bottom of a tube that was overlaid with sucrose. After centrifugation, the two top fractions, containing the membranes and membrane-associated proteins, were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) were prepared as follows. pC4MethPhoE-derivative plasmids were linearized with HindIII and transcribed using a T7 polymerase MEGAscript kit of Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Translations were carried out as described previously (1Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W.L. vonHeijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A lysate was used from a trigger factor-depleted strain, and 100 μm aurin tricarboxylic acid was added 2.5 min after the start of the translation to inhibit initiation. RNCs were purified by centrifugation over a sucrose cushion (29High S. Flint N. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Per standard translation reaction of 12.5 μl the RNCs were resuspended in 2 μl of RN buffer (100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9), mixed with 10.5 μl of periplasmic extract (∼1 mg/ml), and treated with 1 mm BS3. In vitrotranslation of prePhoE was carried out as described previously (16de Cock H. Schafer U. Potgeter M. Demel R. Muller M. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Either plasmid pJP29 (30Bosch D. Leunissen J. Verbakel J. de Jong M. van Erp H. Tommassen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7) or pVG01 (24Van Gelder P. De Cock H. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3) was used. For targeting to the IM, vesicles were added at the start of the translation reaction, and cross-linking was carried out with 1 mm DSS as described (1Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W.L. vonHeijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were transferred to ice and incubated for 5 min with chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) to stop further translations. Subsequently, mixtures were incubated with proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) in the absence or presence of Triton X-100 (1% w/v). The protease reaction was stopped after 30-min incubation on ice by the addition of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.Figure 3In vitro synthesized PhoE binds to Skp at the periplasmic side of the inner membrane.PrePhoE was synthesized in vitro using an S135 extract in the presence of inner membrane vesicles isolated from wild type (lanes 1-8) or from an skp mutant (lanes 9–16). After translocation, the samples were treated with the membrane permeable cross-linker DSS and either directly immunoprecipitated or after treatment with proteinase K. Anasterisk indicates the cross-link product of PhoE with Skp. Molecular masses are indicated in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trichloroacetic acid pellets were either directly solubilized with SDS-sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-precipitated proteins or solubilized in SDS-buffer and used in immunoprecipitation reactions under denaturing conditions. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (31Römisch K. Webb J. Lingelbach K. Gausepohl H. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed on 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Co-immunoprecipitations of in vitro synthesized PhoE proteins with antibodies directed against Skp were performed as described previously (16de Cock H. Schafer U. Potgeter M. Demel R. Muller M. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by phosphorimaging using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 473 and analyzed using the ImageQuaNT software from Molecular Dynamics. PhoE is translocated over the IM in a non-native state. Upon entering the periplasm, the protein has to be released from this membrane to assemble into the outer membrane in its native trimeric structure. We wanted to determine which chaperones and folding catalysts assist in these processes and to study the timing of the interaction with these accessory proteins. To that end, we used an unbiased approach to analyze the molecular environment of the newly translocated PhoE protein or PhoE translocation intermediates at the periplasmic side of the IM. MC4100 cells containing an induciblephoE gene were converted into spheroplasts, induced for the expression of PhoE, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and chased with cold methionine. Subsequently, cells were treated with the membrane-impermeable cross-linker BS3 either in the presence or absence of added periplasmic extract. After immunoprecipitating the PhoE proteins in the pellet or supernatant fractions with anti-sera against PhoE, proteins that interact with this OMP were identified. As shown in Fig. 1,lanes 13 and 14, a cross-linking product with a molecular mass of ∼52 kDa was found in the supernatant fraction. The 52-kDa product corresponds in size to the combination of one molecule of PhoE (36 kDa) and one Skp (16 kDa). The band was absent when periplasmic proteins were not added (lane 11) or when a periplasmic extract of a skp mutant was used (lane 12). These data indicated that Skp closely interacts with PhoE during or after the process of secretion into the spheroplast medium, as was shown previously (16de Cock H. Schafer U. Potgeter M. Demel R. Muller M. Tommassen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the spheroplast pellet fraction cross-linking products of ∼71, 57, and 52 kDa were detected (lanes 5–8), suggesting that these products are still associated to the IM. The intensity of the 71- and 57-kDa bands was independent of the addition of periplasmic proteins. This indicates that the cross-linking adducts were not periplasmic, but membrane-associated proteins. The cross-linking adducts were not further identified, but the size of the 71-kDa product suggests that this represents a PhoE dimer. The band of 52 kDa could be immunoprecipitated with a specific antiserum raised against Skp (lane 9). A faint reaction was also obtained without the addition of a periplasmic extract containing Skp (lanes 5and 6), indicating that the residual amount of Skp associated with the spheroplasts interacted with PhoE. These results showed that Skp interacts with PhoE at the level of the IM. It is, however, also conceivable that the Skp-PhoE cross-linking product in the pellet fraction represented an interaction of Skp with PhoE aggregates. To distinguish between these possibilities, spheroplasts were lysed and IMs were purified by flotation gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2). The vast majority of PhoE protein was associated with the membranes present in fraction 2 (seelanes 3, 4, and 6). In this fraction the IM protein YidC (32Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was detected as a control protein (results not shown). Furthermore, the typical three cross-linking products of 72, 57, and 52 kDa were also detected in this membrane fraction. The 52-kDa band could be immunoprecipitated with either αPhoE (lane 6) or αSkp (lane 8). The three cross-linking bands could also be obtained when the cross-linking was carried out after the flotation (lane 4). These results showed that the Skp·PhoE interaction occurs in close proximity of the membrane, resulting in a membrane-associated PhoE·Skp complex. The interaction of Skp with PhoE at the membrane was also investigatedin vitro. The precursor of PhoE was synthesized in anE. coli-derived translation system in the presence of inverted IM vesicles. The precursors could be imported into these vesicles with an efficiency of ∼25% as was monitored by their resistance against externally added proteinase K (Fig.3, lanes 1, 4, and7). This efficiency of targeting and insertion was also found in other studies with in vitro synthesized prePhoE (33Houben E.N.G. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.-W. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 238: 1-5Google Scholar). Cross-linking with the membrane-permeable cross-linker DSS gave rise to a cross-linking product of 52 kDa that could be immunoprecipitated with anti-serum directed against PhoE (lanes 2, 5) and Skp (lanes 3 and 6). This cross-linking product must have been formed, at least for a large part, inside the vesicles (periplasmic side), because it was resistant to externally added proteinase K (lanes 5 and 6). Importantly, this proteinase K-resistant cross-linking product could not be obtained when vesicles were used isolated from a skpmutant (lanes 13 and 14). The 52-kDa cross-linking product that could be immunoprecipitated with anti-Skp (lane 11) was degraded by the protease (lane 14), indicating that the cross-linking adduct origins from the lysate, which was isolated from the wild type. We subsequently wanted to determine whether Skp interacts with PhoE during translocation across the IM. Previously, it was demonstrated that a PhoE-LacZ hybrid protein spans the IM, with the PhoE moiety in the periplasm and the β-galactosidase moiety in the cytoplasm. In addition, such LacZ fusion proteins were shown to block translocation of other proteins across the IM, due to jamming of the Sec pathway (34Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In other studies dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was used to create OmpA-DHFR translocation intermediates that have similar effects as LacZ fusions (35Arkowitz R.A. Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (36Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We made use of this strategy to study the environment of PhoE translocation intermediates. We constructed a hybrid protein containing the N-terminal 300 amino acid residues of PhoE fused to mouse DHFR under control of the inducible arabinose promoter. Upon induction with arabinose, cells harboring thephoE300-dhfr gene fusion synthesized the hybrid protein and stopped growing (results not shown). In a pulse-chase experiment it could be demonstrated that under non-inducing conditions relatively low amounts of the hybrid protein were synthesized (Fig.4 a). In these cells, the OmpA protein was rapidly processed to the mature form (Fig. 4 c). Upon induction with arabinose the PhoE-DHFR hybrid protein was synthesized to increased amounts and both the hybrid precursor as well as the mature form were present even after 30 min (Fig. 4 b). In addition, the synthesis of OmpA was reduced and proOmpA accumulated, indicating that it could not be translocated across the IM (Fig.4 d). These results indicated that the synthesis of the PhoE-DHFR hybrid protein causes jamming of the Sec translocase. Proteinase K treatment of spheroplasts that were induced for synthesis of the hybrid protein and subsequently pulse labeled, showed that the PhoE moiety of the mature hybrid protein was degraded by the protease, whereas the DHFR moiety was not (results not shown). These data demonstrate that the PhoE-DHFR hybrid protein is in a transmembrane orientation, because it is accessible for protease added from the outside and it blocks the translocation apparatus. The vast majority of the translocons must be occupied with this fusion protein, because an efficient block in protein export is observed. To analyze the environment of these translocation intermediates, spheroplasts were induced with arabinose, pulse-labeled in the presence of additional periplasmic proteins, and subsequently treated with the soluble cross-linker BS3. In the pellet fractions several cross-linked bands could be identified after immunoprecipitation with antisera raised against DHFR (Fig. 5,lane 3). The strong cross-linking product of ∼97 kDa possibly represented a dimer of the hybrid protein. The very weak band of ∼65 kDa could also be immunoprecipitated with antiserum raised against Skp (lane 2). In addition, by using sequential immunoprecipitation we found that this cross-linking product could be immunoprecipitated first by anti-Skp and subsequently by anti-PhoE (lane 1). The 65-kDa cross-linking product was membrane-associated, because it was found in the same two fractions of a flotation gradient as the inner membrane protein YidC (32Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (results not shown). These results demonstrated that the PhoE-DHFR hybrid protein interacted with Skp and that the interaction of Skp with PhoE occurred during translocation, i.e. when PhoE is in a transmembrane orientation. The amount of PhoE-DHFR·Skp complex found in this experimental setup is much less compared with the amount of PhoE·Skp found in the experiments described above and shown in Fig.1. It is possible that cross-linking targets are not properly exposed in the hybrid protein, but it is also conceivable that a C-terminal PhoE-truncate binds less efficiently to Skp compared with the full-length protein. The results obtained so far indi"

These two phenotypically mature cell types show a high degree of plasticity, which can be observed when cells are grown under specific culture conditions. Gap junctions are abundant among osteoblastic cellsin vivo and in vitro, whereas they are down-regulated during adipogenesis. Gap junctional communication (GJC) modulates the expression of genes associated with the mature osteoblastic phenotype. Inhibition of GJC utilizing 18-α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGRA) blocks the maturation of pre-osteoblastic cells in vitro.

We used several human osteoblastic cell lines, as well as bone-derived primary osteoblastic cells, to show that confluent cultures of human osteoblastic cells grown under osteogenic conditions developed an adipocytic phenotype after 3 days of complete inhibition of GJC using AGRA or oleamide, two dissimilar nontoxic reversible inhibitors. Development of an adipogenic phenotype was confirmed by the accumulation of triglyceride droplets and the increase in mRNA expression of the adipocytic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 and lipoprotein lipase. Glycyrrhizic acid, a noninhibitory AGRA analog, or α-bromopalmitate, a nondegradable fatty acid, had no effect.

Osteoblasts and adipocytes are phenotypically distinct mature cells thought to differentiate from a common mesenchymal progenitor cell (1Owen M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 10: 63-76Crossref Google Scholar, 2Asahina I. Sampath T.K. Hauschka P.V. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 222: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The molecular events that determine lineage progression toward a specific phenotype remain to be fully characterized. Either cell type can be cultured in vitro under conditions that foster or maintain their respective phenotypes. Osteogenic conditions include the presence of ascorbic acid, β-glycerol phosphate, and dexamethasone or vitamin D3, depending on the maturational stage of the osteoblast precursor, in the culture medium. In contrast, adipogenic conditions include the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX),1 insulin, and dexamethasone in the culture medium. Nutall et al. (3Nutall M.E. Patton A.J. Olivera D.L. Nadeau D.P. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have shown that mature human osteoblastic cells are capable of trans-differentiation to adipocytes when cultured in the presence of dexamethasone and IBMX. On the other hand, Park et al. (4Park S.R. Oreffo R.O.C. Triffitt J.T. Bone. 1999; 24: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have shown that cloned single human adipocytes can dedifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells, which subsequently differentiate into osteoblasts or adipocytes under appropriate culture conditions. This plasticity between the differentiation of osteogenic and adipogenic human cells provides further support for a common precursor and has significant physiological implications, because the decrease in bone mass associated with age-related osteopenia and osteoporosis is accompanied by an increase in bone marrow adipose tissue (5Meunier P.

Gap junctions (GJ) are aggregations of individual gated cell-to-cell channels that allow the exchange of small molecules (up to 1 kDa) between the cytoplasms of adjacent cells (7Loewenstein W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 829-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Connexin43 (Cx43) has been identified as the major component of gap junctions in osteoblastic cells (8Schiller P.C.

The responsiveness of osteoblastic cells to stimulation by parathyroid hormone is modulated by gap junctional communication (GJC) (15Vander Molen M.A. Rubin C.T. McLeod K.J. McCauley L.K.

Bone. 2001; 28: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of gap junctional communication interferes with the maturation process of osteoblastic cells in culture (17Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Estremadoyro P. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. Bone. 1998; 23: S325Google Scholar, 18Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Ziambaras K. Cheng S.L. Koval M. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In contrast, murine marrow-derived preadipocytic cells undergoing in vitro adipogenic differentiation down-regulate Cx43 and GJC (19Umezawa A. Hata J. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these data suggest that GJC may play a critical role in modulating the progression of progenitor cells toward a specific phenotype in vivo. Moreover, we have reported that in the rat, Cx43 is down-regulated as a function of age in most tissues examined (20Schiller P.C. Roberts E.L. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. The Gerontologist. 1993; 33: 138Crossref Google Scholar). In this study we investigate whether modulation of GJC per se can influence the phenotype of osteoblastic cells in culture. We have used 18-α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGRA), a reversible inhibitor of GJC (21Davidson J.S. Baumgarten I.M. Harley E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 22Davidson J.S. Baumgarten I.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 1104-1107PubMed Google Scholar) and its noninhibitory analog glycyrrhizic acid (GA) (21Davidson J.S. Baumgarten I.M. Harley E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) to confirm that chemical inhibition of GJC interferes with the timely development of osteoblastic phenotypic markers in the MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic differentiation model (23Kodama H. Amagai Y. Sudo H. Yamamoto S. Jpn. J. Oral. Biol. 1981; 23: 899-901Crossref Google Scholar) and to determine whether AGRA-mediated inhibition of GJC can promote the development of adipogenic phenotypic characteristics. To investigate if human osteoblastic cells are susceptible to trans-differentiation toward an adipocytic phenotype, under osteogenic culture conditions, we utilized both osteoblasts derived from trabecular bone explants and the widely used osteoblastic osteosarcoma U-2 OS. Inhibition of GJC was achieved by the use of AGRA and oleamide (24Boger D.L. Patterson J.E. Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4810-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), two inhibitors of GJC with dissimilar chemical structures. Adipogenesis is characterized phenotypically by the appearance of triglyceride droplets in the cytoplasm of the osteoblastic cells U-2 OS, SaOS, HOS, and primary cultures of vertebra-derived human osteoblasts, and genotypically by the expression of mRNAs for the adipocytic lineage-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) and enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). The cloned nontransformed murine osteogenic cell line MC3T3-E1 (23Kodama H. Amagai Y. Sudo H. Yamamoto S. Jpn. J. Oral. Biol. 1981; 23: 899-901Crossref Google Scholar) was kindly provided to us by Dr. M. Kumegawa (Meikai University, Sakada, Japan) and subcultured in α-modified essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin (pen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (strep), with a change of medium every 3 to 4 days. Primary cultures of human osteoblast-like cells were obtained from trabecular bone explants isolated from a lumbar vertebra of a 10-year-old normal female (primary culture 1) or of a 67-year-old normal male (primary culture 2) after fatal traumatic injury (25D'Ippolito G. Schiller P.C. Roos B.A. Ricordi C. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Primary human osteoblastic (hOB) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Human osteoblastic osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and SaOS cells (ATCC) were grown in McCoy's 5a medium with 1.5 mm l-glutamine supplemented with 15% FBS, and HOS cells (ATCC) in MEM with 10% FBS. Osteoblastic cells were expanded in their respective growth media and when sufficient cells were obtained they were seeded at 10,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates (for staining and GJC assays; Costar, Cambridge, MA) or 60- to 100-mm dishes (for RNA isolation; Costar). The following day (day 0) the respective growth medium in each case was replaced with osteogenic medium, growth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate (Sigma). Thereafter the cells were grown in osteogenic medium for periods ranging from 7 to 28 days. The medium was replaced every 3–4 days or as specified in the figure legends. All tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). FBS was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), 18-α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGRA), and oleamide were purchased from Sigma, and α-bromopalmitate was from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). These test reagents were prepared fresh immediately before use as 30-mm stocks in Me2SO and diluted as needed. In those experiments where cells were exposed to GA, AGRA, oleamide, α-bromopalmitate, or vehicle (Me2SO), the growth medium was supplemented with these agents every time it was replaced, and the final Me2SO concentration was always kept constant (0.3%). Treatment times are indicated in each figure legend. Studies involving human cells were approved by the local VA institutional review board for human tissues in research. GJC was assessed using a modification of the two-dye method (26Tomasetto C. Neveu M.J. Daley J. Horan P.K. Sager R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as previously described (16Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Balkan W. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. Bone. 2001; 28: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in osteogenic medium in parallel cultures identical to those to be assayed for GJC were loaded with the dyes calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 4 μm) and DiI (Molecular Probes; 8–10 μm). Double-labeled donor cells were trypsinized and ∼100–200 single cells were gently overlaid on unlabeled recipient cells growing in 6-well plates (Costar). Transfer of GJ-permeable calcein (green fluorescence) from the double-labeled donor into the recipient cells was monitored for periods of up to 24 h. The GJ-impermeable DiI (red fluorescence) was monitored to identify the donor cells. GJC was scored as 0 when no transfer of calcein was observed, as 1 when calcein transferred from the donor cell to an adjacent recipient cell, as 2 when the adjacent cell transferred calcein to a subsequent adjacent cell in a direction away from the donor cell, as 3 when transfer was to yet a third cell away from the donor, and so on. Dye transfer to 5 or more cells away from the donor was difficult to quantify and was scored as ≥5. GJC was scored only when the donor was a single cell at least 10 cells away from another single donor cell. For RNA isolation, cells were grown in 60-mm or 100-mm dishes (Costar). At the indicated times the medium was removed, and total RNA was extracted as previously described (13Schiller P.C. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using the TriZol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Manassas, VA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically. For Northern blot analysis, 10 to 20 μg of total RNA was processed as previously described (13Schiller P.C. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A mouse bone sialoprotein (BSP) plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Marian Young, the mouse osteocalcin (OC) probe was a 371-bp fragment obtained by RT-PCR corresponding to positions 8–379 of GenBankTM/EBI locus MMBGPR, and the mouse GAPDH fragment was from Ambion (Austin, TX). For semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), RNA was precipitated in a 2m LiCl (Sigma) solution, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Five micrograms of high molecular weight RNA was reverse transcribed using MuLV reverse transcriptase, 200 pmol random hexamer primer, and 50 pmol of oligo(dT) (16Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Balkan W. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. Bone. 2001; 28: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Aliquots (4%) of the total cDNA were amplified in each PCR in a 20-μliter reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of 5′ and 3′ primers in a standard PCR buffer supplemented with 0.5 μCi of [32P]dCTP (10 μCi/μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each sample was run in duplicate. Controls lacking reverse transcriptase were treated in the same fashion. All PCR reagents were from Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT). Amplifications were performed in a GeneAmp9600 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 17–28 cycles (typically: 94 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 60 s; 72 °C for 60 s) after an initial denaturation of 94 °C for 2 min. PCR products in a 10-μl aliquot were size separated by electrophoresis in 6% acrylamide/Tris-borate-EDTA gels. Quantitation of the amplification reactions was performed by electronic autoradiography using an InstantImager analyzer (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Semiquantitative analysis of gene expression was assessed from the differences between amplified products normalized to the corresponding elongation factor (EF-1a) PCR product. Primer Sequences: mouse osteocalcin (371-bp product; GenBankTM/EBI locus: MMBGPR), mOC-F (5′-CAAGTCCCACACAGCAGCTT-3′) and mOC-R (5′-AAAGCCGAGCTGCCAGAGTT-3); human PPAR-γ2 (419-bp product; HSU79012): hPPAR-F (5′-ATTCTCCTATTGACCCAGAAAGCG-3′) and hPPAR-R (5′-AGCTTTATTCTCCACAGACACGACATT-3′); human LPL (276-bp product; HSLPLR): hLPL-F (5′-GAGATTTCTCTGTATGGCACC-3′) and hLPL-R (5′-CTGCAAATGAGACACTTTCTC-3′); human EF-1a (235-bp product; HUMPTI1A): hEF1a-F (5′-AGGTGATTATCCTGAACCATCC-3′) and hEF1a-R (5′-AAAGGTGGATAGTCTGAGAAGC-3′). Cells were washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Lipid droplets were stained using a 3% solution of Sudan IV (Sigma) or Oil-Red-O (Sigma) in isopropyl alcohol/water (3:2) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Matrix-bound mineral content was determined using alizarin red-S as previously described (27Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cellular lipids were extracted directly from the tissue culture wells with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2; v/v) as described (28Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol and triglyceride were measured by published methods (29Heider J.G. Boyett R. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 9: 514-518Google Scholar,30Mendez A.J. Cabeza C. Hsia S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After the lipid extraction, cellular proteins were dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 270: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cholesterol and triglyceride mass were expressed as μg lipid per mg of cell protein. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for each group. Statistical differences among treatment groups were evaluated with analysis of variance. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the following day (day 0) the medium was replaced with medium supplemented with ascorbic acid and β-glycerol phosphate (osteogenic medium). Under these conditions, these preosteoblastic cells undergo a maturation process similar to that of primary osteoblastic cells (32Quarles L.D. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W. Caton R. Wenstrup R.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Parallel cultures were grown in osteogenic medium in the presence or absence of 100 μmAGRA, 100 μm GA, or vehicle (Me2SO) for 3 to 28 days. At this concentration, AGRA had no detectable deleterious effect (i.e., no decrease in cell number) in these cells (not shown). GJC was measured from 2 to 6 h after overlaying the donor cells on those days in which the medium was changed. GJC increased with time in culture in cells treated with either vehicle or 100 μm GA in a fashion similar to untreated cells at all times tested. In contrast, AGRA inhibited GJC within the time frame in which it was assayed (Table I).Table IPhenotypic markers in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cellsTreatmentGJC1-aGJC was assayed in cells grown for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 100 μm AGRA inhibited GJC at all times tested.

Open table in a new tab MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded and grown as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Parallel cultures were grown in the presence or absence of vehicle (Me2SO), 100 μm GA, or 100 μm AGRA and used to determine matrix-bound mineral or for RNA isolation. Growth medium was changed every 3–4 days, and fresh test substances were added every time the medium was changed. AGRA-mediated inhibition of GJC resulted in a decrease in matrix mineral content at all times tested (Table I). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that expression of BSP and OC (Table I) mRNAs, assayed within 4 h after addition of chemicals, were decreased only when GJC was inhibited. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of the same RNA used in the Northern blot experiments confirmed the Northern blot data (not shown). Because inhibition of GJC in long-term cultures of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells inhibited the development of the osteoblast phenotype, we investigated whether it would have an effect on the appearance of the adipocytic phenotype. Sudan IV staining of cells grown under osteogenic conditions for 28 days showed that lipid droplets accumulated in the cytoplasm of some of the cells only when GJC had been inhibited by AGRA (Fig.1 A). Having found that inhibition of GJC not only inhibited the development of an osteoblastic phenotype but stimulated adipocytic characteristics (cytoplasmic lipid droplets) in long-term cultures of murine preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, we wanted to determine whether inhibition of GJC for a relatively short term had an effect on the capacity of phenotypically mature human osteoblastic cells to develop an adipocytic phenotype. Human U-2 OS and bone-derived primary osteoblastic cells were seeded as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the next day (day 0) exposed to osteogenic conditions. The cells were grown for 7 days in osteogenic medium until they were fully confluent. On day 8 the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 50–90 μm AGRA, 20–90 μm oleamide, 20–90 μm GA, or vehicle (Me2SO) in osteogenic medium. GJC was determined using donor cells grown in parallel in the absence of any inhibitors. GJC was evaluated every 2–6 h for up to 24 h after overlaying the dye-loaded cells. AGRA and oleamide effectively inhibited GJC in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas GA had no inhibitory effect on GJC (Fig. 2). At a concentration of 90 μm, AGRA inhibited GJC without any detectable deleterious effects on the cells (no change in cell numbers; not shown); however, it was observed that after 24 h the cells recovered some of their capacity to communicate via GJ. In a fashion similar to that observed on day 8, AGRA inhibited GJC on days 9 and 10 when fresh medium containing inhibitors was added (not shown). Oleamide effectively inhibited GJC at a concentration of 70 μm in U-2 OS and at 90 μm in primary osteoblasts. In a similar fashion, oleamide-treated cells also partially recovered their capacity to communicate via GJ after 24 h. However, oleamide appeared to inhibit GJC more effectively for longer periods of time compared with AGRA. Human U-2 OS cells express phenotypic characteristics of mature osteoblasts (33Ringbom-Anderson T. Jantti J. Akerman K.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also the bone-derived primary osteoblastic (hOB) cells used in these studies showed alkaline phosphatase activity and expressed bone sialoprotein mRNA (not shown). Cells were seeded and grown under osteogenic conditions in parallel cultures for 4, 8, or 15 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In each case the cells were exposed to the GJC inhibitors AGRA or oleamide, the noninhibitory analog GA, or vehicle for 3 consecutive days. Because AGRA and oleamide were effective in inhibiting GJC for approximately a 24-h period, the medium was replenished with fresh osteogenic medium (containing vehicle, AGRA, oleamide, or GA) each consecutive day. On the fourth day after beginning the treatments with the chemical agents, the cells were fixed and stained for cytoplasmic lipid droplets with Sudan IV or Oil-Red-O. Lipid staining showed the accumulation of cytoplasmic droplets only in cells from cultures grown under osteogenic conditions for 8 days (confluent cultures) after GJC was inhibited by AGRA or oleamide for 3 consecutive days (Fig. 3). No accumulation of lipid droplets was detected in sparse U-2 OS cultures grown for 4 days or in compact overconfluent cultures grown for 15 days in which GJC had been inhibited with either AGRA or oleamide for an additional 3 consecutive days (not shown). To ascertain that lipid droplet accumulation in the cytoplasm of AGRA-treated cells was caused by inhibition of GJC and not uptake of excess lipids in the growth medium or fatty acid-induced adipogenesis, U-2 OS and hOB cells were grown for 7 days and exposed to the nonmetabolizable fatty acid α-bromopalmitate (90 μm) from day 8 to day 11 under the culture conditions described. Treatment with α-bromopalmitate did not induce accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (Fig. 3). To confirm that the observed results were not an isolated phenomenon and that indeed inhibition of GJC could promote the trans-differentiation of other human osteoblastic cells to an adipocytic phenotype, the osteoblastic cell lines SaOS, HOS, and an additional primary osteoblastic culture were exposed to the same treatment. In all cases the osteoblastic cells accumulated lipid droplets only when complete inhibition of GJC by either AGRA or oleamide was achieved (Fig. 4). AGRA- and oleamide-mediated inhibition of GJC in SaOS, HOS, and additional primary osteoblastic cultures was time- and dose- dependent in a fashion similar to that observed for U-2 OS (not shown). Analysis of the lipid content in U-2 OS cells indicated that inhibition of GJC resulted in a 3–5-fold increase in triglyceride levels in the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 5), whereas the cholesterol levels were not affected (not shown). In a similar fashion, analysis of lipid content in hOB cells showed that inhibition of GJC resulted in a 3–8-fold increase in cytoplasmic triglyceride content without affecting cholesterol levels (not shown). To further characterize the effect of inhibition of GJC on the development of an adipogenic phenotype by human osteoblastic cells, the level of expression of PPAR-γ2, LPL, and EF-1α transcripts was evaluated using semiquantitative RT-PCR in U-2 OS cells. Inhibition of GJC with AGRA resulted in an increase in the expression of the adipogenic-specific genes PPAR -γ2 andLPL, whereas expression of EF-1a was unaffected (Fig.6 A). Statistical analysis of changes in the detectable levels of the transcripts are also shown (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained in U-2 OS cells treated with oleamide and in hOB cells where GJC had been inhibited with either AGRA or oleamide (not shown). The results demonstrate that the effects of AGRA-mediated inhibition of GJC in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells are very similar to those obtained as a result of gene-mediated inhibition of GJC utilizing dominant-negative mutants of Cx43 (18Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Ziambaras K. Cheng S.L. Koval M. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). AGRA-mediated inhibition of GJC has been utilized as a means to demonstrate other biological events in which GJC was found to play a significant role (34Munari-Silem Y. Lebrethon M.C. Morand I. Rousset B. Saez J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Grandolfo M. Calabrese A. D'Andrea P. J. Bone Miner.

We have previously reported that Cx43 (13Schiller P.C. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and GJC (16Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Balkan W. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. Bone. 2001; 28: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) increase during in vitro osteoblastogenesis. Inhibition of GJC in MC3T3-E1 cells with AGRA is reversible, and because the medium containing the inhibitor is replaced every 3–4 days, it is likely that GJC is at least partially recovered among the cells before the addition of fresh inhibitor blocks it again. Long-term GJC inhibition was sufficient to interfere with the ability of osteoblastic cells to express two genes, BSP and OC, intimately associated with the mature osteoblastic phenotype. GJC inhibition also profoundly affected the capacity of the osteoblastic cells to produce a mineralized extracellular matrix, the ultimate phenotypic hallmark of an osteoblast. In addition, GJC inhibition not only blocked the progression of preosteoblastic cells toward the mature osteoblastic phenotype, but it appeared to stimulate cytoplasmic accumulation of lipid droplets in a portion of the cells, a characteristic of adipocytic cells. Our results also demonstrate that cultured human bone-derived osteoblastic cells, as well as widely used osteoblastic cell lines, undergo trans-differentiation toward the adipogenic phenotype after 3 days of AGRA- or oleamide-mediated inhibition of GJC despite being grown under osteogenic culture conditions. Adipogenesis was characterized by the expression of functional as well as molecular markers. Lipid staining and subsequent analysis showed that indeed triglycerides accumulate in the cytoplasm of cells as a consequence of GJC inhibition by either AGRA or oleamide. This phenotypic change took place with a parallel increase in PPARγ2 and LPL transcripts, molecular markers of adipogenesis. In the studies described we use AGRA, a polycyclical lipid, as well as oleamide, an amide of oleic acid, as inhibitors of GJC. It has previously been reported that certain lipids, in particular fatty acids, are capable of inducing differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (37Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have found no evidence that lipids with a chemical structure resembling that of AGRA or oleamide are capable of inducing adipogenesis. As a control we have used GA, a glycoside of 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid (21Davidson J.S. Baumgarten I.M. Harley E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which does not inhibit GJC, at the same concentration and found to have no effect on adipogenesis. 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid also inhibited GJC in osteoblastic cells; however, in our hands it had a significantly higher toxicity than its α-isomer and was not used for that reason (data not shown). To further exclude the possibility that the GJC inhibitors may be inducing adipogenesis as a consequence of their lipid nature, we used the nonmetabolizable fatty acid α-bromopalmitate and found that at concentrations of up to 90 μm, it also was unable to induce trans-differentiation of human bone-derived osteoblastic cells to adipocytes, suggesting that lipids alone are not sufficient to induce this process in these cells. Similarly, Nutallet al. (3Nutall M.E. Patton A.J. Olivera D.L. Nadeau D.P. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) reported that α-bromopalmitate by itself was unable to induce expression of an adipocytic phenotype in treated osteoblasts. There is a possibility that AGRA may be inducing adipogenesis via a mechanism different from inhibition of GJC. Previous studies have shown that AGRA can inhibit calcium waves in addition to inhibiting GJC (38Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Ehring G.R. Hall J.E. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We have used oleamide, which does not inhibit intercellular calcium signaling (38Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Ehring G.R. Hall J.E. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), instead of AGRA and found it to inhibit GJC in a dose-dependent fashion and to have similar effects in inducing trans-differentiation to adipocytes. We observed that complete inhibition of GJC with either AGRA or oleamide was required in order for osteoblastic cells to develop adipocytic characteristics within the time frame described. The results obtained using AGRA and oleamide, two inhibitors with different chemical structures, support a role for GJC in determining lineage progression of skeletal cells with multipotential capacity. A future direction is to determine the adipogenic potential of marrow-derived progenitor cells fromCx43-null mice, whose osteoblastic cells were reported to have a decreased osteogenic potential (39Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheik S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Exposure of U-2 OS cell cultures grown for 4 days (sparsely populated) or for 15 days (tightly compact) to the same GJC inhibitory conditions (3 days) did not increase cytoplasmic lipid content. These results suggest that there may be a window of time, during the culture of these osteoblastic cells, during which inhibition of GJC will lead to adipogenesis. Genetic approaches using inducible expression vectors which will profoundly inhibit GJC, such as dominant-negative forCx43 and Cx45, now under development, will confirm the results obtained with the chemical inhibitors. Our results support the concept that plasticity exists among cells of the stromal lineage and that modulation of GJC may be a mechanism involved in determining progression toward an osteoblastic or adipocytic fully differentiated phenotype. Whereas cell-to-cell coupling via gap junctions would favor osteogenesis, uncoupling would favor adipogenesis. Changes in GJC could contribute to a shift in lineage progression by affecting the second-messenger systems activated in response to external stimuli or the rate of transcription of specific genes associated with the fully differentiated phenotypes. In support of this concept, Vander Molen et al. (15Vander Molen M.A. Rubin C.T. McLeod K.J. McCauley L.K. Donahue H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12165-12171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the responsiveness of osteoblasts to parathyroid hormone changes as a function of GJC, and Lecanda et al.(40Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Bone. 1998; 23: S150Crossref Google Scholar) have identified specific regulatory sequences in the osteocalcin promoter which are sensitive to GJC in osteoblastic cells. Cells coupled via gap junctions may transfer second-messenger molecules, such as calcium, inositol phosphates, or cyclic nucleotides, from the stimulated cell to neighboring cells. Alternatively, when uncoupled, the relative concentration of the second messenger,e.g. calcium, could reach higher intracellular levels than when the cell is coupled. Thus cell coupling may influence the amplitude and the duration of the response to a stimulus, which may, in turn, regulate the cascade of events (e.g. protein kinases) leading to transcription factor activity modulation. Inactivation of a particular set of transcription factors, such as those involved in the regulation of OC or BSP expression, in parallel with activation of a different set, such as PPARγ2 or others involved in adipogenesis, may cause a genotypic switch leading to a change in the phenotype of a cell. The role of GJC in this lineage interrelationship may have important consequences in terms of the progression of osteopenic diseases. The excess adipogenesis in postmenopausal women and in age-related osteopenia may occur at the expense of osteogenesis and may involve a decrease in GJC as a result of aging or endocrine changes. We have recently demonstrated an age-related decrease in marrow osteoblastogenesis in humans (25D'Ippolito G. Schiller P.C. Roos B.A. Ricordi C. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the femurs of young mice there are twice as many GJ (among osteoblasts, stromal, and hematopoietic cells) than in those from older animals (41Krenacs T. Rosendaal M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 993-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of skeletal GJC may represent a pharmacological target by which inhibition of marrow adipogenesis can take place with the parallel enhancement of osteoblastogenesis. Such a scenario could provide a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of human age-related osteopenic diseases and postmenopausal osteoporosis.

The ability of the five βγ dimers to support receptor-α-βγ interactions was examined using membranes expressing the β1-adrenergic or A2a adenosine receptors. These receptors discriminated among the defined heterotrimers based solely on the β isoform. The β4γ2 dimer demonstrated the highest coupling efficiency to either receptor. The β5γ2 dimer coupled poorly to each receptor, with EC50 values 40–200-fold higher than those observed with β4γ2. Strikingly, whereas the EC50 of the β1γ2 dimer at the β1-adrenergic receptor was similar to β4γ2, its EC50 was 20-fold higher at the A2a adenosine receptor. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase type I (AC1) and stimulation of type II (AC2) by the βγ dimers were measured. βγ dimers containing Gβ1–4 were able to stimulate AC2 similarly, and β5γ2 was much less potent. β1γ2, β2γ2, and β4γ2inhibited AC1 equally; β3γ2 was 10-fold less effective, and β5γ2 had no effect. These data argue that the β isoform in the βγ dimer can determine the specificity of signaling at both receptors and effectors.

The components involved in this signaling cascade are diverse, including a large number of receptors, G protein α and βγ subunits and effectors. Even though the diversity of the proteins in this system could potentially account for the known specificity of signaling in differentiated cells, the mechanisms for determining specificity are not completely defined. The β-adrenergic receptor is one of the most well characterized seven transmembrane spanning receptors, and provides an excellent example of selective coupling to a particular α subunit, Gs. When activated, Gs can stimulate all nine adenylyl cyclase isoforms (3Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 4Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F400-F416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The G protein βγ dimer, when released after receptor activation, is also able to regulate adenylyl cyclase (5Hurley J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7599-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of the various isoforms of adenylyl cyclase by the βγ dimer is much more selective; apparently, only AC2, AC4 (6Feinstein P.G. Schrader K.A. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J.

Vogel Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that AC2 does not respond well to dimers composed of certain β and γ subunits (10Myung C.S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16595-16603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or to dimers containing the phosphorylated γ12subunit (11Yasuda H. Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand fully the regulation of adenylyl cyclase by a Gs-coupled receptor, one needs to know which βγ dimers are most likely to support receptor G protein coupling and the effects of βγ dimers on the various isoforms of adenylyl cyclase.The number of functionally distinct βγ dimers is potentially very large, with seven G protein β isoforms (including two splice variants) and 12 γ isoforms characterized to date (12Downes G.B. Gautam N. Genomics. 1999; 62: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Neer E.J.

Mostin vitro studies involving coupling of receptors to Gs α or regulation of adenylyl cyclases by distinct βγ dimers have used dimers containing the β1, β2, or β5 subunits (15Ueda N.

The ubiquitous cellular and tissue distribution of Gs α provides the potential for interaction with all five β isoforms and underscores the importance of understanding the role of the different β isoforms on signaling pathways involving Gs α. For example, the antisense studies of Kleuss et al. (17Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Kleuss C.

Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) suggest that specific isoforms of the heterotrimer couple to different receptors, and a number of in vitro studies imply that defined βγ dimers may be released upon receptor activation (16Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S.

In addition, isolation of G protein heterotrimers from a variety of tissues using chromatography or immunoprecipitation has shown that certain β and γ subunits preferentially associate with one another as well as with distinct αO isoforms (22Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Balcueva E.A. McIntire W.E. Mehta N.D. Schey K.L. Robishaw J.D. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4189-4192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Asano T. Morishita R. Ueda H. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21425-21429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data suggest that specific combinations of G protein subunits do existin vivo and may have specialized roles in various signaling cascades.To examine the roles of the various β subunits in receptor-Gs coupling, and in regulating adenylyl cyclase, recombinant Gs α and βγ dimers containing β1–5 complexed with γ2 were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and purified. Proteins were then reconstituted into partially purified Sf9 cell membranes overexpressing either the β1-adrenergic receptor, the A2a adenosine receptor, AC1 or AC2. The effects of the β1–5γ2 combinations were measured in four assays as follows: 1) the ability to couple the Gs α subunit to the β1-adrenergic receptor; 2) the ability to couple the Gs α subunit to the A2a adenosine receptor; 3) the ability to stimulate AC2; and 4) the ability to inhibit AC1. Clear differences were observed among the five βγ dimers in both receptor coupling and effector regulation, suggesting that the diversity of the β subunit contributes extensively to signaling specificity.DISCUSSIONAlthough considerable research has focused on the role of the α subunit in receptor signaling via G proteins, it is also clear that the βγ dimer is required for coupling the α subunit to receptors (16Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S.

Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), and both the β and γ subunits appear to contribute to the interaction. Current evidence indicates that the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the γ subunit and the nature of the prenyl group (farnesyl versus geranylgeranyl) are very important determinants of the coupling of G proteins to receptors (20Richardson M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13525-13533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol.

Compared with α and γ, less is known about the important domains in the β subunit, but cross-linking experiments indicate that the C terminus of the β subunit is able to interact directly with the receptor (46Taylor J.M.

However, the regions close to the C terminus of the β subunit are likely to be quite discrete because mutations in amino acids His311, Arg314, and Trp332have no effect on the ability of the dimers to support receptor coupling but cause a major disruption in the ability of the βγ dimer to activate PLC-β or AC2 (47Myung C.S.

A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Whereas the diversity of the β and γ subunits offers attractive possibilities for determining the specificity of cellular signaling, the functional significance of this heterogeneity has not been completely elucidated. Some insight has come from an elegant set of experiments in which antisense mRNAs to various G protein α and βγ subunits were injected into the nuclei of GH3 cells, leading to the observation that specific receptors couple to distinct isoforms of the G protein heterotrimer. These experiments indicated that the M4 muscarinic receptor preferred a heterotrimer composed of αO1:β3γ4, whereas the somatostatin receptor preferred a heterotrimer composed of αO2:β1γ3 (17Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B.

Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), where it has been demonstrated that selectivity of receptor coupling to α subunits of the Gi (49Kalkbrenner F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10095-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) families depends upon the composition of the βγ dimer. However, few experiments have examined the composition of βγ dimers that couple receptors to Gs α. Moreover, reproduction of this signaling specificity using in vitro systems has proven difficult.A major contribution of the experiments presented in this report is that a panel of highly active recombinant βγ dimers was used in a sensitive assay to compare the ability of five β subunits to couple to two different Gs-linked receptors. The ability of a defined heterotrimer to support coupling of an α subunit to a particular receptor depends primarily on the affinity of the receptor for the heterotrimer (48Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and presumably on the affinity of the interaction between the α and βγ subunits (16Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S. Savino Y. Yasuda H. Khazan R. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34429-34436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 636-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since the order of coupling efficiencies in the present experiments was quite different between the β1-adrenergic and the A2a adenosine receptors, the possibility that the differences observed here were due to differences in the α:βγ affinity seems unlikely. Thus, the order of EC50 values for each receptor is most likely a reflection of its preference for the particular β subunit examined. The β5γ2 dimer, which couples M1 muscarinic receptors efficiently to the Gqα subunit (16Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S. Savino Y. Yasuda H. Khazan R. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34429-34436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was particularly ineffective at coupling the Gs α subunit to either receptor. In contrast, the β4γ2 dimer was consistently highest in coupling efficiency for either receptor. Even more surprising was the finding that the β1γ2 dimer, which in most assays of βγ function is potent and efficacious, was very poor at coupling Gs α to the A2a adenosine receptor. These results lead to the following conclusions: 1) receptors can discriminate among the G protein heterotrimers based on the β isoform alone; 2) all β1–4 isoforms can function in signaling cascades involving Gs α; and 3) dimers containing β5 are not likely to be released from Gs-coupled receptors. Finally, since different βγ dimers may be released upon receptor activation, the downstream effects of the distinct β isoforms may have different signaling properties.One of the immediate downstream targets for βγ is the family of receptor kinases that phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors upon recruitment to the membrane by the dimer (52Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Experiments have examined the ability of defined βγ dimers to interact with the receptor kinases. For example, dimers containing β1 and β2 interact with GRK2, the kinase responsible for down-regulation of the β-adrenergic and A2a adenosine receptors (53Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) far better than dimers containing β3 (54Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Another study examined the ability of a variety of defined βγ dimers to promote the phosphorylation of both the β2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin by GRK2. These results indicate a significant difference in the ability of the various βγ dimers to promote phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor or rhodopsin and suggest that the type of β subunit could determine selectivity between the two receptors (55Muller S. Hekman M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10439-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, even though β1–4 are over 80% identical, the accumulating evidence suggests the type of β subunit in the dimer may have a larger role in determining signaling specificity than previously appreciated.Another immediate downstream target for the βγ subunit is the effector adenylyl cyclase (3Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Results presented here demonstrate that dimers containing β1, β2, or β4 were able to regulate either type of adenylyl cyclase effectively. In contrast, β5γ2 was not particularly effective at inhibiting AC1 or in stimulating AC2 (16Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S. Savino Y. Yasuda H. Khazan R. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34429-34436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, β3γ2 was almost 10-fold weaker at inhibiting AC1 as compared with the β1–4isoforms (Table I), whereas it was equally effective on AC2. These results suggest that upon stimulation of certain Gs-linked receptors, co-activation of AC2 by βγ is relatively nonspecific, whereas inhibition of AC1 by βγ is more selective and may be receptor-dependent. This specificity of interaction between AC1 and the different β isoforms suggests that dimers containing the β3 subunit have signaling roles distinct from those containing β1, β2, or β4.The regions of the βγ dimer that are thought to interact with AC1 and AC2 have been examined using competition experiments with synthetic peptides and alanine mutagenesis. Peptides identical to residues 86–105 and 115–135 of the β1 subunit were able to inhibit stimulation of AC2 by the βγ dimer, implicating these residues of the β subunit (56Chen Y. Weng G. Li J. Harry A. Pieroni J. Dingus J. Hildebrandt J.D. Guarnieri F. Weinstein H. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2711-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as well as others (57Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), as sites on the molecule that interact with AC2. Moreover, the QEHA peptide, which represents a sequence from AC2 thought to interact with the βγ dimer, was able to bind directly to the β subunit. Molecular modeling of the QHEA peptide-βγ interaction also identified the region of β defined by residues 75–165 as a potentially important effector-binding domain (58Weng G. Li J. Dingus J. Hildebrandt J.D. Weinstein H. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26445-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments have suggested that three residues in the β subunit involved in α:β interface, Asp228, Asp246, and Trp332, are important for the activation of AC2 but have no effect on the ability of the dimer to inhibit AC1 (59Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Neer E.J. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16265-16272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Studies of the outer surface of the β torus show that Asn132 in blade two of the protein is important for inhibition of AC1, but seems to have little effect on activation of AC2 (60Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The observation that ADP-ribosylation of Arg129 of β1, a residue also present in β2–4, prevents the inhibition of AC1 by the βγ dimer supports the argument that this is an important domain in the interaction of the dimer with AC1 (61Lupi R. Corda D. Di Girolamo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9418-9424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Examination of the regions identified by the experiments discussed above in the β1–4 subunits shows minimal differences in the amino acid sequence. This is consistent with the observation that these four βγ dimers activated AC2 equally. A similar conclusion applies to the ability of three of the dimers to inhibit AC1; the intriguing exception was β3γ2, which was far less effective. Unfortunately, there are no obvious differences in the amino acid sequence of the β3 subunit in these regions to explain the differences in activity, suggesting that some other region in the molecule is also involved in the interaction with AC1. There are, however, sequence variations that could explain the lack of activity of β5γ2 on either isoform of cyclase. In contrast to the near identity of the β1–4subunits in the regions outlined above that are thought to interact with AC2 and AC1, the β5 subunit has 13 amino acid differences in these regions when compared with the β1subunit. Moreover, there is a two-amino acid insert in the region between residues 130–132, a site identified by ADP-ribosylation experiments as being important for the inhibition of AC1 (61Lupi R. Corda D. Di Girolamo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9418-9424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although not definitive, these differences provide a reasonable starting point for future experiments.Despite the homology in amino acid sequence among these β isoforms, differences in localization have been observed. For example, in contrast to the other β isoforms that were localized to the membrane, β3 was observed predominantly in cytoplasmic fractions in both heart (62Muramoto S. Murakami T. Urasawa K. Kawaguchi H. Kitabatake A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and retina (63Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24776-24781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This property of β3 does not seem likely to be responsible for the observed differences in inhibition of AC1, since β3γ2 was just as effective as the other βγ dimers at activating the membrane-bound protein AC2 and supporting coupling to the β1-adrenergic and A2a adenosine receptors. A more reasonable explanation is that certain residues unique to β3 impart specificity either through altering the contacts with an effector molecule such as AC1, or those unique residues slightly influence the conformation of the β subunit, thereby altering interactions with other proteins. Whatever the reason, one important conclusion is that differences in AC1 inhibition may result from the release of different βγ dimers by receptor activation.This concept appears to apply especially well to dimers containing the β5 subunit. Even though the current data suggest that the β5γ2 dimer is unlikely to be released from Gs-linked receptors, it clearly can be released by activation of Gq-linked receptors (16Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S. Savino Y. Yasuda H. Khazan R. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34429-34436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence shows that the β5γ2dimer does not regulate a variety of effectors, including AC1, AC2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PLC-β3 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (this report and Refs. 64Zhang S. Coso O.A. Lee C. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and 65Maier U. Babich A. Macrez N. Leopoldt D. Gierschik P. Illenberger D. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13746-13754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Even though the β5γ2 dimer did not regulate adenylyl cyclase in our experiments, transfection of the dimer into COS-7 cells caused an inhibition of both AC1 and AC2 (66Bayewitch M.L. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Nevo I. Simonds W.F. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2273-2276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These conflicting data may be explained by other potential partners for β5, such as RGS 6, 7, 9, and 11 (67, 68), which may impinge upon the adenylyl cyclase cascade in vivo. This evidence of multiple partners for the β5 subunit suggests the β5 protein may have functions not normally associated with β subunits and makes the physiological role of β5 on effectors unclear. Especially interesting is the possibility that the β5subunit may exist as a monomer and exchange between γ subunits and RGS proteins (69Yoshikawa D.M. Hatwar M. Smrcka A.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11340-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the role of β5 in signaling is clearly complex, one conclusion from this information is that receptors that couple to and release dimers containing the β5 subunit are less likely to generate cross-talk between signaling systems because of the limited effect of β5containing dimers on downstream effectors.Brain is one tissue where all of the signaling components studied in this report are expressed at high levels (70Liang J.J. Cockett M. Khawaja X.Z. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 71Betty M. Harnish S.W. Rhodes K.J. Cockett M.I.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential effects of the β isoforms demonstrated in this report could have major effects on signaling cascades in the brain. Some experimental support for this concept comes from experiments showing that small amounts of βγ derived from Gs activation can inhibit the neuronal-specific AC1 in vivo (74Nielsen M.D. Chan G.C.K. Poser S.W. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33308-33316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Further information needed to corroborate these proposed differences in βγ signaling includes cellular and subcellular localization of these molecular components. Once the subcellular architecture in these tissues is better understood with respect to G proteins, signaling models based on specific G protein β subunits can be refined with precision. Signal transduction involving heterotrimeric G proteins1 is a universal mechanism for the integration of extracellular stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, and light (1Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The components involved in this signaling cascade are diverse, including a large number of receptors, G protein α and βγ subunits and effectors. Even though the diversity of the proteins in this system could potentially account for the known specificity of signaling in differentiated cells, the mechanisms for determining specificity are not completely defined. The β-adrenergic receptor is one of the most well characterized seven transmembrane spanning receptors, and provides an excellent example of selective coupling to a particular α subunit, Gs. When activated, Gs can stimulate all nine adenylyl cyclase iso"

The groundbreaking work of Vane (1Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7367) Google Scholar) demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, owe their anti-inflammatory effects to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The last 30 years has seen major developments in prostanoid biology, not least the identification of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),1 the inducible COX isoform that is believed to play a major role in inflammation (2Vane J.R.

Despite such advances, salicylate remains a pharmacological enigma, as it inhibits prostanoid synthesis in intact cells (9Wu K.K. Sanduja R. Tsai A.L. Ferhanoglu B. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Proc. Natl.

Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11693-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that salicylate owes its anti-inflammatory effects to the inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated gene expression (12Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 13Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of NF-κB is exerted only at suprapharmacological concentrations of sodium salicylate (NaS) (>5 mm) with no effects at pharmacological concentrations (14Mitchell J.A. Saunders M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. Belvisi M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Salicylate at such high concentrations inhibits numerous cellular kinases nonspecifically (15Frantz B. O'Neill E.A. Science. 1995; 270: 2017-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our group recently demonstrated that NaS and aspirin at pharmacologically relevant concentrations equipotently inhibited COX-2 transcription (16Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5292-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and that the maximal inhibitory effect occurs in cells deprived of serum for 24 h. Because aspirin is rapidly deacetylated and converted to salicylate in vivo its action on COX-2 expression is attributed to salicylate. To elucidate the mechanism by which salicylate suppresses COX-2 transcription we evaluated the effects of NaS, at a representative therapeutic concentration, on COX-2 expression in serum-deprived G0 and serum-driven cycling human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). The results show that the inhibitory effect of salicylate on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- and interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced COX-2 transcription was confined to G0 cells. Salicylate suppressed PMA- and IL-1β-induced COX-2 promoter activity by inhibiting the binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β to its cognate site on the 5′ promoter region. By contrast, salicylate did not inhibit NF-κB binding to the COX-2 promoter or NF-κB-dependent COX-2 induction by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). HFF were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In all protocols 90–95% confluent HFF were serum-deprived for 24 h to synchronize the cells in the G0/G1 phase before treatment with serum or other stimuli. RNA isolation and Northern analysis was performed as outlined previously (16Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5292-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In brief, 25–30 μg of RNA isolated from HFF was fractionated on 1% agarose and was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. As a COX-2 probe, agarose gel-purified, full-length, 1.9-kilobase COX-2 cDNA was used. Hybridization and detection by autoradiography were performed according to a procedure reported previously (16Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing HFF with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and 0.2 mmleupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were boiled for 5 min with equal volumes of 2× gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 2 mg/ml bromophenyl blue). Nuclear extracts were prepared by a method described previously (16Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nonspecific IgGs were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk containing 1 mg/ml globulin-free bovine serum albumin before being incubated with an antibody against COX-2 (Cayman Chemical) or C/EBP isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. AP-2 and NF-κB oligonucleotides were obtained from Promega. C/EBP oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys based on the human COX-2 promoter (17Tazawa R. Xu X.M. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Wild type, 5′-GCTTACGCAATTTTTTTAAGG-3′; mutant, 5′-GCgactagAATTTTTTTAAGG-3′. The complimentary oligonucleotides were annealed and purified following the manufacturer's protocol. Each probe was end-labeled with [γ32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSA was perfomed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extract with a labeled probe (10,000 cpm; ∼10fmol) in a binding buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). To assess the specificity of DNA protein binding up to a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type or mutant oligonucleotide was added. For supershift experiments C/EBP isoform-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were applied to the mixture for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was applied to a 4% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 150 V for 90 min, and the complex was detected by autoradiography. A 5′ flanking DNA fragment −891 to +9 (−891/+9) and its deletion mutants of the human COX-2 gene were constructed into a promoterless luciferase expression vector pGL3 (Promega) as described previously (16Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5292-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Using the −891/+9 construct NF-κB mutant 1 (−447 to −438), GGGGATTCCC to attcATTCCC; mutant 2 (−222 to −213), GGGACTACCC to aattCTACCC; and the C/EBP mutant (−132 to −124), TTACGCAAT to gcgatagcT were generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. For transfection experiments, 2 μg of reporter vector mixed with 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to HFF. To optimize transfection Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced with OPTIMEM-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 6 h cells were washed twice with fresh OPTIMEM-1 and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as outlined above. After 16 h, cells were serum-starved for a period of 24 h before treatment. The expressed luciferase activity was determined in a luminometer (Bioscan Lumi/96; Bioscan Inc., Washington D. C.). We recently reported that NaS and aspirin at therapeutic concentrations (10−7 to 10−3m) equipotently suppress IL-1β- and PMA-induced COX-2 transcription in serum-deprived human endothelial cells and fibroblasts (16Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5292-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of salicylate is cell cycle-dependent, we performed experiments in HFF that were first serum-deprived for 24 h followed by the addition of 2.5% FBS to drive the cell cycle. This fibroblast model has been extensively used to characterize G0 cells, as well as cells in various phases of the cell cycle (18Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Our cell cycle analysis was consistent with previous reports in that over 90% of HFF in medium deprived of FBS for 24 h were in G0, and after 2.5% FBS treatment cells entered into S phase at 16 h, and over 50% of cells were in S phase at 24 h (19Gilroy D.W. Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Wu K.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At several time points, chosen by flow cytometry to best represent the individual phases of the cell cycle, 0 h (G0), 4 h (G1), 24 h (S), and 42 h (G2/M), cells were pretreated with a representative therapeutic concentration of NaS (10 μm) for 30 min before adding PMA (100 nm), IL-1β (1 ng/ml), or TNFα (1 ng/ml). COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were determined 2 and 4 h post-treatment by Northern and Western blot analysis, respectively. NaS inhibited COX-2 mRNA (Fig.1 A) and protein levels (Fig.1 B) induced by PMA in serum-starved G0 cells, but the inhibitory action was no longer apparent at 4, 24, and 42 h after 2.5% FBS treatment. Similarly, IL-1β-induced COX-2 protein expression was inhibited by NaS in serum-deprived G0 cells but not in cells treated with 2.5% FBS for 24 h (Fig.1 C). In contrast, TNFα-induced COX-2 protein expression was not inhibited by NaS in G0 or S phase cells (Fig.1 C). In subsequent experiments, the inhibitory effects of NaS on PMA induced expression of COX-2 at earlier time points after 2.5% FBS addition was evaluated. NaS inhibited COX-2 mRNA and protein by ∼50% in G0 cells. However, after only 1 h of exposure to 2.5% FBS, NaS was no longer able to inhibit COX-2 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, D and E). We have previously shown that NaS and aspirin inhibited PMA- or IL-1β-induced COX-2 promoter activity conferred by a core promoter fragment −891/+9 (16Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5292-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Here we show that salicylate suppressed COX-2 promoter activity in a G0-restricted manner (Fig.2). As NaS is only effective in G0 cells all subsequent experiments to determine its mechanism of action were performed in the absence of serum unless otherwise stated.Figure 2Effect of NaS on PMA-induced luciferase activity of a COX-2 promoter (−891/+9) transiently expressed in subconfluent HFF cells. The cell cycle was activated by the addition of 2.5% FBS as for Fig. 1. NaS (10 μm) was added 30 min prior to the addition of PMA (100 nm) at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h post-serum. After 6 h of treatment, luciferase activity was determined, and basal activity was subtracted. Eachbar represents mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments.

RLU, relative light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cis acting elements in the COX-2 promoter region that are required for the transcriptional inhibition by salicylate were determined using fragment −891/+9 and its deletion or site-directed mutants (17Tazawa R. Xu X.M. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) cloned into plasmid pGL3 and transiently expressed in subconfluent HFF. The transfected cells were pretreated for 30 min with NaS (10 μm) before the addition of PMA (100 nm), IL-1β (1 ng/ml), or TNFα (1 ng/ml) for 6 h at which time cells were harvested and lysed, and luciferase activity was determined. NaS retained its inhibitory action on PMA- and IL-1β-induced promoter activity by 5′ deletion mutants until the −96/+9 construct when neither PMA nor IL-1β stimulated the promoter activity (Fig. 3, A andB), whereas TNFα lost its stimulatory effect on the −362/+9 construct (Fig. 3 C). Site-directed mutation of the C/EBP site reduced PMA- and IL-1β- but not TNFα-induced promoter activity. Neither the residual promoter activity seen with PMA or IL-1β nor the promoter activity of the mutant induced by TNFα was affected by salicylate (Fig. 3 D). By contrast, site-directed mutagenesis of NF-κB sites abolished the effect of TNFα but not PMA or IL-1β (Fig. 3 E). Mutation of NF-κB sites also had no effect on salicylate inhibition of PMA- or IL-1β-induced COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 3 E). Taken together these results suggest that the C/EBP site at −132/−124 is critically involved in PMA- and IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression and salicylate suppression. NF-κB sites at −447/−438 and −222/−213 are critical for TNFα-induced COX-2 expression consistent with reported results (20Jobin C. Morteau O. Han D.S. Balfour Sartor R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, neither NF-κB site is involved in promoter induction by PMA and IL-1β or suppression by salicylate. The 5′ deletion mutation analysis suggested that the region −193 to −97, containing an AP-2 and C/EBP/NF-IL6 site, is required for PMA- or IL-1β-induced promoter activity, whereas TNFα requires the region −447 to −438 containing a putative NF-κB site for optimal activity. EMSA were performed using an AP-2, C/EBP, or NF-κB probe. AP-2 binding was unaffected by any of the stimuli (data not shown). Concordant with the reporter assays, IL-1β and PMA but not TNFα increased complex formation between C/EBP probe and nuclear extract proteins (Fig. 4 A,left panel, and B). The specificity of binding is demonstrated by the inhibition of the PMA-induced complex formation by a 5- to 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled C/EBP wild type probe but not by a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled C/EBP mutant probe (Fig.4 A, right panel). NaS significantly reduced C/EBP binding activity induced by PMA and IL-1β (Fig. 4, A andB) but not TNFα (Fig. 4 B). A structural analogue 3-OH benzoic acid failed to affect PMA-induced complex formation (Fig. 4 C). Hence, the inhibitory effect of salicylate (2-OH benzoic acid) is selective and not common to all substituted benzoic acids. The PMA-induced complex was only supershifted in the presence of an anti-C/EBPβ antibody but was unaffected by antibodies against other C/EBP isoforms (Fig.5). TNFα and IL-1β but not PMA increased NF-κB binding that was insensitive to NaS inhibition (Fig.6, left panel). The specificity of binding is demonstrated by the inhibition of the TNFα-induced complex formation by a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB wild type probe (Fig. 6, right panel). C/EBPβ full-length (46 kDa) and C/EBPα (40 kDa) proteins were expressed constitutively in nuclear extract and were not altered by PMA treatment (Fig. 7). The truncated C/EBPβ isoform liver inhibitory protein was barely detectable and was not altered by PMA treatment (data not shown). C/EBPγ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPε were undetectable (data not shown). To determine whether the increased binding is because of phosphorylation of C/EBPβ, control and PMA-treated nuclear extracts were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (10 units) for 30 min before being applied to EMSA. Alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced the complex formation in both control and PMA-treated HFF cells (Fig. 8).Figure 5Supershift assay shows complex of C/EBP β with DNA probe.

Our findings indicate that salicylate at a pharmacological concentration has no effect on NF-κB transactivation induced by TNFα, in contrast to the potent anti-NF-κB effects exerted by suprapharmacological concentrations (>5 mm). Concentrations higher than 5 mm nonspecifically inhibit many cellular kinases (15Frantz B. O'Neill E.A. Science. 1995; 270: 2017-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This renders NF-κB as an unlikely target for the pharmacological actions of salicylate. We propose that the actions of salicylate are mediated instead by inhibition of C/EBPβ binding and transactivation. Several pieces of evidence support this proposal: 1) deletion or mutation of the C/EBP site abolishes the stimulatory effect of PMA and IL-1β and concomitantly, the inhibitory effect of salicylate; (2Vane J.R. Mitchell J.A. Appleton I. Tomlinson A. Bishop-Bailey D. Croxtall J. Willoughby D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) salicylate inhibited the binding of C/EBPβ to the C/EBP site; and (3Seibert K. Zhang Y. Leahy K. Hauser S. Masferrer J. Perkins W. Lee L. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12013-12017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar) salicylate had no effect on TNFα-induced NF-κB binding or COX-2 promoter activity conferred by wild type or C/EBP mutant constructs. C/EBPβ is a pleiotropic transactivator for myriad genes involved in inflammation, cell differentiation, and the immune response (21Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this study, we have established the role of C/EBPβ in human COX-2 induction by PMA and IL-1β. C/EBPβ has been reported to be essential for COX-2 induction in murine cells in response to a number of stimuli (28Wadleigh D.J. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, salicylate blockade of C/EBPβ-mediated COX-2 expression provides a plausible explanation for the pharmacological actions of aspirin and other salicylate compounds. Furthermore, the action of salicylate may be extended to other C/EBPβ-mediated genes, and as such, our findings have a major impact on the conceptual understanding of the actions of salicylate and on new drug design and discovery. C/EBPβ is a member of the C/EBP family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors (27Wedel A. LomsZiegler-Heitbrock H.W. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It forms homodimers and heterodimers with other C/EBP isoforms to transactivate or repress promoter activity. There are several C/EBPβ isoforms comprising the full-length and three truncated forms that include liver inhibitory protein, which is considered as a dominant negative mutant of the full-length C/EBPβ (29Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In this study, the results indicate that quiescent HFF express predominantly the full-length C/EBPβ. C/EBPα was also detected, but its role in regulating COX-2 expression is unclear. C/EBPβ levels are not altered by PMA, IL-1β, or salicylate. C/EBPβ binding activity has been previously shown to be enhanced by phosphorylation mediated by several kinase pathways such as protein kinase C (30Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 6: 2554-2561Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (32Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (33Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (34Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These kinases directly or indirectly phosphorylate different threonine or serine residues suggesting multiple mechanisms for activating C/EBPβ. Many of the activities of proinflammatory mediators are mimicked by PMA that activates protein kinase C. We therefore determined whether PMA-induced C/EBPβ binding enhancement was attributable to phosphorylation by treating nuclear extracts with a general phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase), and the results confirm that PMA-stimulated C/EBPβ binding activity depends on phosphorylation of this transactivator. Our results further suggest that it is mediated via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. 2M. A. Saunders and K. K. Wu, unpublished data. It is likely that NaS blocks PMA-induced C/EBPβ binding activity by targeting a downstream kinase in the protein kinase C signaling pathway. Salicylate has been shown to effect several protein kinases that include p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (35Stevenson M.A. Zhao M.J. Asea A. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 163: 5608-5616Google Scholar), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (36Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (37Schwenger P. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8089-8094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (38Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These studies were performed using suprapharmacological concentrations of NaS, and as such, these kinases are not likely involved in the specific effects demonstrated in this study. However, a recent report demonstrated that NaS at pharmacological concentrations inhibited PMA-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (39Law B.K. Waltner-Law M.E. Entingh A.J. Chytil A. Aakre M.E. Norgaard P. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38261-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that p70 S6 kinase may occupy an important position in mediating C/EBPβ phosphorylation and increasing its binding activity and is the target of salicylate inhibition. This proposal is being investigated in our laboratory. It is intriguing that the inhibitory action of salicylate on COX-2 transcription stimulated by PMA and IL-1β is confined to serum-deprived fibroblasts. Results from our recent work (19Gilroy D.W. Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Wu K.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) show that COX-2 is expressed more abundantly in serum-starved cells than serum-treated cells suggesting that COX-2 expression is controlled by an endogenous mechanism that is operative in proliferating cells. Quiescent cells in vivo may be the major COX-2-expressing cells and play a key role in the inflammatory response. That salicylate suppresses COX-2 expression only in G0 cells is consistent with its anti-inflammatory actions in vivo. However, the mechanism that underlies the restricted efficacy of NaS is not understood. We have excluded the possibility that the lack of effect, after addition of 2.5% FBS, is because of sequestration of salicylate by serum proteins as exposure of NaS to serum prior to its addition to serum-deprived cells did not alter its inhibitory effect (data not shown). However, it is possible that after addition of 2.5% FBS there may be an alteration in the expression of C/EBP isoforms, and this alteration abrogates the inhibitory action of salicylate. Switch of C/EBP isoform expression has been shown to occur in liver cell differentiation (40Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar), but there is no published data on changes in C/EBP isoforms after serum treatment. Certain isoforms of C/EBP, such as liver inhibitory protein and C/EBP homologous protein, bind C/EBPβ to form a heterodimer and inhibits C/EBPβ binding to DNA and transactivation of the promoter (41Welm A.L. Mackey A.L. Timchenko L.T. Darlington G.J. Timchenko N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Whether these isoforms are regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner is unknown. G0-restricted salicylate action may be because of an alteration in C/EBPβ phosphorylation in cycling cells. C/EBPβ phosphorylation is probably regulated by coordinated activities of kinases and phosphatases. This delicate balance may be altered by serum or cell cycle progression. C/EBPβ is located in cytosol and translocated into the nucleus after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines (43Yin M. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Lane M.D. Chatterjee S. Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 30: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 44Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Dransfield D.T. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 48: 30356-30361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It should be interesting to determine whether this translocation process is altered by serum and cell cycle progression. Understanding why NaS is only effective in G0 cells is critical, as it will potentially provide a target for novel therapeutic compounds with broad implications for the treatment of inflammation, tissue injury, and tumor growth."

Deletion of SBE1, which is proximal to the VDRE, but not the distal SBE3 in this promoter reporter abolished TGF-β responsiveness and eliminated synergistic co-activation with vitamin D.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.-C. Verkest V., M., M. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). VDREs typically consist of at least two copies of the consensus motif, PuG(G/T)TCA, arranged as direct repeats with a three-nucleotide spacing (DR3) (5Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to spacing, small differences in the half-site sequence, and the sequence of the flanking extension of the response elements also appear to be important in determining receptor binding efficiency (Ref. 6Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and references therein). Upon binding, these receptors can either stimulate or repress transcription of target genes (7Sims N.A. White C.P. Sunn K.L. Thomas G.P. Drummond M.L. Morrison N.A. Eisman J.A. Gardiner E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1695-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), assisted by direct and indirect interaction with other transcriptional regulatory proteins. Such additional factors may be recruited by other regulatory signals, such as TGF-β, which has been shown to act in synergy with vitamin D (8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), like activin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), signals through the Smad family of intracellular transducing proteins (10Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Among the Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 are known to permit signaling by TGF-β and activin ligands (11Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, these Smad proteins heterodimerize with Smad4, the common mediator of TGF-β pathways. These complexes translocate to the nucleus where they regulate target genes either by interacting with DNA or with other transcription factors (11Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Though a palindromic Smad binding element (SBE), GTCTAGAC, was shown to interact with the Smad3 and Smad4 complex, the smaller 4-bp half-site of this SBE DNA sequence, GTCT or AGAC, has been shown to be sufficient to bind these proteins (12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hua X.X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although Smads can bind to DNA, Smad-DNA binding alone is not always sufficient for gene activation. There are now a growing number of examples in which Smads cooperate with DNA-binding partners to regulate transcription (14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This type of interaction has been demonstrated for the Mix.2, goosecoid and Xvent2 promoters where Smads interact with FAST-1, FAST-2, mixer, milk and OAZ transcription factors (12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding by Smad3, in conjunction with TFE3, PEBP2, and ATF-2 to their cognate sites, has been reported to be essential for TGF-β-dependent activation of the PAI-1,IgA, and collagenase A promoters respectively (12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these cooperativities may be involved in mediating signals for other signaling pathways, as suggested by recent studies that described a physical interaction of liganded VDR, Smad3, and SRC-1/TIF2 mediating cross-talk between vitamin D and TGF-β signaling pathways (8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar,9Yanagi Y. Suzawa M.

In the present study, we identified functional TGF-β-response elements in the human osteocalcin (hOC) gene promoter; demonstrated cross-talk between vitamin D and TGF-β signaling pathways in regulation of this promoter; and determined the molecular mechanism for synergistic activation of the hOC promoter by vitamin D and TGF-β. Reporter plasmids pOSLUC2 (−1.3 kb) and pOSLUC1 (−344 bp), of the human osteocalcin gene promoter linked upstream of the luciferase reporter of pGL-3basic have been described previously (15Issa L.L. Leong G.M. Barry J.B. Sutherland R.L. Eisman J.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). pOSLUC3 (−1.3 kb to −1111 plus −905 to −833) was created by deletion of a StuI fragment from pOSLUC2. Deletion of the PstI and SacI fragment from pOSLUC2 resulted in pOSLUC4 (−1.3 kb to −833 plus −341). pOSLUC5 (−1.3 kb to −341 plus −191) was constructed by deletion of theSacI and ApaI fragment from pOSLUC2. pOSLUC6 was created by cloning in an osteocalcin promoter PCR fragment (forward primer −1337 to −1311 with MluI 5′ overhang and reverse primer −475 to −500 with XhoI 5′ overhang) into the pGL-3 promoter vector. The p3TP-Lux reporter, which contains SBEs from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene in front of the luciferase reporter, was a kind gift from Dr. J. Massague (16Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to human osteocalcin VDRE (−507 to −470 or −515 to −484) or rat osteocalcin VDRE (−515 to −484) were cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter of pGL-3 promoter vector to produce hVDREluc and rVDREluc respectively. hVDRE-3TPlux was created by inserting the hVDREs in front of the SBEs from the p3TP-Lux plasmid. Insertion of 450 bp fragment, which do not contain known SBEs from pSG5 expression vector, between VDRE and SBEs of hVDRE-3TPlux into XhoI site resulted in the V450T reporter plasmid. VDR expression vector, mVDR-pSG5 and FLAG-Smad2,3,4/pcDNA3 plasmids that express Smad2, 3, or 4 with N-terminal FLAG tags have been described elsewhere (15Issa L.L. Leong G.M. Barry J.B.

COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated at ∼30% confluence in 24-well plates and the following day were transfected using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) with 250 ng/well of reporter plasmid and 50 ng of the VDR or Smad expression plasmid. After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 2% charcoal stripped fetal calf serum containing medium was added having either 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (Hoffman-LaRoche) or vehicle (isopropyl alcohol, final conc. 0.01%) and/or TGF-β (1 ng/ml) (Sigma, Saint Louis, MI) or vehicle (4 nm HCl in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Following incubation for 16 h, cells were lysed with 2× Promegalysis buffer, and luciferase assays were performed in triplicate with the firefly luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and measured using a Berthold LB953 Autolumat luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Each experimental condition was measured in triplicates, and the values given represent the mean ± S.D. from two to three experiments. Oligonucleotides were endlabeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA binding reactions of 20 μl were carried out in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10% (W/V) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 400 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 75 mm KCl, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1–0.3 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotide, and 2 μl of Smad3 and Smad4 proteins transcribed and translated in vitro, in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions were performed in room temperature for 20 min. Free and bound DNA were separated on 4% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:0.5) gels, which were run at a constant voltage of 250 V in 22 mm Tris-borate, 0.5 mm EDTA (6Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The modulatory effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β signaling on the human osteocalcin promoter were analyzed by transient transfections into COS1 cells using the pOSLUC2 reporter and VDR expression plasmid. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 transactivated the pOSLUC2 reporter activity by 6-fold whereas TGF-β alone augmented the reporter activity 2-fold (Fig. 1). Both ligands, produced a synergistic effect (10-fold induction). This synergy was specific to the pOSLUC2 reporter, because these two ligands together or singly did not significantly alter transcriptional activity of pOSLUC1, which lacks 960 bp of distal 5′ DNA sequence from the human osteocalcin promoter including the VDRE (15Issa L.L. Leong G.M. Barry J.B. Sutherland R.L. Eisman J.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Smad3 and Smad2, but not BMP Smads (Smad1 or Smad5), activated the osteocalcin promoter reporter (data not shown), both in the absence and presence of TGF-β. Augmentation of reporter activity was greater with Smad3, suggesting a putative Smad3 binding site conferred the TGF-β signal for this promoter. Overexpression of Smads 3 and 4 constitutively activated basal promoter activity mimicking TGF-β signaling, as has been reported for other well characterized TGF-β responsive promoters (11Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the synergistic activity observed in our previous experiment was in fact mediated through the VDRE (4Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.-C. Verkest V., M., M. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), the hVDREluc reporter was co-transfected with a VDR expression plasmid into COS1 cells. Whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased the reporter activity 10-fold, TGF-β did not affect reporter activity (Fig. 2 A), nor was there any synergy between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β, as observed in the case of the pOSLUC2 reporter. As the DR3 VDRE in the human osteocalcin promoter overlaps a DR6 VDRE and an AP1 site, testing of these overlapping elements (−515 to −484) was carried out in a luciferase reporter construct. This construct also responded to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 but did not respond to TGF-β, and there was no synergy between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3and TGF-β (Fig. 2 B). Comparable experiments performed with the rVDREluc reporter had a similar 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 but no response to TGF-β and no synergy between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β signals, irrespective of nucleotide differences in human and rat VDREs (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that VDRE alone is not sufficient to mediate the synergy. Possible effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3on TGF-β transcriptional activation were tested on a heterologous reporter construct carrying the well characterized TRE from thePAI-1 gene (p3TP-Lux) in COS1 cells (16Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Whereas TGF-β activated the reporter in these cells 7-fold, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 had no effect on the basal activity of the reporter (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, TGF-β-activated transcription was not augmented by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Fig. 3 A). This result suggests that the TRE alone is incapable of converging vitamin D and TGF-β signaling pathways. To explore whether the synergy by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β pathways required concomitant binding of both VDR and Smad to their separate cognate elements, the hVDRE-3TPlux reporter plasmid, which contains both respective response elements, was co-transfected with VDR expression plasmid in COS1 cells. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 or TGF-β alone activated this reporter approximately by 10-fold (Fig.3 B). Importantly, hVDRE-3TPlux reporter responded synergistically to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β (45-fold), suggesting both binding sites are needed to mediate the synergy (Fig. 3 B). Sequence analysis of the human osteocalcin promoter identified three regions: −415 to −353 (SBE1); −313 to −228 (SBE2); and −1027 to −997 (SBE3); each of which contains three copies of GTCT or its reverse complement AGAC, an optimal target/binding site for Smad3 and Smad4 (13Hua X.X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays using Smad3 and Smad4 proteins, transcribed and translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, were used to examine DNA binding activity of these putative SBEs as well as the PE2 fragment of the PAI-1 promoter (13Hua X.X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as a positive Smad binding control. SBE1 and SBE3 formed complexes similar to PE2 (Fig. 4) whereas there was no complex formation with SBE2 (data not shown). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate alone did not form any complexes with these DNA probes (data not shown). DNA binding specificity of complexes formed with DNA probes, was examined using cold DNA probes as competitors. Both SBE1 and SBE3 inhibited complex formation. However the PE2 element (−586 to −551) from the PAI-1 promoter, which contained three AGAC motifs, moderately inhibited the complex formation with either SBE1 or SBE3. To determine functional significance of the Smad binding to the potential SBEs in the promoter, we made deletions of larger regions from the pOSLUC2 (−1.3 kb) that removed SBE2, SBE1, and/or SBE3 (pOSLUC3–6). Cotransfection of Smad3 and Smad4 expression vectors with reporter plasmids pOSLUC1-6 augmented basal and TGF-β-dependent activity (Fig.5). The highest activation was observed with the wild-type promoter reporter, pOSLUC2. Deletion of SBE1 (pOSLUC4) greatly affected Smad3-mediated augmentation whereas a moderate reduction was observed with the deletion of SBE3 (pOSLUC3), both of which reflected the previous binding studies that SBE1 and SBE3 were capable of binding to Smad3 and Smad4. Deletion of SBE2 (pOSLUC5), which did not bind with Smad3 and Smad4 in the gel shift assay (data not shown), did not affect the reporter activity. Combined deletion of SBE1 and SBE3 (pOSLUC1) or SBE1 and SBE2 (pOSLUC6) also resulted in marked loss of reporter activity. These results suggest that the Smad-mediated activity was largely through the SBE1. The role of the spacing between VDRE and TRE in the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β synergy was examined using V450T reporter plasmid. This construct, containing both VDRE and TRE separated by 450 bp, was co-transfected with VDR expression plasmid in COS1 cells. This reporter activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or TGF-β alone or in combination was remarkably reduced (Fig.6) in comparision to the parent hVDRE-3TPlux reporter plasmid (Fig. 3 B). The level of reduced synergy conferred by V450T was comparable with pOSLUC6 reporter that has the VDRE and SBE3 at a similar 450-bp distance. This result demonstrated that synergy by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β signaling, conferred via their respective transducers VDR and Smad3, only occurred through binding to VDRE and TRE located in the close proximity in the target promoter. It was previously demonstrated that the 40-amino acid N-terminally truncated Smad3 did not physically interact with VDR in either GST pull-down assays or the mammalian two-hybrid system, whereas the 20-amino acid N-terminally truncated Smad3 retained such abilities (8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We examined whether these Smad3 mutants together with VDR were capable of synergistically activating the hVDRE-3TPlux reporter. The wild-type Smad3 and Smad3-(21–435), capable of transducing TGF-β signal, together with VDR synergistically transactivated this reporter (Fig. 7). Smad3-(41–345) failed to mediate TGF-β signaling, and with VDR, was unable to transactivate synergistically as Smad3, suggesting that a competent Smad3 in addition to separate and distinct binding sites is also required for the synergy. DNA-binding nuclear factors interact with one another and with cofactors to form complex networks of DNA-protein-protein interactions for transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells (5Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Transcription regulatory regions of eukaryotic gene promoters generally consist of clusters of transcription factor-binding sites that coordinate responses to combinations of signaling molecules and different transcription factors utilize a variety of means to promote or repress target genes. (19Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Osteocalcin gene expression is facilitated by overlapping and contiguous regulatory elements including a functional VDRE in the distal promoter region (4Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.-C. Verkest V., M., M. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 20Ducy P. Karsenty G.

Regulatory factors, including VDR, Cbfa-1, AP-1 factors, and homeodomain proteins act directly, and BMPs and TGF-β act indirectly to mediate commitment to the osteoblastic cell lineage and regulation of the osteocalcin promoter (22Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30 Suppl. 31: 62-72Crossref Google Scholar, 23Rodan G.A. Harada S. Cell. 1997; 89: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Only two reports to date describe transcriptional regulation through protein-protein interaction involving Smad3 and nuclear hormone receptors (8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 24Song C.Z. Tian X. Gelehrter T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Whereas Yanagisawa et al. (8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) reported that activation by VDR, but not other receptors (oestrogen receptor α, androgen receptor, GR, retinoic acid receptor, and RXR), was affected by the treatment with TGF-β, Song et al. (24Song C.Z. Tian X. Gelehrter T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) found that Smad3 was the direct target for repression by the GR on a type-1 PAI-1 gene promoter. They provided evidence for GR-Smad3 interaction in vivo and in vitro, although they could not rule out the possibility that other proteins might have mediated the interaction. A structure/function analysis of the hOC promoter was initiated to explore its synergistic activation by vitamin D and TGF-β (Fig. 1). Recently it has been reported that Smad3, a downstream component of the TGF-β signaling pathway, acts as a coactivator of VDR potentiating its ligand-induced transactivation (8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar,9Yanagi Y. Suzawa M. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12971-12974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested the VDRE from the hOC promoter as a separate response element in the context of a minimal heterologous promoter. There was no synergy between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β signals through this VDRE (Fig.2 A). In addition, the slightly longer VDRE, which contained both DR6 and DR3 spacing, exhibited no synergy in transient transfection studies in COS-1 cells by these signals (Fig.2 B). A rat osteocalcin DR3-type of VDRE placed in heterologous context also did not mediate synergistic effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β (Fig. 2 C). These results suggested that nucleotide differences in different minimal VDREs cannot explain the failure to observe TGF-β-mediated reporter activity. In addition, similar results were obtained in three separate cell lineages, suggesting differences in cellular context could not be responsible for the disparity of the results. These data are not consistent with direct protein-protein interaction as the sole mode of action to explain the synergy, and therefore are in sharp contrast to the findings of Yanagisawa et al.(8, 9) who reported that the VDRE alone was sufficient for convergence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β signaling pathways. Disparity between our results and previously reported results may be attributed to the design of the reporter construct used in the transient transfection studies. Constructs in Ref. 8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar derived from pGCAT (25Ebihara K. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Suzawa M. Uematsu Y. Yoshizawa T. Ono T. Harada H. Matsuda K. Hasegawa T. Masushige S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and contained a synthetic oligonucleotide insert withHindIII and XbaI sites. This XbaI site follows GT nucleotide of the parental plasmid sequence and creates a DNA sequence 5′-GTCT-3′, which has been defined as a Smad box (12Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could form part of a cryptic SBE in close proximity to the VDRE. Potentially, the presence of these two closely spaced sites could be mediating the synergy between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF-β signals in their reporter construct. Irrespective of these reasons, in our studies, convergence of vitamin D and TGF-β signaling required both specific DNA response elements in both heterologous promoter model constructs and in the human osteocalcin promoter. The ability of the Smad3-Smad4 complex alone or in the presence of TGF-β to transactivate the OSLUC2 reporter is consistent with the existence of Smad binding sites in this promoter. This led us to test the activation of reporters containing both a VDRE (human) and a cluster of TGF-β response elements from the PAI-1 gene, upstream of the SV40 promoter. Transient transfection studies with these reporter constructs recreated the synergy between vitamin D and TGF-β signals, with activation by vitamin D comparable with the induction of hVDREluc reporter (Fig. 2 A), and TGF-β stimulated activation comparable with that of the standard TGF-β responsive reporter p3TP-Lux (Fig. 3 A). Of three potential SBE clusters in the osteocalcin promoter, two (SBE1 and SBE3) bound to Smad3 and Smad4 proteins in a gel shift assay (Fig. 4). Deletion of these two putative regions separately or together reduced TGF-β-mediated reporter activity confirming their functional role (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that the convergence of TGF-β and vitamin D signaling does not take place in the absence of either VDRE or TRE. In agreement with these data, a Smad3-Smad4 complex and an AP-1 complex have been reported to synergize in transcriptional activation of the c-jun promoter by binding to separate sites 120 bp apart (26Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Similarly, transcriptional cooperativity between c-Jun and Smad3 at the AP-1 binding site of the collagenase I promoter also required the interaction of c-Jun and Smad3 with DNA (27Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38802-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several other recent reports point to cross-talk between Smad proteins and transcription factors such as TFE3, FAST-1, SP1, CREB, and Tinman in the expression of various TGF-β-inducible genes (Ref. 13Hua X.X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholarand references therein). It has been proposed that the number of SBEs as well as discrete spacer segments between SBEs and/or Smad-partner transcription factor binding site(s) will also be critical for the specificity of TGF-β-induced transcription of these promoters (13Hua X.X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our study also found that the synergy by vitamin D and TGF-β was reduced when the spacing between VDRE and TRE was extended (Fig.6). The promoter studies further indicate that simultaneous binding of VDR and Smad3 to their cognate sequences (Fig. 3 B) and possibly a direct interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 7), are both required for the convergence of the vitamin D and TGF-β signals. The Smad3-(41–345) construct failed to mediate TGF-β signaling through the 3TPlux reporter (data not shown) suggesting that this Smad3 mutant is functionally inert. The same N-terminal deletion mutant failed to interact with VDR (8Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Our study also found that this mutant was unable to transactivate synergistically with VDR through hVDRE-3TPlux reporter, therefore we could not positively conclude that a direct VDR-Smad3 interaction was involved in the cross-talk between these regulatory pathways. In the present study we demonstrated that the VDRE-containinghOC gene promoter contains two functional Smad3 binding elements through which the TGF-β and vitamin D signaling pathways converge. Our data thus strongly suggest that cross-talk between these two signaling pathways requires the presence in the promoter of both respective response elements in close proximity. These data support the concept of specific response elements being required to transduce both single agents and to integrate the synergistic activation of hormone responsive genes. p3TP-Lux luciferase reporter plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. J.

https://openalex.org/W1531819701,"Chromatin plays an important role in regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Chromatin is composed of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome core (consisting of two copies of the well conserved histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and a more variable linker histone H1. Various in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated histone H1 as a repressor of gene expression or as an activator, but its exact role is still unclear. Sequencing of the yeast genome has led to the identification of a putative histone H1 gene. Biochemical studies demonstrated that yeast does indeed possess abona fide histone H1. However, deletion of the unique yeast H1 gene is not associated with any phenotypes, and it was questioned whether it plays any role. To address this issue, we performed whole-genome microarray analysis to identify genes that are affected by H1 removal. Surprisingly, deletion of the gene encoding histone H1 does not result in increased gene expression but rather in a modest reduction. Northern blot analysis of selected genes confirmed the results obtained with the microarray analysis. A similar effect was observed with an integrated lacZ reporter. Thus, our data demonstrate that removal of yeast histone H1 only results in decreased gene expression. Chromatin plays an important role in regulating eukaryotic gene expression.

Thus, our data demonstrate that removal of yeast histone H1 only results in decreased gene expression. In recent years, numerous studies have shown a functional role of chromatin in regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Nucleosomes are the basic repeating unit of chromatin. The nucleosome core is composed of DNA wrapped around an octamer composed of two copies of each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6986) Google Scholar, 2Wolffe A. Chromatin, Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). In addition, a linker histone H1 is thought to interact with the DNA located between nucleosome cores (3Ramakrishnan V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 83-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Core histones are highly conserved between species ranging from yeast to human. Histones have been shown to repress transcription by preventing access of transcription factors to target DNA sequences. Core histones are subject to various modifications including acetylation. A number of complexes with histone acetyltransferase activity have been characterized (reviewed in Refs.4Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 5Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 6Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). How histone acetylation results in increased transcription is not clear. One model states that acetylation of core histone tails loosens the interaction with DNA, resulting in easier access of the transcriptional machinery and leading to increased gene transcription (5Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, there is also growing evidence that histone acetylation (and other modifications) may serve as signals for interaction with other proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6675) Google Scholar). Conversely, other complexes have been shown to possess histone deacetylase activity and are involved in repression of gene expression (6Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Thus, a relatively clear picture of the role of core histones along with complexes involved in core histone modification has emerged in recent years. Linker histones are less conserved throughout evolution when compared with core histones. Moreover, the location of linker histone H1 and its role in regulating gene expression are less clear (reviewed in Ref. 8Travers A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 4-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The addition of H1 has been shown to inhibit transcription in vitro (9Croston G.E. Kerrigan L.A. Lira L.M. Marshak D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but no effect of H1 was observed in other studies (10Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,11Howe L. Iskandar M. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11625-11629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The deletion of Tetrahymena H1 does not result in global alteration of transcription but rather in selective decreased and increased gene expression in vivo (12Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of the unique H1 gene in Aspergillus nidulans does not result in any apparent phenotype (13Ramon A. Muro-Pastor M.I. Scazzocchio C. Gonzalez R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). InXenopus oocytes, overexpression of H1 results in repression of the oocyte 5 S rRNA gene but has no effect on somatic 5 S rRNA (14Kandolf H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7257-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,15Belikov S. Karpov V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the testis-specific histone H1t do not show any defect in spermatogenesis. H1t-deficient germ cells show a normal H1 to nucleosome ratio, perhaps because of compensation by other H1 isoforms (16Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a fact that could account for the absence of a phenotype. Deletion of the genes encoding other H1 isoforms does not lead to any apparent phenotype in mice or chicken cells (17Sirotkin A.M. Edelmann W. Cheng G. Klein-Szanto A. Kucherlapati R. Skoultchi A.I.

For many years, there has been no evidence for the existence of histone H1 in yeast. This was in agreement with the unusually short nucleosomal repeat length observed in this organism (20Horgen P.A. Silver J.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1978; 32: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, sequencing of the yeast genome revealed a unique open reading frame (ORF)1 encoding a putative H1 gene (21Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 287-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recombinant yeast H1 was shown to behave like H1 found in higher eukaryotes because it forms a stable ternary complex with a reconstituted core dinucleosome in vitro (23Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, a fusion of H1 and the green fluorescent protein is localized in the nucleus (22Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Deletion of the H1 gene is not lethal in yeast and does not result in any apparent phenotype such as slower growth, alteration in telomeric silencing, mating, sporulation, or induction of gene expression (22Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L.

Genet. 1997; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, upon removal of histone H1, the nucleosomal repeat length is unchanged in yeast and in A. nidulans (13Ramon A. Muro-Pastor M.I. Scazzocchio C. Gonzalez R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These results raise the question of whether histone H1 plays any role in regulating gene expression in yeast. To address this issue, we performed whole-genome microarray analysis of yeast cells carrying a deletion of the H1 gene. Strikingly, our analysis did not provide any evidence for increased expression of any gene because of the removal of histone H1. Unexpectedly, we observed rather an overall (but modest) decrease of gene expression with 27 genes affected by a factor of 2 or more. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are derived from BY4741 or BY4742 (25Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar) and were obtained from H. Bussey (Saccharomyces deletion project, Research Genetics strains 2125 and 12125, hereafter referred to as Δhho1a and Δhho1α). Yeast cells were grown in rich medium (YPD (26Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar)) to an A600 of 0.8–1.0. for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated with the hot phenol procedure (27Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). RNA was further purified with Qiagen columns according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA labeling and hybridization were performed exactly as described (28Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. MacGregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35506-35511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Custom-made yeast whole-genome microarrays (>6200 yeast ORFs) were obtained from the Microarray Center at the Ontario Cancer Institute (Toronto, Canada). Scanning and quantification were performed exactly as described (29Traven A. Wong J.M.S. Xu D. Sopta M. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4020-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, chip A was hybridized with a mixture of wild type cDNA labeled with Cy3 (WT-Cy3) and Cy5 (WT-Cy5); chip B, a mixture of WT-Cy3 and Δhho1-Cy5; chip C, a mixture of Δhho1-Cy3 and WT-Cy5; chip D, a mixture of Δhho1-Cy3 and Δhho1-Cy5. The ratio of Δhho1/WT for each ORF obtained from chips B and C was normalized with the corresponding ratio of the same ORF from chips A and D. Because each ORF is duplicated on the same chip, four ratios obtained from chips B and C were normalized individually with the four ratios obtained from chips A and D; i.e. 16 values were obtained for each ORF. Moreover, the results presented in Table I are an average of two independent experiments performed with independent RNA preparations.Table IList of the genes affected by removal of histone H1Systematic nameGeneGene productExpression (Δhhol/WT)Secretory pathwayYDR238CSEC26Vesicle coat component0.47YGL022WSTT3Integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein oligosaccharyltransferase complex subunit (putative)0.47YFL031WHAC1Transcription factor that is required for the unfolded protein response pathway0.48YPR181CSEC23GTPase-activating protein0.51YGL137WSEC27Yeast coatomer β′ subunit (involved in endoplasmic-to-Golgi protein trafficking)0.52YDR432WNPL3Involved as a protein carrier in mRNA export; involved in mitochondrial protein targeting0.53YLR378CSEC61Membrane component of ER protein translocation apparatus0.53TranslationYOR133WEFT1Translation elongation factor 10.41YPL237WSUI3Translation initiation factor eIF-2 β subunit0.44YDR385WEFT2Translation elongation factor 20.46YLR249WYEF3Translation elongation factor 30.50YOR361CPRT1Translation initiation factor eIF3 subunit0.51Heat shock responseYPL240CHSP82Heat shock protein 90; mammalian Hsp90 homolog0.47YPL106CSSE1Hsp70 family member0.53VacuoleYMR297WPRC1Carboxypeptidase Y (proteinase C)0.43YBR286WAPE3Vacuolar aminopeptidase yscIII0.49YKL103CLAP4Vacuolar aminopeptidase ysc10.53MetabolismYMR205CPFK2Phosphofructokinase (glycolysis)0.33YPR159WKRE6β-glucan synthase (putative)0.35YBL099WATP1Mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase α subunit0.41YMR105CPGM2Phosphoglucomutase0.43YMR250WGAD1Glutamate decarboxylase0.45YLR304CACO1Aconitase (mitochondrial)0.45YPR160WGPH1Glycogen phosphorylase0.45YGR240CPFK1Phosphofructokinase α subunit (glycolysis)0.46YEL011WGLC31,4-Glucan-6-(1,4-glucano)-transferase0.46YOR374WALD4Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase0.51YLR258WGSY2Glycogen synthase (UDP-glucose-starch glucosyltransferase)0.51YPL262WFUM1Fumarase (converts 1-malate to fumarate as part of the trichloroacetic acid cycle)0.52YOL059WGPD2Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase0.53YDL171CGLT1Glutamate synthase (NADPH)0.53YMR189WGCV2Glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)0.54MiscellaneousYGL008CPMA1Plasma membrane H+-ATPase0.31YFL032WUnknown0.36YLR379WUnknown0.43YHR027CRPN126 S proteasome PA700 subunit0.43YMR092CAIP1Actin cortical patch component0.47YGR279CSCW4Soluble cell wall protein0.48YJL157CFAR1Cdc28p kinase inhibitor0.50YLR232WUnknown0.50YPL098CUnknown0.52YBL100CUnknown0.52YPR019WCDC54Essential for initiation of DNA replication; homolog of Saccharomyces pombe CDC210.52YMR229CRRP5Required for processing of pre-rRNA0.52YPL105CUnknown0.52YDR508CGNP1High affinity glutamine permease0.53YML072CUnknown0.53YOR086CUnknown0.53YPL036WPMA2Plasma membrane ATPase0.53YBR287WUnknown0.53YGR281WYOR1ABC transporter0.54Genes whose mRNA levels are most affected by deletion of theHHO1 gene are listed according to functional categories.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar. Southern and Northern blot analysis were done according to standard procedures (31). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 1 m NaCl, 2.8× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate. The probe for Southern blot analysis of the deletion of the HHO1 gene was obtained by PCR amplification of the promoter region of theHHO1 gene with genomic DNA and the primers CGGGATCCTTATTGCCGGTTACTGAACT and GGAATTCATCAGGTGCCCATAAATAAC. The PCR product was cut with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene) cut with the same enzymes. AHpaI-HpaI fragment of the lacZ gene was used as a probe to verify proper integration of the EFT1reporter (see below). Probes for Northern blot analysis were obtained by PCR amplification of specific open reading frames using genomic DNA and the following oligos: SSE1 gene, CGGGATCCATGAGTACTCCATTTGGTTTAG and GGAATTCCAGCAGCAGTTAGAATTCTGT;PMA1 gene, CGGGATCCCCAAGCTGGTTCTATTGTCG and AGACAGGGTCAAATGGATGGAATT; EFT1 gene, CGGGATCCATGGTTGCTTTCACTGTTGA and GGAATTCTCTTAGCATATCTGGTGGCG. The PCR products were cut with EcoRI andBamHI and subcloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene) cut with the same enzymes. Fragments were gel-purified and randomly labeled (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for Northern blot analysis. An EFT1 reporter was constructed by amplifying its promoter using genomic DNA isolated from strain YPH499 (33Ha N. Hellauer K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the following oligos: ATCGACTCGAGTCACGTCCAACATGATTATC and CGGGATCCCATTTTTATCTGTTATTAAAAATTCTTGGG. The PCR product was cut with XhoI and BamHI and subcloned into plasmid p178MB (a high copy plasmid with a URA3 selection marker (34Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) cut with BamHI and XhoI to give EFT1-lacZ-2 μm. The reporter contains about 700 base pairs of promoter sequences relative to the ATG. The ATG of the promoter is used to initiate translation of thelacZ gene. A reporter for chromosomal integration was obtained by deleting 2-μm sequences by cutting withHindIII and religating the backbone to giveEFT1-lacZ-IP. The resulting plasmid was linearized by cutting at the unique ApaI site located in theURA3 marker. DNA was transformed into BY4741 or Δhho1a and colonies selected on plates lacking uracil. Proper integration of the reporter was verified by Southern blot analysis. Strains BY4741 and Δhho1a were also transformed withEFT1-lacZ-2 μm. Colonies were grown overnight in YPD and diluted 2000-fold in minimal medium (SD, Ref. 26Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and adenine. β-Galactosidase assays were performed with permeabilized cells (35Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Values are the average of at least three independent experiments performed at least in duplicate. In our study, we used a wild type yeast haploid strain and strains (either MATa or MATα) carrying a deletion of the entire open reading frame of the HHO1 gene encoding histone H1. The deletions were confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1). Wild type and Δhho1 strains were grown in rich medium, and RNA was isolated for microarray analysis. An analysis was done on 6216 genes and is an average of two independent experiments performed with duplicate genomes. Although H1 is thought to be a repressor of transcription, no significant increase (more than 50%) in gene expression was detected in cells lacking H1 (Fig.2). Similar results were obtained with a strain of the opposite mating type (Δhho1α, data not shown). These results are in agreement with the fact that no changes in telomeric silencing were observed in a Δhho1strain (23Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, our whole-genome analysis does not provide any evidence for the involvement of yeast H1 in repressing RNA polymerase II transcription. Our data point rather to a slight and general decrease of transcription in cells lacking histone H1 (Fig. 2). This effect is modest because most genes show a less than 2-fold reduction in mRNA levels. Only about 27 genes showed reduced mRNA levels of more than 2-fold (Table I). The modest effect of H1 removal on mRNA levels may explain the absence of any growth defect in cells lacking H1.Figure 2Effect of histone H1 removal on overall mRNA levels. A summary of the microarray analysis performed with strains BY4741 and Δhho1a (see “Material and Methods”). The number of genes is given on the leftrelative to their expression in the Δhho1a strain as compared with the wild type strain (mRNA levels Δhho1a/WT strain)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Table I provides a list of the genes that were most sensitive to H1 removal. We could not assign these genes to a common functional class. For example, genes with decreased mRNA levels in the Δhho1 strain include EFT1, an elongation factor; PFK2, a phosphofructokinase; APE3, a vacuolar aminopeptidase; YLR232W, a gene of unknown function. In addition, there was no correlation between the level of expression and the genes affected by the HHO1 knockout. For example, PMA1 has 43 mRNA molecules/cell;PFK2, 6.8 molecules/cell; and PGM2, 0.3 molecules/cell (36Barra J.L. Rhounim L. Rossignol J.L. Faugeron G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, there was no apparent clustering of the genes with reduced mRNA levels in the Δhho1 strain. For example, there was no clustering for these genes near the telomeres or the centromeres of the chromosomes (data not shown). In summary, our whole-genome microarray analysis showed that removal of histone H1 has modest effects on steady-state mRNA levels with about 27 genes being affected by a factor of 2 or more. To confirm these results, we performed Northern blot analysis on a few selected genes. RNA was isolated from a wild type strain and a strain carrying a deletion of the HHO1 gene. As expected from the microarray analysis, decreased mRNA levels for the genesEFT1, SSE1, and PMA1 were observed in the Δhho1 strain (Fig. 3). The EFT1 and the SSE1 probes cross-hybridized with ribosomal RNA, thus providing an internal control for equal loading and transfer of RNA isolated for the wild type and knockout strains (Fig. 3). PhosphorImager analysis showed that mRNA levels are reduced about 2-fold for SSE1, EFT1,and PMA1 in cells lacking H1. These values are in good agreement with those obtained by microarray analysis (Table I). The reduced mRNA levels of these specific genes could be because of mRNA destabilization or decreased transcription. To test whether the effect is at the transcriptional level, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing about 700 base pairs of promoter sequences of theEFT1 gene (including the natural ATG) fused to thelacZ gene. The activity of the integrated EFT1reporter was reduced about 3-fold in the Δhho1 strain (Table II), in agreement with the microarray analysis (Table I). Even though the lacZ fusion contains the 5′-untranslated region of the EFT1 mRNA, it is very likely that the reduced activity is because of decreased transcription and not mRNA destabilization. Moreover, the data show that the effect of histone H1 on activity of the EFT1promoter does not depend on a specific chromosomal location.Table IIβ-Galactosidase activity of reporters in wild type and Δhho1strains.ReporterStrainWild typeΔhholaEFT1integrated13.4 ± 4.04.0 ± 1.3EFT1 high copy (2 μm)6.4 ± 1.94.6 ± 1.2β-Galactosidase activity was measured in yeast strains BY4741 and Δhho1 a transformed with the high copy reporter EFT1-lacZ-2μ or with an EFT1 reporter integrated at the URA3 locus as described under “Material and Methods”. β-Galactosidase units and S.D. are given on the right panel.

Interestingly, no significant difference of the EFT1promoter activity could be detected between the wild type and Δhho1 strains when assayed with a high copy episomal reporter (Table II). This difference may be due to a variation in the copy number of the 2-μm plasmid between wild type and Δhho1 strains or a difference in the chromatin structure of the integrated and episomal EFT1 reporters. In this study, we have performed whole-genome analysis of yeast cells carrying a deletion of the HHO1 gene that encodes histone H1. Results show a slight decrease of expression for the majority of the yeast genes. However, only a small fraction of the genes (27 of 6216) had mRNA levels reduced by 2-fold or more. This subtle (but significant) effect of histone H1 likely explains why previous analyses have failed to detect any phenotype (22Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol.

Similarly, no variation in the expression of a limited number of tested genes was observed with the exception of CYC1 (see below) (22Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol.

Importantly, we observe only a slight increase (less than 50%) in expression for a small number of genes. Thus, in yeast, H1 is not a general repressor of gene expression. Studies performed in Tetrahymena thermophila have shown previously that deletion of the gene encoding histone H1 is not lethal and does result in global changes of transcription as assayed by measuring the overall RNA content. However, both increases in basal expression (but not activated transcription) and decreases in gene expression were observed in cells lacking H1 (12Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Similarly, no phenotype is observed in A. nidulans lacking H1 (13Ramon A. Muro-Pastor M.I. Scazzocchio C. Gonzalez R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, H1 in Ascobulus immersus is essential for long life span but not early vegetative growth (37Wyrick J.J. Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Causton H.C. Shore D. Grunstein M. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Finding a role for H1 in higher eukaryotes may be complicated by the presence of many isoforms. For example, knockout of the testis-specificH1t does not result in an H1 imbalance, because of the presence of other H1 subtypes, and does not result in any obvious phenotype (16Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, the nonessential histones H1 in yeast andTetrahymena are more divergent than their mammalian counterparts. For example, Tetrahymena has an unusually small H1 without a globular domain. In contrast, yeast H1 has two putative globular domains unlike mammalian H1 (21Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 287-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, although A. nidulans has a typical H1, its absence does not result in any apparent phenotype (13Ramon A. Muro-Pastor M.I. Scazzocchio C. Gonzalez R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, H1 may perform more specialized functions in these organisms. For example, a majority of yeast genes are expressed under normal growth conditions. This may explain the differences in the role and the primary structure of H1 in yeast as compared with higher eukaryotes. Our studies point to an effect of yeast H1 on a rather limited number of genes. We do not observe any obvious common feature for these genes. For example, they perform different functions such as translation (e.g. EFT1, EFT2, SUI3,YEF3), metabolism (PFK1, PFK2,GPH1, GAD1), and heat shock response (HSP82, SSE1). Reduced mRNA levels are observed for the gene products of the secretory pathway likeSEC26, HAC1 (a transcription factor required for the unfolded protein response pathway), SEC23,SEC27, and SEC61. However, we did not observe increased sensitivity of a Δhho1 strain to stress induced by the addition of dithiothreitol to plates or to the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. 2K. Hellauer, E. Sirard, and B. Turcotte, unpublished results. Similarly, reduced mRNA levels of heat shock genes HSP82and SSE1 at normal growth temperature (30 °C) does not result in sensitivity of the Δhho1 strain to high temperatures as assayed at 37 °C and 45 °C.2 Moreover, the expression levels of genes affected by H1 vary over a wide range (0.3–43 molecules/cell) (36Barra J.L. Rhounim L. Rossignol J.L. Faugeron G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, H1 is not specifically implicated in the activation of genes with, for example, a low transcription rate. In addition, there is no correlation between dependence on the chromatin remodeling complexes SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gnc5-acetyltransferase) or SWI/SNF (36Barra J.L. Rhounim L. Rossignol J.L. Faugeron G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and H1. Finally, there is no specific location of these genes near the telomeres or the centromeres, unlike what is observed for H4 (38Puig S. Matallana E. Perez-Ortin J.E. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This finding is in agreement with our observation that a lacZ reporter driven by the EFT1 promoter shows decreased β-galactosidase activity in Δhho1 cells when integrated at the URA3 locus. What is the mechanism of action of histone H1? Our study did not include genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I and III. However, given the absence of growth differences in minimal media (24Escher D. Schaffner W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that altered transcription by RNA polymerase I or III could account for the decreased expression of the genes observed in a HHO1knockout strain. Yeast studies have shown that H1 has no effect on nucleosome positioning on the POT1 and theYIL161W genes (38), which are not affected by H1 removal according to our microarray analysis. Similarly, nucleosome positioning is independent of histone H1 in Tetrahymena (39Karrer K.M. VanNuland T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33020-33024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We observed decreased expression of EFT1 irrespective of its chromosomal location (Table II). However, the effect of H1 deletion was not observed with an EFT1-lacZ reporter present on a 2-μm plasmid (Table II). This finding is somewhat surprising because high copy reporters generally behave like endogenous genes (2Wolffe A. Chromatin, Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). We do not know the basis for the difference between the results obtained with integrated and episomal reporters. No difference in expression of the CYC1 gene was observed with our microarray analysis. However, using a low copy episomalCYC1-lacZ reporter, increased β-galactosidase activity (2.5-fold) was observed in a Δhho1 strain (22Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, the CYC1 promoter present on an episomal plasmid may not behave like the endogenous gene, as observed for EFT1. Decreased activity with the EFT1 gene is not due to ORF sequences because the EFT1 promoter linked to thelacZ gene and integrated at the URA3 locus (or episomal reporters) behaved like the natural gene. It is possible that the affected genes have an unusual nucleosomal ladder in their promoter regions making them sensitive to H1 removal. Deletion of the H1 gene in Tetrahymena results in selectively decreased and increased gene expression (12Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the removal of H1 increases the accessibility of trans-acting protein complexes that act as activators or repressors of transcription (40Dou Y. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 225-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In yeast, a high level of acetylation of core histones is observed (41Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the removal of histone H1 may affect the acetylation state of core histones of some genes. For instance, yeast genes affected by the removal of histone H1 may be more accessible to histone deacetylases resulting in decreased gene expression. This would explain the overall decrease of gene expression observed in yeast cells lacking histone H1 (Fig. 2). In conclusion, our studies provide additional evidence that histone H1 has a more specialized function than the core histones. Importantly, yeast H1 is involved in the general activation of genes, with a limited number of genes being more affected by its removal. Thus, in yeast, H1 is not involved in the repression of gene expression. Our studies were performed with cells grown under rich medium. Testing the effect of H1 removal under more stringent conditions may identify a larger number of genes that are affected by histone H1. We are grateful to Drs.

This protein, damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB), is a heterodimer of two polypeptides, p127 and p48. Recent in vivo studies suggested that DDB is involved in global genome repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that in vitro DDB directly stimulates the excision of CPDs but not (6–4)photoproducts. The excision activity of cell-free extracts from Chinese hamster AA8 cell line that lacks DDB activity was increased 3–4-fold by recombinant DDB heterodimer but not p127 subunit alone. Moreover, the addition of XPA or XPA + replication protein A (RPA), which themselves enhanced excision, also enhanced the excision in the presence of DDB. DDB was found to elevate the binding of XPA to damaged DNA and to make a complex with damaged DNA and XPA or XPA + RPA as judged by both electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I protection assays. These results suggest that DDB assists in the recognition of CPDs by core NER factors, possibly through the efficient recruitment of XPA or XPA·RPA, and thus stimulates the excision reaction of CPDs.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have been reported to help mediate NER. The existence of such factors in humans, however, has not been clearly demonstrated. Damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB) is one of the candidates that might play such an accessory role in human cells. DDB is composed of two subunits, p127 and p48, and has a higher affinity for various types of DNA lesions compared with the damage recognition subunits (XPA, RPA, XPC·HR23B, and TFIIH) of the six core repair factors (17Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol.

DDB activity has been shown to be missing in a subset of xeroderma pigmentosum group E (XP-E) patients. XP is an autosomal recessive disease associated with abnormal sensitivity to UV lights and a high incidence of skin cancer, which is known to be caused by defects in NER. XP-E is one of eight genetic complementation groups (XP-A through XP-G and XP-V) of XP patients, and, along with XP-V, manifests the mildest clinical features and deficiency in NER. XP-E individuals lacking DDB activity were found to carry mutations in p48gene (20Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 21Kataoka H. Fujiwara Y.

Because of its high specificity for binding to damaged DNA and a defect in some XP-E cells, DDB has been postulated to be involved in the NER process, presumably in a damage recognition step. However, DDB is clearly not essential for NER in several in vitro reconstituted systems, and its precise role in the damage recognition process has not been demonstrated so far (24Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hübscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D.

However, recent in vivo studies clearly showed that XP-E cells and rodent cells lacking DDB activity are selectively defective in global genome repair (GGR) of CPDs, and transfection of the p48gene into the rodent cells complements the deficiencies (28Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 29Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 205: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (279) Google Scholar), suggesting that DDB may be involved in GGR especially for CPDs. For this study, we have overproduced DDB in a baculovirus/insect cell system, purified it to near homogeneity, and tested its effect uponin vitro excision reactions with DNA substrates containing either a single CPD or a single (6–4)photoproduct. Indeed the recombinant DDB stimulated the excision rate of CPDs by cell-free extracts (CFEs) prepared from AA8 Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that lack DDB activity, and the stimulatory effect was enhanced in the presence of XPA or XPA + RPA. We also observed that DDB forms a complex with XPA and RPA at the damage sites based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I protection assays. These results provide direct biochemical evidence that DDB can be involved in the recognition process of CPDs in NER. To overproduce FLAG-tagged DDB subunits in insect cells, 5′-terminal portions of cDNAs with FLAG epitope sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reactions using the primers for p127 (5′-CGCGGACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGTCGTACAACTACGTGG-3′ and 5′-ATTGAATTCCTTTTCTCGG-3′) or for p48 (5′- CGCGGATCCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGGCTCCCAAGAAACGC-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCCCCCTTTGG-3′) and digested with BamHI andEcoRI. These fragments of 0.6 kilobases for p127 and 0.4 kilobases for p48 were individually subcloned into the pFASTBac1 expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the sequences of the inserted portions were verified. The remaining 3′-terminal regions ofp127 or p48 cDNA were excised from the original constructs (30Dualan R. Brody T. Keeney S. Nichols A.F. Admon A. Linn S. Genomics. 1995; 29: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with BstEII and NotI orBstXI and NotI, respectively, and inserted into the pFASTBac1 constructs containing each 5′terminal portions to give the complete cDNAs. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding the p127 or p48 subunit were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sf21 insect cells were co-infected with both viruses to jointly express p127 and p48 or with the p127 virus alone and incubated at 27 °C for 42–48 h. After collecting the cells by centrifugation, extracts were prepared by method of Manley et al. (31Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The extracts were first applied to SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 100 mm KCl. After extensive washing with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, the recombinant proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0.1–1m) in buffer A and identified by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. The eluted proteins were directly applied to a column containing anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels (Sigma) and washed extensively with buffer A containing 0.15 m KCl. The proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.15m KCl and 2 mg/ml FLAG peptides, dialyzed against the storage buffer, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant RPA and (His)6-XPA were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (7Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Sancar (University of North Carolina). The activities of these purified repair factors were verified by an in vitro complementation assay or reconstitution assay. Duplex DNA substrates (56 bp for binding assays and DNase I protection assays and 136 bp for excision assays) that contained a cis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer or a (6–4)photoproduct in the center were constructed from 4 and 6 blocks of oligomer, respectively. Details for sequences and preparations of these substrates have been described (34Zhao X. Liu J. Hsu D.S. Zhao S. Taylor J.-S. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Cell-free extracts (CFEs) were prepared by the method of Manley et al. (31Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The standard reaction mixture contained 3–6 fmol of 136-bp substrate, the indicated recombinant proteins, and 50 μg of CFE prepared from AA8 cells in 25 μl of reaction buffer (32 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 64 mm KCl, 6.44 mm MgCl2, 0.16 mm dithiothreitol, 0.16 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, and 4% glycerol). Normally, the substrates were first incubated with the indicated recombinant proteins at 30 °C for 10 min, CFE was added, and incubation was continued for 45 min. DNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Excision products were visualized by autoradiography, or the signals were quantified by exposing gels to Bas2000 imaging screens, and the intensities were measured with a Fuji Bas2000 Bioimaging Analyzer. Two fmol of32P-labeled 56-bp substrates were incubated with the indicated amounts of recombinant proteins or CFE at 30 °C for 20 min in 25 μl of reaction buffer. The protein·DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 25 mA for 2 h and analyzed by autoradiography. To identify the compositions of protein·DNA complexes, specific antibodies were added after the complex formation. Monoclonal antibodies against FLAG and hexahistidine tags were obtained from Sigma and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against the p34 subunit of RPA were purchased from Oncogene Science. The internally labeled 56-bp substrates (2 fmol) were incubated with the indicated amounts of proteins in 25 μl of reaction buffer at 30 °C for 20 min and then digested with 700 units of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 3.8 mm CaCl2. The products were purified, separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by autoradiography. To investigate the effect of DDB on in vitroexcision repair reaction, we have overproduced DDB heterodimer (p127 and p48) or p127 subunit alone in baculovirus/insect cell system. An 8-amino acid FLAG epitope fused at the N termini of both polypeptides (p127 and p48) facilitated the purification of the recombinant proteins. After a two-step separation with SP-Sepharose and an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, the near homogeneous proteins (Fig.1 A) were tested for DDB activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig.1 B). The heterodimeric DDB specifically bound to a 56-bp duplex containing a (6–4)photoproduct (lanes 7 and8), and the mobility of the complex was identical to that with the native DDB (lanes 3 and 4) from HeLa cell-free extracts. However, the recombinant p127 protein alone did not bind to DNA either with or without a (6–4)photoproduct (lanes 9 and 10), consistent with previous reports (36Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also compared the binding ability of the DDB to a 56-mer duplex DNA containing a single CPD or a (6–4)photoproduct (Fig. 1 C). As expected, DDB showed a clear preference for the DNA duplex with a (6–4)photoproduct (lanes 10–12) over the undamaged DNA probe (lanes 2–4), and it also showed a moderate preference for the DNA probe containing the CPD (lanes 6–8). To test the effect of the recombinant DDB on an in vitro excision reaction with a CPD-containing DNA substrate, we prepared CFEs from CHO AA8 cells, which have been shown to lack p48 expression and, consequently, DDB activity (29Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 205: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 36Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B (lanes 5 and 6) confirmed that there is no binding activity in AA8 CFEs. The 136-bp substrate with a single CPD was preincubated with DDB heterodimer or p127 alone (as a control) and subsequently incubated with AA8 CFE (Fig.2 A). DDB (lane 2), but not p127 alone (lane 3), stimulated the excision reaction by AA8 CFEs ∼3-fold, in agreement with in vivodata that when CHO V79 cells were transfected with the p48gene DDB activity reappeared along with GGR of CPDs (29Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 205: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This stimulation was also dependent on the concentration of DDB (Fig.2 B). On the other hand, when the DNA substrate containing a (6–4)photoproduct was used, the same amount of DDB (280 ng) greatly inhibited the excision reaction (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 5). Since DDB binds to a (6–4)photoproduct more efficiently than a CPD, as shown in Fig.1 C, a similar experiment with less DDB was carried out (Fig.2 C). Under this condition, DDB up to 13.2 ng did not affect the excision level of (6–4)photoproducts by AA8 CFEs. It should be noted that the excision amount of (6–4)photoproducts is much higher than that of CPDs (3.0% versus 0.06%). Thus DDB might help the recognition of CPDs by the core NER proteins. To investigate the functional interaction between DDB and the predicted damage recognition subunits of the NER factors, DNA substrate with a CPD was preincubated with DDB in the presence of RPA, XPA, XPA + RPA, or XPC·HR23B before the addition of AA8 CFE. As shown in Fig.3 A, the stimulatory effect (lane 2, ∼4-fold) of DDB on the excision of CPDs was further enhanced by XPA (lane 4, to ∼7-fold) or XPA + RPA (lane 5, to ∼10-fold) but not with RPA (lane 3) or XPC·HR23B (lane 6). The individual repair factors show some stimulatory effect in the absence of DDB (lanes 7–10), and the effects of DDB and XPA or XPA + RPA appear to be additive. Interestingly, when the DNA substrates with a (6–4)photoproduct were used (Fig. 3 B), the inhibitory effect of DDB on the excision reaction was apparently reversed by XPA (lane 4) or XPA + RPA (lane 5) but not by RPA (lane 3) or XPC·HR23B (lane 6). These results suggest that XPA and RPA might be directly involved in the DDB-stimulated excision reaction of CPDs. To determine whether DDB forms a complex with XPA and/or RPA on a damaged DNA, we first employed EMSA with various pairwise combinations of DDB, XPA, and RPA (Fig.4). Since we had a special interest in the possible ability of DDB to recruit XPA or RPA onto a damaged DNA, we chose conditions under which XPA or RPA alone barely bound to the DNA probes (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 2). A combination of DDB and XPA (Fig. 4 A) produced a shifted band (lane 4) that migrated more slowly than the DDB·DNA complex (lane 3). Moreover, the addition of specific antibodies to XPA (α-His, lane 5) or DDB (α-FLAG,lane 6) supershifted all of this band. These data indicate that DDB enhances the binding of XPA to CPD-containing DNA and makes a ternary complex of DDB·XPA·DNA. On the other hand, another combination, DDB and RPA (Fig. 4 B), gave a more intense band compared with RPA alone (lane 2 versus lane 4). This band appears to contain RPA·DNA complex and DDB·RPA·DNA complex since the band was partially supershifted by α-FLAG antibody (lane 6). These data indicate the potential complex formation of DDB·RPA·DNA, which shows nearly the same mobility as the RPA·DNA complex, consistent with a previous report (38Otrin V.R. McLenigan M. Takao M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we mixed all three factors with the DNA probe to test whether a higher order complex forms. As shown in Fig. 4 C, only one retarded band was observed (lane 5), which was supershifted by all of the specific antibodies to these factors (lanes 6–8), indicating that this retarded band contains DDB·XPA·RPA·DNA. We believe that the band in lane 5 is different from the band in lane 4 for the following reason. When we added α-His antibody to the reaction containing RPA and DDB, as in lane 4, we could not observe any supershifted band (data not shown). However, α-His antibody supershifted more than 90% of the complex as shown in lane 6. To determine whether the three factors make a complex at a damaged site or bind independently, we conducted a DNase I protection assay (39Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using DNA probes containing a (6–4)photoproduct and internal32P label at the 4th phosphate bond 5′ to the lesion. This fragment was chosen for these studies due to the inability of CPD-containing substrates to show clear signals in the DNase I protection assay (data not shown). After incubation with DDB and/or XPA + RPA, the probes were extensively digested with DNase I to determine the size of the DNA region that was protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 5). DDB alone conferred a specific and distinctive band of 9 nucleotides (lane 4) in addition to nonspecific bands of 4–6 nucleotides, indicating the presence of a DDB·DNA complex around a damaged site. On the other hand, XPA and RPA protected a larger DNA region ranging between 11 and 17 nucleotides (lane 8) in a damage-dependent manner. Strikingly, the mixing of all three factors, DDB, XPA, and RPA, led to a drastic increase in the protection levels, and the size of the protected DNA region was smaller than with XPA and RPA (lane 6). These results are consistent with specific and tight complex formation around a damaged site by DDB and XPA·RPA. This paper provides the direct evidence that DDB stimulates the excision reaction of CPDs in vitro, consistent with the recent report that DDB activity correlates well with the GGR activity of CPDs in intact cells (28Hwang B.J.

One possible reason would be that the substrates used in those studies contained non-CPD lesions: UV-irradiated plasmid DNA containing (6–4)photoproducts as well as CPDs (24Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hübscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9173-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In fact, we also failed to observe a stimulatory effect of DDB using (6–4)photoproduct-containing DNA substrates. Preferential binding of excision repair factors RPA, XPA, or XPC·HR23B to non-CPD lesions has been reported (33Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol.

The recognition of these non-CPD lesions might be properly achieved by these repair factors, at least in vitro, regardless of the presence or absence of DDB. On the contrary, cis-syn-CPD is a poor substrate forin vitro NER reactions, as shown in Fig. 2, and there have been no reports of preferential binding of the core NER factors to CPDs. The preferential binding of CPD-containing DNA substrates (Fig.1 C) may assist core repair factors to recognize CPDs. Could DDB not be involved in the repair of (6–4)photoproducts? In vivo repair studies (28Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 47Mitchell D.L. Photochem.

Dermatol. 1999; 113: 251-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) do not support this idea. The repair of (6–4)photoproducts in XP-E cells lacking DDB activity is significantly slower compared with normal cells, indicating the partial involvement of DDB in the repair of (6–4)photoproducts in vivo. In intact cells, DDB may be required for the recognition of (6–4)photoproducts at some parts of the genome. Alternatively, a possible role of DDB in the repair of DNA in chromatin may be implicated, as suggested by others (26Otrin V.R. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Why DDB inhibits the excision of (6–4)photoproducts at higher concentrations (Fig. 2) is not known at present. A similar inhibitory effect of DDB also has been reported in a reconstituted system under XPA- or RPA-limiting conditions (25Kazantsev A. Mu D. Nichols A.F. Zhao X. Linn S. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5014-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). DDB has an ∼10-fold higher affinity for (6–4)photoproducts compared with CPDs (18Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at high concentrations, the second band, with slower migration, increases relative to the first band in EMSA (Fig. 1 C). This form of the complex might inhibit the binding of core NER factors and the complex formation of human excision nuclease. Another noteworthy finding in this study is that the stimulatory effect of DDB on the excision of CPDs was further enhanced in the presence of XPA or XPA + RPA (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of DDB on the excision of (6–4)photoproducts was also suppressed by the presence of these factors (Fig. 3 B). These observations have a good correlation with the complex formation detected by EMSA (Fig.4). XPA, which readily made a complex with DDB on a damaged DNA, could enhance the stimulatory effect of DDB, whereas RPA, which partially made a complex with DDB, could not. Analogously, the combination of XPA and RPA made a complex with DDB as well as enhanced the stimulation of DDB. Furthermore, the binding of XPA to damaged DNA was profoundly enhanced in the presence of DDB (Fig. 4 A). These results strongly suggest a functional link between DDB and XPA in the efficient repair of CPDs in vitro. Taken together, we propose the following model. DDB binds to a CPD in DNA, providing the kink or bending of DNA, as shown by others (18Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fujiwara Y. Masutani C. Mizukoshi T. Kondo J. Hanaoka F. Iwai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20027-20033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and facilitates the recruitment of XPA or XPA together with RPA to the CPD site possibly through protein-protein interaction with XPA. The complex formation at a damaged site by these three factors may lead to the subsequent excision reaction. In this study, we failed to obtain an indication of a functional interaction between DDB and XPC·HR23B based on the in vitro excision assays (Fig. 3) and EMSA (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the recent report (49Batty D. Otrin V.R. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) that DDB and XPC·HR23B bind to UV-damaged DNA independently as judged by EMSA. These results were rather unexpected because XPC·HR23B has been already known to be involved in GGR of CPDs (50Venema J. van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F.

https://openalex.org/W2070294819,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are heparin-binding polypeptides that affect the growth, differentiation, and migration of many cell types. FGFs signal by binding and activating cell surface FGF receptors (FGFRs) with intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. The signaling involves ligand-induced receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, followed by downstream transfer of the signal. The sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate bind both FGFs and FGFRs and enhance FGF signaling by mediating complex formation between the growth factor and receptor components. Whereas the heparin/heparan sulfate structures involved in FGF binding have been studied in some detail, little information has been available on saccharide structures mediating binding to FGFRs. We have performed structural characterization of heparin/heparan sulfate oligosaccharides with affinity toward FGFR4.

Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological effects of FGFs are exerted through interactions with FGF receptors (FGFRs). The receptor family consists of four known members, FGFR1–4, with many isoforms (2Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding the receptor is thought to be activated through dimerization and phosphorylation by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains (3Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), abundant components of cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix, appear central to signaling through FGF·FGFR complexes (for reviews, see Refs. 4Zimmermann P.

McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar).

McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Different splice variants of the receptors differ in affinity for heparin, such that the interaction may vary with the structure of the extracellular receptor domain (13Wang F. Kan M. Yan G. Xu J.

The further modification reactions, C5-epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid (IdoA) units and O-sulfation at various positions (C2 of IdoA and GlcA, C3 and C6 of GlcN units), all occur in the vicinity of previously incorporated N-sulfate groups. Heparin, a highly specialized product of mast cells, is more extensively modified than HS and the modifications are more evenly distributed along the polymer (14Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The heparin/HS structures required for FGFR binding are poorly defined. However, both IdoA(2-OSO3) and GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) residues appear to be required for the FGF2 induced activation of FGFR1, whereas 2-O-sulfate groups alone are sufficient to mediate binding to FGF2 (11Guimond S.

While these findings suggest a role for 6-O-sulfated GlcNSO3 residues in the interactions with FGFR1, it would seem likely that different FGFRs may bind structurally distinct HS species. Neuroepithelial HSPG thus preferentially bound FGFR1 at the cell surface although FGFR3 was also present (19Brickman Y.G. Ford M.D. Small D.H. Bartlett P.F. Nurcombe V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24941-24948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The importance of polysaccharide-FGFR interaction was underpinned by the finding that heparin could alone induce phosphorylation of FGFR4 in the absence of an FGF ligand (20Gao G. Goldfarb M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present paper we describe FGF-independent binding of heparin and HS to the extracellular domain of FGFR4. We show that the interaction is mediated by N-sulfated octasaccharides that contain both IdoA(2-OSO3) and GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) residues, and provide sequence data for FGFR4-binding HS domains. All studies were performed using the soluble extracellular domain of FGFR4. The expression and purification of recombinant human FGFR4, containing the three extracellular Ig domains (Ser25-Arg366), were as described earlier (21Loo B.-M. Darwish K. Vainikka S. Saarikettu J.

Briefly, the His-tagged protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified directly from the culture medium by nickel and heparin affinity chromatography. Heparin from pig intestinal mucosa (stage 14, Inolex Pharmaceutical Division, Park Forest South, IL), was purified as previously described (22Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A. Lindahl B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2817-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was used either unlabeled or radiolabeled by 3H-acetylation of free amino groups (specific activity 75,300 dpm/nmol) as described (23Höök M. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. Anal.

Heparan sulfate preparations from bovine aorta, kidney, lung, and intestine were generously provided by Dr. Keiichi Yoshida (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). N-Sulfated HS oligosaccharides were prepared from bovine intestinal mucosa heparan sulfate (a gift from Kabi AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and3H-labeled as described previously (26Kreuger J. Prydz K. Petterson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, HS wasN-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis followed by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 3.9, resulting in cleavage at theN-unsubstituted GlcN residues. The resistentN-sulfated oligosaccharides were recovered, reduced with NaB3H4 (28 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and separated by gel chromatography. The column materials, Sephadex G-15 and CH-Sepharose-4B, were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, as were the PD-10 desalting and Superdex 30 columns. The Partisil-10 HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) was from Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ, and the Propac PA1 HPLC column was from Dionex, Surrey, United Kingdom. In the filter-trapping assay (27Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), radiolabeled glycosaminoglycans were incubated with FGFR4 in 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in a total volume of 200 μl for 2 h at room temperature. The mixtures were rapidly passed through nitrocellulose filters (Sartorius, diameter 25 mm, pore size 0.45 μm) using a vacuum suction apparatus, followed by washing with PBS. Proteins and protein bound saccharides remain on the filter whereas unbound saccharides pass through. The bound saccharides were released by 2 m NaCl and quantified by a β-scintillation counter. Binding studies were also performed using a CH Sepharose-4B column, with immobilized FGFR4, that was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For preparation of 1 ml of the affinity matrix, ∼0.5 mg of FGFR4 was used. Heparin (0.5 mg) was included in the immobilization reaction to protect the heparin-binding site on FGFR4. To avoid immobilization of heparin to the matrix, the heparin preparation used had been treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (28Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) to destroy any N-unsubstituted GlcN residues, followed by recovery of the high molecular weight fraction by gel chromatography on Superdex 30. Samples of 3H-labeled heparin/HS were applied to the column in PBS, with or without CaCl2supplementation, followed by washing with PBS and elution of the bound material with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.14–1.0 m) in PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and measured for radioactivity. The NaCl gradient was monitored by measuring the conductivity of every third fraction. A control column was prepared without immobilized FGFR4. This column did not bind any of the tested glycosaminoglycans (data not shown). To study the interaction of the antithrombin (AT) binding heparin domain with FGFR4,3H-labeled heparin decasaccharides were subjected to affinity chromatography on antithrombin-Sepharose as described (29Höök M. Björk I. Hopwood J. Lindahl U. FEBS Lett. 1976; 66: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Bound decasaccharides were eluted with a step gradient of NaCl (0.14, 0.5, and 2.0 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The high affinity (∼2% of total saccharide) and non-binding fractions recovered in the 2.0 and 0.14 m NaCl eluates, respectively, were tested for FGFR4 binding by affinity chromatography. Surface plasmon resonance analysis on a BiacoreX instrument (BiaCore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was a third means of studying saccharide:FGFR4 binding. Heparin (0.5–1 mg) was biotinylated by incubation in 0.1m MES buffer (pH 5.5 with 50 mm biotin hydrazide (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 10 mm N-ethyl-N′(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Pierce Chemical Corp., Rockford, IL) for 5–6 h at room temperature. Biotinylated heparin was separated from excess reagent on a PD-10 column and immobilized to streptavidin-coated sensor chips (BiaCore AB). FGFR4 was incubated with saccharides for at least 10 min prior to injection over the heparin-coated surface. The running buffer used was PBS supplemented with 0.005% Tween 20. The concentrations of the interactants and flow rates were as indicated in the figure legends. A streptavidin surface without immobilized heparin was used as a control. The response from this surface was subtracted from the response of the heparin surface. N-Sulfated oligosaccharides from bovine intestinal HS were fractionated by binding to the FGFR4 affinity matrix. To deplete the unbound pool (∼80% of the total saccharide) of any remaining FGFR4 binding components, it was rechromatographed twice on the FGFR4 column (<4% of the material was bound to the matrix upon the second rechromatography step). The disaccharide composition of HS samples was determined as described (30Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, saccharides were treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) at pH 1.5, leading to deaminative cleavage of the saccharide chain at GlcNSO3 units (28Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The resultant terminal anhydromannose units were radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4 (0.25–0.5 mCi/reaction) yielding3H-labeled 2,5-anhydromannitol ([3H]aManR) residues. The labeled disaccharides were recovered by gel chromatography and further separated by anion-exchange HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column eluted with a step gradient of KH2PO4. The disaccharide peaks were identified by comparing their elution positions to those of standard heparin disaccharides. The proportions of non-O-sulfated disaccharides were determined by high voltage paper electrophoresis of the total labeled disaccharides in 0.83 m pyridine, 0.5 m acetic acid buffer, pH 5.3 (32Kusche M. Lindahl U. Enerbäck L. Rodén L. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). FGFR4 binding HS oligosaccharides, containing a reducing terminal [3H]aManRresidue, were prepared for sequence analysis by anion-exchange HPLC on a Propac PA1 column in H2O, pH 3 (adjusted with HCl). The bound oligosaccharides were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (up to 1.5 m). The fractions containing the octasaccharides of interest were pooled, desalted, dried in a centrifugal evaporator, and sequenced through a combination of chemical and enzymatic degradation procedures as described (33Vivès R.R. Pye D.A. Salmivirta M. Hopwood J.J. Lindahl U. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Samples were first subjected to partial HNO2 (pHNO2) cleavage (34Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) by treatment with 2 mm NaNO2 in 20 mm HCl on ice. After incubation for various periods of time (30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min), aliquots were removed and the reaction was stopped by addition of 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6. The aliquots, containing the cleavage products from the different time points, were combined and subjected to enzyme digestion. The exoenzymes used for sequence analysis were iduronate-2-sulfatase (IdoA2Sase), α-l-iduronidase (IdoAase), and glucosamine-6-sulfatase (GlcN6Sase) (Oxford GlycoSciences, Abingdon, U.K.). The enzymes are recombinant human (IdoA2Sase and IdoAase) or caprine (GlcN6Sase) proteins produced in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. IdoA2Sase removes ester sulfates at C2 of nonreducing terminal IdoA(2-OSO3) residues of heparin/heparan sulfate whereas IdoAase cleaves the α1–4 linkage between IdoA and GlcNR in heparin/heparan sulfate (Ris -COCH3, -SO 3−, or -HS 3). GlcN6Sase cleaves ester sulfates at C6 of nonreducing GlcNR residues. The substrate specificities of the enzymes were confirmed using known heparin structures as substrates. IdoA2Sase and IdoAase were shown to be active on all potential substrates including heparin disaccharide deamination products. Notably, 6-O-sulfated aManR is not a substrate for GlcN6Sase. 2J. Kreuger and U. Lindahl, unpublished data. The amounts of enzyme used were 1 milliunit/reaction of IdoA2Sase/IdoAase, and 0.2 milliunits/reaction of GlcN6Sase. The samples were incubated with a single enzyme or combinations of the enzymes in a total volume of 25 μl, in the incubation buffer provided with the enzymes (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 13–15 h. In digestions involving several enzymes, the enzymes were added at 2-h intervals, in the order of action. The enzyme-treated saccharides were analyzed by Propac ion-exchange chromatography as described above. Sequence information was obtained by detecting shifts in the elution positions of the enzyme-treated subfragments (33Vivès R.R. Pye D.A. Salmivirta M. Hopwood J.J. Lindahl U. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To assess the binding of the recombinant extracellular domain of FGFR4 to heparin, increasing amounts of [3H]heparin were incubated with FGFR4 at physiological ionic strength. The protein-polysaccharide complexes formed were trapped on nitrocellulose filters and the bound saccharide was quantified by scintillation counting (27Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The results indicated that heparin bound FGFR4 in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 1 A), whereas the binding was completely abolished by addition of excess cold heparin (data not shown). A KD value of 0.3–0.4 μm was determined for the FGFR-heparin interaction (assuming an average molecular weight of 10 kDa for heparin) by fitting a hyperbolic function using nonlinear regression analysis to the data visualized by a Scatchard plot (inset, Fig. 1 A). The interaction was also studied by affinity chromatography of [3H]heparin on immobilized FGFR4, as well as by surface plasmon resonance (BiaCore) measurements of soluble FGFR4 binding to immobilized heparin. In affinity chromatography, [3H]heparin was found to require 0.25–0.50 mNaCl for elution from the FGFR4 column (Fig. 1 B). Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed saturable binding of FGFR4 to the heparin-coated surface whereas little or no binding was seen to a control surface without heparin (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that the FGFR4 ectodomain is capable of binding heparin in a FGF-ligand independent fashion, in agreement with previous results (20Gao G. Goldfarb M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,21Loo B.-M. Darwish K. Vainikka S. Saarikettu J. Vihko P. Hermonen J. Goldman A. Alitalo K. Jalkanen M. Int. J. Cell Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15947-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An important role for divalent cations such as Ca2+ in the binding of heparin to FGFR1, another member of the FGFR family, were proposed by McKeehan and co-workers (36Kan M. Wang F. Kan M. To B. Gabriel J.L. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37Patstone G. Maher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 3343-3346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To examine whether calcium ions affect the heparin-FGFR4 interaction, we tested the binding of [3H]heparin to the FGFR4 affinity matrix in the presence of 1.3 mm Ca2+, which corresponds to the physiological Ca2+ concentration of extracellular fluids. Under these conditions, the peak elution of [3H]heparin occurred at ∼0.40 m NaCl, as compared with a peak elution position corresponding to ∼0.35m NaCl in the absence of Ca2+ ions (Fig.1 B). These results suggest that Ca2+ ions may slightly enhance, but are not required for, the heparin-FGFR4 interaction. To identify the minimal size of the FGFR4 binding heparin domain, even numbered, 3H-end-labeled heparin oligosaccharides were incubated with FGFR4 in solution, after which the binding was assessed by the filter-trapping method (see “Experimental Procedures”). Octasaccharides were the shortest oligosaccharides with appreciable FGFR4 binding capacity (Fig.2 A). The binding of decasaccharides and longer fragments to FGFR4 increased gradually with increasing fragment length, but without any striking differences in binding between the consecutive fragments of the series. Surface plasmon resonance was also used to define the minimal FGFR4-binding heparin domain by assessing the ability of heparin oligosaccharides to inhibit binding of FGFR4 to biotinylated full-length heparin, immobilized on the chip surface (Fig. 2 B). Octasaccharides were the smallest fragments with substantial inhibitory capacity, whereas decasaccharides and longer fragments had still higher inhibitory effect. Taken together, the above data implicate a minimal FGFR4-binding site within a sequence encompassing eight monosaccharide units. We next studied the importance of the N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfate groups of heparin in FGFR4 binding, by testing the ability of selectively desulfated heparin preparations to inhibit binding of [3H]heparin to FGFR4 in solution (Fig.3 A). Whereas low concentrations (1–5 μg/ml) of unlabeled, native heparin blocked the binding almost completely, corresponding amounts of the various selectively desulfated heparin preparations showed little inhibitory capacity. However, each of the preparations resulted in 50–75% inhibition at high concentrations (50–100 μg/ml) (Fig.3 A). In Biacore studies (Fig. 3 B), FGFR4 was incubated with the desulfated heparin preparations prior to injection of the mixture over the heparin-coated surface. The results were in agreement with the data from filter trapping assays, such that each of the selective desulfation treatments led to a dramatic decrease in inhibitory capacity (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, these results suggest that the N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfate groups of heparin all contribute to binding FGFR4. Recently, the AT-binding pentasaccharide motif of heparin, containing a critical 3-O-sulfated GlcNSO3 residue was implicated in binding to FGFRs (38McKeehan W.L. Wu X. Kan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21511-21514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We decided to reassess this proposal by separating 3H-labeled heparin decasaccharides with regard to affinity for AT, and then test the resultant high and low affinity fractions for ability to bind FGFR4. About 2% of the starting material bound with high affinity to immobilized AT, in good agreement with previous findings (29Höök M. Björk I. Hopwood J. Lindahl U. FEBS Lett. 1976; 66: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and this fraction was quantitatively retained by the FGFR4 column (Fig.4 A), in accord with the proposal by McKeehan et al. (38McKeehan W.L. Wu X. Kan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21511-21514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, a major portion of the fraction with low affinity for AT also bound to the immobilized FGFR4, and elution of this material from the FGFR4 column required the same NaCl concentration as that needed to displace the decasaccharide with high affinity for AT (Fig. 4 A). This finding is in disagreement with the notion that the AT binding sequence is essential for FGFR binding. Indeed, isolation of the two FGFR4-binding fractions followed by analytical AT-Sepharose chromatography confirmed that one of the fractions, as expected, showed high affinity for AT whereas the other did not (Fig. 4 B). The major physiological polysaccharide ligand for FGFR4 is presumably HS rather than heparin, that is essentially confined to the mast cell. The interactions of3H-labeled HS samples from bovine lung, aorta, and kidney with FGFR4 were studied by affinity chromatography (Fig.5). All HS species tested were retained by the column and required 0.2–0.3 m NaCl for elution. Generally, the binding was somewhat weaker than that of heparin, judging from the higher NaCl concentration required to displace heparin compared with HS. The FGFR4 binding profiles of the various HS species differed such that a substantial portion of kidney HS emerged at NaCl concentrations >0.35 m, whereas aorta HS contained only minor amounts of such high-affinity material. We next proceeded to characterize HS domains with affinity toward FGFR4. The experiments with selectively desulfated heparin suggested that the binding of HS to FGFR4 would require highly sulfated structures, of the type represented by theN-sulfated domains of the polysaccharide. These domains are composed of consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units and contain most of the O-sulfate groups of the HS chain. To isolate such domains, we used bovine intestinal HS that bound to the FGFR4 affinity column (data not shown) similar to the lung HS preparation shown in Fig. 5. N-Sulfated oligosaccharides were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and3H-end-labeled by reduction with NaB3H4. Affinity chromatography of the [3H]decasaccharide on the FGFR4 column yielded 20% of bound material. After two reapplications of the unbound fraction, less than 4% of the material bound to the matrix, indicating depletion of FGFR4-binding species (data not shown). Analysis of the bound and unbound decamer pools (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that the bound fraction was markedly enriched in 6-O-sulfate groups, that were almost twice as abundant as in the unbound fraction (Table I, Fig. 6). The 6-O-sulfate groups occurred mainly in trisulfated -IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)- disaccharide units. Similar results were obtained upon compositional disaccharide analysis of FGFR4 bound and unbound dodecasaccharides (not shown). Together, these findings suggest that the FGFR4-HS"

We have used a multidisciplinary approach involving crystallography, NMR, and isothermal titration calorimetry to study the regulatory fragment of Fyn (FynSH32) and its interaction with a physiological activator: a fragment of focal adhesion kinase that contains both phosphotyrosine and polyproline motifs. Although flexible, the preferred disposition of SH3 and SH2 domains in FynSH32 resembles the inactive forms of Hck and Src, differing significantly from LckSH32. This difference, which results from variation in the SH3-SH2 linker sequences, will affect the potential of the regulatory fragments to repress kinase activity. This surprising result implies that the mechanism of repression of Src family members may vary, explaining functional distinctions between Fyn and Lck. The interaction between FynSH32 and focal adhesion kinase is restricted to the canonical SH3 and SH2 binding sites and does not affect the dynamic independence of the two domains. Consequently, the interaction shows no enhancement by an avidity effect. Such an interaction may have evolved to gain specificity through an extended recognition site while maintaining rapid dissociation after signaling.

Src homology focal adhesion kinase isothermal titration calorimetry glutathione S-transferase phosphotyrosine nuclear Overhauser effect The Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases to date comprises nine members (Src, Fyn, Lck, Hck, Yes, Fgr, Yrk, Blk, and Lyn), all of which play important roles in cellular signal transduction. Some Src kinases (Fyn, Src, and Yes) are found in most cell types and serve to mediate diverse signaling pathways, whereas others display a restricted tissue distribution and have more specific biochemical tasks (e.g. Lck in T lymphocytes, Hck in myeloid cells, and Blk in B cells). Because Src kinases are proto-oncoproteins, their activity is tightly controlled by intramolecular inhibitory interactions. Understanding of the diverse inhibitory and activatory mechanisms has been advanced substantially in the last 3 years, helped by the determination of crystal structures of the repressed, “closed” form of the two Src kinases Src (1Williams J.C.

In the inactive form, the Src homology (SH)1 2 domain binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine of the C-terminal tail (Tyr-527 in Src), whereas the SH3 domain docks onto the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain via a proline-containing motif in the SH2-kinase linker. As a consequence, helix C of the kinase domain adopts a nonproductive orientation (Fig. 1). The kinase can be activated by dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 or by ligand engagement of one or both SH domains. The viral Nef protein has been shown to activate Hck via an SH3 interaction (4Moarefi I.

The availability of the SH domains for their cognate ligands seems to be interdependent of phosphorylation of Tyr-416 of the activation segment (13Gonfloni S. Weijland A. Kretzschmar J. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent reports have stressed the importance of fine-tuning of intra- and intermolecular interactions for full functionality of the Src kinases (14Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To further the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to regulation and adaptation of Src kinases, we focused on the role of their SH3-SH2 tandem domain for kinase repression and ligand selection. By combining crystallography, solution-state NMR spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we characterized the structure and dynamics of this fragment from Fyn and explored its two-domain interaction with FAK. FAK, a central component in integrin signaling (15Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds to the SH2 and SH3 domains of the Src family kinases Fyn or Src, leading to their activation (5Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 6Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White G.C., II Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The FAK-Src interaction is thus responsible for the majority of FAK-mediated signaling events and has been implicated in the regulation of cancer cells (16Jones R.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Amino acids 81 to 247 of human Fyn (SWISS-PROT Database accession number P06241), comprising SH domains 2 and 3, were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. All cysteine residues of human Fyn (amino acids 238, 239, and 245) were mutated into serine in this construct to avoid nonspecific disulfide cross-linking. The LckSH32 construct (comprising residues 59 to 238 of human Lck as a GST fusion vector) was a kind gift of Dr. Yves Collette (U119 INSERM, Marseille, France). Cells were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium or minimal medium containing 100 μg ampicillin/ml culture. The cells were induced at an optical density at λ= 600 nm of 0.5 with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 6 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and stored at −80 °C. Minimal medium with 15NH4Cl or 13C-enriched glucose, 15NH4Cl, and D2O instead of H2O was used to produce isotopically labeled protein. For purification, the cells were thawed and then lysed by mild sonication on ice in the lysate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and one tablet of Complete protease block (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto a phosphotyrosine column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column with the bound protein was then washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton, with 20 column volumes of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, and finally with 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. In the case of GST-Lck, 2 mm dithiothreitol was added to all buffers. Protein was eluted with 1 m NaCl in 150 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against the crystallization, NMR, or ITC buffer. Purity of the sample was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, concentration was assessed by optical density at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients calculated from amino acid sequence. The 36-amino acid phosphotyrosine (pY) peptide ARALPSIPKL ANNEKQGVRS HTVSVSETDD (pY)AEIID (FAKp3/2), derived from residues 367 to 402 of chicken FAK, and the pY peptide TDS(pY)AEIID were purchased from MWG AG BIOTECH. The residue Ser in position pY-1 of the pY peptide was chosen because the native FAK residue Asp gave rise to problems in synthesis. FAKp3/2 used for the NMR studies was a kind gift from Michael D. Schaller, M. D. (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) (and contains the canonical Asp). The PXXP peptide AAAARALPSIPKL and the SM1 peptide ATEPQpYQPGEN were synthesized by the Oxford Center for Molecular Sciences peptide synthesis facility. After dialysis into 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mmNa2SO4, the buffer was exchanged again into a stock solution of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm Na2SO4 by four ultrafiltration and dilution cycles. D2O was added to 5%. Peptides were added in 2-fold excess, and the pH was readjusted with NaOH and HCl. For the assignment, 0.8 mm samples of15N-labeled SH32*SM1 and ∼65% 2H,13C, 15N-labeled SH32*SM1 and SH32*FAKp3/2 were used. For the 15N relaxation and chemical shift studies,15N-labeled samples of 0.3 mm SH32, 0.6 mm SH32*(pY peptide)*(PXXP peptide), and 0.6 mm SH32*FAKp3/2 were used. All the NMR experiments were performed at 27.5 °C on a home-built spectrometer consisting of Oxford Instruments magnets operated at 1H frequencies of 600 and 750 MHz. Backbone assignment was achieved using a combination of 2D1H-15N heteronuclear spin quantum coherence (17Boyd J. Soffe N. John B. Plant D. Hurd R. J. Magn.

Data were processed with Felix 2.3 (Biosym, Inc., San Diego, CA) and analyzed with XEasy (23Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Transverse (15N-T2) and longitudinal (15N-T1) relaxation times and the heteronuclear steady-state 15N-{1H} NOE were measured at 60.8 MHz using procedures as described in Refs. 24Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar and 25Farrow N.A. Zhang O.W. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar. Transverse relaxation time constants (T2) were measured using a spin-echo sequence with a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill delay of 457 μs. Dipolar and chemical shift anisotropy cross-correlation was removed by application of proton 180° pulses every 5 ms (T1) and in the middle of the basic Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill block (T2) (26Boyd J. Hommel U. Campbell I.D. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990; 175: 477-482Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 27Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). For the T2 and T1 measurements, data sets were acquired using acquisition times of 70.9 ms for 15N and 41 ms for 1H. Eight different relaxation delays were used, ranging from 8 to 112 ms for the T2 measurements and 20 to 1000 ms for the T1 measurements, respectively. The acquisitions times of the 15N-{1H} NOE experiment data sets were 62.4 ms for 15N and 41 ms for1H. 1H saturation in the NOE experiment was effected by means of a train of 120° flip-angle pulses at 10-ms intervals for 4 s. The T1, T2, and15N-{1H} NOE spectra were processed with mild resolution enhancement to optimize resolution while maintaining a good signal to noise ratio. Relaxation rates were derived from two-parameter exponential fits to the resonance intensities (28Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The heteronuclear NOE was calculated as the ratio of resonance intensities in the spectra recorded with and without saturation. Uncertainties in the parameters were estimated from Monte Carlo simulations using the root mean square noise in the respective spectra. For a few residues, the peak intensity was too small to reliably estimate the 15N-{1H} NOEs. Accordingly, they were excluded from further analysis. The isotropic correlation times were estimated from the 15N T1/T2 ratios of the well-structured regions of SH32 (residues 86–113 and 119–139 in SH3 and residues 150–153 and 155–231 in SH2) (24Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). For SH32 domains, they are essentially independent of anisotropy (29Fushman D. Xu R. Cowburn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10225-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed using the MSC system (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) as described elsewhere (30Ladbury J.E. Hensmann M. Panayotou G. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11062-11069Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the experiments, FynSH32 protein was diluted from stock solution to the concentration required for the ITC experiment (4–10 μm) and dialyzed against the ITC buffer 7.5 (10 mm Na,K phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) or 8.0 (50 mm Na,K phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl). For titrations with LckSH32, 4 mm dithiothreitol was added. Peptides were diluted from a buffered 5 mm stock solution into the ITC buffer to 10–15× the concentration of the protein in the cell. For one titration experiment, typically twenty 15 μl aliquots of peptide were injected into the 1.3-ml sample cell at 25 °C containing FynSH32 or LckSH32. The data were fit by least squares regression using ORIGIN software. Because cleavage of the fused GST from LckSH32 by factor X (PROMEGA) required large amounts of factor X (cleavage with 1 μg of factor X yielded about 80 μg of LckSH32), GST-LckSH32 was used for most ITC experiments. The binding parameters for GST-LckSH32 were comparable to those for LckSH32 (Table II).Table IIThermodynamic parameters of peptide binding to FynSH32 and LckSH32SyringeCellkDΔGΔHTΔSBufferμmkJkJkJFAKp3/2FynSH320.03−42.9−88.6−45.7Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaClFAKp3/2LckSH320.7−35.1−45.6−10.5Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaClFAKp3/2GST-LckSH320.9−34.3−68.1−33.8Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaClFAKp3/2FynSH320.2−38.0−132−114Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaClFAKp3/2GST-LckSH323.3−31.3−44−12.7Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaClpYFynSH322.5−32.0−45.1−13.1Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaClpYGST-LckSH325.0−30.0−8.0+22.0Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaClPXXPFynSH3268−24.6−16.1−42.9Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaClData obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry at 25 °C.

Peptides and buffers are described under “Experimental Procedures.” CD spectra were measured with a nitrogen-cooled spectropolarimeter using a 4 s time constant, a 10 nm·min− 1 scan speed, and a 1 nm spectral bandwidth. A 0.1-cm path-length cell was utilized for the far-UV CD region (185–260 nm), and a 1-cm path-length cell was utilized for the near-UV CD region (240–320 nm). All spectra were recorded at 10 °C in ITC buffer. For crystallization, isolated FynSH32 was kept in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl and concentrated to 16 mg/ml. Crystals were grown with the vapor diffusion method from hanging drops using 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of well solution (0.25m sodium tartrate, 12% PEG 8000, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.0). Diffraction data were recorded at room temperature on a single crystal (700 × 300 × 100 μm, space group P21 with a = 40.0 Å, b = 90.0 Å,c = 60.3 Å, b = 101.4°) on Beamline ID14-2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Integration (with MOSFLM), merging, and scaling (with SCALA, CCP4 suite) of the data yielded an 82% complete dataset between 37.0 and 2.6 Å resolution (Rsym = 7.4%, <I/sigI> = 6.3). The structure was solved with AMORE, using as search models the crystallographic structures of Fyn SH3 (Protein Data Bank accession code 1SHF) and Src SH2 (Protein Data Bank accession code 1SPS). Placement of two Src SH2 and two Fyn SH3 molecules yielded a correlation coefficient of 55 and an R factor of 40% between 3.0 and 12.0 Å. The SH3-SH2 linker region of the two FynSH32 molecules became visible after solvent flattening and histogram matching using DM (CCP4 suite). The FynSH32 structure was rebuilt in the electron density map after DM and refined by CNS. The final model has a crystallographic R factor of 21.4% (Rfree = 27.7%) for all reflections between 37.0 and 2.6 Å resolution and root mean square deviations of 0.012 Å for bond lengths and 1.66o for bond angles. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1G83). Attempts were made to obtain crystals of the complex between FynSH32 and FAKp3/2. The complex was formed by mixing together FynSH32 and FAKp3/2 and purified by gel filtration using a size exclusion chromatography column (Superdex75; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Crystals of this material grew after 3 to 6 months from hanging drops of 1 μl of well solution (13% PEG 4000, 13% PEG 3350, 0.24m lithium sulfate, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) mixed with 1 μl of a solution containing the complex in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Native data were recorded on European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14-2. Additional data were collected from a crystal soaked for 5 h in 0.2 mmuranyl acetate on European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14-4. Data were integrated with MOSFLM and merged and scaled with SCALA. The crystals grew in space group R32 (a = b = 113.0 Å, c = 205.0 Å) and yielded a 98% complete native dataset to 3.5 A (Rsym = 8.3%) and a 97% complete uranyl-derivative to 3.8 A (Rsym = 7.7%). Both structures could be solved by molecular replacement using the refined FynSH32 structure as template (correlation coefficient for two positioned FynSH32 was 44%, and the R factor was 50% for the native data). Phases were calculated from the uranyl derivative using the program SHARP and used to calculate a map that confirmed the molecular replacement solution. The SH3 positioning was additionally verified by maps that were phased using only the two SH2 domains of the asymetric unit and averaged by DM. Crystal packing occluded the pY+3 binding pocked on the SH2 domain and the PXXP-peptide binding site of the SH3 domain. Unattributed electron density was found at the pY binding pocked; however, no further electron density for the FAK peptide was apparent. FynSH32 was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Crystals of this fragment were obtained in two different crystal forms, one in space group P21 and the other in space group R32, grown under different crystallization conditions. These diffracted to maximum resolutions of 2.6 Å and 3.5 Å, respectively. Both crystal forms could be solved by molecular replacement using crystal structures of Fyn SH3 domain and Src SH2 domain as search models. The higher resolution P21 data were used to obtain the final refined model (Fig.2). This model includes the first crystal structure of Fyn SH2. As expected, Fyn SH2 is very similar to Src SH2 (31Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) (their 96 Cαs superimpose with root mean square of 0.96 Å) and to the NMR model of Fyn SH2 (22Mulhern T.D. Shaw G.L. Morton C.J. Day A.J. Campbell I.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Cα root mean square is 1.62 Å). Both crystal forms were comprised of asymmetric units, which contained two independent copies of FynSH32. All four FynSH32 structures showed a very similar SH2-SH3 orientation, which in turn resembles the SH3-SH2 arrangement observed in the repressed, “closed” form of Hck and Src (Fig.3). When superimposed on their SH2 domain, the SH3 domains of the crystallographic FynSH32 structures are related to each other by a rotation of maximally 10° around the vector connecting the Cαs of residues Ile-144 and Gln-145. A similar rotation is sufficient to superimpose the SH3 domains of FynSH32 upon the SH3 domain of the inactive Src kinase.Figure 3Regulatory fragments of Src family kinases, superimposed on the basis of their SH2 domain. The two molecules of FynSH32 from the P21 crystal form are shown in red andyellow, the regulatory fragments of the intact Src kinases Hck and Src are shown in dark red and magenta,respectively, and the isolated structure of LckSH32 is shown incyan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the flexibility of the SH3-SH2 domain orientation in solution, the individual correlation times of the domains were determined from 15N NMR relaxation data (TableI). A marked difference is observed between the correlation times of the SH3 and SH2 domains, in agreement with the differences in their masses. This indicates that the individual SH domains of FynSH32 are not associated rigidly but show interdomain motions. This interpretation agrees with the analysis of local motion using 15N-{1H} NOEs (Fig.4). The15N-{1H} NOE is highly sensitive to nano- to picosecond movements of each HN-N bond vector, where a reduction of the 15N-{1H} NOE reflects local flexibility. The 15N-{1H} NOEs are slightly lower than expected from the overall correlation times of the SH domains, which is likely to be due to the relatively fast amide proton exchange at pH 7.0. Apart from the N- and C-terminal residues, Gly-117, Ile-144, and Leu-154 show significantly reduced15N-{1H} NOEs, indicating substantial fast motions. High mobility of the loop comprising Gly-117 has been observed before in the single FynSH3 domain (21Morton C.J. Pugh D.J.R. Brown E.L.J. Kahmann J.D. Renzoni D.A.C. Campbell I.D. Structure. 1996; 4: 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Leu-154 lies on the surface of the SH2 domain, 13 Å away from the SH3-SH2 linker, and therefore cannot be important for the flexibility of the domain interface; its low NOE probably reflects only local conformational flexibility. Ile-144 lies in the linker region and was identified as a hinge in the crystallographic analysis. Hence, the high mobility of Ile-144 is likely to be correlated with the observed interdomain flexibility of the SH3-SH2 domains. The remaining linker residues 146–148 could not be observed, most likely because these relatively unprotected amide protons exchange rapidly with solvent.Table ICorrelation times of the SH domains determined from 15N NMR relaxation dataSH3 in SH32SH2 in SH32SH3 in SH32*FAKp3/2SH2 in SH32*FAKp3/215N T1 (ms)665 ± 79655 ± 90708 ± 69733 ± 7115N T2 (ms)80.0 ± 9.767.0 ± 8.369.3 ± 7.458.5 ± 6.3τc(iso) (ns)8.8 ± 0.19.7 ± 0.29.9 ± 0.211.1 ± 0.2Isotropic correlation times and average 15N longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times of the individual SH domains are given for FynSH32 and the FynSH32*FAKp3/2 complex. Open table in a new tab Isotropic correlation times and average 15N longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times of the individual SH domains are given for FynSH32 and the FynSH32*FAKp3/2 complex. The crystallographic and NMR observations are consistent with a favored relative orientation of the SH3 and SH2 domains with some degree of flexibility (Fig. 3). This characteristic is probably shared by the Src family members Src, Hck, and Fyn because they have similar domain-domain interfaces. In all three members, the interface is formed by a 10-amino acid linker region, which contains a short stretch of 310 helix (residues 144–146). The linker region contacts both SH2 and SH3 domains, burying 600 and 450 Å2 of molecular surface, respectively. The surface of the linker region is formed mainly by side chains of the 310 helix, which is anchored to the SH2 domain via hydrophobic contacts between Ile-144 of the linker and Trp-149, Tyr-150, Tyr-185, and Leu-224 of the SH2 domain. The whole interface is largely hydrophobic in character, which, while favoring some rotational movements of the SH3-SH2 domains relative to each other, will discourage gross rearrangements that would expose hydrophobic surfaces. The preferred arrangement is further stabilized by an electrostatic interaction between Glu-148 of the linker region and Lys-105 of the SH3 domain (Fig.5 A). Molecular models of three other isolated SH3-SH2 tandem domains have been published: Abl (16Jones R.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Grb2 (32Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Fromage N. Arnoux B. Becquart J. Ducruix A. Science. 1995; 268: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and Lck (33Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The short 310 helix that stabilizes the Fyn SH3-SH2 disposition is not found in the linker regions of non-Src kinases, which explains why the SH3-SH2 arrangements of Grb2 and Abl are different from that of Fyn. The correlation time of the individual SH domains of AblSH32 (29Fushman D. Xu R. Cowburn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10225-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is similar to that of FynSH32. The isotropic correlation times of Abl SH3 and SH2 are 8.9 ± 0.1 ns and 9.5 ± 0.1 ns, respectively, indicating a slightly tighter coupling than that seen in Fyn. Lck is a Src family member, and the structure of LckSH32 has been solved in the presence and absence of a phosphorylated peptide ligand for the SH2 domain (33Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In both crystal forms, LckSH32 adopts a similar conformation, which is clearly distinct from isolated FynSH32 and consequently from the SH3-SH2 arrangement of the closed form of Src and Hck. The superimposition of FynSH32 and LckSH32 by their SH2 domains reveals that the different relative position of Lck SH3 is a consequence of a conformational change of residues Asn-120 and Ser-121 (Asp-142 and Ser-143 in Fyn). Molecular modeling does not reveal any amino acid substitution in Lck that could hinder the positioning of its SH3 domain as seen in isolated FynSH32 and inactive Hck and Src. This SH3 position is, however, likely to be less stable in Lck due to a Pro-X-Pro motif (residues 146–148 in Fyn numbering). The first proline blocks formation of the 310 helix, whereas the second proline, equivalent to Glu-148 of Fyn, is unable to establish the electrostatic interaction with Lys-105 (Fig.5 B). In addition, hydrophobicity analysis indicates that the face of the SH3 domain that packs against the SH3-SH2 linker in Lck is less hydrophobic than that in Fyn. Taken together, our observations show that the preferred relative orientation between SH3"
https://openalex.org/W2163098172,"The asialoglycoprotein receptor is an abundant hetero-oligomeric endocytic receptor that is predominantly expressed on the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocytes. A number of physiological and pathophysiological functions have been ascribed to this hepatic lectin (HL), the removal of desialylated serum glycoproteins and apoptotic cells, clearance of lipoproteins, and the sites of entry for hepatotropic viruses. The assembly of two homologous subunits, HL-1 and HL-2, is required to form functional, high affinity receptors on the cell surface. However, the importance of the individual subunits for receptor transport to the cell surface is controversial. We have previously generated HL-2-deficient mice and showed that the expression of HL-1 was significantly reduced, and the functional activity as the asialoglycoprotein receptor was virtually eliminated. However, we failed to detect phenotypic abnormalities. To explore the significance of the major HL-1 subunit for receptor expression and function in vivo, we have disrupted theHL-1 gene in mice. Homozygous HL-1-deficient animals are superficially normal. HL-2 expression in the liver is virtually abrogated, indicating that HL-1 is strictly required for the stable expression of HL-2. Although these mice are almost unable to clear asialo-orosomucoid, a high affinity ligand for asialoglycoprotein receptor, they do not accumulate desialylated glycoproteins or lipoproteins in the plasma. The asialoglycoprotein receptor is an abundant hetero-oligomeric endocytic receptor that is predominantly expressed on the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocytes. A number of physiological and pathophysiological functions have been ascribed to this hepatic lectin (HL), the removal of desialylated serum glycoproteins and apoptotic cells, clearance of lipoproteins, and the sites of entry for hepatotropic viruses. The assembly of two homologous subunits, HL-1 and HL-2, is required to form functional, high affinity receptors on the cell surface. However, the importance of the individual subunits for receptor transport to the cell surface is controversial. We have previously generated HL-2-deficient mice and showed that the expression of HL-1 was significantly reduced, and the functional activity as the asialoglycoprotein receptor was virtually eliminated. However, we failed to detect phenotypic abnormalities. To explore the significance of the major HL-1 subunit for receptor expression and function in vivo, we have disrupted theHL-1 gene in mice. Homozygous HL-1-deficient animals are superficially normal. HL-2 expression in the liver is virtually abrogated, indicating that HL-1 is strictly required for the stable expression of HL-2. Although these mice are almost unable to clear asialo-orosomucoid, a high affinity ligand for asialoglycoprotein receptor, they do not accumulate desialylated glycoproteins or lipoproteins in the plasma. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) 1The abbreviations used are:ASGPRasialoglycoprotein receptorHLhepatic lectinMHLmouse hepatic lectinESembryonic stemASORasialo-orosomucoidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLDLlow density lipoproteinHDLhigh density lipoproteinapoapolipoproteinMAAMaackia amurensis agglutininSNASambucus nigra agglutininRCARicinus communis agglutininkbkilobasekbpkilobase pair was originally identified by Ashwell and Morell as a hepatic receptor that mediates the rapid clearance of serum glycoproteins containing terminal galactose residues from the circulation (see Refs. 1Ashwell G. Morell A.G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1974; 41: 99-128PubMed Google Scholar, 2Spiess M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10009-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 3Stockert R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 591-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar for review). ASGPR is abundantly expressed on the sinusoidal surface of the parenchymal cells of the liver. Its primary physiological function has been considered to be the removal and degradation of desialylated circulating proteins.Nonreducing terminal of oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins are usually capped by sialic acid residues. When the terminal sialic acid residues are removed by neuraminidases, penultimate galactose residues are exposed and recognized by ASGPR. High affinity binding requires the receptor to be assembled as a hetero-oligomer consisting of two highly homologous subunits termed hepatic lectin (HL) 1 and 2 (4Lodish H.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 374-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both subunits contain an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane segment, a stalk domain, and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (5Halberg D.F. Wager R.E. Farrell D.C. Hildreth J., IV Quesenberry M.S. Loeb J.A. Holland E.C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9828-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASGPR belongs to C-type animal lectins because of the requirement of Ca2+for ligand binding and disulfide bonds in carbohydrate recognition domains (6Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A number of diverse physiological roles have been proposed for ASGPR over the years. Among them, hepatic clearance of the desialylated and senascent serum proteins was most originally proposed (1Ashwell G. Morell A.G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1974; 41: 99-128PubMed Google Scholar). ASGPR was also postulated to account for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-independent clearance of lipoproteins including chylomicron remnants (7Windler E. Greeve J. Levkau B. Kolb-Bachofen V. Daerr W. Greten H. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Ishibashi S. Perrey S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N.

Med. 2000; 191: 1171-1181Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and fibronectin (10Rotundo R.F. Rebres R.A. McKeown-Longo P.J. Blumenstock F.A. Saba T.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have emerged as likely candidates of natural ligands for ASGPR. The clearance of apoptotic cells or a subpopulation of lymphocytes in the liver has also attributed to ASGPR (See Ref. 3Stockert R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 591-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar for review). It is particularly noteworthy that ASGPR has also been proposed to be utilized as entry sites into hepatocytes by several hepatotropic viruses including hepatitis B virus (11Treichel U. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Stockert R.J. Poralla T. Gerken G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3021-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), Marburg virus (12Becker S. Spiess M. Klenk H.-D. J. Gen.

Virol. 2000; 74: 10950-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).As an attempt to elucidate the bona fide functions of ASGPR, we have previously generated mice lacking a minor subunit of mouse ASGPR (MHL-2) (14Ishibashi S. Hammer R.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of disruption of MHL-2, the expression of MHL-1 was severely reduced, and the plasma clearance of asialo-orosomucoid was almost completely abrogated in theMHL-2−/− mice. However, the MHL-2−/− mice were apparently normal and showed no detectable abnormalities even in the metabolism of remnant lipoproteins. Because MHL-2−/−liver expresses small but significant amounts of MHL-1 (14Ishibashi S. Hammer R.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Broun J.R. Willnow T.E. Ishibashi S. Ashwall G. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is still possible that the residual MHL-1 is sufficient to execute the primary task of ASGPR as suggested by in vitro transfection experiments (16Braiterman L.T.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2855-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the current study we have generated mice lacking the major subunit (MHL-1) of ASGPR in mice and analyzed the resulting phenotypes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of MHL-1 Knockout MiceThe MHL-1 gene was cloned from the 129/Sv mouse genomic library. The genomic organization of the MHL-1 gene was essentially the same as recently reported by Soukharev et al. (18Soukharev S. Berlin W. Hanover J.A. Bethke B. Sauer B. Gene. 2000; 241: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed so that the genomic fragment containing exons 2–3, which encoded the ATG initiation codon and transmembrane domain, was replaced by the pol2neo cassette (19Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). The short arm containing a 0.8-kb StuI/BamHI fragment containing exon 2 and the long arm containing a 9-kbXhoI/SalI fragment spanning exons 3–9 were inserted into the XhoI and NotI sites, respectively, of the vector pPol2short-neobpA-HSVTK as described previously (14Ishibashi S. Hammer R.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tozawa R. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yagyu H. Oka T. Chen Z. Ohashi K. Perrey S. Shionoiri F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30843-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).After linearization by digestion with SalI, the vector was electroporated into JH-1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (a gift from Dr. Herz at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Targeted clones, which had been selected in the presence of G418 and 1-(2-deoxy,2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5 iodouracil, were identified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-CTGGTCAGGGATATTTGGAGATACGG-3′ and 5′-GATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCATGC-3′ (see Fig. 1). Homologous recombination was verified by Southern blot analysis after digesting the genomic DNA with EcoRI using a 0.7-kbp StuI fragment as a probe (see Fig. 1). Targeted ES clones were injected into the C57BL/6 blastocysts, yielding 14 lines of chimeric mice that transmitted the disrupted allele through the germline from four independent ES cell clones. All experiments reported here were performed with 129/Sv-C57BL6 hybrid descendants (F1 and subsequent generations) of these animals.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from the liver by TriZOLTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 20 μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in an agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MHL-1 and MHL-2cDNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a kit (Megaprime labeling kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were used as probes for hybridization (14Ishibashi S. Hammer R.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Image capture and analysis were performed with BAS 2000 (Fuji Film).Immunoblot AnalysisLiver membrane proteins were prepared as described (14Ishibashi S. Hammer R.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50 μg of the proteins was separated by 5–20% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under a nonreducing condition. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblot analyses were performed using specific rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies for MHL-1 and MHL-2 (14Ishibashi S. Hammer R.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies were visualized by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Plasma Turnover ExperimentsAsialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) was prepared by incubating 100 mg of orosomucoid (Sigma) at 37 °C in 10 ml of sodium acetate buffer containing 2 mmCaCl2, pH 5, together with 1 unit of neuraminidase-type XA (Clostridium perfringens) attached to agarose beads (Sigma). After 4 h another unit of enzyme was added, and the incubation was continued overnight. Asialofetuin (Sigma) and ASOR were labeled with 125I using the IODO-GEN procedure (Pierce). Specific activities of 125I-asialofetuin and125I-ASOR were 257 and 502 cpm/ng, respectively. 10 μg of iodinated protein in 200 μl of saline containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were injected intravenously into the jugular vein of anesthetized male mice (n = 3) that were wild-type and homozygous for MHL-1 gene disruption. Blood was collected at the indicated intervals from the retroorbital venous plexus. After the labeled proteins in 20 μl of plasma were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, their radioactivities were determined.Analyses of Mouse Plasma Lipoprotein ProfilePlasma lipoprotein analyses were performed as previously described (21Yagyu H. Ishibashi S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Okazaki M. Perrey S. Kitamine T. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1677-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after mice were bled from the retroorbital venous plexus, the blood was collected into tubes containing EDTA. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the plasma were determined enzymatically using kits (Determiner TC555 and Determiner TG555; Kyowa Medex). 5 μl of plasma was diluted to 100 μl with saline and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses using four columns of TSK gel Lipopropak XL (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) connected in tandem.Lectin Blot Analyses of Plasma Protein1 μl of plasma was separated by 3–15% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under a reducing condition and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Lectin blotting was done using Maackia amurensisagglutinin (MAA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which were conjugated with digoxigenin, and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA120; Sigma), which was conjugated with biotin. Digoxigenin and biotin were detected by alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Digoxigenin detection kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-biotin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively.RESULTSThe MHL-1 gene was cloned by hybridization screening of a mouse genomic library using a mouse cDNA probe. A gene replacement vector was constructed so that the initiation codon and transmembrane domain were interrupted by the pol2neo cassette (Fig.1 A). Following electroporation of the linearized targeting vector into JH-1 ES cells, targeted clones were obtained. Chimeric mice were generated from six independently targeted clones using a standard procedure. Four independent ES cell cloned yielded total of 14 germ line chimeric males. They were bred to wild-type female C57BL/6 mice. Heterozygous offspring (F1 generation) were crossed with each other and gave rise to mice wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (±), or homozygous (−/−) for the disruptedMHL-1 allele in accordance with Mendelian law (+/+:±:−/− = 29:65:43; χ2 = 1.51; p = 0.47) (Fig.1 B). Homozygous MHL-1-deficient mice were viable and displayed no obvious phenotype under laboratory housing conditions. The animals appeared to have a normal life span.Northern blot analysis showed that MHL-1−/− mice lacked 1.3-kb wild-type MHL-1 transcript completely (Fig.2 A). MHL-1+/− mice expressed an intermediate amount of the MHL-1 transcript. A reduced amount of truncated MHL-1 transcript was expressed in mice having the disrupted MHL-1 allele (MHL-1+/− or MHL-1−/−). On the other hand, there were no differences in the size and amounts of MHL-2mRNA. The disruption of the MHL-1 gene resulted in complete absence of the 40-kDa-encoded protein in MHL-1−/−animals (Fig. 2 B). MHL-1+/− mice showed reduced expression of MHL-1 protein as compared with the wild-type mice, indicating the gene dosage effect on the expressed protein levels of MHL-1. In wild-type and MHL-1+/− mice, four distinct bands that were immunoreactive with the anti-MHL-2 antibody were observed (36, 47, 80, and 192 kDa). Because the bands with higher molecular mass were not observed under a reducing condition (data not shown), three of these multiple bands may represent oligomers of MHL-2 protein in different degrees (monomer for 36 kDa, dimer for 80 kDa, and tetramer for 192 kDa). No bands immunoreactive with the anti-MHL-2 antibody were visible in MHL-1−/− mice.Figure 2Northern and Western blot analysis of ASGPR subunits in mouse liver.

The size of the molecular mass markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine whether the disruption of the MHL-1 gene resulted in the impairment of the hepatic clearance of asialoglycoproteins, we injected the iodinated asialofetuin or ASOR into +/+, +/−, and −/− mice and compared the radioactivities remaining in the plasma (Fig.3). The plasma clearance of125I-asialofetuin was severely, albeit not completely, impaired in MHL-1−/− mice (Fig. 3 A). At 30 min after the injection, plasma 125I-asialofetuin was decreased to 4, 8, and 40% of the initial dose in +/+, +/−, and −/− mice, respectively. Heterozygous mice cleared 125I-asialofertuin with only partially reduced efficiency. The plasma clearance of125I-ASOR was more severely impaired inMHL-1−/− mice (Fig. 3 B). At 30 min after the injection, plasma 125I-ASOR was decreased to 3, 24, and 65% of the initial dose in +/+, +/−, and −/− mice, respectively. Heterozygous mice cleared 125I-ASOR with intermediate efficiency.Figure 3Disappearance of 125I-labeled glycoproteins from the plasma. 125I-labeled asialofetuin (Panel A) or asialo-orosomucoid (Panel B) was injected into 12-week-old female mice wild-type (●), heterozygous (○), and homozygous (X) for theMHL-1 gene disruption. Values shown are means of triplicates of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity remaining in plasma at the indicated time points and are calculated as a percentage of radioactivity present 1 min after injection of the label.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the expression of the sialic acid- and galactose-terminated serum glycoproteins, plasma from the wild-type andMHL-1−/− mice were subjected to lectin blot analysis (Fig.4). The following lectins were used to detect terminal sugars: MAA, a lectin specific for NeuNAc(α2–3)Gal on N-linked carbohydrate; SNA, a lectin specific for NeuNAc(α2–6)Gal on N-linked carbohydrate; and RCA120, a lectin specific for β-galactose. There were no consistent differences either in the pattern of the bands or in their intensities betweenMHL-1+/+ and MHL-1−/− mice.Figure 4Lectin blot of plasma proteins. Blood was collected from 32-week-old male mice wild-type (lanes 1–5) or homozygous (lanes 6–10) for theMHL-1 disruption. Lectin blotting was done using MAA, SNA that were conjugated with digoxygenin, and RCA120 that was conjugated with biotin. Digoxigenin and biotin were detected by alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody and alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-biotin antibody, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test whether ASGPR is involved in chylomicron remnant clearance by the liver, we analyzed the plasma lipid levels of MHL-1−/−mice and MHL-1−/− mice that also lacked the LDL receptor (Table I). The plasma lipid levels of the MHL-1−/− mice were indistinguishable from those of control animals expressing wild-type MHL-1, in the absence or presence of functional LDL receptors. The lipoprotein profiles evaluated by HPLC analyses failed to reveal any differences in lipoprotein fractions between wild-type and MHL-1 −/− mice (Table II).Table IPlasma lipid levels in mice deficient in MHL-1LDLRMHL-1nTCTGmg/dl+ /++ /+483 ± 2289 ± 6+ /++ /−4105 ± 1199 ± 17+ /+− /−489 ± 18102 ± 38− /−+ /+5328 ± 70277 ± 33− /−+ /−9327 ± 21268 ± 29− /−− /−7279 ± 19233 ± 27Blood was collected from mice aged 8–12 weeks after an overnight fast.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONWe have generated mice lacking functional asialoglycoprotein receptors by disrupting the gene for the major MHL-1 receptor subunit by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. HomozygousMHL-1-deficient mice displayed no obvious phenotype as long as they were maintained under the standard laboratory housing condition.Although MHL-1−/− liver expressed a reduced amount of a truncated transcript, no band immunoreactive with the anti-MHL-1 antibody was detected, indicating that MHL-1−/− mice were virtually null for the MHL-1 gene. In MHL-1+/−mice, the amounts of both mRNA and protein of MHL-1 were reduced 2-fold, indicating the gene-dosage effects of the inactivation. This reduction was accompanied by the reduction in the amounts of MHL-2 protein, even if the mRNA levels were not affected. InMHL-1−/− mice, MHL-2 protein was undetectable. These results strongly indicate that MHL-1 is obligatorily required for the stable expression of MHL-2. This is consistent with the in vitro results in transfected cells that the minor subunit is unstable in the absence of coexpression of the major subunit (22Shia M.A. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Wikstrom L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wikstrom L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 168: 14412-14416Google Scholar). Without HL-1, HL-2 may succumb to degradation within endoplasmic reticulum. It is interesting to compare this to MHL-2−/−mice in which substantially reduced but still significant amounts of MHL-1 were expressed. Together these results indicate that both subunits are required for the stable expression of oligomeric receptor and that HL-1 is more strictly required than HL-2.As was observed in MHL-2−/− mice, the plasma clearance of asialoglycoproteins was severely impaired in MHL-1−/− mice (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that the impairment of the clearance of ASOR appeared milder than that of asialofetuin in the heterozygotes. This is probably because some other pathway also contributes to the plasma clearance of asialofetuin but not to that of ASOR. For example, a macrophage lectin that is conceivably expressed in hepatic Kupffer cells may mediate this uptake, because it recognizes both galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (25Oda S. Sato M. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Ii M. Kurata H. Itoh N. Yamashina I. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11295-11298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma clearance curve of ASOR was indistinguishable from that of orosomucoid (data not shown), suggesting that MHL-1−/−mice clear ASOR via a pathway(s) that is irrelevant to the galactose-recognition system. Although ASGPR function was severely impaired in MHL-1−/− mice, the plasma glycoproteins levels were not significantly increased (Fig. 4). Together with our previous observations in MHL-2 knockout mice, ASGPR is unlikely to be essential for the homeostasis of the major plasma glycoproteins as has been frequently discussed. In support of this, Kido et al.(27Kido M. Asano M. Iwakura Y. Ichinose M. Miki K. Furukawa K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have recently reported that serum glycoprotein levels were maintained in mice lacking β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I. Although nearly 90% of the serum glycoproteins lacked β-1,4-galactose in the knockout mice, their serum protein concentrations were similar to those in wild-type mice. This does not necessarily rule out the possible role of ASGPR in the regulation of minor serum glycoproteins (28Drickamer K. Cell. 1991; 67: 1029-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this context, Rotundo et al. (10Rotundo R.F. Rebres R.A. McKeown-Longo P.J. Blumenstock F.A. Saba T.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have proposed that ASGPR is responsible for the disposal of cellular fibronectin from the plasma and/or in the liver. Cellular fibronectin contains large amounts of terminal galactose residues, and intravenous infusion of excess asialofetuin caused retention of labeled cellular fibronectin in the liver (29Rutondo R.F. Vincent P.A. McKeown-Longo P.J. Blumenstock F.A. Saba T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1189-G1199PubMed Google Scholar). However, in multiple experiments not shown here, by Western blot analyses in the liver membrane we failed to find the abnormal accumulation of fibronectin in the liver of MHL-1−/− mice. Furthermore, we failed to find significant morphological changes in the liver of MHL-1−/− mice. With regard to IgA metabolism, Rifai et al. (9Rifai A. Fadden K. Morrison S.L. Chintalacharuvu K.R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1171-1181Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have recently reported the impaired clearance of the IgA2 isoform in MHL-2−/− mice. However, its physiological relevance is currently unknown.Windler et al. (7Windler E. Greeve J. Levkau B. Kolb-Bachofen V. Daerr W. Greten H. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) proposed a possible function of ASGPR in the hepatic lipoproteins metabolism. ApoB-100 and apo(a) are heavily glycosylated giant proteins. Therefore it is reasonable to consider that the lipoproteins containing these apolipoproteins is cleared by ASGPR when the LDL receptor system is dysfunctional. To test this hypothesis, we crossed MHL-1−/− mice to the LDL receptor-deficient mice to generate mice lacking both ASGPR and the LDL receptor. As was the case in the mice lacking both MHL-2 and the LDL receptor, we failed to detect the elevation of plasma lipoproteins as compared with the LDL receptor knockout mice (Tables I and II). Accumulating evidence indicates that LDL receptor-related protein is involved in the plasma clearance of apoE-rich remnant lipoproteins (30Rohmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of ASGPR in the plasma clearance of lipoproteins is minimal if present.ASGPR is a member of animal C-type lectins (6Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because most of C-type lectins appear to be involved in host defense, ASGPR may have been evolved as a molecule to protect mammals from viral or bacterial insults (31Schauer R. Sander-Wewer M.

The ASGPR system may protect vertebrates from pathogenic organisms that take advantage of neuraminidase to invade the hosts. A significant decrease in the expression of ASGPR accompanied by accumulation of serum asialoglycoproteins is observed in the patients with advanced liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis (33Marshall J.S.

Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 reduces its ability to bind to eIF4E and thereby to compete with eIF4G. A novel combination of biophysical and biochemical tools was used to measure the impact of phosphorylation and acidic side chain substitution at each potentially modulatory site in 4E-BP1. For each individual site, we have analyzed the effects of modification on eIF4E binding using affinity chromatography and surface plasmon resonance analysis, and on the regulatory function of the 4E-BP1 protein using a yeast in vivo model system and a mammalian in vitro translation assay. We find that modifications at the two sites immediately flanking the eIF4E-binding domain, Thr46 and Ser65, consistently have the most significant effects, and that phosphorylation of Ser65 causes the greatest reduction in binding affinity. These results establish a quantitative framework that should contribute to understanding of the molecular interactions underlying 4E-BP1-mediated translational regulation.

Eukaryotic translation is an example of a major cellular process that may be regulated in this way at a number of steps in the overall pathway (3Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). A key point of translational regulation is at the step of ribosome binding to the 5′ end of cellular mRNA. Ribosome-mRNA binding involves interactions mediated by the cap-binding complex eIF4F1 (Fig. 1 A). Mammalian eIF4F comprises the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A (4Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). The largest eIF4F component (5Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), eIF4G, has binding sites for eIF4E, eIF3, eIF4A, the poly(A)-binding protein and the mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase Mnk1 (5Imataka H.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). More recent work indicates that yeast eIF4G also binds to the mRNA decapping protein (Dcp1; Ref. 11Vilela C. Velasco C. Ptushkina M. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eIF4F complex is tethered to the mRNA cap by the 25-kDa cap-binding protein, eIF4E. eIF3 is believed to form a bridge between the 40 S ribosomal subunit and eIF4F, whereas the binding of eIF4G to poly(A)-binding protein may play a role in promoting interaction between the 3′ and 5′ ends of mRNA. The significance of the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4A is not clear, but the latter factor (together with eIF4B) catalyzes ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that may promote ribosomal scanning along structured mRNA (12Sonenberg N. Gingras A.-C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Mnk1 phosphorylates eIF4E, which may in turn increase this factor's affinity for the mRNA cap (13Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The cell regulates eIF4F activity in response to environmental changes and various stimuli, including temperature stress and stimulation by hormones (3Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N.

Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 581-593Google Scholar). Deviations from normal levels of eIF4F activity can have drastic effects on cellular functions. For example, overexpression of eIF4E leads to cell transformation and changes in cell morphology (16Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 17De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The eIF4E-eIF4G interaction is of central importance for cap-dependent initiation, and can be blocked by small regulatory proteins that bind to eIF4E, the 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs; Refs. 18Lin T.A.

Inhibition by 4E-BP1 is apparently inversely dependent on its level of phosphorylation, whereby the hypophosphorylated form binds most tightly to eIF4E (19Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C.

Cell transformation caused by overexpression of eIF4E is reversed by simultaneous overexpression of the 4E-BP1 gene (22Rousseau D. Gingras A.-C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work (23Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G.

The binding sites for eIF4G of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the yeast eIF4E-binding protein p20 (which is also a phosphoprotein (27Zanchin N.I.T. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26505-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) overlap within this dorsal region on yeast eIF4E (23Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There is also another yeast 4E-binding protein, called Eap1, that is suspected to act partially as a 4E-BP1 functional analogue (28Cosentino G.P. Schmelzle T. Haghighat A. Helliwell S.B. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and possesses an eIF4E-binding motif similar to that of p20. 4E-BP1 binds to the equivalent region on the dorsal face of human eIF4E (24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T.

Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), but this regulatory protein uses a slightly different set of molecular contacts to those involved in eIF4G binding (24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T.

The binding of protein ligands at the dorsal site of yeast or human eIF4E is capable of stabilizing cap binding at the ventral cap-binding slot (23Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30551-30555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), although the physiological significance of this effect has yet to be determined. The mammalian 4E-BPs seem to mediate strong regulation of translationin vivo (3Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar, 12Sonenberg N. Gingras A.-C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to yeast p20 (30McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,33De la Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which may possibly be involved in the fine tuning of translation rates (23Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the key role of the 4E-BPs in the regulation of translation, it is important to elucidate the mechanism underlying this modulation. The binding affinities of the nonphosphorylated 4E-BPs for human eIF4E are high (estimated KD values of 10−8-10−9m) and comparable with recent estimates of the binding affinity between eIF4E and the eIF4E-binding domain of eIF4G of yeast (23Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Youtani T. Tomoo K. Ishida T. Miyoshi H. Miura K. International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Life. 2000; 49: 27-31Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs have the potential to compete effectively with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E and therefore to act as potent translational inhibitors. In the present study, we extend this comparison by estimating the binding affinities of phosphorylated forms of a 4E-BP. Six sites of phosphorylation on rat 4E-BP1 (also known as PHAS-I) have been mapped (Fig. 1 B), but there is disagreement about the roles of the respective sites in regulation, while the kinases involvedin vivo remain poorly characterized. These correspond in the human 4E-BP1 sequence (which is almost identical to PHAS-I) to Thr37, Thr46, Ser65, Thr70, Ser83, and Ser112 (35, 36; Fig. 1iB). In rat adipocytes, phosphorylation at the first four of these sites is increased in response to insulin and partially decreased in the presence of rapamycin (35Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 37Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The effect of rapamycin is currently explained by proposing that at least two of the sites (Thr37 and Thr46) are phosphorylated by a FRAP/mTOR-associated pathway (38Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersbold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the Akt/PKB protein kinase also seem to act via a further pathway that does not involve FRAP/mTOR (39Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, the kinases directly responsible for phosphorylating 4E-BP1 in vivo have not been identified, and much uncertainty remains about the signaling pathways leading to phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs (see Ref. 3Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar for review). The other key area yet to be resolved concerns the influence of phosphorylation on the molecular function of 4E-BP1. Some reports have concluded that phosphorylation of Thr37 and Thr46 (40Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), or of Thr46 alone (35Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 41Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence J.C. FEBS Letts. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), is capable of inhibiting the eIF4E-4E-BP1 interaction. In contrast, another group observed no loss of binding associated with phosphorylation at these two sites, and proposed that their primary function is to trigger phosphorylation at the other sites on 4E-BP1 (38Gingras A.-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersbold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). This interdependence of phosphorylation events has been questioned by others (37Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 42Heesom K.J. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Heesom and Denton (42Heesom K.J. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have concluded that the phosphorylation of Ser65 leads to dissociation of 4E-BP1-eIF4E, whereas phosphorylation at Thr37 and Thr46 does not disrupt this complex. In this paper we focus on the molecular consequences of phosphorylation at the sites on 4E-BP1 that are most relevant to eIF4E binding, showing how these can contribute to the regulatory function of this protein in vivo. The result is a quantitative biophysical model of molecular regulation that helps explain how different degrees of inhibition can be achieved by phosphorylation at the respective phosphorylatable sites. Mutagenesis via a polymerase chain reaction-based technique (43Mikaelian J. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) yielded products which could be inserted between either the NdeI andEcoRI sites of the yeast expression vector YCpSUPEX2 (44Oliveira C.C. Van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol.

Gene ( Amst .). 1994; 143: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The genes for expression in yeast all encode an N-terminal “Flag,” MDYKDDDDKT, which appears to enhance the stability of the protein in yeast (24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Hughes J.M.X. Ptushkina M. Karim M.M. Koloteva N. von der Haar T. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol.

The genes for expression in E. coli all contain 12 histidine codons between the first and second 4E-BP1 codons, thus facilitating (using nickel ion affinity) both purification of the protein and binding to the sensor chip surface used for SPR. The nucleotide sequence of each of the variants in both vectors was confirmed to be free of any spurious mutations. 4E-BP1 function was assayed in yeast strain Jo56 (cdc33::LEU2 his3 ura3 ade3 (YCpTrp-hu4E TRP1), Ref. 29Hughes J.M.X.

The cdc33disruption in Jo56 was complemented by the human eIF4E gene in the plasmid YCpTrp-hu4E. 4E-BP1 expression was induced by transferring the cells to galactose-containing selective medium. Expression of each of the 4E-BP1 derivatives was also tested in a strain with intactCDC33 as control. The phenotypes of two independently isolated derivatives of each 4E-BP1 allele were tested, and each allele was re-tested after re-cloning into a fresh YCpSUPEX2 vector background. Expression of the 4E-BP1 genes contained in pCYTEXP3 was achieved by a temperature shift from 30 to 42 °C in the protease-deficient E. coli strain CAG629 (46Grossman A.D. Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Cell. 1984; 38: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The proteins were then purified denatured on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). For analysis of the sites of phosphorylation, 2 μg of 4E-BP1 were incubated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 1% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm ATP with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.45 units of activated recombinant ERK2 in a total volume of 20 μl for 2 h at 23 °C. The reference activity of ERK2 was estimated using myelin basic protein as substrate. ERK2 was generously given by Dr. C. Armstrong, Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee. For SPR analysis, 20 μg of recombinant 4E-BP1 was phosphorylated with 2.25 units of ERK2 under the same conditions, but in a total reaction volume of 100 μl and excluding radiolabeled ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by adding SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, each to 1%, and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radiolabeled 4E-BP1 was eluted from the gel by shaking overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Gel pieces were removed with Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Costar) and the labeled protein was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. After removal of the trichloroacetic acid by extensive washing, the protein was digested overnight at 30 °C with trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.1% Zwittergens, or with trypsin and chymotrypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 0.2%n-octylglucopyranoside (Calbiochem). The peptide mixtures were acidified by adding 3 volumes of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Gilson) using a Vydac C18 (250 mm long × 4.6-mm internal diameter) reversed-phase column developed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile. The main radiolabeled fractions were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (47Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Electrophoresis in the first dimension was performed at pH 1.9, and chromatography in the second dimension with buffer containing isobutyric acid. Capped and polyadenylated luciferase mRNA was synthesized in vitrofrom a luciferase gene inserted into plasmid pHST7 (11Vilela C. Velasco C. Ptushkina M. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 16.5 μl of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (micrococcal nuclease-treated, Promega) was mixed with 125 ng of 4E-BP1 in 0.5 μl of buffer A (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2), plus RNasin (final concentration 1 unit/μl) and amino acids (final concentration of each, 40 μm) in a total volume of 24 μl. The mixture was preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min, programmed by the addition of 1 μl containing 0.1 μg of mRNA and incubated a further 90 min. Luciferase activity was then measured using a luminometer. 2 μg of 4E-BP1 were labeled with 32P, as described above, and separated from [γ-32P]ATP by gel-filtration through Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sample was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of eIF4E, to give a total volume of 370 μl (in buffer A, see above), then incubated at 15 °C for 15 min before mixing with 30 μl of m7GTP-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubating for a further 90 min with gentle agitation. The resin was subsequently washed three times with 400 μl of the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of 0.1 mmm7GTP in the same buffer. In controls, further elution steps were performed to demonstrate that all of the eIF4E (and, if present, associated proteins) had been eluted. The protein fractions were precipitated with ice-cold acetone and resolved by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The quantities of radiolabeled proteins in the gel were determined using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 image analyzer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Image Quant software. Phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was separated from nonphosphorylated 4E-BP1 by native gel electrophoresis after loading the phosphorylation reaction mixture directly onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (49Shi Q. Jackowski G. Hames B.D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 1-50Google Scholar), with an aliquot of32P-labeled 4E-BP1 run in parallel as a marker. Phosphoprotein was eluted from macerated gel slices directly into buffer B (10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20 (Biacore), and 50 μm EDTA). Gel pieces were removed using a Spin-X centrifuge tube filter (Coster) and the solution was concentrated using a Vivaspin polyethersulfone membrane with a 5-kDa exclusion limit (Vivascience). All SPR assays were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument essentially as described previously (24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 4E-BP1 proteins in Buffer B (described above) were immobilized on the sensorchip of type NTA (Biacore). For estimation of the dissociation constant (KD), six different eIF4E concentrations, ranging from 10 nm to 1 μm, were allowed to interact with the immobilized 4E-BP1 protein. The resulting sensorgrams were evaluated using the BIA Evaluation software package. The curves were analyzed using local fittings for Langmuir binding and averaged for each protein. We examined to what extent modification at each of the threonine/serine-proline ((T/S)P) phosphorylation sites affect the translation regulatory function of 4E-BP1 by substituting acidic amino acids, either glutamic acid (Glu) or aspartic acid (Asp), for each of the threonines (Thr) or serines (Ser) at positions 37, 46, 65, 70, and 83 individually (Fig. 1 B and the substitutions listed in Fig. 3). Ser112 was not included in this study because its phosphorylation is neither rapamycin-sensitive nor is it thought to affect 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E (36Heesom K.J. Avison M.B. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We assessed the effects of these changes initially using a yeast growth assay. Previous work established a system whereby the synthesis of human 4E-BPs in yeast causes inhibition of translation and consequent reduction in growth (24Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Hughes J.M.X. Ptushkina M. Karim M.M. Koloteva N. von der Haar T. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3261-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This allows us to study translational regulation by 4E-BP1 in vivo. The system is dependent on replacement of the endogenous yeast eIF4E gene (CDC33) by the human eIF4E gene, which complements cdc33. Human, but not yeast, eIF4E is able to bind 4E-BP1 tightly, therefore only the strain with the eIF4E substitution is sensitive to 4E-BP1 expression; expression of the human 4E-BP1 gene in an unmodified yeast strain has no inhibitory effect on growth. The 4E-BP1 gene sequences were introduced into the test strain on a plasmid that allows conditional induction. We used a colony growth assay to provide semiquantitative estimates of growth inhibition and thus first indications as to the impact of the amino acid substitutions on 4E-BP1 repressive activity. When synthesis of “wild-type” 4E-BP1 was induced, colony growth was inhibited, the cell doubling time being increased to over 15 h at 30 °C (Fig.2, WT), compared with the control, in which no 4E-BP1 was synthesized and the doubling time was about 3 h (Fig. 2, CON). When the modified 4E-BP1 genes were induced, the phenotypes of most of the substituted forms were indistinguishable from that of the wild type and showed strong growth inhibition. Two of the forms, however, involving substitution of Asp for Thr at position 46 and of Glu for Ser at position 65, showed partial relief of the growth inhibition (Fig. 2, S65E and T46D; Fig.3). All of the yeast strains grew normally when the 4E-BP1 genes were repressed (Fig. 2,Repressed). Moreover, in an unmodified control strain expressing the endogenous yeast eIF4E, none of the modified 4E-BP1 genes caused any inhibitory effects (data not shown). The fact that acidic side chain substitution has effects at positions 46 and 65 suggests that these two sites are of primary importance in terms of their potential influence on the affinity of 4E-BP1 for eIF4E. If the effects on yeast growth caused by the T46D and S65E substitutions are due to reduced binding to eIF4E, then it should be possible to observe these effects on translation more directly. The effects of the acidic residue substitutions in 4E-BP1 on translation were therefore investigated using a reticulocyte lysate translation assay. The Asp- or Glu-substituted 4E-BP1 proteins were synthesized in, and purified from, E. coli (an N-terminal poly-His “ta"

Contractile force and velocity of cardiac muscle were decreased in the tail suspension rats as compared with the control. Ca2+-dependent actomyosin ATPase activity was also decreased; however, sensitivity of cardiac muscle to Ca2+ activation was unchanged. There was no change in expression of myosin heavy chain, tropomyosin, troponin T, or troponin I isoforms in hearts of tail suspension rats. A novel finding is a fragment of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) that had increased amounts in the heart of tail suspension rats. Binding of this cTnI fragment by a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the COOH terminus indicates an intact COOH terminus. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the cTnI fragment revealed truncations primarily of amino acids 1–26 and 1–27 and smaller amounts of 1–30, including Ser23 and Ser24, which are substrates of protein kinase A phosphorylation. This cTnI fragment is present in normal cardiac muscle and incorporated into myofibrils, indicating a role in regulating contractility.

Through neurohumoral regulations, this fluid redistribution induces reductions of blood volume and central venous pressure (1Convertino V. Hoffler G.W. J. Fla. Med. Assoc. 1992; 79: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar). Although decreased intrapleural pressure during space flight may assist filling of the heart (2White R.J. Blomqvist C.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 85: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), prolonged exposure to microgravity results in decreases in cardiac preload and function, evident by echocardiography of astronauts showing decreases in left ventricular end diastolic volume and ventricular stroke volume (3Bungo M.W. Goldwater D.J. Popp R.L. Sandler H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 62: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Herault S. Fomina G. Alferova I. Kotovskaya A. Poliakov V. Arbeille P. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 81: 384-390Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rats flown in space for 14 days showed decreased average cross-sectional area of the myocytes in left ventricular muscle, indicating myocardial atrophy (5Goldstein M.A. Edwards R.J. Schroeter P. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 73 (suppl.): 94-100Crossref Google Scholar). These observations suggest that prolonged exposure to microgravity induces a decrease in cardiac function. However, the regulation of cardiac muscle contractility in microgravity is unclear. In addition to the health and safety of astronauts during and after long space flight, a thorough understanding of the adaptation of cardiac muscle in microgravity will also contribute to the prevention and treatment of myocardial dysfunction in chronic bedridden, paraplegic, and heart failure patients, since similar changes are seen in their hearts (6Kashihara H. Haruna Y. Suzuki Y. Kawakubo K. Takenaka K. Bonde-Petersen F. Gunji A. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1994; 616: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kessler K.M. Pina I. Green B. Burnett B. Laighold M.

Physiol. 1996; 80: 1612-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The adaptation of myocardial contractility in microgravity may involve structural and functional modifications of contractile proteins. The contraction of cardiac muscle is based on actin-myosin interactions regulated by intracellular Ca2+ via the thin filament-based troponin-tropomyosin system (9Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The regulation of thin filament proteins may play a role in the functional adaptation of cardiac muscle. The troponin complex contains three subunits: the Ca2+-binding subunit troponin C (TnC),1 the tropomyosin (Tm)-binding subunit troponin T (TnT), and the inhibitory subunit troponin I (TnI) (10Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 235-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). During muscle contraction, Ca2+-induced interactions between TnC and TnI, TnT, Tm, and actin result in a series of allosteric conformational changes in the thin filament, translating the signal into the activation of actomyosin ATPase and development of force (10Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 235-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A key step in this signaling mechanism is the release of inhibition of TnI on actin-myosin interaction (12Perry S.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three homologous TnI genes (cardiac, fast skeletal muscle, and slow skeletal muscle) have evolved in vertebrates to encode the muscle type-specific TnI isoforms (13Hastings K.E.M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of TnI isoforms is regulated during development. The embryonic heart expresses exclusively slow skeletal muscle TnI. During perinatal heart development, the expression level of slow TnI decreases, and expression of cardiac TnI (cTnI) increases and becomes the only TnI isoform in the adult heart (14Saggin L. Gorza L. Ausoni S. Schiaffino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16299-16302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Murphy A.M. Jones L. Sims H.F. Strauss A.W.

Post-translational regulation of TnI structure and function has been found to involve both amino acid side chain modification and cleavage of the primary structure. A proteolytic truncation of 19 amino acids of the COOH terminus of cTnI has been found during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (24McDonough J.L. Arrell D.K. Van Eyk J.E. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Expression of this cTnI fragment in transgenic mice produced myocardial stunning (25Murphy A.M. Kogler H. Georgakopoulos D. McDonough J.L. Kass D.A. Van Eyk J.E. Marban E. Science. 2000; 287: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A significant difference between cTnI and skeletal muscle TnIs is an NH2-terminal extension of 32 amino acids in cTnI (12Perry S.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-adrenergic signaling pathway controls phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser23 and Ser24) in the NH2-terminal region of cTnI by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (26Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30773-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation of cTnI decreases myofilament Ca2+sensitivity by reducing the Ca2+ binding affinity of TnC (27Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism plays an important role in the functional adaptation of cardiac muscle to physiological or pathological stress (28Bodor G.S. Oakeley A.E. Allen P.D. Crimmins D.L. Ladenson J.H. Anderson P.A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 29Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Stewart R.W. Bond M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The present study investigated the role of myofilament proteins in the adaptation of myocardial contractility in a rat tail suspension model of simulated microgravity (30Morey-Holton E. Wronski T.J. Physiologist. 1981; 24: 45-48Google Scholar). 4 weeks of tail suspension resulted in decreases of cardiac muscle contractility without change in the expression of contractile and regulatory protein isoforms. However, a novel finding is an NH2-terminal truncated cTnI fragment with increased amounts in the heart of tail suspension rats. This proteolytic NH2-terminal modification of cTnI removes the two serine residues that are PKA substrates. This post-translational regulation in simulated microgravity suggests a role of the NH2-terminal domain of cTnI in functional adaptations of cardiac muscle. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180–210 g were randomly divided into control and tail suspension groups. The rats were housed in a 22 ± 2 °C environment, subjected to 12-h light/dark cycles, and fed water and Rat Chowad libitum. Tail suspension was carried out by a modified Morey-Holton method (30Morey-Holton E. Wronski T.J. Physiologist. 1981; 24: 45-48Google Scholar) for 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks. Care was taken to protect the tail tissue, and the movement of the rats was not restricted during the procedure. Rats were anesthetized with ether. The heart was rapidly excised and rinsed in oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). The left ventricular papillary muscle was removed and mounted in a continuous perfusion myograph chamber according to the method described previously (31Capasso J.M. Strobeck J.E. Malhotra A. Scheuer J. Sonnenblick E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: H882-H889PubMed Google Scholar). The muscle was superfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution, and CaCl2 was added to the solution at a series of steps to a final concentration of 6.5 mm. The solution was maintained at 30 °C and oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The nontendinous end of the papillary muscle was held by a spring clip. The tendinous end was tied to a stainless steel hook connected to an isometric force transducer (TB-651; Kohden, Japan). The muscles were electrically stimulated by square wave pulses (10-ms duration) at 0.2 Hz. The length-tension relationship was recorded after equilibration at a resting tension of 1 g for 60–90 min. The length of the muscle was increased until a maximum developed force was obtained (Lmax). The length-tension relationship was then measured by reducing the muscle length at 2% intervals from the Lmax to 88% of Lmaxwhile recording the resting and developed forces. Each of the step changes in length was after a reproducible sequence of 8–15 contractions to minimize effects of hysteresis. At the end of each experiment, the Lmax was measured again, and the muscle was then blotted dry and weighed. The cross-sectional area of the muscle was calculated assuming the geometry of a cylinder with a specific gravity of 1.0 (31Capasso J.M. Strobeck J.E. Malhotra A. Scheuer J. Sonnenblick E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: H882-H889PubMed Google Scholar). Tension was normalized by cross-sectional area. The unloaded maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) was extrapolated from zero loading condition according to the Maxwell model of muscle (32Bottinelli R. Canepari M. Cappelli V. Reggiani C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C785-C790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small cardiac muscle bundles (∼0.4 mm in diameter and 2.5–2.8 mm in length) were dissected from the papillary muscle of left ventricle under a dissection microscope. The bundles were mounted as above for the measurement of isometric tension. After equilibration for 30 min, the resting tension was adjusted to 100 mg. The bundles were then chemically skinned with 1% Triton X-100 for 60 min in a relaxing solution (pCa 9) containing 130 mmpotassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmEGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, and 20 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 7.0. A rigor solution (the relaxing solution without ATP) was used to test whether the muscle was completely skinned. The force-pCa relationship for the cardiac muscle was measured by adding CaCl2 to the relaxing solution to achieve a series of pCa (7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.3, 6.0, 5.5, 5.3 and 5.0). All experiments were carried out at 20 °C. The free Ca2+concentrations in the buffer were calculated using the apparent binding constant of Ca2+ to EGTA under the experimental conditions (33Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1975; 249: 497-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The tension was normalized to the maximum developed tension atpCa 5.0. The force-pCa relations were fitted to a Hill equation, in which relative force = 100(Ca2+)n/(k + (Ca2+))n, where k and n are constants (33Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1975; 249: 497-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Rat cardiac myofibrils were isolated as described (34Tsika R.W. Herrick R.E. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 63: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-activated ATPase activity of the myofibrils was analyzed in a buffer containing 50 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NaN3, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm Na2ATP at 30 °C and was terminated after 4 min by the addition of an equal volume of cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After removing the precipitate, inorganic phosphate (Pi) released was quantified as described previously (36Fitzsimons D.P. Bodell P.W. Herrick R.E. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 69: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As described previously (37Huang Q.Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 520: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), total protein was extracted from rat ventricular muscle by homogenization in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer containing 1% SDS. The myocardial protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE using Laemmli gels. 6% gel with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 180:1 was used for the analysis of myosin heavy chain (MHC); 14% gel with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 180:1 was used for the examination of TnT and Tm; and 12% gel with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1 was used for the examination of TnI. The protein bands resolved by SDS-PAGE were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size) at 5 mA/cm2 for 25 min. The blotted nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. The blocked membrane was incubated with anti-MHC monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) FA1 and FA2 (38Jin J.-P. Malik M.-L. Lin J.J.-C.

Hybridoma. 1985; 4: 223-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After washes with TBS plus detergents (0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% SDS) and TBS rinses, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG second antibody (from Sigma) in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1.5 h. After washes as above, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate reaction was carried out as described previously (40Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W., Yu, Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to reveal the expression of MHC, TnT, TnI, and Tm isoforms in the cardiac muscle. Rat cTnI was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using the TnI-1 mAb against an epitope at the COOH terminus of TnI (40Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W., Yu, Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The TnI-1 mAb (IgG1) was purified from hybridoma ascites fluid using a Protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The immunoaffinity isolation of cTnI was then carried out using a Sepharose 4B-TnI-1 mAb affinity column. Rat left ventricular muscle was minced into 1–2-mm3 pieces and extracted by 20 volumes (w/v) of Guba-Straub solution containing 300 mm KCl, 100 mm K2HPO4, 50 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.5, on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant containing mainly myosin was removed. The pellet was extracted in 20 volumes (w/v) of 1 m KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by stirring on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation as above, the extract was diluted 5-fold in TBS and loaded on the TnI-1 mAb affinity column equilibrated in TBS. The column was washed with TBS, and the proteins bound to the TnI-1 mAb affinity column were eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.7. 0.5-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 0.1 ml of neutralizing buffer containing 1m Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above to identify the cTnI peak. The cTnI fractions isolated by immunoaffinity columns were pooled and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lyophilized. The concentrated protein was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on 14% SDS-PAGE, and then electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. The membrane was stained by 0.5% Amido Black, and a stained protein band representing the cTnI fragment was sliced out. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out by Edman degradation using an automated amino acid sequencer (performed at the Protein Sequencing Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Two-dimensional densitometric analysis of the Western blots was performed to determine the relative amounts of the Tm, TnT, TnI, and the TnI fragment in the cardiac muscle of tail suspension and control rats. After the alkaline phosphatase substrate color reaction, the nitrocellulose membranes were scanned on a SciScan 5000 densitometer (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) using the reflection mode. The relative intensity of the protein bands recognized by the specific antibodies was calculated from scans of multiple tail suspension and control rat heart samples. Values are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between the mean values was analyzed by Student's t test. The theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point of rat cTnI and fragments were calculated from amino acid sequences using the DNAStar computer program. The body weights of the tail-suspended rats were similar to age-matched controls. The heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and maximal left ventricular pressure of the 4-week tail suspension rats were not significantly different from the controls. The heart weight/body weight ratio and the size of papillary muscle of the tail suspension rats were also not significantly different from those of the control rats (data not shown). Isometric force measurements on the papillary muscles of tail-suspended and control rats showed no difference in resting tension (RT) (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, developed tension (DT) was decreased in the cardiac muscle of the tail suspension rats (Fig. 1 A,p < 0.05–0.01). This decrease began at 2 weeks of tail suspension (data not shown) and became significant at 4 weeks of tail suspension. However, the length-tension relationship was preserved in the cardiac muscle of tail suspension rats, similar to that seen in the failing cardiac muscle (42Weil J. Eschenhagen T. Hirt S. Magnussen O. Mittmann C. Remmers U. Scholz H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 541-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43van der Velden J. de Jong J.W. Owen V.J. Burton P.B. Stienen G.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 46: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The calculatedVmax of the papillary muscle was also decreased after 4 weeks of tail suspension (p < 0.05) (Fig.1 B) together with a prolonged time to peak tension development (data not shown). Despite the decreased force and velocity, the response curve and EC50 of intact papillary muscle to the extracellular Ca2+ concentration were not different from controls (data not shown), indicating that the Ca2+ handling of cardiomyocyte membranes was not significantly affected in the tail suspension rats (44Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The force-pCa curves of skinned cardiac muscle preparations showed no difference between thepCa50 values obtained from the 4-week tail suspension and control rats (Fig.2 A). The Hill coefficientn obtained from the pCa50 values was also not changed. However, consistent with the results from intact cardiac muscle, the maximal isometric force (Fmax) of the skinned cardiac muscle was decreased in the tail suspension rats (p < 0.05) (Fig.2 B). Correspondingly, the Ca2+-activated ATPase activity of the cardiac myofibrils of 4-week tail suspension rats was significantly lower than that of the control rats (Fig. 2 C,p < 0.05). Expression of isoforms of the contractile and regulatory proteins was examined to determine whether any isoform switching could contribute to the decrease in the cardiac muscle contractility in the tail suspended rats. Using mAbs FA1 (specific to α-MHC) and FA2 (recognizing both α- and β-MHC) (38Jin J.-P. Malik M.-L. Lin J.J.-C. Hybridoma. 1990; 9: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the Western blots in Fig.3 show no decrease in the normally predominant α-MHC or detectable expression of β-MHC in the ventricular muscle of 4-week tail suspension rats. The results in Fig. 6 show that the Western blots using the anti-Tm mAb CH1 that recognizes both α- and β-Tm detected only the normally occurring α-Tm in the heart of 3- and 4-week tail suspension rats with no difference from the controls. The Western blots using the anti-cardiac and slow skeletal muscle TnT mAb CT3 showed only adult cardiac TnT, indicating no change in the expression of alternative RNA splicing-generated cardiac TnT isoforms (45Jin J.-P. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the heart of 3- and 4-week tail suspension rats. Western blots using the RATnT polyclonal antibody against cardiac and skeletal muscle TnTs showed no expression of fast or slow skeletal muscle TnT isoforms in the heart of tail suspension rats. No proteolytic fragment of Tm and TnT was detected in the tail suspension rat hearts by Western blot analysis. Western blots using mAb TnI-1 recognizing all three TnI isoforms (40Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W., Yu, Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) did not detect fast and slow skeletal muscle TnI isoforms in the heart of tail suspension rats (Fig.4). A novel finding was a ∼22-kDa TnI fragment with increased amounts in the heart of tail-suspended rats (Fig. 4). In addition to the mAb TnI-1 from mouse ascites fluid, supernatant from TnI-1 hybridoma cell culture recognizes this band on Western blot, excluding nonspecific reaction from other immunoglobulins in the mouse ascites fluid. This band is also recognized by a rabbit polyclonal anti-TnI antibody, RATnI (16Jin J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), confirming that it is indeed a TnI fragment. The Western blots of hearts of tail-suspended and control rats plus rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL; a fast skeletal muscle), soleus (a slow skeletal muscle), and neonatal cardiac muscle controls showed that the low Mr cTnI band migrated faster than the slow skeletal muscle TnI but more slowly than the fast skeletal muscle TnI (Fig. 4). Although slow skeletal muscle TnI is expressed in embryonic and postnatal cardiac muscles (14Saggin L. Gorza L. Ausoni S. Schiaffino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16299-16302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Murphy A.M. Jones L. Sims H.F. Strauss A.W.

Commun. 1996; 225: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the gel mobility indicates that this low Mr TnI is not a reexpression of slow skeletal muscle TnI in the adult heart. Although phosphorylation may also slightly alter the mobility of TnI in SDS gel, we have confirmed by amino acid sequencing that this lowMr TnI is a cTnI fragment. While a slight increase was detected in the heart of 3-week tail suspension rats as compared with controls, amounts of this cTnI fragment significantly increased in the heart of 4-week tail suspension rats. The relative levels of the low Mr cTnI band in hearts of 4-week tail suspension rats was quantified by two-dimensional densitometry of the TnI-1 mAb Western blots. The results demonstrate an increase of the cTnI fragment from 13.1 to 16.3% of the total cTnI (p < 0.05), reflecting an increase of its ratio to intact cTnI from 1:6.61 to 1:5.15. Although the cTnI fragment increased 24.4%, this portion only represents 3.2% of the total cTnI. Therefore, no significant change in the amounts of intact cTnI was detected by densitometric analysis of the Western blots (Fig.5).Figure 5The relative amounts of Tm , cardiac TnT , and cTnI in the heart of control and tail suspension rats. A, densitometry of Western blots on total cardiac muscle homogenate revealed significantly increased amounts of the cTnI fragment in the heart of 4-week tail suspension (SUS) rats, while no change in the levels of Tm, cardiac TnT (cTnT), and intact cTnI was detected. The comparison was made using the blots of control (CON) rat hearts as 100%. B, the ratios between the cTnI fragment and intact cTnI in the heart of tail suspension and control rats are shown.

One example is the Hoxb1 auto-regulatory element (b1-ARE), which drives expression of Hoxb1 in the fourth rhombomere of the hindbrain. We previously showed that HOXB1 and PBX1 activate transcription from the b1-ARE by binding to sequences required for the expression of a reporter gene in rhombomere 4 in vivo. We now report that in embryonal carcinoma cells, which retain characteristics of primitive neuroectodermal cells, the b1-ARE displays higher basal and HOX/PBX-induced activities than in other cell backgrounds. We have identified a bipartite-binding site for SOX/OCT heterodimers within the b1-ARE that accounts for its cell context-specific activity and is required for maximal transcriptional activity of HOX/PBX complexes in embryonal carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we found that in an embryonal carcinoma cell background, HOXB1 has a significantly higher transcriptional activity than its paralog HOXA1. We map the determinants for this differential activity within the HOXB1 N-terminal transcriptional activation domain. By using analysis in transgenic and HOXA1 mutant mice, we extended these findings on the differential activities of HOXA1 and HOXB1 in vivo, and we demonstrated that they are important for regulating aspects of HOXB1 expression in the hindbrain. We found that mutation of the SOX/OCT site and targeted inactivation of Hoxa1 both impair the response of the b1-ARE to retinoic acid in transgenic mice. Our results show that Hoxa1 is the primary mediator of the response of b1-ARE to retinoic acid in vivoand that this function is dependent on the binding of SOX/OCT heterodimers to the b1-ARE.

Several of these in vivotarget sites are composed of bipartite and overlapping HOX- and PBX-binding motifs (HOX/PBC sites) and represent useful models for analyzing the function of HOX-containing transcriptional complexes.

One of the HOX-binding elements examined in most detail in vivo is contained in a highly conserved auto-regulatory enhancer of the Hoxb1 gene (b1-ARE). This is a key cis-regulatory element for the normal rhombomere 4 (r4)-restricted expression of Hoxb1 in the developing hindbrain. Genetic analysis has revealed that in an early phaseHoxa1 and Hoxb1 function synergistically to establish initial r4 identity by triggering the auto-regulatory loop (6Pöpperl H. Bienz M. Studer M.

Development. 1998; 125: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a part of this process, the early activation ofHoxb1 and Hoxa1 themselves is directly mediated by RA signaling through the presence of RA response elements (RAREs) located at the 3′ ends of both genes (28Studer M.

Nature. 1994; 370: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In later stagesHoxb1 is required to maintain r4 identity (27Studer M. Lumsden A. Ariza-McNaughton L. Bradley A. Krumlauf R. Nature. 1996; 384: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 28Studer M. Gavalas A. Marshall H. Ariza-McNaughton L. Rijli F.M. Chambon P. Krumlauf R. Development. 1998; 125: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the b1-ARE does not contain a canonical RARE, it indirectly participates in mediating the RA-dependent ectopic activation of Hoxb1 in anterior regions (r2), through its auto-regulatory ability (6Pöpperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chang S.-K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Auto- and para-regulation of Hoxb1 are dependent on the cooperative binding of HOXB1 or HOXA1, and a member of the PBX family on three conserved sequence motifs (R1, R2, and R3) in the b1-ARE related to a consensus bipartite HOX/PBC-binding site (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Pöpperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chang S.-K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Each of these HOX/PBX repeats contributes to the r4-restricted expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice and to the indirect RA response. The R3 motif, however, makes the largest contribution to the b1-ARE regulatory activity (6Pöpperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chang S.-K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the b1-ARE is not active in other regions of the embryo where Hoxb1 and Pbx1are coexpressed (spinal cord, paraxial mesoderm, endoderm, and limb buds), suggesting that region-specific expression in the hindbrain might be determined by differential activity of additional factors. We reported previously (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that the human HOXB1 and PBX1 proteins cooperatively activate transcription from a basal promoter under the control of the b1-ARE in transfected mammalian cells. Comparing the functional selectivity of proteins from a range of Hoxparalogy groups, we showed (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that only a restricted subset of HOX proteins (HOXA1, HOXB1, and HOXB2) are able to activate transcription from the b1-ARE in cooperation with PBX1. Selective recognition of the R3 motif by the HOXB1/PBX1 complex is mediated by the N terminus of the HOX homeodomain, whereas the major transcriptional activator domain is provided by the HOXB1 N-terminal region (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,26Viganò A. Di Rocco G. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 18: 6201-6212Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the basal and HOX/PBX-induced transcriptional activities of b1-ARE, in comparison to other cell lines, are significantly higher in murine or human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which retain phenotypic and molecular characteristics of primitive neuroectodermal cells (32Andrews P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 17-36PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In this context, HOXB1 displays a stronger transcriptional activation than its paralog HOXA1, in cooperation with PBX1. The differential activity between HOXB1 and HOXA1 is not based on the DNA-binding properties of the HOXB1/PBX1 complex but rather on specific determinants within the HOXB1 transcriptional activation domain that selectively interact with the transcriptional machinery. Furthermore, we show that the full transcriptional activity of HOX/PBX heterodimers on the b1-ARE is dependent on the binding of a SOX/OCT heterodimeric complex to a bipartite site located immediately upstream of the R3 sequence. Mutation of this site, as well as the targeted inactivation of theHoxa1 gene, impairs the response of the b1-ARE to RA treatment in transgenic mice and the establishment of a full ectopic auto-regulatory circuit of Hoxb1 in vivo. Our results show that the product of the Hoxa1 gene is required for the response of Hoxb1 to RA, and this activity requires a functional SOX/OCT-binding site within the b1-ARE. Together, these results have uncovered novel differences among HOX paralogs and their modifiers. All expression constructs are derivatives of the SV40 promoter-based expression vector pSG5 (34Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). HOXB1, HOXA1, HOXB2, and PBX1 expression vectors were described previously (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V.

The mutated cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI site of pSG5. pGAL1–147 (35Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) contains the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 (amino acids 1–147). pGALVP16 was generated by cloning an PCR-amplified region encompassing the C terminus (last 80 aa) of the VP16 protein in frame with the GAL1–147 protein at the BamHI site of the pGAL1–147 vector. PCR was carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). All PCR-generated fragments were sequenced on both strands, and expression of all proteins was preliminarily tested using a T7 polymerase-based transcription and reticulocyte lysate-based translation system (Promega). The luciferase reporter construct pMLluc is a pXP2-based vector (36Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) containing the adenovirus major late basal promoter (from −65 to +30). pAdMLARE contains the AvaI-HaeII fragment of theHoxb1 r4-autoregulatory enhancer (b1-ARE) (6Pöpperl H.

In pAdMLoctm, the Sox/Oct-binding sequence CTTTGTCATGCTAAT in the b1-ARE was changed to GCAAGTCGACTGCCT. The pTUASluc reporter construct was described (37Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Helmer Citterich M.

For transgenic mouse analysis, the wild type Hoxb15′-flanking StuI-HindIII fragment containing the b1-ARE was cloned into the lacZ basal reporter vector BGZ40 (38Yee S.-P. Rigby P.W.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) as described previously (6Pöpperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chang S.-K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R. Krumlauf R.

Point mutations in the SOX/OCT-binding sequence (TAAT to CCGG and TTTGTC to CGCTGT) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis in M13 or inverse PCR, followed by double-strand sequencing. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. P19 and NT2/D1 cells were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium. Transfections were carried out by CaPO4 precipitation (39Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In a typical transfection experiment, 8 μg of reporter plasmid, 4–8 μg of expression construct, and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-gal (CLONTECH) as an internal control were used per 10-cm dish. 48–60 h after transfection, cells were washed and lysed directly on the plate with a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT. Extracts were collected, centrifuged to clear the supernatant, and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression as described (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To rule out the existence of intrinsic differences between COS-7 and P19 cells in sustaining transcriptional activation, we tested for the capability of a GAL4-VP16 chimera to activate transcription from a GAL4-responding reported in both cell lines. The GAL4-VP16 chimera gave identical results in terms of transactivation in both cell lines (data not shown). To obtain total cell protein extracts, cells were collected from confluent plates, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and lysed by resuspension in 5 volumes of Extraction Buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Trasylol). The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 34,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-50 rotor, and the supernatant was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. To obtain embryonic cell extracts, about 50 mouse embryos were collected at 9.5 dpc, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed as described above. Gel retardation analysis was performed by preincubating the cell extracts (8 μg) for 30 min on ice in 20 μl of binding buffer (75 mm NaCl, 20% Ficoll, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 3 μg of poly(dG-dC) or poly(dI-dC)), together with 2 μl (0.5 ng, 5 × 104 cpm) of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Competition experiments were carried out by adding 2 μl of α-Oct1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-Oct3/4 (kindly provided by Hans Shöler), or α-Sox-2 (a gift from Marco E. Bianchi) antisera before adding the probe. The incubation mixture was resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE at 10 V/cm. Gels were dried and exposed to a Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C. The b1-ARE oligonucleotide probe sequence was 5′-AGCTTGTGTCTTTGTCATGCTAATGATTGGGGGG-3′. Transgenic mice were produced by microinjection of DNA into fertilized eggs from crosses between F1 (CBA × C57) females and males. Whole mount β-galactosidase reporter activity in founder embryos was performed as described previously (41Whiting J. Marshall H. Cook M. Krumlauf R. Rigby P. Stott D. Allemann R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RA exposure was achieved by treating pregnant females with embryos at 7.5 dpc by oral gavage with 200 ml of sesame seed oil containing all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma), diluted from a 25 mg/ml stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide, for a final dose of about 20 mg/kg of maternal body weight (42Marshall H. Nonchev S. Sham M.H. Muchamore I. Lumsden A. Krumlauf R. Nature. 1992; 360: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The inductive response was assayed in embryos at 9.5 dpc. We have shown previously that the HOXB1/PBX1 heterodimer is able to activate transcription of a reporter gene under the control of the b1-ARE in mammalian cell lines (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Viganò A. Di Rocco G. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 18: 6201-6212Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of the cell context on this system, we compared the transcriptional activity of the HOXB1/PBX1 complex in different cell lines, including COS-7, HeLa, NIH3T3, P19, and NT2/D1 cells. The murine P19 and the human NT2/D1 EC cells are originally derived from germ cell tumors and retain many characteristics of primitive neuroectodermal cells, including the ability to differentiate into neurons (32Andrews P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 17-36PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and activate the fourHox gene clusters upon induction with retinoic acid (43Deschamps J. De Laaf R. Joosen L. Meijlink F.

Dev. 1991; 33: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To measure transcriptional activity, reporter constructs were made by placing a luciferase gene under the control of the adenovirus major late basal promoter either alone (pAdMLluc) or in combination with the 150-bp b1-ARE Hox-responsive region (pAdMLARE). These were cotransfected with expression constructs for HOXB1 and PBX1 into the various cell lines and assayed for reporter activity (Fig.1). In COS-7, HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells the basal activity of the reporters with and without the b1-ARE enhancer were identical (Fig. 1 and data not shown). In contrast, in both P19 and NT2/D1 EC cells the construct containing the b1-ARE enhancer (pAdMLARE) displayed a 7-fold higher basal level, compared with the control (pAdMLluc). In non-EC cells (e.g. COS-7 in Fig. 1), coexpression of HOXB1 and PBX1 led to a 8-fold transactivation of the pAdMLARE reporter. In P19 and NT2 cells, however, coexpression of HOXB1 and PBX1 led to significantly higher levels of transactivation, ∼20- and ∼60-fold, respectively, over the pAdMLARE basal activity of the reporter, corresponding to a ∼140- and ∼360-fold increase in activity, respectively, of the enhancer-less pAdMLluc reporter (Fig.1). Transfection of the PBX1 expression vector alone had no effect on reporter activity in any cell context, whereas transfection of HOXB1 alone led to a 2–3-fold activation only in EC cells presumably through interaction with the endogenous levels of PBX1 expressed in these cells. The higher activity of the HOXB1/PBX1 complex on the b1-ARE target was found not to be due to a higher transfection efficiency in EC cells, as the percentage of transfected cells was found to be comparable to that of the other cell lines (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed no broad differences in the capability of ECversus COS-7 cells to sustain transcriptional activation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Our findings that the basal activity and the ability of the HOXB1/PBX1 complex to act on the b1-ARE are much higher in EC cells, compared with other cell lines, suggest either the presence of EC-specific enhancing factors or COS-7 inhibiting components that modify the b1-ARE regulatory potential. We previously reported that only HOX proteins belonging to paralogous groups 1 and 2 can bind and activate the full b1-ARE or multimerized versions of R3 in cultured cells in a PBX-dependent manner (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To compare directly the activity of different HOX/PBX complexes in an EC cell background, expression constructs for HOXA1, HOXB1, and HOXB2 were cotransfected in P19 cells, together with the reporters containing the entire b1-ARE (pAdMLARE) or a trimer of the R3 motif (5Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The basal activity of pAdMLARE was higher than that of pAdMLR3 and was only weakly induced by cotransfection with HOX proteins alone (Fig.2). On the pAdMLR3 reporter, consistent with our previous results using non-EC cells, the activities of the HOXB1/PBX1 and the HOXA1/PBX1 complexes were comparable, resulting in an 80–100-fold transactivation. The HOXB2/PBX1 complex was also active although it remained lower (15-fold transactivation) (Fig. 2). In contrast, on the full b1-ARE reporter (pAdMLARE) while HOXB1 and PBX1 induced a 20-fold transactivation (see also Fig. 1), surprisingly HOXA1 only weakly activated (6-fold) the reporter expression in combination with PBX1 (Fig. 2). HOXB2 displayed an even lower (4-fold) activity with PBX1 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that in the EC cell background HOXB1 activates transcription more efficiently than its paralog HOXA1 in cooperation with PBX1 through the entire b1-ARE element. This differential activity was never observed in non-neuroectodermal cell lines. As the use of a multimerized version of the HOX/PBC repeat 3 target sequence apparently relaxes the paralog selectivity, allowing HOXA1 and HOXB2 to function as effectively as HOXB1, we considered the possibility that other enhancer sequences within the b1-ARE might influence the activity of the different HOX/PBX heterodimers. In order to analyze the contribution of different regions of the enhancer in restricting transcriptional activation, we cotransfected reporter constructs containing sequential 5′ deletions of the b1-ARE (Fig.3 B) with HOXB1, HOXA1, and PBX1 in P19 cells. In deletions with increasing size there was a progressive reduction in the overall level of transactivation that progressively reduced expression to 70, 50, and 30% of the entire b1-ARE (Fig. 3 A). However, the differential ability of HOXB1/PBX1 versus HOXA1/PBX1 to activate these sites was maintained even on a reporter containing only repeat 3 and its surrounding sequences (AREΔR1 + R2, Fig.3 A). Considering that a reporter containing a multimer of the R3 motif alone responds equally well to HOXB1 or HOXA1 (Fig. 2), this result suggests that sequences flanking R3 are important in mediating the selective preference of the b1-ARE for HOXB1. In the b-1ARE, located between the R2 and R3 HOX/PBC sites, there is a bipartite sequence motif that is highly conserved in the human, mouse, chicken and pufferfishHoxb1 locus (6Pöpperl H. Bienz M.

https://openalex.org/W1548282121,"Insulin induces apolipoprotein A-I,apoA-I gene transcription via a membrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This finding prompted us to ask whether the gene is stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), EGF a peptide hormone that binds to another member of the receptor superfamily with tyrosine kinase activity. Our data showed that like insulin, EGF increased abundance of apoA-I protein and transcription of the gene in human hepatoma, Hep G2 cells. The effects of both hormones appeared direct because their induction of apoA-I gene transcription was not affected by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Although both insulin and EGF stimulate apoA-I expression, each hormone binds to a distinct membrane receptor thus suggesting differential intracellular signaling. Therefore, we used a panel of inhibitors to define the pathway(s) that mediate the actions of these hormones. Whereas, the actions of EGF required only the Ras-mitogen-activated protein, MAP kinase, those of insulin were mediated by equal participation of both the Ras-MAP kinase and protein kinase C, PKC cascades. Despite differences in signaling pathways triggered by each hormone receptor, the activation ofapoA-I transcription required the participation of a single transcription factor, Sp1. Furthermore, EGF induction of transcription was attenuated by mutating the MAP kinase site at amino acid, Thr266 rendering Sp1 phosphorylation deficient. In summary, EGF stimulation of apoA-I expression is mediated solely by the Ras-MAP kinase cascade and enhanced activity of this pathway requires Sp1 with an intact phosphorylation site at Thr266. However, insulin induction of this gene is different and requires both Ras-MAP kinase and PKC pathways but their actions are also mediated by Sp1.

The anti-atherogenic properties of apoA-I alone or as part of HDL underlie their inverse correlation with the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular disease, the number 1 cause of premature death in modern societies (3Barter P.J.

Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137 (suppl.): S1-S6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cardioprotective actions of apoA-I or HDL arises from their participation in a normal physiologic process, so called “reverse cholesterol transport” (5Barter P.J. Rye K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Luoma P.V. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 81: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ApoA-I acts as a cofactor to facilitate an interaction between HDL particles and the cell membrane. This interaction enables the efflux of intracellular cholesterol to HDL particles, which in turn shuttles the sterol to the liver for further metabolism and excretion (5Barter P.J. Rye K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Miller N.E. La Ville A. Crook D. Nature. 1985; 314: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Enhanced reverse cholesterol transport lowers total body cholesterol, as demonstrated clearly following the infusion of apoA-I protein into humans (8Nanjee M.N. Crouse J.R. King J.M. Hovorka R.

The reduction in cholesterol lowers the risk of arteriosclerosis (9Eisenberg D.A. Am. J.

In support of this idea, transgenic mice that overexpress human apoA-I protein had significant reductions of atherosclerotic lesions in vessel walls (10Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E. Chiesa G. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that enhance apoA-Iexpression will lead us to better ways to enhance its expression and thus lower the risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease (11Taylor A.H.

Insulin action is initiated by its binding to a membrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, prompting us to wonder whether this mechanism is unique to the peptide hormone. The actions of insulin can be categorized into immediate responses: such as glucose transport or delayed responses; including cell differentiation and proliferation (14Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). Several intracellular pathways are activated by insulin action and may include the Ras-MAP kinase, PI 3-kinase, and phospholipase Cγ cascades (14Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These pathways are not exclusive to the insulin receptor and may be used by other tyrosine kinase receptors, including that for EGF (16Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of another peptide hormone, epidermal growth factor, EGF onapoA-I expression. If apoA-I is inducible by EGF, it offers a new avenue to augment expression of the gene. But equally important is that this model provides an opportunity to compare or contrast the signaling mechanism(s) activated by EGF and insulin. The results summarized here show that like insulin, EGF also enhances apoA-I expression. However, whereas the actions of EGF are mediated solely by the actions of a single pathway, that of insulin requires the participation of at least two cascades. Construction of the reporter, pAI.474-CAT was described previously (17Romney J.S. Chan J. Carr F.E. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 943-950PubMed Google Scholar).

(24Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Protein samples of total cell lysates were analyzed for activated p42/44 MAP kinase using Western blot techniques (21Zhong Z.D. Hammani K. Bae W.S. DeClerck Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18602-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Total RNA from cells was extracted from cells using TRITM-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) (25Wu J.Y. Wu Y. Reaves S.K. Wang Y.R. Lei P.P. Lei K.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C537-C544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA was reverse-transcribed with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit using pd(N)6primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's protocol. 3 μl of this solution was amplify using PCR primed with a forward primer 5′-CCTGATGAATGCTCATCCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGCATTCTGCCGACATGG-3′ homologous to the CAT gene. The RT-PCR signal from CAT mRNA transcripts was normalized with the signal obtained from β-actin using the primer pair (forward: 5′-CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′; reverse: 5′-TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGG-3′) as described previously (26Zheng X.L. Gui Y. Sharkey K.A. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 632-640PubMed Google Scholar). The pBabe-Puro retroviral expression vector (27Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) with and without RasAsn-17 insert was transfected into AmphoPckTM-293 cell (CLONTECH), using LipofectAMINE as per the manufacturer's instructions. The supernatants containing the virus were used to infect stable Hep G2 cells that harbored the pAI.474-CAT reporter gene in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. After elimination of uninfected cells by adding 2.5 μg/ml puromycin to culture medium, the cells were treated with 17 nm EGF, 100 microunits/ml insulin or 5 μmbpV(phen), prior to assaying for CAT activity. Sp1 mutants were created using the QuickChangTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) according to manufacturer's instruction (28Nelson M. Zhang Y. Van Etten J.L. EXS. 1993; 64: 186-211PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vandeyar M.A. Weiner M.P. Hutton C.J. Batt C.A. Gene ( Amst.). 1988; 65: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In brief, CMV-Sp1 plasmid DNA was denatured and annealed with oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation. Using the nonstrand-displacing action of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, the enzyme extended and incorporated the mutant primers resulting in nicked circular DNA. The methylated, nonmutated parental DNA templates were subsequently digested with DpnI. The circular, nicked double-stranded DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. After transformation, the XL1-Blue supercompetent cells repaired the nicks in the mutated plasmid. The mutations were verified using nucleotide sequencing before use in transfection of Hep G2 cells. We recently described the creation of a stable Hep G2 cell line harboring the reporter, pAI.474-CAT. This plasmid is comprised of the −474 to −7 fragment of the rat apoA-I promoter fused to the reporter gene, CAT (23Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). In these cells, CAT activity (Fig.1 A) increased following treatment with 17 nm EGF. Induction appeared to be rapid with detectable increases at 3 h following exposure to the hormone. The extrapolation of the data points to time 0 suggested an almost instantaneous induction by EGF. Similarly, 100 milliunits/ml insulin also stimulated CAT activity with comparable kinetics. The only difference was that following 48 h of exposure to EGF, CAT activity in the cells increased 7-fold versus a 3–3.5-fold caused by insulin. Like insulin, 5 μm mimetic, bpV(phen) also enhanced apoA-I transcription 4–5-fold (Fig.2).Figure 2Inhibiting EGF receptor kinase blocks induction of apoA-I. Panel A , shows an autoradiograph of CAT activity in stable cells treated with either 17 nm EGF, 100 microunits/ml insulin, or 5 μmbpV(phen) for 24 h in the presence (lanes 4, 6, and8) or absence (lanes 3, 5, and 7) of 1 μm PD153035. Panel B, shows a graph of the relative CAT activities in cells treated with conditions noted at thebottom of each bar (mean ± S.E.,n = 4).

Total RNA was extracted from these cells and assayed for abundance of CAT mRNA using RT-PCR. Results showed that whereas, cycloheximide did not inhibit EGF or insulin induction of CAT mRNA expression (Fig.1 B), as expected actinomycin D blocked transcription of theCAT gene. These findings suggest that both hormones had a direct effect on apoA-I promoter activity and did not require de novo synthesis of other proteins. Whether EGF or insulin induction of apoA-I promoter correlated with increases in apoA-I protein is not known. Therefore, Western blot analysis was used to measure the abundance of the protein in both whole cell lysate and culture medium from cells treated with either EGF or insulin or 5 μm bpV(phen), a insulin mimetic, for 24 h. All three agents increased apoA-I protein in both cell lysate and culture medium (Fig. 1 C). Together the above results show that EGF and insulin share similar activities in the direct induction of apoA-I promoter activity leading to increased abundance of the protein. The action(s) of EGF is initiated by its binding to a specific membrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. To determine whether EGF induction of apoA-I is mediated by its receptor, stably transfected Hep G2 cells were exposed to 1 μm PD153035, a specific inhibitor for the EGF receptor (30Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), prior to the addition of hormone. The results (Fig. 2) showed that treatment with PD153035 completely blocked EGF induction ofapoA-I activity. In contrast, neither insulin nor bpV(phen) induction of CAT activity in the same cells was affected by PD153035 (Fig. 2). These findings show that the activation of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase is required for apoA-I induction by the hormone. Furthermore, blockade of EGF receptor activity had no effect on the actions of insulin or bpV(phen). Ligand binding to a receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity triggers this function leading to receptor autophosphorylation. These events initiate signal transduction and cellular responses. Activated tyrosine kinase receptor can initiate several intracellular pathways including; Ras-MAP kinase cascade, PI 3-kinase, and PLCγ pathways (16Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, the cellular responses and their signaling mechanisms are largely dependent on the cell type examined. Furthermore, the actions of a single hormone may vary from one cell type to another. Therefore, we wanted to examine the intracellular signaling pathway by which EGF and insulin inducedapoA-I gene expression in Hep G2 cells. To identify the signaling pathways underlying the actions of EGF and insulin, we used a panel of specific inhibitors known to block selected pathways. The results show that inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, 100 nm wortmannin or 10 μm LY294002 (32Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect the actions of EGF, insulin, or bpV(phen) (Fig.3). Whereas, the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (1 μm) completely blocked EGF induction ofapoA-I expression (Fig. 3), it only inhibited 50% of insulin action on apoA-I activity (Fig. 3). Although the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (2 μm) (33Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect EGF response, it did inhibit insulin induction of apoA-I gene by 50% (Fig. 3). More importantly, the combination of PD98059 and GFX together completely blocked insulin induction of apoA-I(Fig. 3). Like insulin, apoA-I induction by bpV(phen) was also blocked in the presence of both inhibitors (data not shown). That MAP kinase was activated during EGF, insulin, or bpV(phen) induction of the gene was assessed by treating the cells with or without the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059. Cell lysate was assayed for p42/44 kinase using Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 B, inset). The treatment of cells with PD98059 inhibited the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinase (Fig. 3 B, inset). The addition of these data to that above show the following: (i) the PI 3-kinase pathway does not participate in either EGF or insulin induction of apoA-Iexpression; (ii) the MAP kinase cascade is the sole mediator of EGF stimulation of apoA-I; and (iii) insulin or bpV(phen) action requires two independent pathways mediated by PKC and MAP kinase to stimulate the apoA-I gene. Since insulin or bpV(phen) induction of apoA-I is blocked by the PKC inhibitor GFX, this implies that the converse where PKC is activated should enhance apoA-I gene activity. Therefore, we tested whether the PKC activator PDBu stimulated apoA-I expression (Fig. 4) and if this induction is sensitive to the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (13Zheng X.L. Matsubara S. Diao C. Hollenberg M.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31747-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Results show treatment of cells with 25 nm PDBu increased apoA-I promoter activity and that was blocked by GFX. However, this induction was not affected by pretreatment of cells with PD98059. These findings suggest that PKC activation does not crossover to the MAP kinase cascade above the level of MEK as described in other cell systems (35Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 36Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ras participates in the EGF and insulin induction ofapoA-I, we infected the stable Hep G2 cells with RasAsn-17 retrovirus to express dominant negative RasAsn-17. This mutant interrupts the Ras-dependent signaling pathway (37Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 38Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Results (Fig.5) showed that expression of RasAsn-17 blocked EGF induction of the apoA-Igene. As expected, the expression of RasAsn-17 partially but significantly attenuated insulin induction of apoA-Ipromoter. Exposure of cells to GFX prior to RasAsn-17retrovirus infection blocked both insulin (Fig. 5) or bpV(phen) (data not shown) induction of the gene. Additionally, the insertion of the dominant negative RasAsn-17 in cells did not affect the stimulation of apoA-I gene induced by PDBu, a PKC activator (data not shown). These findings show that EGF stimulatesapoA-I induction via a Ras-MAP kinase pathway and further solidifying the finding that insulin induction of the gene is mediated independently via both the Ras-MAP kinase and the PKC pathways. Next we searched for the cis-acting element(s) in the apoA-I promoter that mediated the actions of EGF. Thus serial deletion constructs ofapoA-I promoter were transfected into Hep G2 cells and then treated with EGF, insulin, or bpV(phen). Results (Fig.6 A) showed that EGF stimulation of the promoter like insulin or bpV(phen) was abolished following deletion of the −425 to −376 fragment of the promoter. Our previous studies showed that insulin induction of apoA-Igene required a motif called the IRCE −411 to −404. Deletion analysis suggested that the same motif may also be required for response to EGF. Therefore, we tested the activity of a reporter construct containing a mutant of the IRCE. Results (Fig. 6 B) showed that the reporter containing the mutant IRCE was not inducible by EGF, insulin, or bpV(phen). These finding show that the actions of all three agents require the presence of an intact IRCE. The IRCE motif is GC-rich and binds to a transcription factor, Sp1. Therefore, we speculate that Sp1 might participate in EGF, insulin, or bpV(phen) induction of the promoter. To investigate this hypothesis, we used submaximal concentrations of EGF (8.5 nm), insulin (50 microunits/ml), and bpV(phen) (2.5 μm) to stimulate cells that do or do not overexpress of Sp1. Results (Fig. 7) showed that Sp1 expression alone increased apoA-I gene expression 2-fold and submaximal doses of EGF, insulin, and bpV(phen) caused a 2.1-, 1.8-, and 1.7-fold, respectively, in apoA-I transcription. In the presence of both Sp1 and EGF, insulin, or bpV(phen) we observed a marked induction of promoter activity of 7.4-, 6.5-, and 6.4-fold, respectively. The combined actions of Sp1 and hormone were not simply additive but synergistic. Next we postulated that EGF stimulation ofapoA-I was mediated by the MAP kinase pathway involves phosphorylation of Sp1. To test this idea, we inspected Sp1 protein for potential sites of MAP kinase phosphorylation according to published algorithms (39Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Six potential sites for MAP kinase were identified (Fig. 8) (40Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Merchant J.L. Du M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The prediction scores ranged from 0 to 1.000 with values that exceeded 0.5 reflecting potential phosphorylation sites. Three of the sites with the highest scores were Thr266 (0.767), Thr414 (0.664), and Thr650 (0.726) (41Merchant J.L. Du M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thr266 was especially interesting because it was located toward the C-terminal region of the second glutamine-rich domain, one of the known trans-activation domains of Sp1 (19Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Since the amino acids surrounding Thr266appeared most homologous against a consensus MAP kinase site, we mutated the threonine residue by replacing it with an alanine to create Sp1-T266A. The use of Sp1-T266A in transfection studies revealed the following results. Although transfection of Sp1-T266A alone into stable Hep G2 cells augmented activity of pAI.474-CAT, the activity was not significantly different from wild-type Sp1. When the transfected cells were exposed to EGF, apoA-I induction was attenuated by 54% in cells containing the mutant Sp1 compared with the wild-type. However, PDBu induction of apoA-I expression mediated by PKC was the same in the presence of the mutant or wild-type Sp1. These data suggest that amino acid Thr266 in Sp1 is required for full EGF induction of apoA-I. ApoA-I is an essential component of HDL. The protein alone or in the form of HDL mediate a normal physiologic process called reverse cholesterol transport, which lowers total body cholesterol (5Barter P.J. Rye K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Miller N.E. La Ville A. Crook D. Nature. 1985; 314: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) thereby reducing the risk of IHD. This function of apoA-I makes it an important target for therapies to enhance expression of the protein. To"

Here we used adenoviral gene transfer and biochemical inhibitors to manipulate PI3K-dependent pathways in human monocytes. In in vitro lipid kinase assays from purified human monocytes, we showed that MCP-1 activates the “classical” PI3Kα pathway and not PI3Kγ, a PI3K isoform thought to be activated only by the βγ complex of heterotrimeric G proteins. The activity of PI3Kα in purified human monocytes was evident within 30 s. MCP-1-induced monocyte arrest was significantly inhibited both by wortmannin (n = 4; p < 0.01) and LY294002 (n = 4; p < 0.01) with restoration of the rolling phenotype (p < 0.05 for both inhibitors, compared with rolling of control monocytes after MCP-1 treatment). To test the hypothesis that activation of PI3K is sufficient to induce monocyte adhesion, we transduced the monocytic THP-1 cell line with a recombinant adenovirus (Ad) carrying a constitutively active mutant of PI3K (Ad.BD110). We examined the ability of these cells to adhere to human vascular endothelium (HUVEC) transduced with adenoviruses carrying E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and VCAM-1. Under flow conditions, ICAM-1- and VCAM-1-dependent firm adhesion of Ad.BD110-transduced THP-1 cells was enhanced compared with THP-1 cells infected with control Ad (n = 4; p < 0.01 for both). Adhesion augmented by constitutive PI3K activation was entirely abrogated by pretreatment with wortmannin (n= 3; p < 0.01). In contrast, a constitutively active Akt construct had no effect on THP-1 adhesion (n = 3;p = NS). We conclude that PI3K activation is necessary and sufficient to enhance monocytic adhesion under physiological flow conditions.

As chemoattractants, chemokines play an important role in the directional migration of leukocytes through tissues. Recent data have also underscored the importance of chemokines in enhancing the avidity of leukocyte integrins for locally expressed adhesion molecules. Under physiological flow conditions such as seen in the bloodstream, chemokines can induce the rapid conversion of lymphocyte (1Campbell J.J. Hedrick J. Zlotnik A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A.

These data speak to an important role for chemokines in the initial step of leukocyte infiltration of the endothelium, which is then followed by transmigration into the surrounding tissues. However, the pathways by which chemokines activate leukocytes, markedly enhancing leukocyte firm adhesion over the course of seconds, remain poorly understood. Recently the PI3K1 family has been implicated in chemokine receptor signaling. Chemokines activate PI3K isoforms in nanomolar concentrations, and biochemical inhibitors of PI3K have been shown to inhibit chemokine-triggered chemotaxis of lymphocytes, NK cells, and monocytes (3Turner L. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2437-2444PubMed Google Scholar, 4Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol.

Here we used biochemical inhibitors and adenoviral gene transfer to manipulate PI3K-dependent pathways in human monocytes and studied the functional effects of these manipulations on adhesion under physiological flow conditions. Interestingly, we found that MCP-1 triggered monocyte adhesion and activation of the PI3Kα isoform, but not PI3Kγ in purified human monocytes. PI3K activation correlated temporally with our functional studies. Furthermore, PI3K was necessary for the chemokine-triggered conversion of monocyte rolling to firm adhesion and sufficient to enhance monocyte arrest under physiological flow conditions.

Zeng W. Murakawa M. Freeman M.W. Seed B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11296-11303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, AdICAM carries the cDNA for human ICAM-1 (kindly provided by Dr. T. A. Springer) and was initially subcloned into the ClaI site in the pLEP shuttle vector. This construct was then linearized and ligated to the pREP vector containing adenoviral (Ad2) backbone. An adenoviral cosmid was then generated employing λ phage/Escherichia coli extracts (Stratagene). Recombinant adenovirus was generated in 293 cells by lipofectin-mediated transfection with positive cosmid clones. Recombinant adenovirus was propagated by infecting subconfluent 293 cell monolayers in 15-cm tissue culture dishes at an MOI of ∼10. Stock titers for the various constructs ranged from 1 × 1010 to 2 × 1011 pfu/ml with a particle/pfu ratio ranging from 20 to 100. Wild-type adenovirus contamination was excluded by the absence of polymerase chain reaction-detectable E1 sequences. Antibodies to PI3K were H199 (to PI3K p110γ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 06-195 (to PI3K p85, Upstate Biotechnology); to the Myc epitope were 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); to Akt was phospho-Akt-Ser-473 (New England Biolabs). Antibodies to adhesion molecules (10Gerszten R. Luscinskas F. Ding H. Dichek D. Stoolman L. Gimbrone Jr., M. Rosenzweig A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were 7A9 and H4/18 (to human E-selectin), Hu5/3 (to human ICAM-1), E1/6 (which recognizes both human and rabbit VCAM-1), Rb 1/9 (which recognizes only rabbit VCAM-1), IgG1, and IgG2A control mAb (PharMingen). Antibodies to leukocyte epitopes were CD11b, CD49D, and CD62L (PE labeled from PharMingen). Monocytes were washed once with RPMI/5% fetal calf serum and incubated with the indicated fluorescent-tagged (non-fluorescein isothiocyanate for EGFP-transduced cells) primary antibodies for 30–60 min on ice, washed twice with RPMI/5% fetal calf serum, and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. An isotype matched, fluorescent-labeled non-binding antibody was included as a control. Fluorescence was then analyzed using a Becton-Dickinson FACS set to detect fluorescence, forward scatter, and size. Human monocytes were purified from healthy human donors by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation at 15 °C (LSM, Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) followed by magnetic bead purification (Miltenyi Biotech). Monocyte suspensions were >92% pure as determined by light scatter and cell surface antigen analysis. We employed a commercially available parallel plate laminar flow chamber (Immunetics, Cambridge, MA). For biochemical inhibitor studies, the monocytes were incubated with the indicated compound or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min at 16 °C and then diluted with perfusion medium to 106cells/ml. Where indicated, chemokines were added to the monocyte reservoir (room temperature). Monocyte rolling (>3 s) and firm adhesion (>3 s) were quantified for each coverslip 1 min prior to and 1 min after addition of the chemokine. The cells were perfused at an estimated shear stress of 2.0 dynes/cm2 (flow rate of 0.78 ml/min). The entire period of perfusion was recorded on videotape. Purified monocytes or THP-1 cells were pretreated with inhibitor or vehicle control. Monocytes were then stimulated with chemokine, and the reaction was stopped with lysis buffer at the indicated time points. Monocyte lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAbs directed at the appropriate PI3K subunit or epitope tag for 4 h at 4 °C. PI3K activity was then measured directly using phosphatidylinositol and [γ-32P]ATP (12Matsui T. Li L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T. Hajjar R. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were then separated by TLC and32P-labeled PIP was visualized by autoradiography. PI(4)P standard (Avanti Polar Lipids) was run in parallel. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. or S.E., as indicated. Statistical comparison of means was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. The null hypothesis was rejected at p < 0.05. We first examined the effects of biochemical inhibition of PI3K activity on monocyte adhesion in a parallel-plate laminar flow model. We qualitatively and quantitatively assessed monocyte interactions with HUVEC cells transduced with adenoviruses carrying cDNAs for the human adhesion molecules, E-selectin (AdE-sel) or ICAM-1. The phenotype of persistent monocyte-endothelial interactions was characterized as either rolling or firm arrest at 2.0 dynes/cm2. As shown previously, purified human monocytes predominantly rolled on endothelial monolayers transduced with AdE-sel (2Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The addition of recombinant MCP-1 (25 nm) to the flow of incoming monocytes, at physiologically relevant concentrations, markedly augmented monocyte adhesion (Fig. 1), at least in part, though activation of β1 and β2 integrins (2Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), (data not shown). Pretreatment of monocytes with the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (10 nm) or the structurally unrelated LY294002 (50 µm), significantly reduced monocyte firm adhesion and increased rolling on the monolayers after chemokine treatment. Flow cytometry experiments on purified human monocytes showed no effect of wortmannin (10 nm) or LY294002 (50 µm) on surface expression of l-selectin or β2 integrins (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 1, we also saw no effect of wortmannin pretreatment on baseline monocyte-endothelial cell interactions under the conditions tested. Effects of wortmannin on monocyte-endothelial cell interactions were seen at 10 nm, suggesting a specific effect on PI3K, rather than nonspecific effects on alternative pathways (13Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, chemokine pretreatment of the endothelial monolayer has no effect on monocyte adhesion in this model (data not shown) (2Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Chemokines activate several PI3K isoforms in leukocytes, including the classical PI3Kα (p85/p110, IA) isoform as well as PI3Kγ (p101/p110, IB), which is thought to be activated exclusively by G protein-coupled receptors (3Turner L. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2437-2444PubMed Google Scholar, 4Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5al-Aoukaty A. Rolstad B. Maghazachi A.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3249-3255PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the kinetics and relative activation of PI3Kα and PI3Kγ in purified human monocytes. As seen in Fig.2 A, MCP-1 activated PI3Kα, and pretreatment of monocytes with low-dose wortmannin (or LY294002, data not shown) markedly attenuated this activity. Though baseline PI3K activity varied, an increase in lipid kinase activity of PI3Kα was evident within 30 s of MCP-1 stimulation (Fig. 2 B). These data, suggesting rapid activation of the classical PI3K pathway, paralleled our observation that monocyte rolling is converted to firm adhesion in less than 1 min. Interestingly, activity of PI3Kγ, previously implicated in chemokine signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (5al-Aoukaty A. Rolstad B. Maghazachi A.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3249-3255PubMed Google Scholar), was unchanged by MCP-1 at the 30 s and 3 min time points, though background levels were also inhibited by wortmannin. Importantly, the concentration of wortmannin (10 nm) and LY294002 (50 µm) necessary for biochemical inhibition in monocytic cells, as seen in Fig. 2 C, was comparable with the concentration necessary for functional inhibition. As biochemical inhibitors suggested that PI3K is necessary for MCP-1-triggered monocyte adhesion, we next used a constitutively active PI3K construct (AdBD110), which employs the p85 binding domain fused in-frame with the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, to address whether PI3K activation is sufficient to recapitulate the augmented adhesion seen by chemokine activation of monocytes under flow. To manipulate signaling pathways using somatic gene transfer, we employed the monocytic THP-1 cell line, which mimics much of the phenotype of human monocytes (14Vaddi K. Newton R.C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We first assessed lipid kinase activity in vitro of the monocytic THP-1 cell line transduced with the constitutively active PI3K construct. Cell lysates from the transduced THP-1 cells were concentrated using a combination of mAbs, directed at both the c-Myc-tagged BD110 and endogenous p110 proteins. As seen in Fig. 3, basal activity of uninfected THP-1 cells was low and was unaffected by infection with a control adenoviral construct or an adenovirus carrying the cDNA for a constitutively active Akt construct. In contrast, we saw a marked increase in PI3K activity in the AdBD110-transduced THP-1 cells. We performed flow cytometry experiments on transduced monocytic cells in parallel with functional assays. We saw no effect of adenoviral gene transfer or PI3K inhibitors on surface expression of integrins critical for monocyte-endothelial interactions or on general markers of leukocyte activation (Fig. 4). Having confirmed that AdBD110 confers increased PI3K activity, we then investigated the functional consequences of this activity in monocytic cells under dynamic conditions. As seen in Fig.5, uninfected and AdEGFP-transduced THP-1 cells show moderate baseline adhesion to HUVEC monolayers co-expressing E-selectin and ICAM-1. Firm adhesion of both uninfected and AdEGFP-transduced THP-1 cells was similarly enhanced by MCP-1 (25 nm). In contrast, we saw approximately a 3-fold increase in baseline ICAM-1-dependent firm adhesion of the BD110-transduced THP-1 cells, to a level comparable with that seen after THP-1 cells are stimulated with MCP-1. In studies employing VCAM-1-transduced monolayers, we also saw augmented adhesion conferred by transduction of THP-1 cells with the BD110 construct (data not shown). Increased adhesion rendered by constitutive PI3K activation and MCP-1 stimulation was inhibited by pretreatment with wortmannin (10 nm). Interestingly, we saw a further increase in overall adhesion after the addition of MCP-1 to the BD110-transduced THP-1 cells.Figure 5PI3K is sufficient to augment adhesion.HUVEC were transduced with AdE-sel and AdICAM-1 (MOI = 50 for each) and cultured for 48 h. THP-1 cells were left untransduced, or infected with AdEGFP or AdBD110 in parallel with the biochemical analysis described above. Leukocyte-endothelial interactions were studied at 2.0 dynes/cm2. When indicated, interactions were quantified 1 min prior to and 1 min after the addition of MCP-1 (25 nm). Uninfected and AdEGFP-transduced THP-1 cell adhesion is comparably enhanced by MCP-1 (n = 6; *p < 0.01 compared with baseline, p = NS compared with each other.) Adhesion of AdBD110-transduced THP-1 cells is increased significantly (n = 4; **p < 0.01) and is further enhanced by the addition of MCP-1(25 nm, n = 3, ***p < 0.05), but entirely abrogated by pretreatment with wortmannin (10 nm; n = 3; ****p < 0.01). Cumulative data from three experiments are shown with the number of coverslips for each condition noted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The serine-threonine kinase Akt is an early critical branching point downstream of PI3K and has been implicated in chemokine-triggered signaling (15Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 16Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Its role in protecting cells from apoptosis is well characterized (17Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Akt is also activated by chemokines in a variety of leukocyte subsets in a PI3K-dependent manner and in a time course that could be consistent with a role in the adhesive process (18Sotsios Y. Whittaker G.C. Westwick J. Ward S.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5954-5963PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether Akt, like PI3K, is sufficient to augment adhesion. We employed Ad.myr-Akt an adenovirus containing the cDNA for human Akt rendered constitutively active by the addition of the Src myristoylation signal (12Matsui T. Li L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T. Hajjar R. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.6 A, MCP-1 rapidly activates Akt in monocytic cells. Transduction of THP-1 cells with BD110 and Ad.myr-akt confers comparable levels of Akt activation as assessed by a mAb specific to Akt phosphorylation at the Ser-473 site. In contrast to PI3K, however, activated Akt did not augment adhesion under flow conditions (Fig. 6 B). Chemokines can markedly enhance leukocyte interactions with surface-expressed adhesion molecules via the rapid activation of integrins, though the relevant signaling pathways remain poorly characterized. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have suggested an important role for PI3K in chemokine signaling, as inhibition of PI3K by biochemical inhibitors and genetic manipulation alter chemotaxis and leukocyte accumulation in several animal models. However, the role of PI3K in leukocyte adhesion under dynamic conditions has not been characterized. The data presented here extend the role of PI3K, as it is necessary for the chemokine-triggered conversion of monocyte rolling to firm arrest, an early step in monocyte recruitment from flowing blood. In addition, our studies also show that PI3K activation is sufficient to augment both β1- (binds VCAM-1) and β2- (binds ICAM-1) integrin-dependent adhesion. A previous study employing a T cell line transduced with a vaccinia virus carrying a constitutively active PI3K construct showed increased adhesion to an ICAM-1·Ig fusion protein under static conditions, though adhesion in their model was not inhibited by PI3K inhibitors such as wortmannin or LY294002 (19Nagel W. Zeitlmann L. Schilcher P. Geiger C. Kolanus J. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14853-14861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, conversion of leukocyte rolling to firm adhesion both by chemokines and AdBD110 was clearly dependent on PI3K in our system. Additionally, we noted that adhesion of THP-1 cells transduced with the constitutively active construct was further augmented by the addition of MCP-1. These data suggest that constitutive activation by this construct is insufficient to saturate all downstream targets or that other signaling pathways can also contribute to augmented firm adhesion. Western blot analysis on lysates from monocytic cells transduced with AdBD110 show little if any further augmentation of Akt activation by the addition of MCP-1 (data not shown), suggesting the latter may be the more likely explanation. Whereas recent studies of PI3K have underscored its importance in a variety of inflammatory models, they have also underscored our poor understanding of the relevant downstream substrates (20Dekker L.V. Segal A.W. Science. 2000; 287 (., 985): 982-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Akt is a key signaling branchpoint downstream of PI3K, and we were particularly interested in its potential role in the adhesive process. Data in lower organisms suggest a functional role for an Akt homolog in chemotaxis triggered by cAMP (21Meili R. Ellsworth C. Lee S. Reddy T.B. Ma H. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2092-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Correlative data in human neutrophil-like HL-60 cells also suggest a role for Akt in chemotaxis to chemokines fMLP and C5a (15Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to a constitutively active PI3K construct, a constitutively active Akt construct was not sufficient to augment adhesion under flow conditions in our model. Studies in knockout mice suggest an important role for PI3Kγ in several in vitro and in vivo inflammatory models, though it should be noted that loss of PI3Kγ had a spectrum of effects on various leukocyte subsets (6Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 7Sasaki T.

Other lines of investigation show that PI3Kγ is activated by chemokines in human NK cells, and mAbs directed against this particular isoform, as opposed to mAbs directed at PI3Kα, inhibit NK cell chemotaxis (5al-Aoukaty A. Rolstad B. Maghazachi A.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3249-3255PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, it is interesting to note that we did not detect MCP-1-induced activation of PI3Kγ in freshly isolated peripheral human monocytes. Whether the generation of PIP3 by PI3K isoforms is a general signal for leukocyte activation and migration, or specific PI3K isoforms confer specific downstream signals in individual leukocyte subsets, remains the subject of future investigations. Data from several lines of investigation, including work in PI3Kγ knockout mice noted previously, now suggest that the signaling pathways necessary for leukocyte chemotaxis differ from those responsible for other functions such as adhesion (2Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 22Loike J.D.

The CC chemokine MCP-4, for example, is a potent activator of human monocytes in chemotaxis and calcium flux studies, yet has a negligible effect in modulating leukocyte adhesion under flow. The CXC chemokine, interleukin-8, in contrast, has modest effects in calcium flux and chemotaxis, but is a surprisingly potent agonist for monocyte arrest. Somatic gene transfer, in addition to biochemical inhibitors and transgenic methods, may prove a useful tool to dissect pathways downstream of PI3K in chemokine-activated leukocytes responsible for these potentially distinct signaling mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2170532016,"Abstract Polynucleotide kinase is a bifunctional enzyme containing both DNA 3′-phosphatase and 5′-kinase activities seemingly suited to the coupled repair of single-strand nicks in which the phosphate has remained with the 3′-base. We show that the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae is able to repair transformed dephosphorylated linear plasmids by non-homologous end joining with considerable efficiency independently of the end-processing polymerase Pol4p. Homology searches and biochemical assays did not reveal a 5′-kinase that would account for this repair, however. Instead, open reading frame YMR156C (here named TPP1) is shown to encode only a polynucleotide kinase-type 3′-phosphatase. Tpp1p bears extensive similarity to the ancient l-2-halo-acid dehalogenase and DDDD phosphohydrolase superfamilies, but is specific for double-stranded DNA. It is present at high levels in cell extracts in a functional form and so does not represent a pseudogene. Moreover, the phosphatase-only nature of this gene is shared by Saccharomyces mikatae YMR156C and Arabidopsis thaliana K15M2.3. Repair of 3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl lesions is thus uncoupled in budding yeast as compared with metazoans. Repair of transformed dephosphorylated plasmids, and 5′-hydroxyl blocking lesions more generally, likely proceeds by a cycle of base removal and resynthesis."

Analysis of the BBP amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a structural module related to that of the 7 transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and known to be important in heterotrimeric G protein activation. Data suggest that BBP mediates cellular vulnerability to Aμ toxicity through a G protein-regulated program of cell death. Two related proteins (BLP1, BLP2; BBP-like proteins) were identified by sequence and structural similarities to BBP, but only the BBP subtype regulates a response to Aμ. Yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) expression plasmids were constructed in the vectors pAS2 and pACT2 (19Wade Harper J. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). Strain CY770 (20Ozenberger B. Young K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1321-1329PubMed Google Scholar) served as host for Y2H assays. Sequences encoding Aμ42 were amplified by PCR using primers incorporating restriction sites for subsequent ligation into pAS2, using a human APP (amyloid precursor protein) cDNA clone as template. A Y2H plasmid library consisting of cDNA fragments isolated from human fetal brain cloned into the yeast 2-hybrid expression vector pACT2 (CLONTECH Laboratories) was screened with pAS2-Aμ. Interactors were identified on synthetic complete yeast growth medium lacking histidine and containing 3-amino-triazole at a concentration of 25 mm. Y2H expression plasmids for BBP deletion analyses were generated by standard methods. Expression of all hybrid proteins was confirmed by immunoblot using antibodies (CLONTECH) directed to the Gal4 sequences. μ-galactosidase assays to measure Y2H interactions were conducted in strain CY770 containing the indicated Y2H expression plasmids plus the GALUAS-lacZ reporter plasmid pRY131 (21Yocum R. Hanley S. West R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A modified rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) protocol was utilized to obtain 5′-BBP sequences absent in the original Y2H clone. First strand DNA synthesis was performed using the rTth thermal-stable polymerase system (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) with human hippocampus mRNA as template. The Marathon™ cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH) was used for subsequent second strand cDNA generation and amplification. In addition, a human genomic lambda library (Stratagene) was screened with a randomly primed BBP protein coding region probe. Positive clones were purified and subjected to further analysis by hybridization to a 45-nucleotide probe directed to the most 5′ sequences known from the original cDNA clone. The nucleotide sequence of the upstream BBP region from a positive λ clone was identical to cDNA sequences identified by RACE. Mouse BBP cDNA and human BLP1 and BLP2 cDNA sequences were initially assembled from expressed sequence tag (EST) data extracted from GenbankTM/EBI. These segments, which did not include potential translation start sequences but extended 3′ to poly(A) sequences, were amplified by RT-PCR from mouse or human brain mRNA. Subsequently, RACE was used to isolate 5′ sequences for human BLP1 and BLP2. RACE failed for mouse BBP, but 5′ sequences were obtained to a potential initiating ATG from genomic cloning (data not described). The three human cDNAs were assigned accession numbersAF353990, AF353991, and AF353992; mouse BBP AF353993. Predicted BBP ectodomain sequences were synthesized as five nonoverlapping peptides. The peptides were pooled and conjugated to activated KLH carrier protein per vendor's instructions (Pierce). Chickens were injected intramuscularly with 0.1 mg of peptides/KLH each week for 4 weeks. Eggs were collected and tested for IgY titer to each BBP peptide by ELISA. IgY was partially purified from egg yolk by dilution and ammonium sulfate precipitation (22Akita E. Nakai S. J. Food Sci. 1992; 57: 629-634Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This sample was further purified by solid phase affinity binding to BBP peptide composed of residues 42–81 (Fig.1 A). Expression of recombinant BBP protein was evaluated in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell lysates. Cells were transfected with pBBP by LipofectAMINE-PLUS per manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) instructions. Cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2; 1 mm EDTA) plus proteinase inhibitors and were maintained on ice. Cells were disrupted using a polytron and debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Soluble and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at ∼200,000 × g using a 45Ti rotor in a TL100 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The membrane pellet was resolubilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% Triton X-100 plus proteinase inhibitors. Laemmli's buffer with detergent and 2-mercaptoethanol were added to aliquots containing 50 μg of protein, and samples were boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis in a 4–10% Tris-glycine NuPage gel (NOVEX). Samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by the semi-dry method (BIORAD). Blots were probed with the chicken anti-BBP antibody described above, using rabbit anti-IgY conjugated to horseradish peroxide (Promega) as a secondary detection reagent. Proteins were visualized by development with the ECL-Plus reagent and exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Deglycosylation of proteins was achieved using the enzymes PNGase-F, NANase II, and O-glycosidase DS per manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Human multiple tissue mRNA Northern blots were obtained from CLONTECH. BBP sequences extending from the original Y2H fusion junction to the poly(A) region were used to generate a radiolabeled probe. Similar BLP1 and BLP2 cDNAs were used to generate probes. Control μ-actin DNA was provided by the manufacturer. Hybridizations were performed per manufacturer's (CLONTECH) instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed utilizing a PE Applied Biosystems 7700 instrument per manufacturer's instructions, probing with sequences contained within the BBP protein coding region. Detection reagents for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were used to qualitatively assess RNA samples and to standardize reactions. DNA templates for riboprobe synthesis were prepared by PCR using each human BBP or BLP cDNA. Subsequent riboprobes were generated to 3′-untranslated regions using the Riboprobe GeminiTM System (Promega). In situhybridization histochemistry using sections of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) forebrain was performed as described previously (23Rhodes K. Monaghan M. Barrezueta N. Nawoschik S. Bekele-Arcuri Z. Matos M. Nakahira K. Schechter L. Trimmer J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4846-4860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Emulsion autoradiograms were developed and fixed according to the manufacturer's (Kodak) instructions, and the underlying tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin. To assess nonspecific labeling, a control probe was generated from a template provided in the Riboprobe GeminiTM System kit. No specific hybridization was observed in control sections. The tagged BBP segment used inin vitro binding assays was produced by amplifying cDNA encoding the BBP protein from the clone 14 junction to ½tm, incorporating DNA encoding the c-Myc epitope EQKLISEEDL in the 5′-PCR primer. This DNA was cloned into the pET28a vector and transformed intoE. coli strain BL21/DE3 (Novagen). Recombinant BBP protein was isolated in inclusion bodies extracted by B-PER reagent (Pierce). Samples were resuspended in 20 ml of 1× binding buffer (Novagen) containing 6 m urea and purified using His-Bind™ chromatography (Novagen) in the presence of 6 m urea. Following elution, urea was removed by dialysis against binding buffer. To prepare Sepharose-antibody complex, 1.5 mg of swelled protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was mixed with 3.3 ml of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) in cold immunoprecipitation buffer (IPB; Ref. 24Sisodia S. Koo E. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) plus 0.02% NaN3 with rotation overnight at 4 °C. After washes, the 6E10 anti-Aμ antibody (Senetek PLC) was added, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. Purified BBP was combined with 500 ng of Aμ40 at a 1:1 molar ratio in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. For Aμ40–1 competition experiments, 25 μg (50× molar excess) of Aμ40–1 was combined with BBP and Aμ1–40. Samples were agitated at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with 200 μl of IPB, resuspended in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing μ-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on a 10–20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel. Standard Western blot procedures utilizing Ni2+-horseradish peroxidase were used to detect BBP. ELISA plates for solid phase binding measurements were coated with Aμ40 peptide and blocked with 5% BSA as described elsewhere (25Matsubara E. Soto C. Governale S. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Forty-residue human or rodent μ-amyloid peptide and reverse human peptide were obtained from AnaSpec, Inc. Peptides were dissolved and stored in hexafluoro-isopropyl alcohol at 1 mg/ml. Samples were lyophilized by pervasion with nitrogen and then resuspended in PBS and immediately frozen as disaggregated peptide. To achieve consistent aggregation, the peptides were resuspended in cell growth medium and divided into 0.13-ml aliquots in a 96-well plate. The plate was shaken at 500 rpm for 5 h. Samples were then combined and normalized to a final Aμ concentration of 50 μm and immediately frozen. The human Aμ peptide was evaluated for circular dichroism and thioflavin-S fluorescence and shown to be predominantly aggregated, but not fibrillar. Purified tagged BBP protein was prepared in PBS plus 5% BSA. Protein was applied to Aμ-coated plates for 1 h at room temperature, washed 5× with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Bound BBP was detected by application of mouse anti-Myc antibody (CalBiochem) followed by five washes, with subsequent application of donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Following five washes and development with an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (BIORAD),A 405 values were obtained. Values obtained from wells lacking Aμ peptide were subtracted from total bound BBP1 to calculate specific binding. Competition assays were performed by adding peptides to BBP (50 nm) in PBS, 5% BSA and incubating at 4o overnight prior to application to Aμ-coated plates. Approximate binding coefficients were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using PRISM software (Graphpad, Inc.). Human Ntera-2 (Nt2) stem cells (26Andrews P. Develop. Biol. 1984; 103: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium/F-12 Ham nutrients plus 15% fetal bovine serum. BBP cDNAs were modified by PCR for expression from the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Mutation of the arginine codon to glutamate within the DRF motif of BBP cDNA was performed using the QuickChange™ system (Stratagene). Cell viability determinations were performed with a CellTiter kit (Promega) measuring conversion of MTS tetrazolium to formazan. For nuclear morphology assays, expression constructs were introduced with pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) into cells by electroporation. DNA amounts were 7.5 μg of subject DNA plus 2.5 μg of pEGFP-N1. Approximately 24 h after transfection, growth medium was replaced with medium containing 10 μmAμ peptide. Forty-eight hours after Aμ addition, the chromatin-specific dye Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to a concentration of 10 ng/ml. Medium was removed after 10 min, and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were then fixed by immersion in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. A minimum of 200 transfected (EGFP+) cells per sample were scored manually by fluorescence microscopy. Statistical comparisons of apoptotic nuclei counts were conducted using Yates G-test of probability for categorical data. All experiments were repeated greater than three times with the same results. Human Nt2 neurons were derived by treatment of stem cells with retinoic acid (26Andrews P. Develop. Biol. 1984; 103: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Neurons were transfected by the ProfectionTM system (Promega) using 4.5 μg of test plasmid plus 1.5 μg of pEGFP-N1 per sample. Similar to the other cellular assays, growth medium was replaced with medium containing 10 μm aggregated Aμ 24 h after transfection. Following incubation for 48 h, cells were fixed and nuclear morphologies of transfected (i.e. EGFP+) cells were scored as described above. Transfection efficiencies, determined as the fraction of green fluorescent cells, for Nt2 stem cells and neurons were routinely 5–6% and 1–2%, respectively. A Y2H genetic screen was developed to identify proteins that interact with human Aμ. The Y2H assay strain CY770, expressing Aμ42 fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain, was transformed with a human fetal brain cDNA Y2H library. A single clone, denoted no. 14, was selected for further characterization as it produced consistent reporter gene activation and contained a substantial open reading frame continuous with that of the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain. The cDNA insert of clone 14 comprised 984 base pairs, terminating in a poly(A) tract. This sequence encoded 201 amino acids with two regions of sufficient hydrophobicity and length to transverse a cellular membrane, indicated in Fig.1 A as tm1 andtm2. Examination of available databases revealed numerous ESTs, but no entry contained a complete open reading frame or attributed a potential function to the protein, which we designate BBP. The BBP cDNA contained in clone 14 lacked a potential native translation initiation site. BBP 5′-DNA sequences were identified from both cDNA and genomic DNA sources. The additional cDNA sequence contained three possible start codons preceded by an inframe stop codon. The deduced sequence of the translation product shown in Fig. 1 A begins at the first potential start site possessing suitable context for efficient translation initiation (27Kozak M. Mammal. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), and as suggested experimentally by recombinantly expressed BBP (data not shown). Peptides contained in the predicted ectodomains of BBP were used to immunize chickens. The chicken IgY was purified and utilized to probe partitioned soluble and membrane fractions produced from cells transfected with a BBP cDNA expression plasmid. A broad specific band of 36–42 kDa was observed in the membrane-enriched fraction (Fig. 1 B); no protein was detected in the soluble fraction. Enzymatic removal of carbohydrates resulted in a shift to 19 kDa, demonstrating that the BBP protein is extensively glycosylated. These data suggest that mature BBP is an integral membrane glycoprotein likely derived from a precursor containing a cleavable secretory signal leader. To investigate this prediction, recombinant human BBP protein lacking putative transmembrane (tm) domains was produced as a fusion to immunoglobulin Fc domain to facilitate protein stability and detection. This fusion protein was found to be secreted from cultured cells. Amino terminal sequencing of the protein revealed a single product processed to the position indicated in Fig. 1 A. The site of cleavage is canonical to the signal peptidase site consensus (28Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). The cleaved protein contains 170 amino acids, consistent with the migration of deglycosylated protein at ∼19 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The BBP protein and translations of available ESTs were assembled, aligned, searched for conserved segments, and evaluated by the MoST protein motif search algorithm (29Tatusov R. Altschul S. Koonin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12091-12095Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). First, these analyses revealed three distinct sets of ESTs in both the human and mouse datasets, indicating that BBP is one member of a structurally related protein family. Subsequently, orthologous sequences to mammalian BBP and the BBP-like proteins were also identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. No additional subtypes were detected in available databases. Human BLP1 and BLP2, and mouse and fly BBP cDNAs were isolated by RT-PCR methodologies using EST and genomic DNA information to guide primer design. The cDNA sequences encoding the mouse and fly BLP1 and BLP2 proteins were derived from EST and genomic DNA consensus determinations. Alignment of the three translation products from human, mouse, and fly revealed several key features (Fig. 2 A). Most striking is a segment exhibiting a significant relationship to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Specifically, these proteins contain two potential tm domains with a high degree of similarity to the third and fourth tm domains of GPCRs (Fig.2 A and B). The similarity includes the intervening hydrophilic loop, which contains the well characterized three amino acid motif, aspartate (D), arginine (R), and an aromatic residue (Y or F) (commonly referred to as the DRY sequence), that is conserved in most members of this receptor superfamily and has been shown to serve as the molecular trigger for G protein activation (30Acharya S. Karnik S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25406-25411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to a general similarity, >25% identity to the tm3 through tm4 segment of some GPCR members, other very highly conserved amino acids include a cysteine immediately preceding tm3 (BBP tm1) and a lysine marking the beginning of tm4 (BBP tm2). A tryptophan found in tm4 of ∼95% of GPCRs is present at the equivalent position in the BLP1 and BLP2 subtypes. Preceding the tm domains, there is little homology between BBP/BLP subtypes, a common feature of receptor families sharing a conserved signal coupling domain, with unique activities determined by less conserved ectodomains. Each protein possesses a region of strong hydrophobicity near the amino terminus, indicative of an amino-terminal secretory signal. With the demonstrated functionality of the amino-terminal signal sequence in BBP, and in conjunction with the homologies to GPCR topology, it is predicted that the proteins transverse cellular membranes twice, with both termini luminal or extracellular as depicted in Fig. 2 B. As with prototypic 7-tm domain G protein-coupled receptors, the BBP/BLP proteins contain the important DRF motif appropriately positioned between two tm domains, juxtaposed to the first tm domain. This suggests that the proteins could modulate a heterotrimeric G protein regulatory pathway. Tissue expression of BBP and BLP mRNAs was evaluated, revealing major transcripts of 1.25 kb, 1.35 kb, or 1.40 kb for BBP, BLP1, and BLP2, respectively, in all samples (Fig. 3 A). Analysis ofin situ hybridization autoradiograms of non-human primate forebrain obtained using riboprobes directed to each BBP mRNA demonstrated that all three genes are prominently expressed in medium to large cells in a pattern indicative of elevated expression in neurons as opposed to glial cells. BBP/BLP transcripts were observed in largely overlapping regional patterns, with greatest expression in the hippocampus and neocortex (Fig. 3 B). The BBP riboprobe was also used to evaluate a human hippocampus/entorhinal cortex sample, revealing expression in virtually all neurons (data not shown). In summary, BBP mRNAs were observed in all tissues examined, andin situ analyses of brain samples revealed extensive expression in neurons of the hippocampus/entorhinal cortex and neocortical regions. This pattern is similar to the regionally-restricted neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease (31Hamos J. DeGennaro L. Drachman D. Neurology. 1989; 39: 355-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32McKee A. Kosik K. Kowall N. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). More rigorous histopathological studies will be necessary to fully assess correlations between BBP expression and disease pathology. Deletion variants of BBP were examined in Y2H assays to delineate the Aμ-binding domain. Results are shown in Fig. 4 A. The original clone 14 produced only a weak response with the Aμ fusion protein. Protein transmembrane domains have been observed to substantially attenuate Y2H responses, 2B. A. Ozenberger, unpublished data. as the reconstitution of transcription activator function must occur in the cell nucleus. Deletion of the second tm domain and carboxyl-terminal sequences of BBP resulted in much more robust Y2H activity, measured by activation of either HIS3 orlacZ reporter genes (clone14-Δtm2). Moving in from the amino end, protein deleted for approximately half of the region between the clone 14 junction and tm1 maintained a positive interaction with Aμ (Δ60-Δtm2). The deletion of 26 additional amino acids resulted in the loss of a Y2H response with Aμ (Δ86-Δtm2). From the carboxyl end, one-half of the tm1 domain could be deleted with no effect on Y2H interaction (Δ60-½tm). However, complete removal of the first tm domain (Δ60-Δtm1) resulted in loss of activity. These results indicate that crucial Aμ binding determinants within BBP are contained within the segment delineated by Δ60 and ½tm. The elimination of the Aμ association upon further deletion from either terminus could result from structural disruption of a single binding site by a distant deletion, or more likely, suggests that two important contacts with Aμ exist (between Δ60 and Δ86, and Δtm1 and ½tm), each necessary but not sufficient for binding alone. The amino-terminal Aμ-binding segment of BBP (between the clone 14 and ½tm sites; see Fig. 4 A) was expressed in bacteria with amino-terminal His6 and c-Myc tag sequences. This protein was purified and utilized in in vitro binding assessments with synthetic Aμ peptide. In pull-down experiments, BBP was mixed with disaggregated Aμ, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Aμ antibody 6E10. Denatured protein complexes were subsequently evaluated using a Ni2+-peroxidase conjugate to detect the His6 tag of the BBP protein. As controls, Aμ was omitted or 50-fold excess reverse Aμ40–1 was added as a potential competitor of binding. Associated BBP protein could be readily observed in the Aμ immunocomplexes, and the signal was not affected by the addition of reverse peptide (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that BBP binds non-fusion Aμ peptide, complementing the Y2H results. A solid phase assay was developed to initiate pharmacological analyses of BBP/Aμ binding. Aμ was immobilized in 96-well plates, and bound BBP was measured with an anti-Myc antibody. Specific binding of BBP to Aμ was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding in wells lacking Aμ peptide. The binding of BBP protein to Aμ exhibited saturable, high affinity characteristics (K d = 150 nm, Fig. 4 C). For the binding experiments, Aμ peptide was disaggregated to provide a homogeneous preparation. However, disaggregated Aμ has much reduced neurotoxicity in cell culture. Only Aμ aggregates possess substantial toxic properties (33Maggio J. Stimson E. Ghilardi J. Allen C. Dahl C. Whitcomb D. Vigna S. Vinters H. Labenski M. Mantyh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5462-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). BBP binding to wells coated with disaggregated or aggregated Aμ was compared to determine whether BBP could bind neurotoxic-aggregated Aμ. BBP bound to Aμ in vitro regardless of the peptide state prior to application (Fig. 4 D). BBP binding to Aμ in solution (Fig. 4 C) was also independent of peptide ag"

In the current studies, we show that two different classes (ATP-sensitive and -insensitive) of TOP2 poisons can be identified based on their differential sensitivity to the ATP-bound conformation of TOP2. First, in the presence of 1 mm ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g.doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone, and 4′-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide) was 30–100-fold stimulated, whereas DNA cleavage induced by ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. amonafide, batracylin, and menadione) was only slightly (less than 3-fold) affected. In addition, ADP was shown to strongly antagonize TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Second, C427A mutant human TOP2α, which exhibits reduced ATPase activity, was shown to exhibit cross-resistance to all ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Third, using ciprofloxacin competition assay, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive poisons was shown to be antagonized by ciprofloxacin. These results suggest that ATP-bound TOP2 may be the specific target of ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons. Using Lac repressor-operator complexes as roadblocks, we show that ATP-bound TOP2 acts as a circular clamp capable of entering DNA ends and sliding on unobstructed duplex DNA.

A. 1987; 84: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The breakage/reunion reaction of TOP2, which is ATP-dependent, can be interrupted by many antitumor drugs (TOP2 poisons) resulting in accumulation of a TOP2-DNA covalent intermediate, the cleavable complex (8Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Accumulation of TOP2 cleavable complexes causes tumor cell death (8Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) by which TOP2 poisons interfere with the breakage/reunion reaction of TOP2 is largely unknown. Several studies have implicated a possible role of ATP in modulating the pharmacological action of TOP2 poisons; uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. DNP and 2-deoxyglucose) have been shown to enhance survival of adriamycin (doxorubicin)-treated Chinese hamster cells (9Colofiore J.R. Ara G. Berry D. Belli J.A. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3934-3940PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, DNP, 2-deoxyglucose, and sodium cyanide, all of which affect ATP metabolism, effectively protect L1210 cells from the cytotoxic action of VM-26 and m-AMSA (10Kupfer G. Bodley A.L. Liu L.F. NCI Monogr. 1987; 4: 37-40PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous cotreatment with DNP or novobiocin has been shown to abrogate m-AMSA cytotoxicity in Chinese hamster cells (11Utsumi H. Shibuya M.L. Kosaka T. Buddenbaum W.E. Elkind M.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2577-2581PubMed Google Scholar). VP-16 (etoposide)-induced chromosome-type aberrations (mainly breaks and exchanges) in cultured Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts are reduced also by cotreatment with DNP (12Suzuki H. Ikeda T.

Whether these effects are due to a direct effect of ATP on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by TOP2 poisons is not known. Studies in bacteria have demonstrated also that the ATP/ADP ratio plays a critical role in modulating the supercoiling state of chromosomal DNA as well as cytotoxicity of quinolone antibiotics (13Li T.K. Liu L.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1022-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hsieh L.S. Burger R.M. Drlica K. J. Mol.

In this case, the role of ATP/ADP has been shown to directly affect TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage in the presence of quinolones (13Li T.K. Liu L.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1022-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of a drug-resistant TOP2 from mammalian cells have demonstrated also that ATP plays a direct role in modulating TOP2-mediated DNA cleavagein vitro (16Danks M.K. Schmidt C.A. Deneka D.A. Beck W.T. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Mao Y., Yu, C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we show that the ATP-bound conformation is the target of a class of ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons that includes many clinically useful TOP2-directed antitumor drugs such as doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, VP-16 (etoposide), and m-AMSA. The ATP-bound form of TOP2 has been shown to be a circular protein clamp based on biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies (18Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 19Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 20Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using Lac repressor-operator complexes as roadblocks, we have demonstrated further that the circular TOP2 protein clamp is capable of sliding on unobstructed duplex DNA. VM-26 was a gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, and amonafide were obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute. Batracylin was a gift from Dr. C. C. Cheng (University of Kansas). 5-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was obtained from Aldrich. All drugs were dissolved in Me2SO (10 mm) and kept frozen in aliquots at −20 °C. Ciprofloxacin was obtained from Bayer. ATP, AMPPNP, and ADP were purchased from Sigma. Except for fetal bovine serum, which was obtained from Gemini Biotech, media and other agents for tissue culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont. The mutation C427A was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Three rounds of PCR were carried out to introduce the C427A into human TOP2α cDNA in YEpWob6. The resulting plasmid is named Yhtop2αC427A. The following four primers were used (the mutations are marked in bold, and the restriction sites are underlined): primer A, 5′-ACGCGTCGACGAATTCGACAGGTTATC-3′ SalI; primer B, 5′-ACAAGAAGGCCTCAGCTGTA-3′; primer C, 5′-TACAGCTGAGGCCTTCTTGT-3′; and primer D, 5′-GCCTGGTACCAAACTGAC-3′ KpnI. Primers B and C contain the alanine codon instead of the wild-type cysteine codon. Primers A and D contain the recognition sites forSalI and KpnI, respectively. Two fragments, AC and BD, which have the alanine codon, were generated during the first round PCR in the presence of YEpWob6 DNA. After denaturation and renaturation of fragments AC and BD, two cycles of a second round of PCR without any primer were carried out to generate a small amount of the fragment containing C427A as the template for the third round of PCR. The third round of PCR amplified the fragment containing C427A using primers A and D. SalI and KpnI were used to digest both the fragment-containing C427A and YEpWob6 (partially digested with SalI), and ligation was carried out at 14 °C overnight. The mutated site was confirmed by sequence analysis. TOP2 was purified to homogeneity from calf thymus glands according to the published procedure (21Halligan B.D. Edwards K.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2475-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length human TOP2β cDNA (hTOP2β cDNA) was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR using mRNA isolated from human U937 cells and primers with sequences according to the published sequence of HeLa TOP2β (22Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For overexpression, hTOP2β cDNA was used to replace the human TOP2α cDNA (hTOP2α cDNA) in YEpWob6 (23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, YEphTOP2β, then was used to transform protease-deficient yeast BCY123 (23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of both TOP2 isozymes and mutant enzyme were performed following the published procedure (23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Lac repressor was a kind gift from Dr. Kathleen S. Matthews (Rice University). YEpG (24Wyckoff E. Hsieh T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is a derivative of YEP24. pYβYOm was constructed by inserting a 42-bp DNA oligomer containing a 21-bp essential Lac repressor binding site (25Wu H.Y. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) into theNotI site in pBRβY (26Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). pYβYOd, which contains two Lac repressor binding sites, was constructed by inserting the same 42-bp oligomer into the XbaI site in pYβYOm. All plasmids were purified using the Qiagen purification kit. 3′ end-labeling of plasmid DNA was performed as described previously (21Halligan B.D. Edwards K.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2475-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of DNA was digested with a proper restriction enzyme followed by labeling at its 3′ ends with the large fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. Unincorporated triphosphates were removed by two cycles of ethanol precipitation in the presence of 2.5 m ammonium acetate. The TOP2 cleavage assay was performed as described previously (27Tewey K.M. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Halligan B.D. Liu L.F. Science. 1984; 226: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (20 μl each) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 ng of 3′ end-labeled DNA, 10 ng of TOP2, and various drugs were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 5% SDS and 150 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C. After the addition of sucrose (5% final concentration) and bromphenol blue (0.05 mg/ml final concentration), DNA samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in TPE (90 mm Tris phosphate, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) buffer. Gels then were dried onto Whatman No. 3MM chromatographic paper and autoradiographed at −80 °C using Kodak XAR-5 films. Knotted P4 phage DNA was used to assay the strand-passing activity of TOP2 (28Liu L.F. Davis J.L. Calendar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3979-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl each) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, calf thymus TOP2 (titrated prior to the experiment), and various amounts of ADP and/or ATP as indicated were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of a solution containing 20% Ficoll, 5% Sarkosyl, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mg/ml bromphenol blue. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing TPE buffer. The ATPase assay was performed as described (29Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that an 8.6-kilobase plasmid DNA, pCaSpeRhs83 (30Horabin J.I. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1408-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was used. Radioactivities were quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The possible effect of ATP on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage was studied using purified TOP2 and various TOP2 poisons. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 1 mm ATP stimulated calf thymus TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26 by about 60-fold (Fig. 1 A) (ATP stimulation is estimated as the -fold of increased drug concentration in the absence of ATP for achieving the same extent of cleavage in the presence of ATP). By contrast, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by amonafide was affected only slightly (less than 3-fold) by 1 mm ATP (Fig. 1 B). The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP, gave similar results as ATP (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with recombinant human TOP2α and TOP2β (data not shown). TOP2 poisons that are highly (about 30–100-fold) stimulated by ATP in the TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage assay include VM-26, VP-16, m-AMSA, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone (referred to as ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons). TOP2 poisons that are affected only slightly by ATP (less than 3-fold) include amonafide, batracylin, and menadione (referred to as ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons). Although ATP strongly stimulated TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26, ADP alone had no such effect (Fig.2). However, in the presence of ATP, ADP effectively antagonized the ATP stimulatory effect on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26 (Fig. 2). The antagonistic effect of ADP on VM-26-induced DNA cleavage was observed also with other ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons (data not shown). By contrast, ATP had a minimum effect on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage in the presence of amonafide, an ATP-insensitive TOP2 poison. In this case, ADP had a minimal effect on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by amonafide in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2). These results suggest that ADP specifically antagonizes the ATP-stimulatory effect on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons. We also had tested the effect of ADP on the catalytic activity of TOP2 using a P4 unknotting assay. As shown in Fig. 3, ADP also effectively antagonized the P4 unknotting activity of TOP2.Figure 3ADP inhibits the P4 unknotting activity of TOP2. The P4 unknotting assay for the catalytic activity of TOP2 was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Various concentrations of ATP and ADP were present as indicated ontop of each lane. The P4 knotted DNA migrated as a smear as indicated. The unknotted P4 DNA migrated as a band as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the role of ATP in the action of TOP2 poisons further, we generated C427A mutant TOP2α. The cysteine 427 is located in the ATPase domain of TOP2α (31Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Wolverton J.S. Chen M. Granzen B. Kim R. Suttle D.P. Liu L.F. DNA Topoisomerases: Topoisomerase-targeting Drugs. Academic Press, New York1994: 145-169Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, C427A mutant TOP2α exhibited almost identical sensitivity to both VM-26 and amonafide compared with wild-type TOP2α in a standard DNA cleavage assay (Fig.4). Strikingly, in the presence of 1 mm ATP, C427A mutant TOP2α was at least 10-fold more resistant to VM-26 as compared with the wild-type enzyme. The resistance of C427A mutant TOP2α to VM-26 is apparently caused by a reduced ATP-stimulatory effect on DNA cleavage as compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). By contrast, both mutant and wild-type TOP2α were equally sensitive to amonafide (Fig. 4). We also tested other ATP-sensitive drugs such as doxorubicin, m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, and CP115,953. Similar results to VM-26 were observed (data not shown). These results suggest that C427A mutant TOP2α can distinguish between ATP-sensitive and -insensitive TOP2 poisons, possibly because of its altered interaction with ATP. Previous studies on another multidrug-resistant mutant TOP2α mutant have shown that the mutant enzyme exhibits an increased ATP requirement for catalysis (16Danks M.K. Schmidt C.A. Deneka D.A. Beck W.T. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test whether C427A behaves similarly, the catalytic activity of the C427A mutant TOP2α was measured by a P4 unknotting assay in the presence of two different concentrations of ATP. As shown in Fig.5, C427A mutant TOP2α was about 5-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 1 mm ATP. However, in the presence of 50 μmATP, C427A was at least 25-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. This result is similar to the result from the experiment performed on another mutant TOP2α enzyme, R450Q TOP2α, which is cross-resistant to ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons and exhibits an increased ATP requirement for enzyme catalysis (17Mao Y., Yu, C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of C427A mutant TOP2α also was measured and shown to be much reduced relative to the wild-type enzyme. The Vmax was reduced from 60 to 11 mm min−1, andKm was increased from 0.78 to 3.2 mm. Ciprofloxacin is known to interact with TOP2 but does not induce significant TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage (32Elsea S.H. Westergaard M. Burden D.A. Lomenick J.P. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consequently, ciprofloxacin has been used to compete with other TOP2 poisons in a standard DNA cleavage assay to assess possible overlap of interaction domains on TOP2 (32Elsea S.H. Westergaard M. Burden D.A. Lomenick J.P. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on this kind of ciprofloxacin competition assay, it has been suggested that various TOP2 poisons including etoposide,m-AMSA, genistein, and the antineoplastic quinolone, CP-115,953, share a common interaction domain with ciprofloxacin on TOP2 (32Elsea S.H. Westergaard M. Burden D.A. Lomenick J.P. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test whether ATP-sensitive and -insensitive TOP2 poisons may interact with different domains on TOP2, we performed the ciprofloxacin competition assay (32Elsea S.H. Westergaard M. Burden D.A. Lomenick J.P. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, ciprofloxacin reduced TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26 as evidenced by the gradual increase in band intensity of the uncleaved DNA bands (see the arrow) with increasing ciprofloxacin concentrations (see laneslabeled 0.1 μmVM). By contrast, ciprofloxacin had little effect on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by amonafide (see the intensity of the uncleaved DNA bands inlanes labeled 1.0 μmAM). Similar ciprofloxacin competition assays were performed with other TOP2 poisons. All ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons were antagonized by ciprofloxacin in this DNA cleavage assay (data not shown). Previous studies have suggested that yeast TOP2 when bound to AMPPNP can undergo a conformational change into a circular protein clamp (19Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 20Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which is consistent with results from x-ray crystallographic studies (18Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). To test whether calf thymus TOP2 also can form a circular protein clamp in its ATP-bound form, we have designed a more stringent assay requiring the TOP2 protein clamp to slide on unobstructed DNA under physiological conditions. As shown in Fig. 7, a linear DNA (8310-bp, 32P end-labeled) with two internally bound Lac repressor molecules at their respective Lac operator sites was used to demonstrate entry and sliding of AMPPNP-bound TOP2. Calf thymus TOP2 was reacted first with AMPPNP to form a circular protein clamp and then incubated with the linear DNA bound by Lac repressors. VM-26 or amonafide was used subsequently to locate the TOP2 sliding clamps on DNA by inducing TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage. As shown in Fig. 7, in the presence of ATP, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage sites induced by VM-26 (lane 3) scattered all over the linear DNA (a similar result was obtained in the absence of ATP; data not shown). However, in the presence of AMPPNP, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26 (lane 5) occurred primarily near the two ends of the linear DNA and extended up to the Lac repressor binding sites. Similar results were obtained in the absence of VM-26 (compare background DNA cleavage in lanes 2 and 4 with VM-26-induced DNA cleavage in lanes 3 and 5, respectively). The lower part of the gel was overexposed to reveal cleavage sites from the other end (Fig. 7). The results from this experiment support the previous claim that AMPPNP-bound TOP2 is in the form of a circular protein clamp. In addition, this experiment has demonstrated that AMPPNP-bound TOP2 is a protein clamp capable of entering DNA ends and sliding on unobstructed duplex DNA while retaining sensitivity to VM-26. Our results have demonstrated that different TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by various TOP2 poisons exhibits a different degree of ATP dependence. The differences in ATP dependence among various TOP2 poisons may reflect differences in their interaction with TOP2 and/or TOP2-DNA complexes. Based on our current results, there seems to be two distinct classes of TOP2 poisons, ATP-sensitive and ATP-insensitive. These two classes of TOP2 poisons show quite different responses to ATP stimulation in the standard DNA cleavage assay. The specific antagonistic effect of ADP against ATP-sensitive but not -insensitive TOP2 poisons has demonstrated further the differences between these two classes of TOP2 poisons. The fact that ADP also strongly inhibits ATP-dependent catalytic activity of TOP2 suggests that ADP may compete with ATP both in enzyme catalysis and cleavable complex formation by the same mechanism. Studies in bacteria have established that the ATP/ADP ratio is a critical determinant for the supercoiling state in cells probably because of the sensitivity of DNA gyrase to the ATP/ADP ratio (14Hsieh L.S. Burger R.M. Drlica K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Hsieh L.S. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Drlica K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3914-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated also that quinolone-induced DNA cleavage depends strongly on the ATP/ADP ratio, both in cells and using purified gyrase (13Li T.K. Liu L.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1022-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the ATP/ADP ratio may be a common determinant for sensitivity/resistance to both antibiotics and antitumor drugs directed against TOP2. Although ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons used in this work have very disparate structures, their interaction domains with TOP2 have been suggested to overlap (32Elsea S.H. Westergaard M. Burden D.A. Lomenick J.P. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that a multidrug-resistant mutant TOP2α is cross-resistant to all ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons (17Mao Y., Yu, C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This multidrug-resistant mutant TOP2α was shown to exhibit an increased requirement of ATP for catalysis and cleavage. It has been suggested that the R450Q mutation on this mutant TOP2α is responsible for altered ATP utilization and cross-resistance to ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons (17Mao Y., Yu, C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This mutation is located in a Walker consensus motif (17Mao Y., Yu, C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have created another mutation C427A on TOP2α. Like the R450Q mutant TOP2α, C427A mutant TOP2α also exhibits multidrug resistance to all ATP-sensitive poisons. Interestingly, C427A mutant TOP2α retains the same sensitivity to ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons as compared with the wild-type enzyme. C427A mutant TOP2α exhibits reduced ATPase activity and an increased requirement of ATP for catalysis. Taken together, these results suggest that ATP-sensitive and -insensitive TOP2 poisons interfere with the breakage/reunion reaction of TOP2 by distinct mechanisms and that ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons may interfere specifically with a step in TOP2 catalysis requiring ATP utilization. Results from the ciprofloxacin competition experiment have suggested that the ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons do not share the same interaction domain on TOP2 with ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons. This result suggests that ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons may target TOP2 with a distinct conformation compared with ATP-insensitive poisons. Based on our results, it seems plausible that ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons may specifically target an ATP-bound conformation of TOP2. Our current studies have suggested that AMPPNP-bound TOP2 is capable of entering duplex DNA only from its ends, consistent with the closed circular clamp conformation of ATP-bound TOP2 proposed previously on the basis of studies of yeast TOP2 (19Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Our results also indicate that upon entry, AMPPNP-bound TOP2 can slide on unobstructed DNA under physiological conditions. Previous studies on DrosophilaTOP2 and yeast TOP2 have implicated linear diffusion in high salt conditions that presumably weaken protein-DNA interactions to allow mobility of the protein circular clamp (19Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 33Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, however, show that AMPPNP-bound mammalian TOP2 is able to linearly diffuse under physiological conditions. The ability of TOP2 to slide on DNA under physiological conditions may imply a role of limited linear diffusion, dictated by ATP binding and hydrolysis, in its strand-passing reaction. Our limited understanding of the role of ATP in TOP2 catalysis precludes us from any meaningful speculation on the mechanistic and/or functional implications of the sliding action of ATP-bound TOP2. The resistance of TOP2 poisons has been studied in cells under stress conditions (e.g. hypoxia and glucose deprivation) that are associated often with solid tumors (9Colofiore J.R. Ara G. Berry D. Belli J.A. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3934-3940PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kupfer G. Bodley A.L. Liu L.F. NCI Monogr. 1987; 4: 37-40PubMed Google Scholar, 11Utsumi H. Shibuya M.L. Kosaka T. Buddenbaum W.E.

Reduced TOP2α levels in stressed cells have been found and suggested to be responsible in part for the observed resistance (38Chatterjee S. Cheng M.F. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4405-4411PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kang Y. Greaves B. Perry R.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 40Shen J.W. Subjeck J.R. Lock R.B. Ross W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3284-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our results raise the possibility that alteration in ATP/ADP ratios, which is known to occur in hypoxic and nutrient-depleted cells (41Kennedy K.A. Anticancer Drug Des. 1987; 2: 181-194PubMed Google Scholar), may contribute to the overall resistance mechanisms through its modulation on TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage. Thus, it seems plausible that ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons may be useful particularly for treating hypoxic tumors that have compromised ATP/ADP ratios. We thank Dr. Kathleen S. Matthews for supplying us with purified Lac repressor."
https://openalex.org/W2079901671,"Enzyme activity measurement showed thatl-ascorbic acid (vitamin C (Vc)) competitively inhibits the hyaluronan degradation by Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase. The complex crystal structure of this enzyme with Vc was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. One Vc molecule was found to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The Vc carboxyl group provides the negative charges that lead the molecule into the highly positively charged cleft of the enzyme. The Vc ring system forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of Trp-292, which is one of the aromatic patch residues of this enzyme responsible for the selection of the cleavage sites on the substrate chain. The binding of Vc inhibits the substrate binding at hyaluronan 1, 2, and 3 (HA1, HA2, and HA3) catalytic positions. The high concentration of Vc in human tissues probably provides a low level of natural resistance to the pneumococcal invasion. This is the first time that Vc the direct inhibition on the bacterial “spreading factor” was reported, and Vc is also the first chemical that has been shown experimentally to have an inhibitory effect on bacterial hyaluronate lyase. These studies also highlight the possible structural requirement for the design of a stronger inhibitor of bacterial hyaluronate lyase.1f9g Enzyme activity measurement showed thatl-ascorbic acid (vitamin C (Vc)) competitively inhibits the hyaluronan degradation by Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase. The complex crystal structure of this enzyme with Vc was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. One Vc molecule was found to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The Vc carboxyl group provides the negative charges that lead the molecule into the highly positively charged cleft of the enzyme. The Vc ring system forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of Trp-292, which is one of the aromatic patch residues of this enzyme responsible for the selection of the cleavage sites on the substrate chain. The binding of Vc inhibits the substrate binding at hyaluronan 1, 2, and 3 (HA1, HA2, and HA3) catalytic positions. The high concentration of Vc in human tissues probably provides a low level of natural resistance to the pneumococcal invasion. This is the first time that Vc the direct inhibition on the bacterial “spreading factor” was reported, and Vc is also the first chemical that has been shown experimentally to have an inhibitory effect on bacterial hyaluronate lyase. These studies also highlight the possible structural requirement for the design of a stronger inhibitor of bacterial hyaluronate lyase.1f9g l-ascorbic acid known as vitamin C hyaluronan S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase l-Ascorbic acid, also known as vitamin C (Vc),1 is synthesized in plants and in almost all animals except primates, guinea pig, Indian fruit bat, and some insects. Vc is necessary in the diet of these animals and usually exists in significantly large concentrations in their tissues (1Khurana S. Powers D.B. Anderson S. Blaber M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6768-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Prolonged lack of Vc in the diet of humans results in scurvy, which is characterized by skin lesions, blood vessel fragility, and poor wound healing. Less severe deficiency of Vc produces alterations in connective tissue structure and may also cause decreased resistance to some infections (2Levine K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Vc is a multifunctional molecule in tissues. It usually acts as an antioxidant (3Hwang J. Peterson H. Hodis H.N. Choi B. Sevanian A. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 150: 275-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), free radical scavenger (4Kalka K. Mukhtar H. Turowski-Warke A. Merk H. Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol. 2000; 13: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), neuroprotectant, and neuromodulator (5Rice M.E. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). It also plays an important physiological function in activating peptide hormones (2Levine K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and regulating cell division and growth (6Smirnoff N. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 229-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vc is the single synthetic chemical that is manufactured and consumed in the greatest quantity in the world (1Khurana S. Powers D.B. Anderson S. Blaber M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6768-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the importance of Vc in the normal function of animal tissues has long been known, the detailed molecular basis of Vc action, especially the mechanisms of its interactions with proteins and enzymes, is still largely unknown. Protein-ligand interaction is an important aspect of modern biochemistry. It provides information for the understanding of the essence of the molecular interactions, enzyme action mechanism, protein activity control, and drug design. In regards to the important function of Vc in so many life processes, the protein-Vc interfaces have not been fully characterized to date. The structural basis of the protein-Vc interface and the possible influence of Vc on enzyme activities are certainly issues of significant interest for the understanding of the functions and principles of Vc action. The protein-Vc interaction was first seen in the crystal structure ofd-xylose isomerase (Protein Data Bank accession number1xid) in which Vc was present between two tryptophan residues (7Carrell H.L. Glusker J.P. Burger V. Manfre F. Tritsch D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 86: 4440-4444Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It clearly emphasizes the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the protein-Vc interface. Here we present the crystal structure ofStreptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL) co-crystallized with Vc, which provides another opportunity to examine the protein-Vc interactions at the atomic level. S. pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, sinusitis, and otitis media in humans worldwide, especially in neonates and children, and often leads to significant rates of mortality and morbidity. It secretes hyaluronate lyase to catalyze the degradation of hyaluronan (HA), one of the main components of connective tissues in animals, to expose tissue cells to bacterial toxins. Therefore, SpnHL is also being called the “spreading factor” (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar, 9Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The inhibition of hyaluronate lyase is expected to reduce the spreading of this pathogen in the most early stages of pneumococcal invasion. The action mechanism of hyaluronan degradation by SpnHL, which was revealed recently, provides a unique opportunity to target hyaluronate lyase in the prevention of the pneumococcal invasion. The Vc-complexed crystal structure of SpnHL is an attempt on this line of research. The enzymatic activity of SpnHL in the presence of various concentrations of Vc was measured. The crystal structure of this enzyme co-crystallized with Vc was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. The structural basis of the inhibitory effect of Vc on SpnHL enzymatic activity was established. l-Ascorbic acid (Sigma) was co-crystallized with the S. pneumoniaehyaluronate lyase at conditions similar to the native SpnHL crystallization condition with an additional 10–100 mmascorbic acid. A set of data at 2.0 Å resolution was collected at 100 K using one crystal at 50 mm ascorbic acid, synchrotron radiation, and a cryocooling technique at conditions similar to the native crystal (10Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL program package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121with cell parameters of a = 84.264 Å,b = 102.666 Å, and c = 103.253 Å. The data set is 90.1% complete (60% in the last shell) with Rsym = 0.087. Coordinates and B-factors of the protein part of the native SpnHL crystal structure (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar) were used directly as a primary model in the SpnHL·Vc complex structure refinement. All waters and solution molecules were omitted from the model. The X-plor package (13Brunger A.T. Rice L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277B: 243-269Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used to refine the structure against 54,217 reflections at a 2.0–45 Å resolution range (87.8% completeness), and 1% reflections were used inRfree calculation to monitor the refinement progress and the model improvement (14Brunger A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 272B: 366-396Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Rigid body, position, and simulated annealing (3000 K) protocols were employed. The model was manually fitted into the electron density maps on graphics using program O (15Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Foundations Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) in between each round of refinement calculations. The electron densities for Vc were observed from the beginning, but the Vc structure was only included into the structural refinement until theR factor dropped below 25%, and water molecules were incorporated thereafter. Only after this point, the B-factor refinement was introduced. The SpnHL enzymatic activity was measured using a modification of previously described protocols using either cetylpyridinium chloride (16Li M.W. Yudin A.I. VandeVoot C.A. Sabeur K. Primakoff P. Overstreet J.W. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or cetrimide (17Berry A.M. Lock R.A. Thomas S.M. Rajan D.P. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The compounds assayed for inhibitory effects on the SpnHL enzyme activity were ascorbic acid, epinephrine, apigenin, salicylic acid, and histamine (Sigma). Volumes of 90 μl of inhibitor solutions at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 mm containing 50 mm sodium acetate and 10 mm calcium chloride at pH 6.0 (apigenin was dissolved in 10% Me2SO water solution) were added along one row of a 96-well microtiter plate, leaving the first row as a blank control. 10 μl of the wild-type SpnHL at a concentration of 3.3 μg/ml was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Reactions using 40 units of bovine hyaluronidase (Sigma) at the same conditions were run in parallel. 25 μl of 1 mg/ml HA were added to each well to start the reaction, which was performed at room temperature for 15 min. Undigested HA was precipitated using freshly made 50 μl of 10% (w/v) aqueous cetylpyridinium chloride with an additional 2.0% NaOH to stop the enzyme activity. The absorbance was measured at 630 nm for cetylpyridinium chloride using an automated microplate reader (EL808, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). A higher absorbance reading corresponds to a higher remaining substrate HA concentration and, therefore, lowers enzyme activity. TheA595 absorbance readings were then converted to percent inhibition by subtracting theA595 value for the pure enzyme without inhibitor from the reading with inhibitor divided by the difference between the 100% inhibition (average values at 12.8, 14.4, and 16.0 mmascorbic acid) and 0% inhibition (A595 reading for the pure enzyme). To determine whether this inhibition was reversible, a sample of SpnHL enzyme activity was measured and designated as 100% activity. After dialyzing the sample against 20 mm Vc in buffer, the enzyme activity dropped to 0%. The sample was then dialyzed against the reaction buffer to remove the Vc, and 94% of the enzyme activity was recovered. Therefore, this inhibition was reversible. The slight drop in activity was caused by the volume changes during dialysis. The reaction initial velocity was measured in quadruplicate using a modified microplate assay (16Li M.W. Yudin A.I. VandeVoot C.A. Sabeur K. Primakoff P. Overstreet J.W. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Initial hyaluronan concentrations were 0.2, 0.1, 0.07, 0.05, and 0.04 mg/ml in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0, 10 mm calcium chloride, and 8% agarose at 55 °C. 100 μl of each of the five concentrations of the hyaluronan-agarose gel were added to the microplate columns in quadruplicate and left at room temperature for an hour to set. Solutions of SpnHL (0.33 μg/ml) with 0, 1, 5, and 10 mmVc in 10 mm calcium chloride and 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0, were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and 100 μl of each of the enzyme preparations were added to the first four lines of each column of the microplate. Reaction buffer was added to the remaining four lines of the microplate as control. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. The enzyme samples were removed, and each well was washed three times with the buffer. Each well was then filled with 100 μl of 2% aqueous cetrimide (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an automated microplate reader (EL808). Structural factors and coordinates of SpnHL·Vc complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 1f9g. The crystal structure of S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase in complex with Vc (SpnHL·Vc complex) was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. In total, 725 of 731 residues were modeled, and 303 waters were incorporated. One Vc molecule was clearly seen in the electron density map (Fig.1). The final crystallographicR factor was 0.208, and Rfree = 0.253. The protein part of the complex structure contained an N-terminal α-domain and a C-terminal β-domain connected by a 10-residue linker. The active site of this enzyme lies in the middle of the molecule in which a predominant cleft was formed between these two structural domains (Fig. 2). The cleft was about 30 × 10 Å in dimension, enough to accommodate three disaccharide units of the hyaluronan substrate chain simultaneously, which were named HA1, HA2, and HA3, respectively, from the reducing end to the nonreducing end of the hyaluronan chain. 2S. Li and M. J. Jedrzejas, submitted for publication. The active site is located at one end of the cleft, corresponding to the reducing end of the bound hyaluronan chain, and is composed of two parts, an aromatic patch responsible for the cleavage site selection on the substrate chain and a catalytic group responsible for the cleavage of the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage between HA1 and HA2 disaccharide units in the hyaluronan chain (8Li S.

The positions of the N-terminal α-domain and C-terminal β-domain are shown. One Vc molecule is bound to the cleft between two structural domains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The protein part of the SpnHL·Vc complex structure has only slight changes when compared with the native SpnHL crystal structure. The root mean square deviation is only 0.538 Å for all protein atoms. In the cleft region, all corresponding atoms in the protein-Vc complex structure are located at the outer side, leaving the cleft about 0.2 Å wider than it is in the native SpnHL structure (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar). The position of Vc relative to the active site residues is shown in Fig.3 a. The aromatic patch of the enzyme active center is composed of three aromatic residues, Trp-291, Trp-292, and Phe-343 (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar) (Fig.3 a). The side chains of Trp-292 and Phe-343 form hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic patches on the hyaluronan chain. Through this matching, the cleavage sites are selected. Trp-292 hydrophobically interacts with a HA2 disaccharide unit and accurately anchors HA2 into catalytic position. In the hyaluronan proton acceptance and donation degradation model,2 the enzyme catalyzed the degradation of the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage between HA1 and HA2 and produced 4,5-unsaturated HA1. Vc in the SpnHL·Vc complex structure was found to bind to Trp-292 (Fig.3 a) indole group and occupy the HA2 position. The bound Vc forms 25 interactions with 7 residues of the enzyme (Table I). These residues are also shown to interact with the substrate (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar). The relative positions of these residues to the bound Vc are shown in Fig.3 b. 5 of the 7 interface residues, Arg-243, Asn-290, Trp-292, Tyr-408, and Asn-580, have been studied extensively in our previous biochemical and structural studies and have been shown to play important roles in the normal function of this enzyme (8Li S.

Open table in a new tab Hyaluronate lyase was complexed with vitamin C. Trp-292 forms eight interactions with Vc, which accounts for the most interactions among all these seven residues in the protein-Vc interface. The indole group of Trp-292 is in parallel to the five-member ring of Vc (Fig. 3 a). This structural arrangement provides the main hydrophobic interaction that stabilizes the Vc molecule inside the cleft. Trp-292 is one of the aromatic patch residues and is responsible for the selection of the cleavage sites on the substrate chain. Therefore, the binding of Vc probably competes with the binding of hyaluronan substrate at the HA2 position, which is located at the middle of the cleft. Tyr-408 is one of the three key catalytic residues in the hyaluronan degradation. It donates one proton to the glycosidic oxygen to break the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage between HA1 and HA2 disaccharide units (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar). In the complex structure, Tyr-408 forms one salt bridge with the Vc O-1 oxygen (refer to Fig. 4 for Vc atom labeling). Therefore, both the aromatic patch and the catalytic group of the active center of SpnHL are involved in the binding of Vc. The binding of Vc blocks both the aromatic patch and the catalytic group. Residues Asn-290 and Asn-580 form the narrowest part across the cleft. Asn-580 is the only residue from the β-domain that is involved in the SpnHL-substrate and the SpnHL·Vc interface. The mutation N580G causes a small increase (about 15%) in the enzyme activity because the wider cleft opening allows for easier substrate entry (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar).3 SpnHL·Vc complex structure showed that Vc is also in contact with Asn-580 and Asn-290. The cleft is highly charged positively by the accumulation of lysine and arginine residues inside the cleft. There are nine conserved arginine residues present in the cleft. Three of them are involved in the interaction with Vc. Arg-462 and Arg-466 are involved extensively in Vc binding (Table I). Arg-243 forms one salt bridge with the Vc carboxyl group. When the substrate is bound into the cleft, Arg-243 interacts with HA2 and HA3 disaccharide units and with the oxygen atom of the second glycosidic linkage, which is suspected to be the next glycosidic linkage to be degraded. The mutation R243V surprisingly decreases the enzyme activity by 33% (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we proposed that Arg-243 plays an important role in the substrate translocation after the initial glycosidic bond is degraded (9Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).2 The glycosidic linkage in contact with Arg-243 is the next linkage to be degraded. The interaction with Arg-243 suggests that the Vc binding also inhibits substrate binding at HA3 position. It was recently reported that one arginine residue is believed to be involved in two Vc binding sites in the Vc-peroxidase complex structure (22Bursey E.H. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7374-7379Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of one or more arginine residues is probably one of the characteristic features in the protein-Vc interface. The 25 interactions in the SpnHL·Vc interface (Table I) can be classified into two groups, hydrophobic and ionic interactions. Trp-292 contributes mostly to the hydrophobic interactions with Vc. Three arginine residues, Arg-243, Arg-462, and Arg-466, form several salt bridges, whereas Tyr-408, Asn-290, and Asn-580 form hydrogen bonds with the ligand. In comparison with the protein-Vc interface observed in thed-xylose isomerase in which hydrophobic interactions play the dominant role, hydrophobic and ionic interactions are almost equally important in the SpnHL·Vc interface. Therefore, the SpnHL·Vc interface represents a novel type of protein-Vc interface. The protein-Vc interactions cause minor structural changes at both parts of the interface. In comparison with the native SpnHL structure, the side chain displacement of these interface residues is very small. On the contrary, Vc itself has relatively significant structural changes compared with its native crystal structure (23Hvoslef J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1968; 24: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) used for modeling and refinement. The carboxyl group is forced to bend toward the plane of the Vc ring (Fig. 4). The negative charges caused by the carboxyl group at physiological condition are apparently important in leading the Vc molecule into the highly positively charged cleft. The actual binding geometry shows that the five-member ring of the Vc molecule provides the most hydrophobic binding interface, whereas the carboxyl group interferes with the Trp-292 indole group, which is not in favor of the Vc binding. Vitamin C, salicylate, and flavonoids have been reported to have certain inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity of hyaluronidases (18Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which are a group of hydrolases employed by mammals for the hyaluronan degradation. Bacteria usually produce hyaluronate lyases to degrade hyaluronan. The search for the inhibitors of bacterial hyaluronate lyases was started from these chemicals. Our activity measurements clearly showed that Vc inhibited the hyaluronan degradation by SpnHL. Vc is structurally similar to one of the sugar units of hyaluronan, the main substrate of SpnHL. Hyaluronan is composed of linear repeats of the disaccharide unit β-1,4-glucuronic-β-1,3-glucosamine. One of the main components of hyaluronan, glucuronic acid, is also the precursor in the Vc biosynthesis. Therefore, Vc can be regarded as a substrate analogue of hyaluronate lyase. The effects of these compounds on the enzyme activity of SpnHL and bovine hyaluronidase were investigated and measured by the microplate enzyme activity essay. The results showed that none of these compounds had any significant influence on the activity of bovine hyaluronidase at our experimental condition (data not shown). However, Vc inhibited the SpnHL activity (Fig. 5). At our experimental condition, the IC50 of this inhibition was approximately 5.8 mm. The initial velocity of the degradation at various concentrations of hyaluronan was measured in the presence of three concentrations of Vc and in its absence. The results were fitted to both the competitive model and the noncompetitive model by nonlinear regression. The fitting attempts with the noncompetitive model repeatedly resulted in an unreasonably high value (Ki > 50,000 mm) for the Kiparameter, which is not present in the competitive model. Because this parameter indicates that the concentration of Vc is required for the binding to the enzyme-substrate complex, it is apparent from this analysis that Vc binds only to the free enzyme (Ki = 53 mm), not to the enzyme-substrate complex in the experiments described in this work. Therefore, the substrate competes successfully for the binding of Vc, and this inhibition is competitive. The degradation of hyaluronan in the host connective tissues is an important step in the pneumococcal invasion. The bacterial strains that produce more hyaluronate lyase were shown to be more virulent than those strains producing less hyaluronate lyase (24Rollend K. Marois C. Siquier V. Cattier B. Quentin R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 1892-1898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae strains with hyaluronate lyase and cell toxin pneumolysin double mutations showed significant additive attenuation in virulence (25Berry A.M. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of hyaluronate lyase activity is probably important in the control of the pneumococcal invasion. And because animals usually use hydrolases to degrade hyaluronan, pneumococcal hyaluronate lyase becomes a potential target for developing a novel antibacterial agent. Vc is the first chemical shown to have inhibition effect on the activity of this pneumococcal enzyme. The human adult minimum daily requirement for Vc is ∼10 mg. Vc exists in human tissues at a level of 0.2 to >10 mmconcentrations and has an unusually varied distribution compared with other vitamins (26Bergsten P. Amitai G. Kehrl J. Dhariwal K. Klein H.G. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2584-2587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brubaker R.F. Bourne W.M. Bachman L.A. Mclaren J.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1681-1683PubMed Google Scholar). Large concentrations of Vc were detected in the adrenal gland and the aqueous humor of the eye. Human corneal epithelium normally contains approximately 1.33 mg of Vc/g of wet weight tissue (27Brubaker R.F. Bourne W.M. Bachman L.A. Mclaren J.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1681-1683PubMed Google Scholar), which corresponds to approximately 7.5 mm Vc. In the activated human neutrophils, internal Vc concentrations as high as 14 mm were detected when external vitamin was kept at physiological concentrations (28Washko P. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of Vc on the SpnHL enzymatic activity may have a physiological meaning. It has long been known that the deficiency of Vc may cause decreased resistance to some bacterial infections. One explanation to this belief is that animal cells, such as neutrophils, generate oxidants to kill bacteria using Vc to quench and control the extra oxidants released (28Washko P. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of Vc on SpnHL activity provides an additional possible explanation to the Vc function as an antibacterial agent. The large concentration of Vc in human tissues makes the tissue environment more unfavorable to the pneumococcal invasion, thereby providing a low level of natural resistance to such bacterial invasion. The infections and diseases caused by pneumococci are thus significantly reduced. Therefore, Vc is probably a natural constituent of the biochemical defense system against the pneumococcal invasion in the host tissues. Pneumococcal invasions usually occur in tissues with relatively low concentrations of Vc. The normal Vc concentration in plasma is around 0.1–0.2 mm and about 10 times higher in the lungs, brain, kidneys, lymph glands, and small intestinal mucosa (19Lester P. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar), which is about 10 times less than the highest Vc concentrations detected in human tissues. The SpnHL·Vc complex structure also provides some clues for the design of a more efficient hyaluronate lyase inhibitor. Based on the interface characteristics, it can be expected that a stronger hyaluronate lyase inhibitor should have a larger ring system to benefit the hydrophobic binding to the Trp-292 indole group. At least one negative charge provider, a carboxyl group, for example, is required in the inhibitor structure to provide the negative charges to lead the inhibitor into the cleft region. In summary, a stronger inhibitor can be expected to have an increased area of hydrophobic interactions and to have more properly placed negatively charged substituents such as carboxyl groups. The molecular properties of Vc are closely related to its structural characteristics. The widely studied free radical scavenger and antioxidant properties of Vc are directly related to the active redox chemical characteristics of this molecule. Our studies emphasized the significance of these structural similarities of Vc, a sugar derivative, to polysaccharides. This structural similarity confers on Vc the capacity of protecting hyaluronan, the main component of connective tissues, from being degraded by bacterial hyaluronate lyases. Any destructive factors of polysaccharides, oxidants or hyaluronate lyases, may be buffered by the existence of the large amount of Vc in tissues. The Vc structural similarities to sugars, its interaction patterns with proteins revealed from the SpnHL·Vc complex structure, and the importance of both hydrophobic and ionic contacts in the protein-Vc interface might lead to the reevaluation of the structure and function relationships of Vc. Vc may compress or retard bacterial invasion by directly inhibiting the bacterial spreading factor, such as hyaluronate lyase, through binding to the enzyme active site and competing with the binding of the hyaluronan substrate. All seven protein interface residues interacting with Vc are strictly conserved among all known bacterial hyaluronate lyases (8Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1128-1140Google Scholar). The studies on the SpnHL·Vc interface are thus significantly relevant to all these bacterial hyaluronate lyases. For example,Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase crystal structure was recently determined (21Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).2 Its active center construction and geometry is nearly the same as it is in SpnHL. Therefore, the results shown may be applicable to Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase, which means that Vc might also provide the host with the ability to resist the S. agalactiae invasion to a certain extent."

Using as bait the C-terminal half of p67phox, which contains both Src homology 3 domains, we have cloned JFC1, a novel human 62-kDa protein. JFC1 possesses two C2 domains in tandem. The C2A domain shows homology with the C2B domain of synaptotagmins. JFC1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in bone marrow and leukocytes. The expression of JFC1 in neutrophils was restricted to the plasma membrane/secretory vesicle fraction. We confirmed JFC1-p67phox association by affinity chromatography. JFC1-containing beads pulled down both p67phoxand p47phox subunits from neutrophil cytosol, but when the recombinant proteins were used, only p67phox bound to JFC1, indicating that JFC1 binds to the cytosolic complex via p67phoxwithout affecting the interaction between p67phox and p47phox. In contrast to synaptotagmins, JFC1 was unable to bind to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate but did bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and to a lesser extent to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate. From the data presented here, it is proposed that JFC1 is acting as an adaptor protein between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase products and the oxidase cytosolic complex.

Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Babior B.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 49-95PubMed Google Scholar). Free radical production is directly related to the bactericidal capacity of the cell, since patients with chronic granulomatous disease, whose NADPH oxidase is inactive (3Babior B.M. Am. J. Hematol. 1991; 37: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Babior B.M. Woodman R.C. Semin. Hematol. 1990; 27: 247-259PubMed Google Scholar), suffer recurrent bacterial infections. In resting cells, the components of the oxidase are distributed between different subcellular compartments and thus remain unassembled while the oxidase is inactive. The main membrane component is cytochromeb 558, an integral membrane protein containing one subunit of gp91phox and one of p22phox that is located in the secretory vesicles and specific granules (5Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the p47phox and p67phox, components that are known to be essential for the oxidase activation in vivo, remain in the cytosol in a complex that also includes p40phox (6Park J.W. Ma M.

Two other factors, the small GTPases Rac2 (8Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Rap1a (9Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Walker L. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J.

The exact mechanism of the activation process, however, remains obscure. In the presence of adequate stimuli, the cytosolic factor p47phox is phosphorylated and translocated, together with p67phox (11El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Park J.W. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19901-19906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to the particulate fraction, where the cytosolic complex interacts with cytochromeb 558. The subunit gp91phox is a flavohemoprotein that contains two hemes necessary to transfer electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen (13Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 14Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The C terminus of p22phox binds to tandem SH31 domains present in p47phox (15de, M. I Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because p47phox binds to p67phox(16Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de, M. I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is considered to be responsible for assembling the oxidasein vivo. On the other hand, recent studies showed that p47phox is not required for the reconstitution of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system when high concentrations of p67phox and Rac are present (18Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30326-30329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, these studies suggest that p67phox is the essential cytosolic factor for enzyme activity (19Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Major structural features of p67phox are an acidic C terminus, two SH3 domains located in the middle (residues 245–295) and C-terminal region (residues 462–512), a Rac binding domain in its amino-terminal fragment, and two proline-rich regions in residues 226–234 and 317–329. Our group has previously reported that p67phox catalyzes pyridine nucleotide dehydrogenation, suggesting an active role of this factor during electron transfer (21Dang P.M. Babior B.M. Smith R.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5746-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that p67phox has a NADPH binding site located in its amino-terminal fragment (22Dang P.M. Johnson J.L. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3069-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, it has been previously reported that the amino-terminal portion of p67phox lacking both SH3 domains was active in a cell-free system (23de Mendez I Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been shown in the same study that complete restoration of NADPH oxidase in p67phox-deficient Epstein-Barr virus-B cells derived from chronic granulomatous disease patients was only achieved with full-length p67phox cDNA expression. Moreover deletions of either SH3 domain dramatically reduced NADPH oxidase activity in this system, findings that correlated with decreased membrane binding (23de Mendez I Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that SH3 domains play an important role in protein-protein interactions regulating cellular localization of interacting factors, and, although the importance of these domains in the p67phox-p47phoxinteraction has been described (16Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de, M. I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17de Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not unlikely that p67phox-SH3 domains interact with other accessory proteins that could take part in the still unclear process of NADPH oxidase assembly or activation. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to search for additional components of the phagocyte antimicrobial machinery. Using as bait the C-terminal half of p67phox, including both SH3 domains, we isolated a protein that interacts with oxidase components. In this communication, we describe the cloning and some of the properties of this protein, which we have designated JFC1. Reagents for the yeast two-hybrid assay, including vectors, yeast strains, the yeast two-hybrid cDNA library, and control vectors, were the generous gifts of Stephen Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The λ-ZAP cDNA leukocyte library was kindly provided by Dr. Ernest Beutler (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), were purchased from Sigma; phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) was obtained from Calbiochem; and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5)P3) were obtained from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) was purchased from Sigma, and [3H]InsP4 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. For the yeast two-hybrid assay “bait” constructs, the C-terminal portion of p67phox, including the two SH3 domains and the intervening sequence (residues 245–512), was amplified from cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ primer (GAATTCGCTCACCGTGTGCTATTT) that contained anEcoRI site (underlined) and a sequence that annealed to nucleotides 730–747 and a 3′ antisense primer (GAATTCCCCTTCAACAAAAACTTTGGGGAA) that also contained anEcoRI site (underlined) and a sequence that annealed to nucleotides 1516–1536. The resulting fragment was then ligated into pAS1 so as to be in frame with the upstream GAL4 coding sequences. This construct was sequenced to verify that it was in frame as planned and that no mutations had been introduced during polymerase chain reaction. The construct was used to screen a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library derived from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblasts cloned in the vector pACTII, whose inserts are expressed as fusion proteins consisting of the activation domain of GAL4 attached to the polypeptide encoded in the insert. The constructs were transfected by the method of Gietz et al. (24Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190, and the screening was performed following procedures and using negative controls that have been described previously (25Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 26Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5234) Google Scholar). From 4.2 million transformants, 46 positive colonies were detected. Twenty-four of these were selected for sequencing. Of these 24 clones, four corresponded to a single protein that showed a strong homology to C2 domains in synaptotagmins (27Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and rabphilin 3 (28Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), two proteins that are involved in lipid binding, secretion, and protein-protein interactions. One of these clones was chosen for further study. To obtain a full-length clone, a peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library in λ-ZAP was screened by standard filter hybridization methods (29Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using the [α-32P]dCTP-labeledPstI fragment of the yeast two-hybrid clone as a probe. After isolation, the λ-ZAP clone containing the full-length JFC1 insert was circularized to the plasmid pBK-CMV-JFC1 by Cre-lox-mediated recombination using the ExAssist helper phage and the Escherichia coli strain XLOLR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences of both the yeast two-hybrid cDNA fragment in pACTII and the full-length JFC1 cDNA in λ-ZAP were determined in The Scripps Research Institute molecular biology facility, using an automated fluorescent dye terminator sequencer. Overlapping oligonucleotide primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were designed so as to obtain complete sequence information from both strands of the cDNA. Leukocyte RNA was obtained as previously described (29Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and probed as described elsewhere (29Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were probed with the full-length EcoRI fragment of the JFC1 cDNA, and the multiple tissue Northern blots were probed as recommended by the manufacturer. Whole blood was obtained from the anonymous donor program at The Scripps Research Institute General Clinical Research Center. Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)) were isolated by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis, and Ficoll density centrifugation as previously described (30Markert, M., Andrews, P. C., and Babior, B. M. (1984) Methods Enzymol. 358–365.Google Scholar). Fractionation was carried out by a published protocol (31Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, PMNs were resuspended in PIPES buffer (10 mm), pH 7.3 containing 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP (buffer A) supplemented with protease inhibitors (diisopropylfluorophosphate, 0.5 mm (Sigma) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and then disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 400 p.s.i. EGTA was added to a final concentration of 1.25 mm, and nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g. The supernatant from this spin (postnuclear supernatant (PNS)) was either centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min to separate cytosol from particulate matter or fractionated on a two-step discontinuous Percoll gradient (step 1, δ = 1.076 g/ml; step 2, δ = 1.11 g/ml, with tonicity adjusted with buffer A containing 1.25 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors) as previously described (31Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All particulate fractions were washed with buffer A containing 1.25 mm EGTA to remove Percoll. PMNs prepared as described above were washed once in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then resuspended in PBS containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 1.5 mmMgCl2 and warmed to 37 °C for 10 min. PMA (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed once in ice-cold PBS and subjected to the cavitation/fractionation protocol. Recombinant JFC1 was expressed inE. coli as the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Sepharose beads (100 μl) containing 10 μg of the recombinant fusion protein or GST alone were washed twice in RIPA buffer (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.025% NaN3) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 1.8 × 107 or 9 × 107 cell equivalent of neutrophil-derived cytosol or buffer. Beads were washed five times during 10 min with buffer RIPA at 4 °C, spun down, and boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer (31Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with primary antibodies directed against p47phox or p67phox. Detection was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The bound alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium colorimetric reagent (Bio-Rad). Wild type JFC1 cDNA and p67phox cDNA were cloned into pBK-CMV under the control of the T7 promoter. In vitro translated proteins labeled with [35S]methionine were produced using the TNT coupled transcription and translation system from Promega(Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. Translational grade [35S]methionine was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. In order to normalize the amount of radioactive protein added to the experiments, serial dilutions of each in vitrotranslation reaction were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and the specific protein bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The binding of [35S]JFC1 to GST-p47phox or GST-p67phox was evaluated as described above under “In Vitro Binding Studies” except that 5 μg of GST-p47phox, GST-p67phox, or GST were used in the assays. The reactions were performed either in RIPA buffer or in a buffer that contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Serial dilutions of thein vitro translation reactions containing [35S]JFC1, [35S]p67phox as a positive control, or [35S]luciferase as a negative control were used in the assay with a 200-μl final volume. Samples were rotated at 4 °C during 1 h, washed four times for 15 min with the reaction buffer, spun down, and boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the specific protein bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The binding of in vitro translated [35S]JFC1 to several phospholipids and phosphoinositides was evaluated by a dot blot assay as previously described (32Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Phospholipids at 2 mg/ml in 1:1 chloroform/methanol solution containing 0.1% HCl were spotted (4 μg) onto nitrocellulose sheets. After drying, nitrocellulose was blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline plus 3% bovine serum albumin. In vitrotranslated [35S]JFC1 (0.1–0.5 μCi) in Tris-buffered saline containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin and 300 μml-methionine was then used to probe the phosphoinositide-containing nitrocellulose for 30 min at room temperature. Filters were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline and dried, and bound radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography. Samples were eluted from the nitrocellulose spots containing the radioactive probe and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity was visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Negative controls using in vitro translated [35S]luciferase were performed in parallel. [3H]InsP4binding to JFC1 was evaluated as previously described (33Koppler P. Mersel M. Humbert J.P. Vignon J. Vincendon G. Malviya A.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5481-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the reactions, containing 3 μg of GST-JFC1 and 2 nm [3H]InsP4 (10,000 cpm/assay) were carried out in a medium containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA for 10, 20, or 30 min at 4, 30, or 37 °C. The final volume was 200 μl. Free and bound InsP4 were resolved either by protein precipitation or by filtration through nitrocellulose. In the first case, protein was precipitated (15 min on ice) by adding 300 μg of γ-globulin and 18% (final concentration) polyethylene glycol. The reactions were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. The pellet was solubilized with 500 μl of tissue solubilizer; 35 μl of glacial acetic acid was added, the suspension was transferred to 4.0 ml of liquid scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For filtration assays, samples were vacuum-filtered on 0.45-μm pore size cellulose nitrate membrane filters (Whatman, Maidstone, England). For this purpose, a sampling vacuum manifold (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was used. The filters were immediately washed four times with 2 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA in less than 20 s. Filters were counted using a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000SC). Negative control assays were run in parallel using either bovine serum albumin or GST. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm InsP4. The antibody against p67phox was raised against recombinant p67phox purified from baculovirus and was the generous gift of Robert M. Smith (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The anti-JFC1 antibody was raised by inoculating rabbits with the N-terminal peptide NH2-MAHGPKPETEGLLDLS-COOH conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Chiron Mimotopes, San Diego, CA). The antibody was affinity-purified over a column of Sulfolink-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on which a peptide identical except for the addition of a C-terminal cysteine had been immobilized. The antibody raised against p47phox has been previously described (12Park J.W. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19901-19906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in identifying proteins that might be involved in the modification and regulation of the cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase. For this purpose, we constructed a yeast two-hybrid system “bait” vector containing a fragment of p67phox comprising residues 245–512, spanning both SH3 domains and the intervening sequence, and used it to screen a cDNA library derived from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphoblasts, cells known to contain a fully functional NADPH oxidase. Among the library clones that were found to interact strongly and specifically with the C-terminal half of p67phox was a sequence encoding p47phox, which served as a convenient internal control, and four copies of a sequence that encoded the C-terminal part of a previously undescribed protein. This protein fragment contained a region of homology to the C2 domains of a number of proteins. C2 domains have been found in proteins that function in protein phosphorylation, lipid modification, GTPase regulation, and membrane trafficking (34Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). These domains also serve as lipid-binding domains in various isoforms of protein kinase C (35Edwards A.S. Newton A.C.

Because all of these processes occur in concert with NADPH oxidase activation, we decided to pursue this clone as a potential regulator of oxidase activity. A full-length cDNA was retrieved from a λ-ZAP human peripheral blood leukocyte library by conventional plaque screening. The sequence of this clone is shown in Fig. 1. Translation of the open reading frame disclosed a 562-amino acid protein (starting from the first methionine) that contained a second C2 domain just upstream of the one found in the original yeast library clone (Fig. 1). According to a previously described classification (40Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), both C2 domains present in JFC1 correspond to topology I. Comparison of the C2 domains from JFC1 with other C2 domain-containing proteins by sequence alignment identified that the C2A domain has structural homology with the synaptotagmin-C2B domains and with rabphilin 3-C2B domain (27Ullrich B.

We examined the tissue-specific expression of JFC1 by probing a semiquantitative mRNA dot blot with the radiolabeled full-length cDNA JFC-1 fragment (Fig. 2). As expected, the clone was abundantly expressed in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, which have a high leukocyte content. There was also significant expression of JFC1 in pancreas, trachea, stomach, salivary gland, and prostate. Northern blot analysis of leukocyte mRNA using the library cDNA as a probe identified a single band at ∼1.8 kilobases, consistent with the size of the full-length cDNA (Fig.3).Figure 3Leukocyte mRNA Northern blot.Leukocyte mRNA obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” was probed with the full-length EcoRI fragment of the JFC1 cDNA as described elsewhere (29Sambrook J.

We examined the subcellular localization of JFC1 by immunoblotting (Fig.4). An antibody raised against an N-terminal peptide from JFC1 recognized a specific doublet in whole neutrophils that had been lysed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Fig. 4 A), probably representing either different translation starting points or just phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of JFC1. JFC1 has been successfully phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II. 2S. D. Catz and B. M. Babior, unpublished observation. When neutrophils were lysed by nitrogen cavitation, JFC1 segregated to the PNS. Ultracentrifugation of the PNS yielded soluble (cytosol) and particulate (membranes/organelles) fractions. JFC1 was detected exclusively to the particulate fraction of neutrophils by the method employed. A more detailed fractionation was carried out using a method previously described (31Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PNS was layered onto a two-step discontinuous Percoll gradient and centrifuged, resulting in the separation of azurophil granules (α), the specific granules (β), the plasma membranes and secretory vesicles (γ), and a layer of cytosol.

https://openalex.org/W2151958126,"Nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar protein involved in several steps of ribosome biogenesis. The protein is highly conserved through evolution and possesses four RNA-binding domains (RBD), which are likely to determine its RNA binding specificity. Previous studies have shown that nucleolin interacts with two different RNA targets. The first is a small stem-loop structure, the nucleolin recognition element (NRE), found all along the pre-ribosomal RNA. The second is a short single-stranded RNA sequence, the evolutionary conserved motif (ECM), located five nucleotides downstream of the first processing site in the pre-ribosomal RNA 5′ external transcribed spacer. Biochemical, genetic, and structural studies have shown that the first two RBD of nucleolin are necessary and sufficient for the specific interaction of nucleolin with the NRE motif. In this work, we have studied the interaction of nucleolin with the ECM sequence. Deletion and mutational analyses showed that all four RBDs of hamster nucleolin were required for the interaction with the ECM sequence. This RNA binding specificity is conserved between hamster and Xenopus laevis, whereas the Xenopus protein does not interact with the NRE. Nucleolin is the first example of a protein that requires four RBDs for its interaction with an RNA target, demonstrating that a single protein can use different combinations of RBD to interact specifically with several RNA sequences.

Nucleolin is the first example of a protein that requires four RBDs for its interaction with an RNA target, demonstrating that a single protein can use different combinations of RBD to interact specifically with several RNA sequences. Specific RNA-protein interactions play an important role in gene expression. One of the most common protein sequence motifs involved in these interactions is the RNA-binding domain (RBD),1 also called the RNA recognition motif (RRM) (1Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R.

A single or multiple RBD, often in combination with other domains involved in protein-protein interaction, are found in proteins that have diverse functions such as in pre-mRNA maturation and splicing (3Sachs A.B.

The RBD domain is characterized by two highly conserved motifs called RNP-1 and RNP-2 found within a weakly conserved 80-amino acid sequence (1Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R.

The crystal and solution structures of several RBDs have revealed a common structural organization composed of four antiparallel β-strands packed against two α-helices (Refs. 8Allain F.H. Gubser C.C.

The RNP-1 octapeptide and RNP-2 hexapeptide are located in the β1 and β3 strands, respectively. Structures of RBD found in tandem show that the two independently folded domains do not interact with each other in Sex-lethal (11Crowder S.M. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the highly conserved structure of the RBD, they show a remarkable ability to interact with diverse RNA sequences and structures. The tertiary structures of several RBD·RNA complexes are now available. These are the single RBDs from the U1A and U2B′′ protein bound to a stem-loop structure (8Allain F.H. Gubser C.C. Howe P.W.

Feigon J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6870-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These different RNA-protein complexes revealed that the RBD uses the highly conserved RNP1 and RNP2 motifs in addition to the more highly divergent loops and linker regions specific to each RBD for the specific binding with their respective RNA target. The presence of several RBD motifs (up to four domains in poly(A)-binding protein and nucleolin) might suggest that these proteins could interact with several RNA targets or that all RBD are required for the interaction with a single RNA or both. All three RBDs of U2AF65 are required for high affinity binding to the polypyrimidine tract (4Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The first two RBDs of poly(A)-binding protein and nucleolin bind specifically to polyadenylate RNA (21Burd C.G. Matunis E.L.

Studies of the specificity of the interaction of nucleolin with pre-rRNA have revealed that it interacts with two different RNA motifs. The nucleolin recognition element (NRE) motif, identified by SELEX, is a small stem-loop structure (31Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Nucleolin binds tightly to similar stem-loop structures found all along the pre-rRNA (35Serin G. Joseph G. Faucher C. Ghisolfi L. Bouche G. Amalric F. Bouvet P. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The second motif, the evolutionary conserved motif (ECM), was identified during studies on the function of nucleolin in the first processing step of ribosomal RNA (33Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ECM is a short evolutionary conserved 11-nt sequence found 5 nt downstream of the cleavage site (36Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The interaction of nucleolin with this sequence is absolutely required for the assembly of the processing complex and maturation of pre-rRNA at this site (33Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol.

Although the first two RBD of nucleolin are required for the specific interaction with the NRE motif (24Bouvet P. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Amalric F. Erard M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine which domains are involved in the binding of the ECM. In this work we show that all four RBD of nucleolin are required for interaction with the ECM. This interaction is conserved between hamster and Xenopus nucleolin. This is the first example of a protein that utilizes two different combinations of RBD to interact with two different RNA targets. Mouse rDNA fragment from nt 645–1250 was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ETS-645 (5′-ggaagatctgcgcgtcgtttgctcactc-3′) and 5′-ETS-1250 (5′-ggaattcaaactttccaaccccagccgcg-3′). The EcoRI and BglII sites used for the cloning in pSP72 (Promega) to give pSPETS645–1250 are underlined. The BglII site present in the resulting plasmid was removed. The final plasmid was called pSPETS645–1250Δ BglII, and was linearized by enzyme BspEI (+677) for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase to give RNA645/677. The NRE cloned between the XbaI andHindIII sites of pSP64PA plasmid (Promega) encode a 68-nucleotide-long RNA. Labeled RNA was synthesized using [α-32 P]CTP in the transcription reaction. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration (G50, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then the RNA was ethanol precipitated. The different nucleolin mutants were produced as described previously (25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nucleolin mutants were generated by PCR using VentTM DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and hamster nucleolin cDNA as template. PCR products contained an NdeI and a BamHI site at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, for subcloning in the corresponding sites of pET15b plasmid (Novagen). The following oligonucleotides were used: R1N (5′-ccccatatgaatctgttcattggaaac-3′) and R2C (5′-cccggatccggtaccagtatagtaaagtgaaac-3′) for R12; R1N and R3C (5′-cccggatccggtaccttgtaactccaacctgat-3′) for R123; R2N (5′-ccccatatgacacttttagcaaaaaat-3′) and R4C (5′-cccggatccggtaccggcccagtccaaagtaac-3′) for R234; R1N and R4C for R1234; and X.NdeM (5′-ggaattccatatgcctgcaaaacgcaaaaaa-3′) and XR4C (5′-cccggatcctcattgggaatctcctttagg-3′). All proteins were quantified using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and checked on SDS-PAGE. Each RNA-binding domain is defined here from the first amino acid of the β1 sheet to the last amino acid of the β4 sheet. For Chinese hamster nucleolin, these amino acid residues are: Asn308–Pro381 for RBD1, Thr394–Gly465 for RBD2, Thr486–Gly558 for RBD3, Pro563–Pro646 for RBD4. The introduction of the RNP-1 mutations was achieved by PCR site-directed mutagenesis with the following oligonucleotides: R1(L/F, L/F)S and R1(L/F, L/F)NS for R1(LL)234; R2 (L/I, L/F)S and R2(L/I, L/F)NS for R12(LL)34; R3(LL)S and R3(LL) NS for R123(LL)4 NS; R4(LL)S and R4(LL)NS for R1234(LL); R1(LL)S and R1(LL)NS forX.l.R1(LL)234; X.l.R2 (LL)S andX.l.R2(LL)NS for X.l.R12(LL)34; R3(L L)S and R3(LL) NS for X.l.R123(LL)4 NS; R4(LL)S and R4(LL)NS forX.l.R1234(LL): (R1(L/F, L/F)S, 5′-ggaaatt(a/t)ggttt(a/t)gtggactttgagtc-3′; R1(L/F, L/F)NS, 5′-ccac(t/a)aaacc(t/a)aatttcctatttgtacc-3′; R2(L/I, L/F)S, 5′-aaaggg(c/a)ttgcttt(t/a)attgaatttaagtc-3′; R2(L/I, L/F)NS, 5′-aat(t/a)aaagcaa(g/t)ccctttactcttccc-3′; R3(LL)S, 5′-gggttagcgttaatagaatttgctt-3′; R3(LL)NS, 5′-tattaacgctaaccctttagatttgcc-3′; R4(LL)S, 5′-gggttaggtttagtagacttcaacagtg-3′; R4(LL)NS, 5′-tactaaacctaaccctttagaggaacc-3′; X.l.R2 (LL)S, 5′-aaagggctggcactggttgagtttagcactgaag-3′; X.l.R2 (LL)NS, 5′-ctcaaccagtgccagccctttatttgatccatcat-3′). All recombinant plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations. BL21(DE3)plysS was transformed with each recombinant pET15b plasmid. Cells grown at 37 °C in LB (100 mg/liter ampicillin, 20 mg/liter chloramphenicol) were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (30 min at 10,000 × g), the supernatant was recovered and gently mixed for 1 h at 4 °C after the addition of 1 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen)/ml of initial culture. After three washes with buffer A and two with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), tagged peptide was eluted with buffer C (buffer B + 0.5m imidazole). The supernatant was applied on a G25 column (NAP 5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 100 mm KCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Concentrations were estimated with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad protein assay) and checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel retardation assay were performed by incubating 10 fmol of labeled RNA in TMKC buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 200 mmKCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 4 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with the indicated amount of protein for 30 min at room temperature. Then they were directly loaded on 8% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylmamide = 60:1) containing 5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE at room temperature. The gel was dried and submitted to an autoradiography. Quantification of RNA retardation was performed with a phosphorimager (Fuji X-BAS 1000). For the UV cross-linking assay, 500 fmol of labeled RNA were incubated with the indicated amount of protein at room temperature for 30 min in 10 μl of TMKC buffer. Samples were subjected to UV light for 5 min as follows: 10-μl drops were spotted on a thin layer of parafilm on ice and subjected to UV (λ = 254 nm) (Spectrolinker XL1000, Spectronics Corp.). Then 0.5 μg of RNase A (Sigma) was added to each sample and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Filter binding assays using purified nucleolin protein and invitro labeled RNA were performed as described previously (25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 fmol of labeled RNA were incubated with different concentrations of purified nucleolin or recombinant proteins in 50 μl of binding buffer (200 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 75 μg/ml poly(A), 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the reaction mixtures were filtered on a nitrocellulose membrane and washed three times with binding buffer. The percentage of bound RNA was determined using a phosphorimager. We have previously shown that nucleolin interacts with two different RNA targets, the NRE and the ECM motifs (31Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol.

The NRE motif is a short stem-loop structure found along the ribosomal RNA, whereas the ECM is an 11-nt motif located 5 nt downstream of the first processing site (34Ginisty H. Serin G.

The first two RNA-binding domains (R12) of nucleolin are required for the interaction with the NRE sequence (24Bouvet P. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Amalric F. Erard M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether the same RNA-binding domains were involved in the specific recognition of the ECM motif, we compared the interaction of the NRE and the ECM sequences with several recombinant proteins, which contain different numbers of nucleolin RBD (Fig. 1 A). RNAs that contain the NRE or the ECM motif were in vitrotranscribed in the presence of [α-32P]CTP. The NRE RNA is 68 nt long and contains the stem-loop structure selected by SELEX (31Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). RNA645/677 contains sequences 645–677 from mouse ribosomal RNA that include the conserved ECM motif. We have previously shown that interaction of nucleolin with this RNA requires the ECM sequence (34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These labeled RNAs were used in a UV cross-linking experiment in the presence of increasing amounts of R12 and R1234 proteins (Fig. 1 B). After UV cross-linking and RNase digestion, proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. As previously described (24Bouvet P. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Amalric F. Erard M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the NRE RNA interacts with R12 and R1234 with the same efficiency (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–8). In contrast, no cross-linking was observed between RNA645/677 and R12 (lanes 9–11), whereas the R1234 protein interacts with this RNA (lanes 12–14). This experiment suggests that different combinations of RBDs are used for the specific interaction with the NRE and the ECM motifs. To determine which RBDs are involved in the interaction with RNA645/677, several recombinant proteins (see Fig.1 A) were produced in Eschrichia coli, purified, and used in the UV cross-linking assay (Fig. 1 B). Deletions of the first (R234, lanes 18–20) or the fourth (R123, lanes 15–17) RBD drastically reduced the cross-linking level compared with R1234 (lanes 12–14). To further confirm this experiment, we compared the interaction of full-length nucleolin with several recombinant proteins using a filter binding assay (Fig.1 C). Proteins and labeled RNAs were incubated at room temperature and filtered through a nitrocellulose filter. Only the RNA bound to the protein was retained on the filter, and the percentage of bound RNA could be determined using a phosphorimager. Nucleolin and the R1234 protein interact with the same affinity with RNA645/677 (Kd of about 75 nm). Deletions of the last RBD (R123), the last two RBDs (R12), or the first two RBDs (R34) drastically reduced the interaction with this RNA. These experiments show that all RBD domains of nucleolin are required for the interaction with RNA645/677. To further characterize the interaction of the four RBDs with this RNA target, point mutations were performed within each RBD. A characteristic feature of the RBD is the octamer RNP-1 motif that contains several aromatic residues involved in RNA binding. The presence of these aromatic residues is absolutely required for the binding activity of most RBDs (25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Merrill B.M. Stone K.L. Cobianchi F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3307-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation of these amino acids to leucine residues in each RBD was performed (Fig.2 A), and each recombinant protein was purified and used in a gel shift assay (Fig.2 B). Quantification of these gel shifts using a phosphorimager is shown in Fig. 2 C. Wild type protein (R1234) interacts with high binding affinity (Kd 50 nm) with RNA645/677. Mutation of the RNP1 motif in RBD1 and -4 (protein R1(LL)234 and R1234(LL), respectively, drastically reduced the interaction with the RNA (Kd> 500 nm). This result is in agreement with data shown in Fig. 1, where deletions of either RBD1 or RBD2 completely abolished the interaction. Remarkably, mutations in RBD2 (R12(LL)34) or RBD3 (R123(LL)4) also drastically affect the interaction with the ECM. Altogether, these data demonstrate that all four RBDs are required for the specific interaction of nucleolin with RNA645/677. A SELEX experiment performed with nucleolin (31Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) identified the NRE motif in 50% of the selected sequences. The remaining sequences show a significant homology to the ECM motif and are efficient competitors for the interaction of nucleolin with the ECM motif (34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of nucleolin with the selected sequences that show homology to the ECM also required all four RBDs, one selected sequence (N25–358) was used in a UV cross-linking experiment (Fig.3) with several recombinant proteins and was compared with the cross-linking results obtained with RNA645/677. Deletion of the first (Fig.3 B, R234, lanes 11and 12) or the last (R123, lanes 9 and 10) RBD drastically reduced the interaction with RNA N25–358 compared with wild type R1234 protein (lanes 7 and 8). This experiment shows that the integrity of all four RBDs of nucleolin is required for interaction with the SELEX-selected sequence that presents homology with the ECM motif. It further suggests that the 11 nt found within this motif and partially in the selected sequence are key determinants for the specific interaction of the four RBD of nucleolin. Previous experiments have shown that human, mouse, and hamster nucleolin interacted with the same binding affinity and specificity with the NRE RNA (25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Serin G. Joseph G. Faucher C. Ghisolfi L. Bouche G. Amalric F. Bouvet P. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This interaction requires the joint action of the first two RBD, which are well conserved in all these species. Although nucleolin RBDs are well conserved overall between human, mouse, and X. laevis, some significant differences can be found in RBD1 and -2 between human andXenopus (only 53% identity to the hamster protein) (29Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the full-length or the first two RBD (X.l.R12) from Xenopus interact with the NRE motif, we performed a cross-link experiment with purified protein (data not shown) or recombinant X.l.R12 protein and compared it with the interaction of hamster R12 with the NRE (Fig.4 A). The full-length protein or the first two RBD of nucleolin did not interact with the NRE motif, indicating that key residues involved in the specific binding of the NRE are not conserved in the Xenopus protein. In contrast, nucleolin purified from X. laevis (34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or recombinant protein containing all four RBDs of the Xenopus protein (X.l.R1234) interacted with RNA645/677 (Fig.4 B). This interaction required the ECM sequence, because deletion of the 11-nt motif completely inhibited the interaction withX.l.R1234 (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether this interaction required all four RBDs as for the hamster protein, mutations in the RNP-1 motif of each RBD of the Xenopusprotein were performed. These recombinant proteins were purified and used in the cross-link assay (Fig. 4 C). Mutations within the RNP-1 motif of RBD1 (R1(LL)234, lanes 4–6), RBD2 (R12(LL)34, lanes 7–9) and RBD4 (R1234(LL) lanes 13–15) had a drastic effect on the interaction with RNA645/677. The mutation in RBD3 (R123(LL)4) had a weaker effect (lanes 10–12), however, this is well correlated with the binding affinity of hamster R123(LL)4 protein (see Fig.2 B). The apparent higher interaction ofX.l.R123(LL)4 with the ECM RNA might result from the cross-linking assay compared with gel shift analysis for the hamster protein. In this work we show that all four RBDs of nucleolin are involved in the interaction with the evolutionary conserved RNA sequence (ECM) located 5 nt downstream of the first processing cleavage site. Deletion of the first or last RBD (Fig. 1) or mutation of residues within each RNP-1 motif (Fig. 2) drastically reduced interaction with the ECM. The ECM sequence is conserved between human, mice, and X. laevis(38Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5990-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Michot B. Bachellerie J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nucleolin purified from Xenopus is able to activate the first processing step in vitro (34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the interaction of the Xenopus nucleolin with the ECM also requires all four RBD (Fig. 4). This conserved interaction of nucleolin with the ECM sequence through evolution indicates that nucleolin plays an important role in this first processing step. A SELEX experiment performed with hamster nucleolin (31Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) has characterized several RNA binding sequences. Half of these sequences form a small stem-loop structure (NRE) with a short stem (5 base pairs) and a 7–10-nt loop containing the (U/G)CCCGA motif. Similar motifs are found all along pre-rRNA, and interaction of nucleolin with these sequences is believed to be involved in pre-ribosomal assembly (20Allain F.H. Bouvet P. Dieckmann T. Feigon J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6870-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Serin G. Joseph G. Faucher C. Ghisolfi L. Bouche G. Amalric F. Bouvet P. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nucleolin of hamster, mouse, and human origin bind to the NRE motif with high affinity (25Serin G. Joseph G.

Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Kd 5–20 nm). However, nucleolin from X. laevis does not bind with this RNA structure (Fig. 4). The first two RNA-binding domains of mouse nucleolin are necessary and sufficient for the high binding affinity and specific interaction with the NRE (24Bouvet P. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Amalric F. Erard M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RBD1 and -2 of Xenopusnucleolin are only 53% identical to the hamster sequence, whereas human and mouse are about 85 and 96% identical, respectively, to the hamster protein (29Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that key amino acids involved in the recognition of the NRE are not conserved within RBD1 and -2 of the Xenopus nucleolin. Indeed, structural analysis of the complex between hamster R12 and NRE has indicated that key amino acids residues involved in the interaction with the NRE RNA are not conserved in the Xenopus protein (20Allain F.H. Bouvet P. Dieckmann T. Feigon J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6870-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); this could explain why the Xenopus R12 protein does not interact with the NRE. Whether these RBDs are involved in the interaction with another target remains to be determined. The remaining sequences selected by SELEX showed significant homology with the ECM motif found 5 nt downstream of the first processing site of rRNA (31Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have shown that the specific interaction of nucleolin with the ECM motif is required for cleavage of the RNA 5 nt upstream of this motif in vitro (33Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of nucleolin with this RNA sequence (Kd 100 mm) is lower compared with the interaction with the NRE sequence (Kd of 5–20 nm). Sequence analysis of the RNA sequence around the ECM predicts that this motif is in a single-stranded conformation (36Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Michot B. Bachellerie J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Previous experiments suggest that the interaction of nucleolin with this sequence is required for the formation of the processing complex by recruiting the different factors through interaction with the N- and C-terminal domains of nucleolin (33Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 34Ginisty H. Serin G. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Roger B. Libante V. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18845-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Deletion and mutational analyses of nucleolin RBDs (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) show that all four nucleolin RBDs are involved in the interaction with the ECM sequence. Aromatic residues present in the RNP-1 sequence of the RBD contribute to RNA binding through ring-stacking interactions with the bases (9Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 40Kanaar R. Lee A.L. Rudner D.Z. Wemmer D.E. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4530-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues has been shown to drastically reduce the binding affinity of the RBD (37Merrill B.M. Stone K.L. Cobianchi F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3307-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that mutations of these residues in each RBD of the hamster (Fig. 2) and Xenopus nucleolin (Fig.4) drastically reduced the interaction with RNA645/677. This suggests that all four RBDs are involved in the interaction with the RNA and that this binding is conserved between hamster andXenopus. Cooperation of several RBDs to achieve specific recognition of an RNA target seems to be a common feature of proteins that contains several RBDs. Two RBDs in hnRNPA1, Sxl, ASF/SF2, HuD, HuC, and poly(A) binding protein are involved in binding with an RNA target (21Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell.

Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) Nucleolin is the first example of a RNA-binding protein that requires four RBD for the specific interaction with an RNA sequence. The structural basis for the interaction of RBD with a single-stranded RNA or a stem-loop structure has now been studied for a few RBD·RNA complexes. These structures are from U1A (8Allain F.H.

Bouvet P. Dieckmann T. Feigon J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6870-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These different structures highlight the important role of the β sheet surface and loop regions within or outside the RBD to determine the specificity of the interaction. They also show that a common domain, which is highly conserved in numerous proteins, can adopt numerous conformations for specific recognition of many different RNA structures. Structural studies of the interaction of the four RBDs of nucleolin with the ECM RNA will certainly reveal a new mode of RNA protein interaction. Another unique feature of nucleolin is its ability to use different combinations of RBD to interact with different RNAs. The interaction of nucleolin with the NRE and ECM motifs appears to be exclusive, because RBD1 and 2 are required for both interactions, and we have been unable to detect an interaction of both RNAs with the same nucleolin molecule (data not shown). The interaction of nucleolin with the two different RNA targets present on pre-rRNA suggests that nucleolin might play different roles upon interaction with pre-rRNA. How nucleolin interaction with the NRE and ECM motifs is regulated remains to be determined, which will certainly reveal important aspects of protein dynamics. Recent studies of RNA·protein complexes show that interaction with RNA can induce conformational changes in the protein, which can influence protein function (45Varani L. Gunderson S.I. Mattaj I.W.

The interaction of nucleolin with the different RNA targets might induce a selective conformational change of the protein allowing access of the N- and C-terminal domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. Depending on these interactions, nucleolin will be incorporated in different RNP complexes, which could explain its different functions.

We also estimated that most polyamines exist as a polyamine-RNA complex in cells (14Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that polyamines regulate protein synthesis at several different steps.In Escherichia coli, the synthesis of OppA protein, which is a periplasmic substrate binding protein of the oligopeptide uptake system, is strongly stimulated by the addition of putrescine to a polyamine-requiring mutant MA261 (7Kashiwagi K. Yamaguchi Y. Sakai Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8387-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that stimulation of OppA synthesis occurs at the level of translation and that the position and secondary structure of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD)1 sequence (16Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar) of OppA mRNA are probably important for stimulation by polyamines (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that polyamines cause a structural change of the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG of OppA mRNA, facilitating formation of the initiation complex (18Yoshida M. Meksuriyen D. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22723-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In the present work, we studied the effects of polyamines on the synthesis of various ς subunits of RNA polymerase to determine how polyamines influence the functional specificity of transcription. Seven different types of ς subunit have been identified in E. coli, each recognizing a specific set of promoters (19Ishihama A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Modulation of the promoter selectivity of RNA polymerase by replacement of the ς subunit is an efficient way to alter the global pattern of gene expression (19Ishihama A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We found that synthesis of the ς28subunit is greatly enhanced by polyamines because of an increase in cAMP level, which is due to stimulation of the synthesis of adenylate cyclase at the level of translation initiation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we initially determined whether the synthesis of seven different species of ς subunits was regulated by polyamines because the functional specificity of RNA polymerase is modified by the ς subunit. Among seven ς subunits, the synthesis of ς28 was most influenced by polyamines. We defined the amount of ς28 measured by Western blotting as “synthesis,” because the degree of stimulation by polyamines at the mRNA level was nearly parallel with that at the protein level. Most of our experiments were carried out using a polyamine-requiring mutant, MA261 (20Cunningham-Rundles S. Maas W.K. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 791-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but similar results were obtained with another polyamine-requiring mutant, DR112 (24Linderoth N. Morris D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when E. coli MA261 was grown in medium A supplemented with 20 amino acids instead of 5 amino acids, the rate of cell growth increased and similar results on polyamine effects were obtained (data not shown).Our hypothesis is that polyamines regulate macromolecular synthesis mainly at the translational level since most polyamines exist as a polyamine-RNA complex in cells (14Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we searched for a target protein, related to the polyamine stimulation of ς28 synthesis, whose translation is altered by polyamines. We found that the translation of adenylate cyclase was stimulated by polyamines. It is known that the efficiency of translation initiation depends on the stability of mRNA secondary structure, location, and length of SD sequence and on the nature of the initiation codon (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 57de Smit M.H. van Duin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 58Van Etten W.J. Janssen G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible secondary structure of the initiation region of Cya mRNA was analyzed. We found that both the SD sequence and the initiation codon were exposed on the mRNA, and that the position of the SD sequence was normal, occurring 5 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon. However, the initiation codon was UUG (see Fig. 6). If the UUG codon is replaced by the initiation codon AUG, the cells are nonviable (55Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5656-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The results strongly suggest that the UUG initiation codon of Cya mRNA limitscya gene expression at the translational level. If the AUG initiation codon was used instead of UUG in Cya-%-gal fusion mRNA, protein synthetic activity increased by 4.5-fold, but the polyamine effect was almost abolished. Given that such an increase in adenylate cyclase activity causes cell death (55Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5656-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the level of cAMP in cells must normally be tightly regulated. In constructs containing the normal UUG initiation codon, protein synthesis was enhanced 2.5-fold by polyamines. Thus, polyamines may contribute to maintenance of an optimal cAMP level by facilitating the UUG codon-dependent initiation.The UUG codon is used as the initiation codon for 34 identified genes in E. coli (41Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar). If polyamines stimulate the interaction between the initiation codon UUG and the anticodon fMet-tRNAi, CAU (59Dube S.K. Marcker K.A. Clark B.F.C. Cory S. Nature. 1968; 218: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), protein synthesis from all mRNAs having UUG as the initiation codon would be stimulated by polyamines. However, this was not the case, as shown in Fig. 8. The secondary structure of the initiation region of mRNA is probably important for causing the stimulation of the UUG codon-dependent initiation by polyamines. Analysis of RNA secondary structure suggests that exposure of the SD sequence of the mRNA is a prerequisite for polyamine stimulation of the UUG codon-dependent initiation. The structural change of Cya, cAMP PDE, and SpoT mRNAs by polyamines is under investigation.Three initiation factors (IF1, -2, and -3) are involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. Among the three initiation factors, IF3 functions as a discrimination factor for the non-canonical initiation codons AUU, AUC, AUA, and CUG (60Sacerdot C. Chiaruttini C. Engst K. Graffe M. Milet M. Mathy N. Dondon J. Springer M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, UUG was not discriminated by IF3 (61Sussman J.K. Simons E.L. Simons R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the amount of IF3 was nearly equal inE. coli MA261 cells cultured with or without putrescine (data not shown). Therefore, the possibility that IF3 is involved in the polyamine stimulation of the UUG codon-dependent initiation is probably low.In addition to ς28, synthesis of ς38subunit was also stimulated by polyamines. However, stimulation of ς38 synthesis by polyamines was not influenced by the cAMP-CRP under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Experiments are now in progress to clarify the mechanism of polyamine stimulation of ς38 synthesis.The results obtained thus far show that polyamines stimulate protein synthesis by changing the structure of the SD sequence as in the case of OppA mRNA (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Yoshida M. Meksuriyen D. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22723-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as well as the efficiency of UUG codon-dependent initiation as in the case of Cya mRNA (this paper). In the latter case, exposure of the SD sequence of the mRNA is probably a prerequisite for the stimulation. Models of polyamine modulation of the formation of OppA mRNA (A)- and Cya mRNA (B)-dependent initiation complex are shown in Fig. 9. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) have important physiological roles and are essential for normal cell growth (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar,2Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). Some of their proliferative effects appear to be due to regulation of nucleic acid and protein synthesis. As for protein synthesis, it has been reported that polyamines can stimulate some kinds of protein synthesis in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell-free systems (3Igarashi K. Sugawara K. Izumi I. Nagayama C. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Atkins J.F. Lewis J.B. Anderson C.W. Gesteland R.F. J. Biol.

Among the three initiation factors, IF3 functions as a discrimination factor for the non-canonical initiation codons AUU, AUC, AUA, and CUG (60Sacerdot C. Chiaruttini C. Engst K. Graffe M. Milet M. Mathy N. Dondon J. Springer M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, UUG was not discriminated by IF3 (61Sussman J.K. Simons E.L. Simons R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the amount of IF3 was nearly equal inE. coli MA261 cells cultured with or without putrescine (data not shown). Therefore, the possibility that IF3 is involved in the polyamine stimulation of the UUG codon-dependent initiation is probably low. In addition to ς28, synthesis of ς38subunit was also stimulated by polyamines. However, stimulation of ς38 synthesis by polyamines was not influenced by the cAMP-CRP under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Experiments are now in progress to clarify the mechanism of polyamine stimulation of ς38 synthesis. The results obtained thus far show that polyamines stimulate protein synthesis by changing the structure of the SD sequence as in the case of OppA mRNA (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M.

In the latter case, exposure of the SD sequence of the mRNA is probably a prerequisite for the stimulation.

Long term potentiation (LTP),1 which is thought to underlie mechanisms of learning and memory, has two distinct phases.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, one of the protein degradation systems of the cell, is involved in a variety of cellular processes, for instance, cell cycling (16Pagano M.

Protein ubiquitination involves three classes of enzymes, E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. In these multienzyme pathways, target proteins are conjugated with polymers of ubiquitin, which trigger their rapid degradation by proteasomes (23Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As the expression level of vesl-1SmRNA does not readily parallel that of Vesl-1S protein after L-LTP induction, we investigated the effects of protease inhibitors on the amount of Vesl-1S protein. We found that proteasome inhibitors promoted the expression and ubiquitination of Vesl-1S proteins and identified a proteolytic signal sequence that controlled its ubiquitinations.DISCUSSIONAll Vesl family proteins contain PEST sequences (Fig.1 A), which are thought to act as proteolytic signals (15Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). We have reported here that Vesl-1S, but not Vesl-1L, -2, or -3, is degraded by proteasomes and that the 11-amino acid region in the C terminus of Vesl-1S, which is the unique sequence among Vesl family proteins, is responsible for proteasome-mediated proteolysis. As the stable deletion mutants contained PEST sequences, it seems likely that PEST sequences are not involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation of Vesl-1S protein, although we will need to examine the stability of a deletion mutant lacking only the PEST sequences to verify this hypothesis.The signals for protein degradation by proteasomes are often ubiquitination. In the case of Vesl-1S, we also found that it was heavily ubiquitinated. In contrast, the proteasome-resistant stable mutant of Vesl-1S, VSD-3, was not ubiquitinated. Therefore the ubiquitination signals may most likely reside in the C-terminal 11-amino acid region, and the ubiquitination of Vesl-1S may promote the rapid degradation of the protein by proteasomes. At present, we have not identified the sites of ubiquitination, but at least the C-terminal 11-amino acid region does not seem to contain the only or major ubiquitination site. Thus, this region may function as a signal to stimulate ubiquitination of the other sites of Vesl-1S protein.The level of endogenous Vesl-1S protein in neurons is also regulated, at least partly, by proteasomes. The level of vesl-1SmRNA is increased after L-LTP induction, although the expression ofvesl-1L mRNA is not modulated during L-LTP. After L-LTP induction, the level of vesl-1S mRNA is higher than that of vesl-1L mRNA, although the amount of Vesl-1S protein is lower than that of Vesl-1L protein (9Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Fukazawa Y. Sugiyama H. Inokuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23969-23975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Following L-LTP induction, Vesl-1S proteins accumulated in the portion of the dendrites that had undergone synaptic activation (26Fukazawa Y Saitoh Y Sato M Matsuo R Ozawa F Inokuchi K 29th Annual Meeting,.Society for Neuroscience Abstracts Miami. 1999; (Presentation 183.16): 23-28Google Scholar). The mRNA for Arc, which was isolated as a synaptic plasticity-regulated gene, is localized to the active postsynaptic regions of dendrites (27Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A.

Lyford G.L. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In contrast,vesl-1S mRNA remains in the cell body after L-LTP induction (8Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Hirai K. Inokuchi K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It is likely that newly synthesized Vesl-1S proteins are rapidly degraded by proteasomes following L-LTP induction and that the overall amount of Vesl-1S protein is relatively low. However, when Vesl-1S proteins evade proteasome-mediated degradation by some unknown mechanism, these proteins may accumulate in postsynaptic regions.An unresolved issue is how proteasome-mediated degradation of Vesl-1S proteins is prevented. What is the inhibition signal? The stability of proteins degraded by proteasomes is regulated by phosphorylation in many cases. Recently, we found that phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) promoted the punctate distribution of Vesl-1S in neurons and that these phenomena were observed in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. 2Kato, A., Fukuda, T., Fukazawa, Y., Isojima, Y., Fujitani, K., Inokuchi, K., and Sugiyama, H. (2001)Eur. J. Neurosci. 7, 1292–1302. Phorbol esters activate several types of proteins (29Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). As some proteins (Mos and p53) evade proteasome-mediated degradation when phosphorylated (30Ishida N. Tanaka K. Tamura T. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Furuno N. Watanabe N. Sagata N.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), it is possible that the application of phorbol esters may provoke the same phenomena as those induced by proteasome inhibitors in neurons. The Vesl-1S protein may be modified by some kind of kinases activated by phorbol esters and, thereby, evade degradation by proteasomes. A possible hypothesis is that Vesl-1S protein accumulates selectively in certain synapses when proteasomes are unable to degrade the modified Vesl-1S protein present at these synapses. The accumulation of Vesl-1S protein at such synapses might affect the cell surface expression of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors 1/5 and promote remodeling of synapses, considering the recent observations that the cell surface expression of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors 1/5 were increased when co-expressed with Vesl-1S and that this increase was inhibited by Vesl-1L (34Ciruela, F., Soloviev, M.

The level of vesl-1SmRNA is increased after L-LTP induction, although the expression ofvesl-1L mRNA is not modulated during L-LTP. After L-LTP induction, the level of vesl-1S mRNA is higher than that of vesl-1L mRNA, although the amount of Vesl-1S protein is lower than that of Vesl-1L protein (9Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y.

It is likely that newly synthesized Vesl-1S proteins are rapidly degraded by proteasomes following L-LTP induction and that the overall amount of Vesl-1S protein is relatively low. However, when Vesl-1S proteins evade proteasome-mediated degradation by some unknown mechanism, these proteins may accumulate in postsynaptic regions.An unresolved issue is how proteasome-mediated degradation of Vesl-1S proteins is prevented. What is the inhibition signal? The stability of proteins degraded by proteasomes is regulated by phosphorylation in many cases. Recently, we found that phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) promoted the punctate distribution of Vesl-1S in neurons and that these phenomena were observed in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. 2Kato, A., Fukuda, T., Fukazawa, Y., Isojima, Y., Fujitani, K., Inokuchi, K., and Sugiyama, H.

The Vesl-1S protein may be modified by some kind of kinases activated by phorbol esters and, thereby, evade degradation by proteasomes. A possible hypothesis is that Vesl-1S protein accumulates selectively in certain synapses when proteasomes are unable to degrade the modified Vesl-1S protein present at these synapses. The accumulation of Vesl-1S protein at such synapses might affect the cell surface expression of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors 1/5 and promote remodeling of synapses, considering the recent observations that the cell surface expression of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors 1/5 were increased when co-expressed with Vesl-1S and that this increase was inhibited by Vesl-1L (34Ciruela, F., Soloviev, M. M., and McIlhinney, R. A. (1999)Biochem. J. 795–803.Google Scholar, 35Roche K.W. Tu J.C. Petralia R.S. Xiao B. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F. J. Biol.

All Vesl family proteins contain PEST sequences (Fig.1 A), which are thought to act as proteolytic signals (15Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). We have reported here that Vesl-1S, but not Vesl-1L, -2, or -3, is degraded by proteasomes and that the 11-amino acid region in the C terminus of Vesl-1S, which is the unique sequence among Vesl family proteins, is responsible for proteasome-mediated proteolysis. As the stable deletion mutants contained PEST sequences, it seems likely that PEST sequences are not involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation of Vesl-1S protein, although we will need to examine the stability of a deletion mutant lacking only the PEST sequences to verify this hypothesis. The signals for protein degradation by proteasomes are often ubiquitination. In the case of Vesl-1S, we also found that it was heavily ubiquitinated. In contrast, the proteasome-resistant stable mutant of Vesl-1S, VSD-3, was not ubiquitinated. Therefore the ubiquitination signals may most likely reside in the C-terminal 11-amino acid region, and the ubiquitination of Vesl-1S may promote the rapid degradation of the protein by proteasomes. At present, we have not identified the sites of ubiquitination, but at least the C-terminal 11-amino acid region does not seem to contain the only or major ubiquitination site. Thus, this region may function as a signal to stimulate ubiquitination of the other sites of Vesl-1S protein.

https://openalex.org/W2064505633,"G protein-coupled inward rectifier K+ channels (GIRK channels) are activated directly by the G protein βγ subunit. The crystal structure of the G protein βγ subunits reveals that the β subunit consists of an N-terminal α helix followed by a symmetrical seven-bladed propeller structure. Each blade is made up of four antiparallel β strands. The top surface of the propeller structure interacts with the Gα subunit. The outer surface of the βγ torus is largely made from outer β strands of the propeller. We analyzed the interaction between the β subunit and brain GIRK channels by mutating the outer surface of the βγ torus. Mutants of the outer surface of the β1 subunit were generated by replacing the sequences at the outer β strands of each blade with corresponding sequences of the yeast β subunit, STE4. The mutant β1γ2 subunits were expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells. They were applied to inside-out patches of cultured locus coeruleus neurons. The wild type β1γ2 induced robust GIRK channel activity with an EC50 of about 4 nm. Among the eight outer surface mutants tested, blade 1 and blade 2 mutants (D1 and CD2) were far less active than the wild type in stimulating GIRK channels. However, the ability of D1 and CD2 to regulate type I and type II adenylyl cyclases was not very different from that of the wild type β1γ2. As to the activities to stimulate phospholipase Cβ2, D1 was more potent and CD2 was less potent than the wild type β1γ2. Additionally we tested four β1 mutants in which mutated residues are located in the top Gα/β interacting surface. Among them, mutant W332A showed far less ability than the wild type to activate GIRK channels. These results suggest that the outer surface of blade 1 and blade 2 of the β subunit might specifically interact with GIRK and that the β subunit interacts with GIRK both over the outer surface and over the top Gα interacting surface.

Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a variety of regulatory signals from a large number of heptahelical receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclases, phosphodiesterases, phospholipases, and ion channels (1Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1992; 17: 383-387Google Scholar). Each G protein oligomer contains a guanine nucleotide binding α subunit and a high affinity dimer of β and γ subunits. The agonist-bound receptor activates the G proteins and generates GTP-bound α subunits and free βγ subunits. Both GTP α and βγ can regulate downstream effectors. The hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on α subunits leads to the reassociation of α and βγ subunits to form inactive heterotrimers.The crystal structure of the βγ subunit reveals that the β subunit consists of an N-terminal α helix followed by a symmetrical seven-bladed propeller structure based on WD repeat sequences, repeating motif of about 40 amino acids (2Wall M.A. Coleman D.E.

The bottom surface of the torus is the major site for interaction with the γ subunit. The outer surface of the torus is largely made up of the outer β strands of seven blades. βγ subunits directly regulate various effectors, including phospholipase Cβs (PLCβs),1 adenylyl cyclases, and ion channels. Experiments using mutated β subunits have demonstrated that some of the amino acid residues, which are located at the interaction sites between Gα and -β subunits, are crucial for the interaction between βγ and the effectors, and each effector demonstrates its specific domain of interaction on the β subunit (4Li Y.

Further mutational analysis showed that the activation of PLCβ2 also involves residues in the outer strands of blades 2, 6, and 7. However, mutations of β subunits that affected PLCβ2 activity did not influence the interaction between βγ and type I or type II adenylyl cyclase (6Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28298-28304Google Scholar). These results suggest that βγ interacts with effectors through both the Gα binding surface and the outer surface of the propeller structure and that each effector is interacting with βγ using different regions of its outer surface.The present study was undertaken to investigate the interaction sites of β1 with brain GIRK channels. We focused our investigation on the outer surface of the β1 subunit. We made sets of β1 mutants in which the amino acid residues located on or near the outermost β strand of each blade were replaced with the corresponding residues of the yeast β subunit (STE4), a most distantly related member of β from mammalian β subunits. In this study we show that mutating residues located on or near the outer strands of blade 1 and blade 2 disrupt GIRK activation by β1γ2. In contrast, the same mutations did not substantially affect the ability of β1γ2 to regulate adenylyl cyclases, indicating that no global disruption of β1 occurred because of the mutations. It is possible that the sites of the β1 subunit in blade 1 and blade 2 could specifically be involved in brain GIRK activation.DISCUSSIONGIRK channels are activated directly by the G protein βγ subunit. The interaction sites of βγ with GIRK have been investigated on the Gα interacting surface of the βγ subunit (5Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science.. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that regions outside of the Gα/β interaction surface of the β subunit also participate in the interaction with GIRK channels. We characterized the interaction of β with brain GIRK by using β1 mutants on the outer strands of the seven-bladed β-propeller structure. Mutations of certain residues on the outer strands of blade 1 (D1) and blade 2 (CD2) resulted in the severe disruption of their ability to activate GIRK channels. However, these mutants could regulate adenylyl cyclases similarly to the wild type, suggesting that the mutations of the D1 and CD2 areas did not produce a global disruption of β1structure. Thus, the results suggest that the mutated residues on the side of blade 1 and blade 2 of the βγ torus might be specifically involved in the regulation of GIRK channels.It should be noted that in this study, we have concentrated on analyzing mutations that produced a large functional deterioration in the K+ channel activation. This study does not exclude the possibility that other mutants may have a moderate defect in their ability to interact with K+ channels.It was previously shown that the activation of PLCβ2involves the outer strands of blades 2, 6, and 7 (6Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28298-28304Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD2 also showed a defect in its ability to activate PLCβ2. The results further support the importance of blade 2 for the interaction with PLCβ2. As shown in Fig.5, D1 was 2–3-fold more potent than the wild type in its ability to stimulate PLCβ2. The exact reason for this difference is currently unclear.Our results on β mutations over the Gα/β interaction surface indicate that W332A showed far less ability to activate GIRK channels. Although only one concentration (10 nm) of β1γ2 was tested, we observed a very large difference in their activity between W332A and the wild type. Because 10 nm is an almost saturating dose for the wild type, this result suggests that W332A is much less active than the wild type in its ability to stimulate GIRK channels. Thus, β/GIRK interaction sites partially overlap with the Gα/β interaction sites, but they are not identical. This is similar to the case of β subunit interaction with PLCβ2 or adenylyl cyclase (4Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Neer E.J. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 16265-16272Google Scholar,5Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science.. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Google Scholar).It is known that βγ can interact with effectors only if Gα is dissociated from βγ. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the β subunit does not undergo conformational changes when it is dissociated from Gα (3Lambright D.B. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature.. 1996; 379: 311-319Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that GDP-bound Gα could sever the β/GIRK association quickly (22Logothetis D.E. Kim D. Northup J.K. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1988; 85: 5814-5818Google Scholar, 23Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature.. 1994; 370: 143-146Google Scholar). Because the interaction sites of GIRK overlap with the Gα interaction surface on Gβγ, this effect of Gα could be explained by a simple spatial (three-dimensional) competition on the β subunit between Gα and GIRK (4Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Neer E.J. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 16265-16272Google Scholar). It is also possible that the association of GIRK to βγ induces a conformational change of the β subunit, and this change would favor the binding of βγ and GIRK. Conformational changes of the βγ subunit are demonstrated in the complex of βγ with phosducin (24Loew A. Ho Y.-K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure.. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Google Scholar). The binding of phosducin to the βγ subunit produces a distinct conformational change in blade 6 and blade 7 of the β subunit. The phosphorylation of phosducin on Ser-73 reduces its affinity for βγ and the released βγ subunit and then switches back to the conformation of free βγ or that of the heterotrimer (24Loew A. Ho Y.-K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure.. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Google Scholar). In the case of βγ complexed with GIRK, when Gαi interacts with a certain region of Gα/β interaction sites, the conformation of βγ could return to the resting state (before GIRK was attached), and this could decrease the affinity of GIRK with βγ. The determination of the structure of βγ complexed with GIRK will be necessary to answer this question. Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a variety of regulatory signals from a large number of heptahelical receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclases, phosphodiesterases, phospholipases, and ion channels (1Hepler J.R.

We characterized the interaction of β with brain GIRK by using β1 mutants on the outer strands of the seven-bladed β-propeller structure. Mutations of certain residues on the outer strands of blade 1 (D1) and blade 2 (CD2) resulted in the severe disruption of their ability to activate GIRK channels. However, these mutants could regulate adenylyl cyclases similarly to the wild type, suggesting that the mutations of the D1 and CD2 areas did not produce a global disruption of β1structure. Thus, the results suggest that the mutated residues on the side of blade 1 and blade 2 of the βγ torus might be specifically involved in the regulation of GIRK channels.It should be noted that in this study, we have concentrated on analyzing mutations that produced a large functional deterioration in the K+ channel activation. This study does not exclude the possibility that other mutants may have a moderate defect in their ability to interact with K+ channels.It was previously shown that the activation of PLCβ2involves the outer strands of blades 2, 6, and 7 (6Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28298-28304Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD2 also showed a defect in its ability to activate PLCβ2. The results further support the importance of blade 2 for the interaction with PLCβ2. As shown in Fig.5, D1 was 2–3-fold more potent than the wild type in its ability to stimulate PLCβ2. The exact reason for this difference is currently unclear.Our results on β mutations over the Gα/β interaction surface indicate that W332A showed far less ability to activate GIRK channels. Although only one concentration (10 nm) of β1γ2 was tested, we observed a very large difference in their activity between W332A and the wild type. Because 10 nm is an almost saturating dose for the wild type, this result suggests that W332A is much less active than the wild type in its ability to stimulate GIRK channels. Thus, β/GIRK interaction sites partially overlap with the Gα/β interaction sites, but they are not identical. This is similar to the case of β subunit interaction with PLCβ2 or adenylyl cyclase (4Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Neer E.J. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

Science.. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Google Scholar).It is known that βγ can interact with effectors only if Gα is dissociated from βγ. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the β subunit does not undergo conformational changes when it is dissociated from Gα (3Lambright D.B. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature.. 1996; 379: 311-319Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that GDP-bound Gα could sever the β/GIRK association quickly (22Logothetis D.E. Kim D. Northup J.K. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Proc.

Nature.. 1994; 370: 143-146Google Scholar). Because the interaction sites of GIRK overlap with the Gα interaction surface on Gβγ, this effect of Gα could be explained by a simple spatial (three-dimensional) competition on the β subunit between Gα and GIRK (4Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Neer E.J. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 16265-16272Google Scholar). It is also possible that the association of GIRK to βγ induces a conformational change of the β subunit, and this change would favor the binding of βγ and GIRK. Conformational changes of the βγ subunit are demonstrated in the complex of βγ with phosducin (24Loew A. Ho Y.-K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure.. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Google Scholar). The binding of phosducin to the βγ subunit produces a distinct conformational change in blade 6 and blade 7 of the β subunit. The phosphorylation of phosducin on Ser-73 reduces its affinity for βγ and the released βγ subunit and then switches back to the conformation of free βγ or that of the heterotrimer (24Loew A. Ho Y.-K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure.. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Google Scholar). In the case of βγ complexed with GIRK, when Gαi interacts with a certain region of Gα/β interaction sites, the conformation of βγ could return to the resting state (before GIRK was attached), and this could decrease the affinity of GIRK with βγ. The determination of the structure of βγ complexed with GIRK will be necessary to answer this question. GIRK channels are activated directly by the G protein βγ subunit. The interaction sites of βγ with GIRK have been investigated on the Gα interacting surface of the βγ subunit (5Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S.

Ugi, a bacteriophage-encoded peptide, potently inhibits UDGs by serving as a remarkable substrate mimic. Structure determination of UDGs has identified regions important for the exquisite specificity in the detection and removal of uracils from DNA and in their interaction with Ugi. In this study, we carried out mutational analysis of the Escherichia coli UDG at Leu191 within the187HPSPLS192 motif (DNA intercalation loop). We show that with the decrease in side chain length at position 191, the stability of the UDG-Ugi complexes regresses. Further, while the L191V and L191F mutants were as efficient as the wild type protein, the L191A and L191G mutants retained only 10 and 1% of the enzymatic activity, respectively. Importantly, however, substitution of Leu191with smaller side chains had no effect on the relative efficiencies of uracil excision from the single-stranded and a corresponding double-stranded substrate. Our results suggest that leucine within the HPSPLS motif is crucial for the uracil excision activity of UDG, and it contributes to the formation of a physiologically irreversible complex with Ugi.

If left unrepaired, these can be detrimental to the maintenance of genetic integrity (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar). Uracil is a natural component of RNA but can occur in the DNA by spontaneous deamination of an inherently unstable base, cytosine (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Wolfram S. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D. C.1995: 1-58Google Scholar). Occasional incorporation of dUMP, in place of dTMP, during DNA synthesis is yet another way by which uracil can arise in DNA (3Tye B.K. Nyman P.O. Lehaman I.R. Hochhauser S. Weiss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). If left unrepaired, in a U:G mismatch, uracil is promutagenic and can lead to GC→AT transition mutations during the next round of replication. Further, uracil, in an A:U pair in the DNA sequences can impend their recognition by the cognate regulatory proteins (4Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 315-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In cells, a highly efficient base excision repair enzyme, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG),1 is dedicated to the indomitable task of freeing the DNA from uracil residues (5Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 6Lindahl T. Ljungquist S. Siegert W. Nyberg B. Sperens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3286-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UDGs have been identified from a large number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and these enzymes show a high degree of conservation from bacteria to viruses to humans (7Aravind L. Koonin E.V.

UDGs also interact with a number of proteins such as the Bacillus subtilis phage-encoded uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor, Ugi, and host cellular factors such as single-stranded DNA-binding protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (9Wang Z.

Thus, UDGs constitute a remarkably interesting model system to understand the basis of catalytic prowess and specificity associated with protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The mechanism of uracil excision that has emerged from various structural studies and mutational analyses of UDGs is that the glycosidic bond between uracil and the sugar is cleaved by the attack of a hydroxyl nucleophile on the deoxyribose C1′ atom. This nucleophile is generated by the activation of a water molecule by an absolutely conserved Asp of the GQDPYH motif. Concomitant protonation of the O2 of the uracil base by His of yet another highly conserved motif, HPSPLS, enhances its leaving group quality (13Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Krokan H.E.

However, several crucial residues (Gln63, Asp64, and Leu191) inE. coli UDG show subtle conformational differences when compared with those in human UDG (15Ravishankar R. Bidya Sagar M. Roy S.

The major interactions, which render the complex between UDG and Ugi physiologically irreversible, are defined by (i) hydrogen bonding and packing contacts derived from the complementarity between the conserved Leu loop (187HPSPLS192) of E. coliUDG and eight hydrophobic residues of Ugi (Met24, Val29, Val32, Ile33, Val43, Met56, Leu58, and Val71) in a cavity burrowed between the α2and the antiparallel β sheet of Ugi and (ii) the electrostatic interactions between the acidic residues of the β1 edge of Ugi with the key active site residues of E. coli UDG. This structure also showed that the interaction between UDG and Ugi results in the burial of about 2200 Å2 of the total accessible surface area. The nestling of Leu191 into the hydrophobic cavity of Ugi alone causes the exclusion of about 250 Å2 of the surface area (17Putnam C.D. Shroyer M.J.N. Lundquist A.J. Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mutational and biochemical analyses form a necessary component of understanding the mechanism underlying the macromolecular interactions. However, the only mutational analysis that has been carried out to understand the mechanism of UDG-Ugi interaction has been with respect to the seven acidic residues (Glu20, Glu27, Glu28, Glu30, Glu31, Asp61, and Glu78) of Ugi. With the exception of the E20I and E20L mutants, which formed reversible complexes, the other mutants formed irreversible complexes with E. coli UDG (20Lundquist A.J. Beger R.D. Bennett S.E. Bolton P.H. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21408-21419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mutational analysis of neither UDG nor Ugi residues that are involved in the hydrophobic interactions has been performed. In this study, we have mutated the Leu191 of E. coli UDG to side chains of varying lengths and investigated the effect of these mutations on the ability of the resultant UDGs to form complexes with Ugi under in vitro and in vivoconditions. In addition, we utilized two of these mutants to understand the role of Leu191 in uracil excision from the single- and double-stranded substrates. Importantly, during these studies, we have developed a novel urea-polyacrylamide gel system, which has allowed us to monitor the real time dissociation of UDG-Ugi complexes. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Bangalore Genei or Ransom Hill Bioscience. The oligomer, SSU9, 5′-d(ctcaagtgUaggcatgcaagagct)-3′, is a single-stranded 24-mer oligonucleotide substrate containing dU at the 9th position (from the 5′-end). The substrate AU9, 5′-d(ctcaagtgUaggcatgcttttgcatgcctacacttga)-3′, is a 37-mer hairpin oligonucleotide containing dU in the stem region. In AU9, the dU is in the same sequence context as in SSU9 except that it is located in a double-stranded region. Oligonucleotides (10 pmol) were 5′-32P-end labeled using 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase in 10-μl reaction volumes (21Chaconas G. van de Sande J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 minicolumns (22Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3737-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This procedure routinely resulted in labeling efficiency of ∼106 cpm/pmol. ForKm and Vmax determinations, radiolabeled oligonucleotides were mixed with cold substrates such that the contribution from labeled substrates was much less than 1% (23Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2336-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment (∼800 base pairs) harboring the sequence downstream of the BamHI site within the ung gene was excised from pTZUng4 usingBamHI (24Varshney U. Hutcheon T. van de Sande J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7776-7784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into a similarly digested pTZ19R to generate pTZUng2B′. This recombinant plasmid is similar to pTZUng2B (24Varshney U. Hutcheon T. van de Sande J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7776-7784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that it harbors the insert in the opposite orientation. Single-stranded DNA template derived from pTZUng2B′ and the mutagenic oligomers 5′-ATG CGC CGA ACC CGG CGA CGG-3′, 5′-ATG CGC CGA A (G/C) C CGG CGA CGG-3′, and 5′-ATG CGC CGA AAA CGG CGA CGG-3′ were used to obtain L191G, L191A, and L191F mutants, respectively (25Handa P. Varshney U. Ind. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 35: 63-66PubMed Google Scholar). All of the mutants were confirmed by complete nucleotide sequencing. During the process of generating these mutations, we serendipitously obtained the L191V mutant. To reconstitute the Leu191 mutants into the pTrcUDG expression vector, the relevant region of the mutant pTZ19R constructs was excised as a NruI–HindIII fragment (∼500 base pairs) and subcloned into similarly digested pTrcUDG to generate pTrc99c-based expression constructs for the L191G, L191A, L191V, and L191F mutants. To develop the T7 RNA polymerase-based expression constructs, the ung gene sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the pTZ19R-based recombinants usingPfu DNA polymerase and a universal primer, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′ that anneals to the vector sequence downstream of the multiple cloning site and a gene-specific primer, 5′-CGTGAAGCTTGACGGTACGGGC-3′ that anneals in the 3′-flanking region of the ung gene and harbors aHindIII site (shown in italics). After initial heating at 95 °C for 1 min, the reactions were subjected to 24 cycles of temperature shifts at 95 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Finally, the reaction was incubated at 72 °C for 10 min. The polymerase chain reaction products were purified and digested with BamHI and HindIII and used to replace a similar region of the ung gene from a pET11d construct harboring the ung gene open reading frame by using standard recombinant DNA methods (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The expression constructs in pTrc99c and pET11d thus obtained were reaffirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The pET11d-based UDG gene constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the transformants were inoculated directly into 250 ml of 2YT medium (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and UDG was purified by a modification of the procedure described earlier (6Lindahl T. Ljungquist S. Siegert W. Nyberg B. Sperens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3286-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial cell pellet was suspended in TG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifuging at 20,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the S-20 supernatant. Streptomycin sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.9% to the S-20 extract and subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The pellet from the 40–60% ammonium sulfate saturation was dissolved in TG buffer containing 500 mmNaCl, loaded onto a G-75 column (80 × 7.1 cm2), and eluted with the same buffer. The fractions enriched for UDG were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate fractionation (70% saturation). The precipitate was suspended in 5 ml of HG buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), dialyzed against the same buffer, and loaded onto a Mono-S column (5 ml; Bio-Rad), which was equilibrated with the HG buffer. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in HG buffer. The fractions enriched for UDG were dialyzed against TG buffer, loaded onto a HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (FPLC; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted using a gradient of 0–1m NaCl in TG buffer. The fractions containing apparently pure UDG were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50% (v/v) glycerol, quantified (27Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar), and stored at −20 °C. A reaction mixture (70 μl) was set up in UDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 35 pmol of SSU9. The reaction was started by adding 5 μl of an appropriate dilution of UDG (96.5 pg of wild type, 2250 pg of L191G, 300 pg of L191A, 72 pg of L191V, and 49.5 pg of L191F UDGs) at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at various time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min), and the reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.2 n NaOH and heating at 90 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was dried in a SpeedVac (Savant) and taken up in 10 μl of loading dye containing 80% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, bromphenol blue, and 1 mm Na2EDTA, and half of the contents was electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gels. The bands corresponding to substrate and product were quantitated by a BioImage Analyser (Fuji). Reactions (15 μl) containing varying amounts of 32P-labeled substrates and appropriate concentrations of UDG in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by adding 5 μl of 0.2 n NaOH. Cleavage at the abasic site was achieved by heating the contents at 90 °C for 30 min, and the reaction products were analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide-8m urea gels. The bands corresponding to the product and the remaining substrate were quantified by using a BioImage Analyser (Fuji). Values of Km and Vmaxwere determined from Hofstee plots (28Dowd J.E. Riggs D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 863-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of at least two independent experiments. UDG (2.5 μg) was mixed with Ugi (1 μg) in a 15-μl volume consisting of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then for 15 min on ice (29Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 30Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Boyanapalli M. Varshney U. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Subsequently, loading dye (5 μl) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue was added to the reaction, and it was subjected to electrophoresis on 10-cm-long 15% polyacrylamide (19:1 cross-linking) gels of 0.75-mm thickness without or with 2, 4, 6, or 8 m urea. The electrophoresis at ∼10 V/cm was carried out using running buffer (25 mm Tris-base, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.8). The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. Bicistronic constructs of various UDG mutants and Ugi were generated in pTrc99c exactly as described (30Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Boyanapalli M. Varshney U. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) except that the open reading frames of the Leu191 mutants (pTrc99c constructs) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction usingPfu DNA polymerase and the gene-specific forward (5′-CGGAATTCCATGGCTAACGAATTAACC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAATTCCTATTACTCACTCTCTGCC-3′) primers. Template DNA (50 ng) and 20 pmol of the forward and the reverse primers were utilized in polymerase chain reaction under the following cycling conditions. The initial denaturation temperature was 95 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of repeated denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing for 30 s at 50 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The final extension was allowed at 72 °C for 10 min. To generate the bicistronic constructs in T7 RNA polymerase-based expression vector,NcoI–HindIII fragments harboring the complete bicistron from the pTrc99c constructs were subcloned into similarly digested pET11d (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Overexpression of UDG and Ugi was achieved from the pTrc99c-based expression constructs exactly as described (30Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Boyanapalli M. Varshney U. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cell-free extracts were analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide (19:1 cross-linking) gels with or without 6 or 8 m urea. The purification of the complexes of Ugi with the wild type and mutant UDGs was achieved by the protocol described earlier (30Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Boyanapalli M. Varshney U. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using the pET11d-based constructs. Due to the high level expression from the T7 RNA polymerase based vector, chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Mono-Q columns was found to be unnecessary. The purified complexes were quantified (27Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at −20 °C. UDG, Ugi, or the in vivo formed complexes of UDG and Ugi (1–2.5 μm) were incubated at 25 ± 2 °C for 4 h in the absence or presence of 2, 4, 6, and 8 murea in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Intrinsic fluorescence (tryptophan) changes were measured using a Jasco FP777 spectrofluorimeter with a thermostat cell holder using a cuvette of 1-cm path length and slit widths of 5 nm for excitation and emission. Appropriate buffer controls were also scanned and subtracted to arrive at the fluorescence intensity values. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the corresponding emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. For detailed analysis of Ugi complexes with the wild type and the L191G UDGs, fluorescence intensities were measured at 332.5 and 326.5 nm, respectively. These wavelengths showed maximal fluorescence difference between the native (untreated sample) and the 8 murea-treated samples. The emission intensities were converted into the relative fluorescence changes and plotted against the corresponding urea concentration. The relative fluorescence changes were calculated as (Ff −Fu)/Ff, whereFf corresponds to the fluorescence intensity of the native proteins and Fu corresponds to the fluorescence intensity of the urea-treated proteins (31Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation of the various Ugi complexes with UDGs (wild type, L191G, L191A, L191V, and L191F) was performed in a spectrophotometer (DU600; Beckman) as described (32Rao J.V.K. Prakash V. Rao N., A. Savithri H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5967-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein used was 1 μm and the absorbance changes were monitored at 287 nm. The first derivative of the thermal denaturation profile obtained using the software supplied with the instrument was used to evaluate the apparent transition temperatures for the proteins. The apparent denaturation temperature (apparent Tm) is defined as the temperature at which half of the protein is in the denatured state. Our repeated attempts to overproduce the UDG mutants at Leu191using the pTrc99c-based expression constructs in E. coliBW310 (ung−) remained unsuccessful. Therefore, we used the T7 RNA polymerase-based expression constructs in E. coliBL21 (DE3). The pET11d-based constructs afforded hyperexpression of UDG even in the absence of induction. SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) revealed that the high level expression and the use of various column chromatography steps (see “Materials and Methods”) yielded UDGs that were purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig.1 A). Although the E. coli BL21 (DE3) is wild type for ung, it has been shown that the UDG preparations obtained from such overexpression constructs are essentially free from the host chromosomal background (34Shroyer M. Bennett S.E. Putnam C.D. Tainer J.A. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4834-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2P. Handa, S. Roy, and U. Varshney, unpublished data. The T7 polymerase based expression systems for E. coli UDG mutants have been used in other studies as well (16Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Gilliland G.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Time course experiments (Fig.1 B) wherein a single-stranded DNA oligomer (SSU9) was used as substrate showed that the wild type and the L191V and L191F mutants were comparable in their uracil excision activity. However, compared with the wild type UDG, the L191A and L191G mutants retained about 10 and 1% enzymatic activity, respectively. Ugi, encoded by the B. subtilis phage, PBS-1 or -2, is a proteinaceous inhibitor of UDG and is an exceptional mimic of the DNA substrate. Co-crystals of UDG-Ugi show that the side chain Leu191 of UDG fits into a hydrophobic cavity of Ugi (15Ravishankar R. Bidya Sagar M. Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Varshney U. Vijayan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4880-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Putnam C.D. Shroyer M.J.N. Lundquist A.J. Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to us to analyze the stability of the complexes of Ugi with the UDG mutants with varying length of the side chains at position 191. Since theB. subtilis UDG, which is a natural target of Ugi, contains phenylalanine in place of the Leu191 in the E. coli UDG, we were also interested in the study of L191F for its ability to interact with Ugi. Fig. 2 A shows electrophoretic analysis of the in vitro formed complexes of Ugi with UDGs on a native polyacrylamide gel. UDG (pI, 6.6; molecular mass, 25.6 kDa) migrates slowest (lane 1), and Ugi (pI, 4.2; molecular mass, 9.4 kDa) migrates fastest (lane 6). The complex of the two proteins (pI, 4.9; molecular mass, 35 kDa) migrates with intermediate mobility (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2–6). The electrophoretic analysis of the native gel did not reveal any differences between the complexes of Ugi with the wild type or the mutant UDGs. The wild type UDG forms a physiologically irreversible complex with Ugi (29Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In fact, the interaction between UDG and Ugi is so strong that, unless heated, the complex does not dissociate even after several hours of incubation in 8m urea. Therefore, to study the effect of mutations at Leu191, we developed a urea-polyacrylamide gel system (Fig.2, B–E) to discriminate the UDG-Ugi complexes based on their relative stability. In the presence of 2 or 4 m urea, UDG (lane 1) and Ugi (lane 7) begin to migrate as diffuse bands (Fig. 2, Band C), suggesting urea-mediated unfolding of these proteins. However, upon further increase in urea concentration (6 and 8m), their mobility on the gel was relatively more compact (Fig. 2, D and E). This is most likely, because with the increase in urea concentration, the unfolding of the proteins was complete. More importantly, the complex of wild type UDG with Ugi migrated as a sharp band even on a gel containing 8 m urea (compare lanes 2 in Fig. 2, A–E). This observation suggests that while the UDG and Ugi are individually susceptible to urea-mediated unfolding, the complex of the two becomes impervious to urea under these conditions. However, under the same conditions, the complex of Ugi with L191G UDG was more susceptible to urea-induced perturbation, and it began to dissociate in 4m urea gel (appearance of smear in Fig. 2 C,lane 3), and the dissociation was complete in 6m urea gel (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). Unlike the L191G mutant, the complexes of L191A and L191V with Ugi remain intact at 4 m urea (Fig.2 C, lanes 4 and 5) but begin to dissociate in 6 m urea (Fig. 2 D,lanes 4 and 5). On the 8 murea gel, while the complex of Ugi with the wild type and the L191F UDGs showed a detectable smear, the other complexes dissociated completely. Furthermore, in the 8 m urea gel (Fig.2 E), we observed that from among the complexes of Ugi with the L191G, L191A, and L191V mutants, the Ugi band that resulted upon the dissociation of the respective complexes (Fig. 2 E) migrated fastest in lane 3 (L191G), intermediately in lane 4 (L191A), and slowest inlane 5 (L191V). On the contrary, the mobility of the smear corresponding to UDG was maximum for the L191V, intermediate for L191A, and least for L191G. Interestingly, the Ugi band inlane 3 (L191G) migrated just slightly slower than the Ugi control (lane 7), suggesting that the L191G-Ugi dissociated soon after its entry into the gel. Taken together, the use of these urea-polyacrylamide gels enabled us to monitor the progressive real time dissociation of the UDG-Ugi complexes, and the relat"

We report a study of six patients with COX deficiencies. Two of the patients had as yet undefined defects, three patients had Surf-1 mutations, and one patient had a 15-base pair deletion in the COX III subunit. We show that quantitative measurements of steady-state levels of subunits by monoclonal antibody reactivity, when used in combination with a discontinuous sucrose gradient methods, provide an improved diagnosis of COX deficiencies by distinguishing between kinetic, stability, and assembly defects. The two mutants of undefined etiology had a full complement of subunits with one stable and the other partially unstable to detergent solubilization. Both are likely to carry mutations in nuclear-encoded subunits of the complex. The three Surf-1 mutants and the COX III mutant each had reduced steady-state levels of subunits but variable associations of the residual subunits. This information, as well as aiding in diagnosis, helps in understanding the genotype-phenotype relationships of COX deficiencies and provides insight into the mechanism of assembly of the enzyme complex.

This information, as well as aiding in diagnosis, helps in understanding the genotype-phenotype relationships of COX deficiencies and provides insight into the mechanism of assembly of the enzyme complex. cytochromec oxidase population doubling mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome c oxidase (COX)1 is the terminal enzyme complex of the respiratory chain. In eukaryotes, it is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it catalyzes the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen (1Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This reaction is coupled with the translocation of protons across the inner membrane, and the resulting electrochemical gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis and ion transport (2Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human COX is composed of 13 subunits, the three largest of which are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (3Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). In addition to these 13 structural subunits, there are many “assembly factors” required for the proper functioning of COX. In yeast, over 30 different genetic complementation groups for COX assembly have been reported (4McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol.

To date, there is no unequivocal evidence of a mutation in the nuclear-encoded structural COX subunits causing human disease. One patient with severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy was reported to have an altered Km for reduced cytochromec yet had no mutations in the mitochondrially encoded COX subunits (27Nijtmans L.G.J. Barth P.G. Lincke C.R. Van Galen M.J.M. Zwart R. Klement P. Bolhuis P.A. Ruitenbeek W. Wanders R.J.A. Van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1270: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The defect in this patient was presumed to have arisen from a nuclear gene mutation, but no definitive data were provided. With so many possible gene defects giving rise to COX deficiency, the screening of patients is complicated, and a protocol that localizes the possible mutations to groups of genes (e.g. mtDNA, nuclear-encoded structural subunit genes, or genes for assembly factors) would be useful. Recently the steady-state levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunits in tissues from 17 patients were examined by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies made in this laboratory (28von Kleist-Retzow J.C. Vial E. Chantrel-Groussard K. Rötig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Taanman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These patients showed a range of subunit profiles. Some had normal levels of all COX subunits and were classified as candidates for mutations in nuclear-encoded structural genes. Other patients, including one Surf-1 mutant, had reduced levels of several of the subunits, which were classified as assembly mutants. More recently, immunohistochemistry has been used to study a set of COX-deficient patients, and similar conclusions were drawn (29Rahman S. Lake B.D. Taanman J.W. Hanna M.G. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Leonard J.V. Brain. 2000; 123: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In that study, patients showed either a reduction in all of the subunits, none of the subunits, or just the mitochondrially encoded subunits. Here, we have analyzed cytochrome c oxidase-deficient patients by subunit composition as before (28von Kleist-Retzow J.C. Vial E. Chantrel-Groussard K. Rötig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Taanman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but we added an analysis of patient mitochondria using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Our previous studies have established that this approach separates the complexes of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiently and, in the case of complex I deficiencies, allows assembly of this complex to be examined (30Hanson, B. J., Schulenberg, B., Patton, W. F., and Capaldi, R. A. (2001) Electrophoresis, in press.Google Scholar, 31Triepels R.H. Hanson B.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Sundell L. Marusich M.F. Smeitink J.A.

As we show, in combination, the data from the two analyses improved the classification of cytochrome coxidase deficiencies and provided insight into both phenotype-genotype relationships and assembly. MRC5 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The population doubling (PD) level of the cells was in the range of 35–45 at the time of harvesting. All cells were grown as described before in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml uridine, 110 μg/ml pyruvate, and 10 mmHEPES buffer to maximize growth rates (32Marusich M.F.

Rho0 MRC5 fibroblasts were derived by culturing MRC5 fibroblasts (PD = 28–30) continuously in permissive medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml ethidium bromide for a further 16 population PDs. Primary fibroblast cultures of Patients 1, 2, 3, and 4 were obtained from needle skin biopsies performed during the course of diagnostic evaluation at the Ospedale Pediatrico “Bambino Gesu,” Roma, Italy. The fibroblast culture of Patient 5 was obtained from the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The 100% mutant cybrid cell line containing a 15-base pair deletion of the COX III subunit (Patient 6) was kindly supplied by Dr. Michael King, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA. Specific details concerning this patient and the generation of the hybrid cell line were described previously (19Keightley J.A. Hoffbuhr K.C. Burton M.D. Salas V.M. Johnston W.S. Penn A.M. Buist N.R.

Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured basically as described previously (34Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. Taanman J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼80–100 μg of protein from digitonized fibroblasts or homogenized muscle biopsy were added to a cuvette containing 1 ml final volume of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml cytochrome c reduced with sodium dithionite, and 0.025% of lauryl maltoside. The oxidation of reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm was then followed spectrophotometrically (extinction coefficient 19.0 mm−1cm−1). Each reported value is the average of 2–5 independent measurements. Proteins were separated on 10–22% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels run according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Western blotting was done as described previously (32Marusich M.F. Robinson B.H. Taanman J.W. Kim S.J. Schillace R. Smith J.L. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to an 0.45-mm polyvinylidine difluoride membrane in Towbin buffer. Reactive bands were detected using the ECL PlusTM detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK) and were imaged using the image analyzer Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence was quantified using NIH Image and standardized to the loading control, porin. The porin monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was used at a 1:120,000 dilution in 5% milk/Ca2+- Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. The polyclonal Surf-1 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Eric Shoubridge, Montreal Neurological Hospital. All other monoclonal antibodies used were prepared at the University of Oregon and used in the following concentrations: complex I-39 kDa (2 μg/ml), complex II-30 kDa (5 μg/ml), complex II-70 kDa (0.01 μg/ml), complex III-core 2 (0.4 μg/ml), complex V-α (4 μg/ml), COX II (2 μg/ml), COX Va (2 μg/ml), COX I (2 μg/ml), COX VIc (2 μg/ml), and COX IV (0.5 μg/ml). Mitochondria (1 mg) were resuspended at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in 1 mmEDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% lauryl maltoside, 100 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.8. The mitochondria were incubated in this solution for 20 min on ice with stirring before insoluble membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant (∼200 μl) was layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged overnight at 4 °C (150,000 ×g, 16.5 h, SW 50.1). The gradient was composed of 250 μl of 35% sucrose, 500 μl of 30% sucrose, 750 μl of 27.5% sucrose, 1 ml of 25% sucrose, 1 ml of 20% sucrose, and 1 ml of 15% sucrose. All sucrose solutions were prepared in 100 mmTris/HCl pH 7.8, 0.05% lauryl maltoside, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The sucrose gradient was fractionated from the bottom of the tube into 10 fractions, which were frozen at −80 °C. For the Western blotting, 20 μl of each fraction was loaded per lane. For quantitation purposes, the levels of subunits present in each fraction were expressed as a percentage of the darkest intensity band for each antibody. Cell lines from six patients demonstrating different degrees of COX deficiency were studied. The clinical presentations of these patients and specific mutations that were identified are shown in TableI. In muscle biopsy samples from Patients 1 and 2, the COX activity was drastically reduced by 77 and 76%, respectively, compared with control values. On the other hand, the COX activity in fibroblasts was much higher, with Patients 1 and 2 losing only 30 and 20% of enzyme activity, respectively. It is not unusual for there to be tissue specificity of a defect when mtDNA mutations are involved, because mtDNA replication and inheritance are stochastic in somatic cells and can result in different mutational loads in different tissues (36Schon E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 555-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, muscle biopsies from Patients 1 and 2 were screened for mutations in the mitochondrially encoded COX subunits I, II, and III, and no mutations were found. The defects in these cell lines are thus predicted to be nuclear-encoded. These two patients were also screened for mutations in the COX assembly factors Surf-1, Sco-1, and Sco-2, but again no mutations were found. The unusual tissue specificity of these two mutants is discussed in more detail later.Table IClinical, genetic, and biochemical characteristics of investigated patientsPatientClinical presentationAge at onsetMutationCOX activity in muscle1-aActivities are expressed as a percentage of control values.

Open table in a new tab In three of the patients (Patients 3, 4, and 5), we identified a SURF-1 mutation, resulting in undetectable levels of the Surf-1 protein (Fig.1). Two of these are frameshift mutations, and produce a premature translation termination. The third (Patient 5) harbored a deletion between exons 1 and 2. Western blotting of Patient 5 using a different antibody from that used here has shown the presence of some Surf-1 of altered migration. 2B. Robinson, unpublished data. Thus, the mutation could result in an incorrectly spliced version of Surf-1. Patient 4 presented with tubulopathy in addition to Leigh syndrome, which is the most common clinical presentation associated with Surf-1 mutations. Patient 6 had a previously reported 15-base pair deletion in COX III (19Keightley J.A. Hoffbuhr K.C. Burton M.D. Salas V.M. Johnston W.S. Penn A.M. Buist N.R. Kennaway N.G. Nat.

Western blot analysis was performed on mitochondria isolated from all six patient cell lines along with control MRC5 fibroblasts and MRC5 fibroblasts that had been depleted of mitochondrial DNA (rho0). Individual protein signals were normalized using the porin signal as a control for equal loading. The signals of all proteins were set to 100% for the control MRC5 fibroblasts, and the levels of the individual proteins in other cell lines are reported relative to this value. The quantitative subunit profiles for each cell line appear in Fig. 2. For Patients 1 and 2, all of the COX subunits probed were present at normal levels (Fig. 2). Thus, the subunit profile alone does not provide diagnostic information. The data for Patients 1 and 2 contrast with those of Patients 3–6, each of which had a significant reduction in all of the COX subunits probed. As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of subunits I, II, IV, Va, and VIc were quantitatively similar in Patients 3 and 6, one a Surf-1 mutant and the second a COX III mutant. The levels of subunits in the other two Surf-1 mutants were different from Patient 3. Patient 5 had much more of subunits II and VIc, whereas Patient 4 showed intermediate expression with more of subunits II and VIc than Patient 3 but less than Patient 5. Thus, steady-state levels alone do not distinguish mtDNA from Surf-1 mutations. Mitochondria from the six patient cell lines, control MRC5 fibroblasts, and rho0 MRC5 fibroblasts were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. In the gradient, complexes are separated at a rate depending largely on their size. The positions of complexes in the gradient can then be determined by Western blotting of the fractions with monoclonal antibodies directed against particular subunits. Ten fractions were collected from each gradient, and Western blots were performed on the fractions from each of the gradients using antibodies to complex I-39 kDa subunit, complex V-α, complex III-core 2, complex II-30 kDa subunit, and COX subunits I, II, IV, and Va. Fig.3 shows a representative Western blot from a sucrose gradient of mitochondria from Patient 4. For simplicity of presentation, the data from each sucrose gradient are graphed by setting the highest intensity signal for each antibody in each gradient to 100% and expressing the levels of each subunit in the various fractions as a percentage of this signal (Fig.4). It is therefore important to note that the absolute level of a particular subunit may be only a small fraction of the level in control cells. However, the absolute expression level of each subunit can be obtained by referring back to Fig. 2. The distribution of the complex II-30 kDa subunit was monitored in each experiment and always ran in fractions 6 and 7, confirming the reproducibility of these gradient experiments (data not shown).Figure 4Graphical representation of the position of four COX subunits in sucrose gradients. Western blot signals were quantitated, and for each antibody, the fraction with the highest intensity signal was set to 100%. The relative amount of signal found in the other fractions was then represented as a percentage of this value. Shown are data from: A, control MRC 5 fibroblasts; B, rho0 MRC 5 fibroblasts,;C, Patient 1; D, Patient 2; E, Patient 3; F, Patient 4; G, Patient 5; and H, Patient 6. COX I is represented in purple, COX II inpink, Cox IV in yellow, and COX Va ingreen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the COX subunits I, II, IV, and Va in the gradient for each cell line. For the control MRC5 cells (Fig.4 A), all of these subunits peak in fractions 5 and 6, indicating that they are assembled in an intact complex. Rho0 cells, on the other hand, show a much different pattern (Fig. 4 B). As subunits I and II are mitochondrially encoded, they do not appear in the gradient. Subunits IV and Va are present, and they both peak in fraction 8. For Patient 1 with 30% reduction in COX activity in fibroblasts, not only were all of the COX subunits expressed at near normal levels (Fig.2), but the sucrose gradient shows a fully assembled complex (Fig.4 C). This patient may have a kinetic defect. Patient 2 had a reduction of COX activity of 20%. In this case, there was evidence of instability of the complex to detergent treatment, as a portion of subunits IV and Va were found dissociated from the core complex (Fig.4 D). Sucrose gradient evaluation of Patients 3, 4, and 5, each with mutations in the COX assembly factor, Surf-1, confirmed that these are all assembly mutants and showed that there are differences between them in the amount and nature of the partially assembled complex (Fig. 4,E–G). A fraction of subunits I, IV, Va, and all of the residual subunit II present were found at the position of fully assembled COX. Both Patients 3 and 4 retained significant COX activity (see Table I), which is related to the amount of COX II present and thereby the amount of assembled complexes. In both of these patients, there were fractions containing subunits I + II + IV + Va, I + IV + Va, and IV + Va. The third Surf-1 mutant (Patient 5) is different from the other Surf-1 patients in regard to both steady-state levels of subunits and in the assembly profile. This patient, with only 11% residual activity, showed no fully assembled enzyme. However, there were fractions containing I + II, I + Va, and IV + Va. Patient 6, with a 15-base pair deletion in the COX III subunit, also exhibited a severe assembly defect, with each of the four subunits examined shifted in the gradient to lower molecular weight fractions compared with controls (Fig. 4 H). As in all the assembly mutants, subcomplexes containing subunits I + II and IV + Va were detected. COX deficiency presents with a plethora of phenotypes, which is not surprising given the complexity of enzyme structure and the multiple factors and many steps required for assembly of this, the terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain (37Robinson B.H. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The challenge in patient diagnosis is both to decide whether the condition is due to a COX defect alone and to localize the possible mutations to a single or limited number of genes. A functional COX requires three mitochondrially encoded subunits, 10 nuclear-encoded subunits, some of which are tissue specific, and an as yet unknown number of assembly factors that includes Cox10, Sco-1, Sco-2, and Surf-1 (12Zhu Z.

Although Akt mediates a variety of biological activities, the mechanisms by which its activity is regulated remain unclear. The potential role of the ε isozyme of protein kinase C (PKC) in the activation of Akt induced by insulin has now been examined. Expression of a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCε (εKD), but not that of wild-type PKCε or of kinase-deficient mutants of PKCα or PKCλ, with the use of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of Akt induced by insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells or L6 myotubes. Whereas the εKD mutant did not affect insulin stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity, the phosphorylation and activation of Akt induced by a constitutively active mutant of PI 3-kinase were inhibited by εKD, suggesting that εKD affects insulin signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase. PDK1 (3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) is thought to participate in Akt activation. Overexpression of PDK1 with the use of an adenovirus vector induced the phosphorylation and activation of Akt; εKD inhibited, whereas wild-type PKCε had no effect on, these actions of PDK1. These results suggest that εKD inhibits the insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt by interfering with the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt.

Given that Akt translocates from the cytosol to the membrane fraction of cells in response to growth factors (23Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P.

Mutational analysis has revealed that phosphorylation of both Thr308 and Ser473 is required for Akt activation (18Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Although a kinase that phosphorylates Ser473 of Akt has been tentatively designated PDK2, its nature remains unclear. Balendran et al. (25Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) recently showed that PDK1 phosphorylates Ser473 of Akt in vitro only in the presence of a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein that contains the COOH-terminal portion of protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase 2 (PRK2) or of synthetic peptides corresponding to this region of PRK2. In contrast, the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase by PDK1 was inhibited in the presence of the same GST fusion protein or peptides (26Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, when overexpressed in intact cells, this same region of PRK2 prevented ligand-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase (26Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the interactions of PDK1 with its substrates, at least those with Akt and p70 S6 kinase, are regulated by another kinase. PKCε is a member of the novel subfamily of PKC isozymes (27Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6927-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). When expressed in fibroblasts also expressing various mutant PDGF receptors, PKCε contributed to the transactivation of the TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate)-responsive element induced by PDGF in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (29Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKCε participates in signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase. We have therefore now investigated whether PKCε plays a role in activation of Akt. We examined the effects of overexpression of wild-type or a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCε on Akt activation induced by insulin, heat shock, or hydrogen peroxide. Expression of the kinase-deficient mutant of PKCε inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of Akt in response to all three stimuli, probably by affecting the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt. L6 myoblasts were maintained and induced to differentiate into myotubes as described previously (30Mitsumoto Y. Liu Z. Klip A. Endocrine J. 1993; 1: 307-315Google Scholar). We amplified a full-length mouse serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase (SGK) 2 cDNA (31Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with cDNA synthesized from RNA extracted from mouse liver as template. The amplified SGK2 cDNA was tagged with the HA epitope at its NH2 terminus with the use of PCR. To establish CHO-IR cells that express (in addition to insulin receptors) FLAG epitope-tagged Akt1 or HA epitope-tagged SGK2 (CHO-IR/Akt cells and CHO-IR/SGK2 cells, respectively), we transfected CHO-IR cells with pSV40-hgh (which confers resistance to hygromycin) and a PECE vector encoding FLAG-tagged rat Akt1 (RAC-PKα) (6Konishi H.

Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Kitamura T.

The resultant adenovirus vectors were termed AxCAεWT, AxCAεKD, AxCAεT566A, AxCAεA159E, AxCAPDK1, and AxCAαKD, respectively. CHO-IR/Akt cells or differentiated L6 myotubes were infected with adenovirus vectors at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI), expressed in plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell, as described previously (33Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cells were subjected to experiments 24–48 h after infection. L6 myotubes or CHO-IR/Akt cells were deprived of serum for 16–20 h, incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for the indicated time, and then immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. The assay for MAP kinase activity was performed with immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to MAP kinase, as described previously (33Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For assay of PI 3-kinase activity, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20; Transduction Laboratories); the resulting immunoprecipitates were washed and PI 3-kinase activity in the washed precipitates was assayed as described previously (33Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For assay of Akt activity, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies to Akt as described (15Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were then mixed with 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm of the specific peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKI), 5 μmnonradioactive ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol), and 5 μm Crosstide peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG) (39Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4393) Google Scholar) and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Assay of SGK activity was performed essentially as described (40Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 25 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). The lysate was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to HA. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with the lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and with the lysis buffer and then twice with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.1% (v/v) of β-mercaptoethanol. The immunoprecipitates were then mixed with 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.12% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 3 μg/ml of PKI, 5 μmnonradioactive ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol), and 36 μm Crosstide peptide, and then incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. The kinase recation mixture for Akt or SGK was spotted onto a P81 phosphocellulose filter (Whatman), the filters were washed three times with 0.5% (w/v) orthophosphoric acid, and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was measured. The in vivophosphorylation of PDE3B was assayed as described previously (16Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO-IR/PDE3B-WT cells, previously infected (or not) with AxCAεKD, were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 15 min, and lysed. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies to PDE3B, the resulting precipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7% gel, and the incorporation of radioactivity into PDE3B was visualized and quantitated with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Infection of CHO-IR/Akt cells, which stably express both human insulin receptors and rat Akt1, with an adenovirus vector that encodes a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCε (AxCAεKD) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the amount of PKCε protein as assessed by immunoblot analysis; the amount of PKCε protein in cells infected at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell was ∼10–20 times that of endogenous PKCε (Fig.1 A). Exposure of noninfected CHO-IR/Akt cells to insulin resulted in a >30-fold increase in the amount of Akt activity measured in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to Akt (Fig. 1 A). Expression of the kinase-deficient mutant of PKCε (εKD) in the cells inhibited insulin-induced activation of Akt in a dose-dependent manner. Infection of CHO-IR/Akt cells with AxCAεKD also inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation of both Thr308 and Ser473 of Akt, as assessed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for either phospho-Thr308 or phospho-Ser473 forms of Akt (Fig. 1 A). Expression of a structurally distinct kinase deficient mutant of PKCε (εT566A) also exerted similar inhibitory effects on insulin-induced activity (Fig. 1 B) and phosphorylation (data not shown) of Akt in CHO-IR/Akt cells. We next investigated whether εKD exerted a similar inhibitory effect on Akt activation in physiological target cells of insulin. Insulin induced an approximately 6-fold increase in Akt activity in L6 myotubes (Fig. 1 C). Expression of εKD inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, overexpression of wild-type PKCε in L6 myotubes did not affect insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt (Fig. 1 D). Expression of wild-type PKCε also had no effect on the activation of Akt in response to insulin in CHO-IR/Akt cells, and expression of either wild-type PKCε or a constitutively active mutant of PKCε (εA159E), of which kinase activity was ∼10-fold higher than that of wild-type PKCε (data not shown), inconsistent with a previous report (41Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), did not induce Akt activation in the absence of insulin in CHO/IR Akt cells or in L6 myotubes (data not shown). These results suggest that εKD inhibits insulin-induced activation of Akt by preventing the phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473, and that signal mediated through PKCε alone is not sufficient to activate Akt in both CHO-IR/Akt cells and L6 myotubes. We investigated whether kinase-deficient mutants of other PKC isozymes also affected the activation of Akt by insulin. Infection of L6 myotubes with adenovirus vectors encoding εKD, wild-type PKCε, or kinase-deficient mutants of PKCα (αKD) or PKCλ (λKD) resulted in marked expression of the encoded proteins (Fig.2 A); at an MOI of 20 PFU/cell; the amount of each recombinant protein was at least 10 times that of the corresponding endogenous PKC isoform. Whereas expression of εKD inhibited insulin-induced activation of Akt, αKD had no effect on this action of insulin (Fig. 2 A). The expression of λKD resulted in a slight enhancement of the effect of insulin on Akt activity, consistent with previous observations (42Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Akt is also activated by heat shock and by hydrogen peroxide (6Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Morag S. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These stimuli induced ∼10- and 20-fold increases in Akt activity, respectively, in CHO-IR/Akt cells (Fig. 2 B). Expression of εKD inhibited the activation of Akt in response to either heat shock or hydrogen peroxide. The phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 and Ser473 induced by these stimuli was also inhibited by expression of εKD (Fig. 2 B). PDE3B was recently identified as a direct substrate of Akt (16Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In CHO-IR cells expressing PDE3B, insulin induced an approximately 2-fold increase in the extent of phosphorylation of PDE3B (Fig. 3). Infection of the cells with AxCAεKD at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell, a virus dose that inhibited insulin-induced activation of Akt by ∼50% in CHO-IR/Akt cells (Fig. 1 A), resulted in ∼50% inhibition of insulin-induced phosphorylation of PDE3B. This observation suggests that inhibition by εKD of Akt activation attenuates signaling downstream of Akt. We further attempted to identify the step of the insulin signaling pathway leading to activation of Akt that is affected by εKD. Overexpression of εKD had no effect on the insulin-induced increase in the activity of PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitated from L6 myotubes with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that εKD affects insulin-induced activation of Akt at a step downstream of PI 3-kinase. To verify this conclusion, we examined the effect of εKD on the activation of Akt by a constitutively active mutant of PI 3-kinase, Myr-p110, which comprises the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase ligated to a myristoylation signal sequence at its NH2 terminus (16Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 34Kotani K. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Kitamura T. Ueno H. Sano W. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21305-21312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Infection of L6 myotubes with an adenovirus vector encoding Myr-p110 (AxCAMyr-p110) induced both the phosphorylation and activation of Akt (Fig. 4 B). Coexpression of εKD inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the phosphorylation and activation of Akt induced by Myr-p110 (Fig.4 B); expression of εKD did not affect the amount Myr-p110 protein as assessed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). These observations are thus consistent with the notion that εKD inhibits insulin-induced activation of Akt by affecting signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase. Expression of εKD did not affect insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 4 C), indicating that early events of insulin signaling, such as activation of the insulin receptor kinase and phosphorylation of its substrates, are not prevented by εKD. PDK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates and activates Akt in vitro (19Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N.

Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the effect of εKD on PDK1-induced activation of Akt. Infection of CHO-IR/Akt cells with an adenovirus vector encoding PDK1 (AxCAPDK1) induced the phosphorylation of Akt on both Thr308 and Ser473 as well as the activation of this enzyme (Fig. 5). Coexpression of εKD with PDK1 resulted in inhibition of the PDK1-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt, with no effect on the amount of PDK1 protein. In contrast, expression of wild-type PKCε had no effect on the phosphorylation and activation of Akt induced by PDK1. These results suggest that εKD inhibited the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate Akt. PDK1 has recently been shown to contribute to the phosphorylation and the activation of SGK (31Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 40Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 43Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We finally investigated the effect of εKD on insulin-induced activation of SGK. CHO-IR/SGK2 cells, which stably express both human insulin receptors and HA-tagged mouse SGK2, were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin for 10 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to HA, and then SGK kinase activity toward Crosstide was assayed in the immunoprecipitates. Insulin induced ∼6-fold increase in the activity of SGK, and overexpression of εKD in the cells inhibited insulin-induced activation of SGK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). We have shown that overexpression of kinase-deficient mutants of PKCε (εKD or εT566A) with the use of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of Akt induced by insulin. An adenovirus vector encoding wild-type PKCε had no effect on the insulin-induced increase in Akt activity, and the virus encoding εKD had no effect on insulin-induced activation of either MAP kinase or PI 3-kinase, suggesting that the inhibition of Akt activation by εKD is due neither to nonspecific effects of viral infection nor to general inhibition of insulin signaling. The phosphorylation and activation of Akt induced by heat shock or hydrogen peroxide were also inhibited by εKD, suggesting that this mutant protein affects a common component of the Akt activation pathways triggered by various extracellular stimuli. PI 3-kinase acts as an upstream mediator of Akt activation induced by several stimuli (1Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J.

However, our observations that εKD both did not inhibit insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase and prevented Akt activation by a constitutively active mutant of PI 3-kinase indicate that εKD affects a signaling component that acts downstream of PI 3-kinase. PDK1 was originally identified as a kinase that phosphorylates Thr308 of Akt in vitro (20Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), and an unidentified kinase that phosphorylates Ser473 of Akt has been termed PDK2. We have now shown that overexpression of PDK1 induced the phosphorylation of Akt on both Thr308 and Ser473 in intact cells. PDK1 has been shown to phosphorylate Ser473 of Akt in vitro in the presence of a GST fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal region of PRK2 or of synthetic peptides that encompass this region of PRK2 (25Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that, in intact cells, PDK1 phosphorylates both Thr308 and Ser473 of Akt, which would explain why overexpression of PDK1 alone resulted in the activation of Akt. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that expression of PDK1 resulted in the activation of PDK2, and that PDK1 and PDK2 coordinately phosphorylate and activate Akt. We have shown that εKD inhibited PDK1-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt, suggesting that εKD affects the insulin signaling pathway at a step downstream of PDK1 action. PDK1 has been shown, at least in vitro, to phosphorylate not only Akt but various other kinases including p70 S6 kinase (44Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.

Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), all of which belong to the AGC family of protein kinases. Thus, the observation that εKD inhibited insulin-induced activity of SGK is also consistent with this hypothesis that εKD interfere with the insulin signaling at a step downstream of PDK1. Given that PKCε is a member of this family of kinases, it also might serve as a substrate for PDK1. However, it is not likely that εKD inhibits insulin-induced activation of Akt simply by competing with Akt for PDK1, because expression of wild-type PKCε did not inhibit this effect of insulin. The mechanism by which εKD inhibits the ability of PDK1 to activate Akt remains unclear. It is possible that endogenous PKCε phosphorylates an unidentified substrate that is important for the interaction between PDK1 and Akt, and that εKD exerts a dominant-negative effect on endogenous PKCε. Our observation that overexpression of wild-type PKCε or a constitutively active form of PKCε alone did not increase Akt activity in the absence of insulin may be explained if such a substrate is constitutively phosphorylated in cells, so that overexpression of the wild-type or a constitutively active enzyme would not alter the phosphorylation state of the substrate. The COOH-terminal region of PRK2, which includes a consensus sequence for a PDK2 phosphorylation site similar to that present in Akt with the exception that the residue equivalent to Ser473 is aspartic acid, modulates PDK1 activity (25Balendran A.

Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of PDK1 suggests the presence in the kinase domain of a hydrophobic pocket that interacts with this region of PRK2 (48Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A.

Given that PKCε also contains a sequence similar to the COOH-terminal region of PRK2, it is possible that εKD affects the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt by interacting with the hydrophobic pocket of PDK1. Whereas serine and threonine residues in the COOH-terminal region of wild-type PKCβII are phosphorylated in intact cells, those of a kinase-deficient mutant of the enzyme are not (49Behn-Krappa A.

Using stopped-flow fluorescence and presteady-state ATPase kinetics, we have determined the kinetic pathway of poly(C) RNA binding to Rho hexamer, both in the presence and in absence of ATP. These studies indicate a four-step sequential mechanism of RNA binding and reveal the respective roles of the primary and secondary RNA binding sites in initiation and ATPase activation of Rho. The primary RNA binding sites of Rho hexamer interact with poly(C) RNA at a diffusion-limited rate constant close to 8 × 108m−1s−1, resulting in the Rho-RNA species PR1, which subsequently isomerizes to PR2 with a rate constant 21 s−1. The PR2 isomerizes to PR3 with a rate constant of 32 s−1 in the presence of ATP, and the formation of PR4 from PR3 results in a species that is fully competent in hydrolyzing ATP at the RNA-stimulated rate. The PR3 to PR4 isomerization occurs at a relatively slow rate of 4.1 s−1; thus, the presteady-state ATPase kinetics show a distinct lag due to the slow initiation step. The interactions of the RNA with the primary sites trigger ring opening, and we propose that during the last two steps, the RNA migrates into the central channel and interacts with the secondary sites, resulting in the activation of the ATPase activity. The primary RNA binding sites, in addition to promoting sequence specific initiation, kinetically facilitate loading of the RNA into the secondary sites, which are relatively inaccessible, since they are present in the central channel.

These studies reveal common features used by hexameric helicases to bind nucleic acids in an efficient and specific manner. The Escherichia coli Rho protein is a transcription termination factor that assembles into a hexamer of six identical protein subunits arranged in a ring (1Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J.

The hexamer is the functional form of the Rho protein, and its biological role is to release specific nascent RNAs that contain the rut(Rho utilization) site from the transcription complex (3Roberts J.W.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.American Society for Microbiology Press. 1996; : 822-848Google Scholar). The Rho protein is homologous to hexameric helicases, containing an RNA-dependent ATPase activity and an helicase activity that can separate the strands of the RNA-DNA duplex in vitro (6Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell.. 1987; 48: 945-952Google Scholar). After the Rho protein initiates at specific sites on the RNA, it is believed to translocate along the RNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction coupled to ATP hydrolysis. The translocation and/or unwinding activity of Rho results in the disruption of the RNA-DNA duplex in the elongation complex, which releases the transcript and causes transcription termination (6Brennan C.A.

The primary RNA binding site residing in the N-terminal domain of Rho polypeptide has affinity for pyrimidine-rich nucleic acid. The structure of the N-terminal domain of Rho protein complexed with oligo(rC)9 has been determined (13Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 3: 487-493Google Scholar). These and other structural studies indicate that the primary RNA binding sites crown the Rho hexamer and are easily accessible for RNA binding (2Yu X.

The RNA has been proposed to wrap around the primary RNA binding sites of the Rho hexamer (13Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol.

Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol... 1988; 199: 609-622Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that the Rho hexamer contains a secondary RNA binding site that is distinct from the primary site (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1982; 257: 5760-5766Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 13947-13955Google Scholar, 12Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol.

Based on mutational and cross-linking studies, and the homology of Rho to the F1-ATPase, it has been proposed that the secondary RNA binding sites in the C-terminal domain reside within the central channel of hexamer ring (12Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol... 1995; 254: 815-837Google Scholar). This mode of RNA binding is similar to the mode of DNA binding employed by several hexameric helicases such as T7 gp4, E. coli DnaB, and T4 gp41 (18Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat.

Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Google Scholar). In Rho, the interactions of RNA with the secondary sites are necessary for ATPase activation (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1982; 257: 5760-5766Google Scholar).The goals of the studies presented here were to determine the kinetic pathway of RNA binding to the Rho hexamer and to elucidate the roles of the primary and secondary binding sites in the initiation process. We have used stopped-flow method to monitor RNA binding in real time by following the RNA-induced changes in the intrinsic protein fluorescence of the Rho protein. The observed kinetics indicated a multistep mechanism for RNA binding. The intrinsic rate constant of each step was determined by globally fitting the kinetic data at various RNA concentrations to a four-step model using numerical methods. The four-step sequential mechanism consisted of a diffusion-limited bimolecular binding of poly(C) RNA to the Rho hexamer, which we propose represents interactions with the primary RNA-binding site located on the outer surface of the ring. The subsequent slower conformational changes represent ring opening and passage of the RNA strand into the central channel of the opened Rho ring. Because the ATPase rate is stimulated only when the RNA interacts with the secondary sites, we were able to determine the kinetics of RNA binding to the secondary sites by following the presteady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. Conserved mechanisms of binding and initiation were revealed upon comparison of the mechanism of RNA binding of the Rho hexamer with the DNA binding mechanisms of hexameric helicases such as T7 gp4 (21Ahnert P. Picha K.M. Patel S.S. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 3418-3427Google Scholar) andE. coli DnaB (22Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 295: 831-852Google Scholar).RESULTSWe have investigated the transient state kinetics of RNA binding to E. coli Rho hexamer with the goal of elucidating both the mechanism of initiation and the roles of the primary and secondary binding sites in RNA binding. We used poly(C) RNA as the ligand because it is an established substrate that binds to the Rho hexamer with a high affinity (Kd of 1.0 nm) and stimulates the Rho ATPase nearly 105-fold (15McSwiggen J.A. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol... 1988; 199: 609-622Google Scholar, 28Lowery C. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1977; 252: 1381-1385Google Scholar). To follow the kinetic pathway of RNA binding in real time, we monitored the RNA-induced changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of Rho protein using the stopped-flow method. To determine when the Rho-RNA species becomes competent in ATPase activity, we measured the presteady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis using the chemical quenched-flow method. The kinetic data from both types of experiments were globally fit to a multistep RNA binding mechanism to obtain the intrinsic rate constants by solving the differential equations using numerical approaches.Rho Protein Fluorescence Changes Due to Poly(C) RNA BindingThe Rho protein contains a single tryptophan and seven tyrosine residues, and when excited at 290 nm, the Rho protein emits with a broad peak at about 355 nm, as shown in Fig.1. When poly(C) RNA was added to the Rho protein without ATP, the fluorescence intensity increased without any change in its maximum at 355 nm. When poly(C) RNA was added to the Rho-ATP complex, the fluorescence intensity decreased, without any change in the maximum. These results indicate that the structures of the Rho-RNA complexes with and without ATP are different. The observed fluorescence changes can be used to monitor the real time binding of poly(C) RNA to Rho hexamer, both with and without ATP.Stopped-flow Kinetics of Poly(C) Binding to Rho Hexamer in the Absence of ATPThe kinetics of poly(C) RNA binding to the Rho hexamer were monitored by mixing a solution of Rho (0.2 μm hexamer) with poly(C) RNA (0.3 μmpolymer) in a stopped-flow instrument and by measuring the time-dependent changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of Rho. Under the conditions of the experiment, the Rho protein is a stable hexamer (25Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 111-121Google Scholar). Fig. 2 Ashows the resulting trace, where the fluorescence of Rho increases in a time-dependent manner after mixing with the RNA. The kinetic trace fits best to the sum of two exponentials rather than one, as shown by the residuals in Fig. 2 A. The fast increase in Rho protein fluorescence occurred with an exponential rate constant of 148 s−1 and the slower change occurred with an exponential rate constant of 4.62 s−1. Control experiments showed no time-dependent protein fluorescence changes when the Rho protein was mixed with the buffer solution.Figure 2Stopped-flow kinetics of Rho protein interaction with poly(C) RNA in the absence of ATP. A, Rho protein (0.10 μm hexamer) was mixed with poly(C) RNA (0.15 μm polymer) in buffer B at 18 °C in a stopped-flow instrument. The time-dependent changes in Rho protein fluorescence upon excitation at 290 nm were measured. The kinetics fit best to the two exponential equation (Equation 2) with rates of the two phases, k1 = 147.6 ± 9.3 s−1 and k2 = 4.62 ± 0.91 s−1 (A1 = 0.242 and A2 = 0.0595) as shown by the residual plots.B, the kinetic traces of RNA binding were measured at constant Rho (0.1 μm hexamer) and increasing poly(C) RNA concentration. The resulting kinetic traces are shown in log time scale. The solid lines are the fits to the three-step RNA binding mechanism, shown in Table I. C, the kinetics traces in B were fit to the sum of two exponentials (Equation 2). The fast rate constant (k1) was plotted against poly(C) RNA polymer concentration. The linear increase occurred with a slope of 7.46 ± 0.72 × 108m−1 s−1and an intercept of 11.0 s−1. D, the slower rate constant (k2) increased hyperbolically with RNA concentration and fit to a hyperbola (Equation3) with a K12 of 50 nm, a maximum rate of 4.7 ± 0.6 s−1, and a yintercept of 1.2 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the kinetic pathway of poly(C) RNA binding to the Rho hexamer, the above stopped-flow experiments were performed at various RNA concentrations. A constant amount of Rho (0.2 μmhexamer) was mixed with poly(C) RNA at varying concentrations (100–600 nm polymer). The resulting time-dependent protein fluorescence changes were recorded and shown in Fig.2 B. The kinetic data were analyzed in two ways. First, the kinetics traces were fit to the sum of two exponentials (Equation 2), and the exponential rate constants were plotted versus the poly(C) RNA polymer concentration to obtain the dependences, shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The analysis of these dependences provided evidence for a two-step RNA binding mechanism and provided approximate rate constants for the steps in the pathway. Second, rigorous analysis was carried out by globally fitting the kinetic data at varying RNA concentrations to the multistep kinetic model using numerical approaches, which is described below. The plot of the observed rate constant of the first exponential phase (k1) versus [RNA] showed a linear dependence (Fig. 2 C). This dependence indicated that a stable Rho-RNA species whose fluorescence was greater than free Rho protein was formed after the bimolecular event. The rate constant for the bimolecular binding event was estimated from the slope that was equal to 7.5 × 108m−1 s−1. The rate constant of the second phase (k2) increased in a hyperbolic manner with [RNA] and reached a plateau at high poly(C) RNA (Fig. 2 D). The hyperbolic dependence provided evidence for a conformational change in the Rho-RNA complex following the bimolecular encounter. The saturation at about 4.7 s−1 provided an estimate for the rate constant of this conformational change. Thus, the fluorescence stopped-flow studies indicated a minimal two-step mechanism for RNA binding consisting of a bimolecular association between Rho and poly(C) RNA followed by an isomerization step.We next attempted to globally fit the kinetic data at various RNA concentrations to a two-step sequential mechanism using the Scientist program that uses numerical methods to solve the differential equations that describe the mechanism. The global fitting procedure is described briefly under “Experimental Procedures” and in more detail elsewhere (29Picha K.M. Ahnert P. Patel S.S. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6401-6409Google Scholar). We were not able to obtain a global fit with the two-step mechanism. Therefore, a three-step mechanism was used as the model, which provided a good fit with the intrinsic rate constants shown in Table I. This mechanism showed that the Rho hexamer interacts with the RNA polymer to form PR1 at a diffusion-limited rate constant k1 = 7.5 × 108m−1s−1, and the complex dissociates with a rate constant of 12.0 s−1. The collision complex PR1 isomerizes to PR2 at a forward rate of k2 = 26.2 s−1 and a reverse rate ofk−2 = 2.8 s−1. The PR2 subsequently converts to PR3 at a relatively slow rate,k3 = 5.0 s−1. There was no detectable rate (k−3) for the conversion of PR3 to PR2.Table IThree-step mechanism of poly(C) RNA binding to E. coli Rho in the absence or presence of ATPP+R⇄k−1k1PR1⇄k−2k2PR2⇄k−3k3PR3k1k−1k2k−2k3k−3m−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1Without ATP7.47 ± 0.14 × 10812.0 ± 0.7726.2 ± 1.532.81 ± 0.865.00 ± 0.46<0.02With ATP8.51 ± 0.13 × 10822.9 ± 1.2320.5 ± 0.771.58 ± 1.5131.2 ± 1.930.025 ± 0.013 Open table in a new tab Stopped-flow Kinetics of Poly(C) Binding to Rho Hexamer in the Presence of ATPPrevious studies have shown that ATP increases the affinity of Rho protein for RNA (30Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Google Scholar). Under equilibrium conditions, in the absence of RNA, the Rho hexamer binds three or four ATP molecules with very little hydrolysis (31Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 11130-11137Google Scholar). The kinetics of RNA binding to Rho-ATP complex were therefore measured by mixing poly(C) RNA (0.1 μm) with Rho protein (0.1 μm hexamer, final concentration) containing 3.0 mm ATP in buffer B, in a stopped-flow instrument. The fluorescence changes in the Rho protein upon RNA binding were monitored in the rapid time scale and shown in Fig. 3 A. The initial interactions of the Rho hexamer with RNA led to an increase in fluorescence at a rapid rate, and a subsequent conformational change decreased Rho protein fluorescence. The increase and decrease in protein fluorescence with time were fit to the sum of two exponentials with rate constants, 118 s−1 and 17.4 s−1, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Note that the observed rate constants of the fast phases are almost the same, with or without ATP, but the rate constant of the second phase with ATP is about 4 times faster.Figure 3Stopped-flow kinetics of Rho protein interaction with poly(C) RNA in the presence of ATP. A, the Rho protein (0.10 μm hexamer, final concentration) and ATP (3 mm) in buffer B were mixed with poly(C) RNA (0.10 μm) at 18 °C in a stopped-flow instrument, and the fluorescence of Rho was measured after mixing upon excitation at 290 nm. The resulting kinetics showed two phases, and the residuals show best fit to the sum of two exponentials (Equation 2) withk1 = 117.6 ± 8.8 s−1 and k2 = 17.4 ± 1.7 s−1 (A1 = 0.31 and A2 = 0.137). B, the RNA binding kinetics were measured at constant Rho protein (0.1 μmhexamer) and increasing poly(C) RNA, and the resulting kinetic traces are shown in the log time scale. The solid black lines are the fit to the three-step RNA binding mechanism with ATP, shown in Table I. C, the kinetics traces inB were fit to the sum of two exponentials (Equation 2). The fast rate constant (k1) increased linearly with increasing [RNA] with a slope of 8.6 ± 0.42 × 108m−1s−1 and an intercept of 24.4 ± 6.5 s−1. D, the observed rates of the second phase increased hyperbolically with the RNA concentration and fit to a hyperbola (Equation 3) with a K12 of 57 nm and a maximum rate of 31.5 ± 5.6 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the mechanism of RNA binding in the presence of ATP, the fluorescence stopped-flow studies were carried out at constant Rho and varying poly(C) RNA concentrations. The final concentrations of the Rho hexamer and poly(C) RNA were 0.1 μm and 50–200 nm, respectively. The kinetic data were collected up to 1.0 s, and during this period the amount of ATP hydrolyzed was less than 10 μm. Hence, the concentration of ATP substrate did not change during the course of our measurements. The kinetic data (Fig. 3 B) were fit to the sum of two exponentials and globally fit to a kinetic model using numerical approaches. The rate of the fast phase increased linearly with increasing [RNA] with a slope of 8.5 × 108m−1 s−1(Fig. 3 C), which represents the bimolecular rate of RNA binding to the Rho-ATP complex. Note that this rate is very close to the rate of RNA binding in the absence of ATP. The rate of the second phase increased in a hyperbolic manner with RNA concentration (Fig.3 D). The hyperbolic fit (Equation 3) provided a maximum rate of 31.5 s−1, which is about 6 times faster than the rate measured in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2 D). Thus, ATP has no effect on the initial encounter of the RNA with the Rho hexamer, but ATP does facilitate the subsequent conformational change.The RNA binding kinetics with ATP at varying [RNA] also fit best to a sequential three-step RNA binding model rather than a two-step model. The global fit was carried out as described above using the program Scientist. The solid black lines in Fig. 3 B are the resulting fits to the three-step RNA binding mechanism, shown in Table I. The derived intrinsic rate constants indicate that the initial bimolecular association of Rho-ATP complex and RNA result in PR1 with k1 = 8.5 × 108m−1s−1 and k−1 = 22.9 s−1. The conversion of PR1 to PR2 occurs at a rate constant, k2, of 20.5 s−1 and a reverse rate constant,k−2, of 1.6 s−1, which is close to the k2 andk−2 in the absence of ATP. The PR2 is converted to PR3 at a rate constant, k3, of 31.2 s−1, which is 6 times faster than the rate of the corresponding step in the absence of ATP. Therefore, ATP does not affect the first and second steps of RNA binding, but ATP does accelerate the third step.The Presteady-state Kinetics of ATP HydrolysisThe above stopped-flow fluorescence studies show that at least three Rho-RNA species, PR1, PR2, and PR3, are formed during the process of RNA binding to the Rho hexamer, and the global analysis provides the rate constants of each step. To fully understand the mechanism of RNA binding, one however needs to know the structures of the Rho-RNA complexes that accumulate during the reaction. Unfortunately, at present, the protein fluorescence changes cannot be interpreted in terms of the structures of the complexes, and other studies are necessary. Several studies have shown that Rho contains two classes of nucleic acid binding sites, the primary and the secondary RNA-binding sites (11Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 13947-13955Google Scholar, 32Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 4182-4189Google Scholar). The primary RNA binding site is accessible, whereas the secondary site is proposed to lie within the central channel (12Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol... 1995; 254: 815-837Google Scholar). It is also known that the steady-state ATPase activity of Rho is stimulated only when RNA interacts with the secondary RNA-binding sites (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1982; 257: 5760-5766Google Scholar). Thus, RNA needs to travel and bind within the central channel of the Rho hexamer to activate the steady-state ATPase activity (12Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol... 1995; 254: 815-837Google Scholar, 16Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 1251-1254Google Scholar). We therefore measured the presteady-state ATPase activity of the Rho protein during the period of RNA binding to determine when Rho protein made stable interactions with the secondary RNA binding sites. These kinetic studies allowed us to determine the kinetics of RNA binding to the secondary sites and to speculate on the structures of the intermediate Rho-RNA species.The Rho protein was preincubated with a mixture of ATP and [α-32P]ATP for 5 or 10 s and then rapidly mixed with poly(C) RNA (Fig. 4 A). The formation of ADP after varying times of incubation with the RNA was measured, and the resulting data are shown in Fig. 4 B. Initially, three ATPs per hexamer were hydrolyzed at a rate, >150 s−1. This burst of ATP hydrolysis was followed by a kinetic lag of 0.3 s, during which time no ATP hydrolysis was observed. The same 0.3-s lag was observed also when the experiments were carried out at various ATP concentrations ranging from 50 μm to 1 mm. After the 0.3-s lag, ATP was hydrolyzed with linear kinetics at the expected poly(C) RNA-stimulated steady-state rate. Comparison of the kinetics of Rho-RNA species (PRi) formation (dictated by the rate constants determined from the stopped-flow studies) with the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis, in the same time period, indicated that the burst of ATP hydrolysis coincided with the formation of PR1. This suggests that the initial encounter of poly(C) RNA with the Rho-ATP complex results in the hydrolysis of three ATP molecules. The subsequent lag in ADP formation indicates that the PR1 species is not competent in turning over ATP or catalyzing multiple ATPase turnovers at the RNA-stimulated steady-state rate. The kinetic lag indicates that the formation of the Rho-RNA species that is competent in catalyzing multiple turnovers of ATP hydrolysis occurs at a slower rate.Figure 4The presteady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. A, the diagram shows the design of the three-syringe acid-quenched experiment. The Rho protein (3.0 μm hexamer) was mixed with [α-32P]ATP and Mg-ATP (1.0 mm) for 5 or 10 s (t1) in buffer B at 18 °C. Subsequently, the Rho-ATP complex was mixed with the poly(C) RNA (1.34 μmpolymer), and the reaction was quenched after varying times (t2). B, the presteady-state ATP hydrolysis kinetic experiments were repeated five times, and the average data are shown. The solid line is the fit to the four-step RNA binding mechanism, shown in Table II. In this mechanism, three ATPs per hexamer were initially hydrolyzed by PR1 at a fast rate of 163 s−1, and only PR4 was capable of hydrolyzing ATP at the RNA-stimulated rate of 30 s−1. The dashed lineshows the predicted curve for a mechanism in which PR3 and PR4 hydrolyzed ATP at the poly(C) RNA-stimulated rate of 30 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The next task was to determine which of the Rho-RNA species, PR2 and/or PR3, were ATPase-competent. We used the three-step sequential mechanism of RNA binding and the rate constants derived from the stopped-flow studies to simulate the ATPase kinetics, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the model where PR1, PR2, and PR3 were all capable of hydrolyzing ATP, no lag kinetics were predicted. When PR2 and PR3 or when PR3 alone was ATPase-competent, then the predicted lag was too short, as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 4 B. These kinetic simulations indicated that PR3 was not competent in hydrolyzing ATP and needed to be converted to PR4 to hydrolyze ATP at the RNA-stimulated rate. Thus, a PR3 to PR4 isomerization step was added to the three-step mechanism, and the ATPase kinetics were fit to a four-step sequential RNA-binding mechanism to obtain the rate of PR3 to PR4 conversion (TableII). To fit the ATPase kinetics, we invoked that the first Rho-RNA species, PR1, hydrolyzed three ATPs at a fast rate, but only the last species in the pathway (PR4) was capable of catalyzing ATPase turnover at the poly(C) RNA-stimulated rate. Eventually, both the ATPase kinetics and the fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic traces, shown in Fig. 3, were fit globally to the four-step RNA binding model to obtain a consistent set of intrinsic rate constants, shown in Table II. The intrinsic rate constants of the first three steps did not change significantly, and the global fit provided the PR3 to PR4 conversion rate of 4.1 s−1.Kinetic Simulation of the Four-step RNA Binding MechanismThe formation and decay of the various Rho-RNA intermediates were simulated using the RNA binding mechanism, shown in Table II, that was derived from the stopped-flow and the ATPase kinetics. This exercise helps one visualize the formation and decay of the various Rho-RNA intermediates and to determine which species would accumulate during the reaction. The kinetic simulation (Fig.5 A) shows that PR2 is a transient intermediate that accumulates to a lesser amount relative to PR1 and PR3. Based on the finding that the primary sites on Rho are accessible (2Yu X. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 299: 1279-1287Google Scholar, 32Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 4182-4189Google Scholar), we propose that PR1 and PR2 are species where the RNA is bound to the primary binding sites (Fig.6). The intermediate PR3 accumulates between 0.1 and 0.2 s, and thus the formation of PR4 is delayed by about 0.3 s. The onset of steady-state ATP hydrolysis activity at the poly(C) RNA-stimulated rate coincides with the time course of the appearance of the PR4. Because only PR4 is capable of hydrolyzing ATP at the poly(C) RNA-stimulated rate, we propose that the RNA in this species is bound stably to the secondary RNA-binding site in the central channel of Rho hexamer. Thus, the"

In the present study, we present the first evidence of a protein kinase identified in rat cerebral cortex/hippocampus that is activated by InsP6. The substrate for the InsP6-regulated protein kinase was found to be the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, pacsin/syndapin I. This brain-specific protein, which is highly enriched at nerve terminals, is proposed to act as a molecular link coupling components of the synaptic vesicle endocytic machinery to the cytoskeleton. We show here that the association between pacsin/syndapin I and dynamin I can be increased by InsP6-dependent phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I.

InsP3 has an established second messenger role in mobilizing intracellular calcium stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar) and can be phosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4), which is proposed to play a role in capacitative calcium entry (2Irvine R.F. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 161-185PubMed Google Scholar) and as an activator of ras-GAP activity (3Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The sequential dephosphorylation of InsP3 and InsP4gives rise to a host of inositol phosphate isomers in a cyclic metabolic pathway that results in inositol returning to the phosphoinositide pool (4Shears S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).In contrast to this well understood signaling pathway the role of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), the most abundant cellular inositol metabolite, is very poorly understood. Present at concentrations 10–100 times greater than InsP3 (15–60 μm) (5Szwergold B.S. Graham R.A. Brown T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6Pittet D. Schlegel W. Lew D.P. Monod A. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18483-18489Google Scholar), InsP6 has long been thought of as metabolically rather inert with levels that do not change in response to cell surface receptor activation. However, the discovery of higher phosphorylated forms of InsP6 has led to the realization that the InsP6 pool is rapidly turning over in a continual cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (7Menniti F.S.

Furthermore, a role for InsP6 in synaptic vesicle trafficking has emerged from studies showing that InsP6 binds with high affinity to a number of proteins that are involved in exo/endocytosis including the clathrin assembly proteins AP2 and AP3 and the synaptic vesicle calcium-sensing protein synaptotagmin (9Voglmaier S.M.

We found that the pacsin/syndapin I, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein that acts as a molecular link coupling the endocytic machinery to the cytoskeleton, is phosphorylated by a protein kinase that is regulated by InsP6. In addition, InsP6-regulated phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I increases the interaction between pacsin/syndapin I and dynamin I. These data provide a novel model by which InsP6 can regulate synaptic vesicle endocytosis.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have shown that the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, pacsin/syndapin I, is phosphorylated by a novel protein kinase that is regulated by InsP6. Furthermore, InsP6-dependent phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I increases the ability of pacsin/syndapin I to interact with dynamin I.The strategy we adopted for the discovery of the InsP6-regulated protein kinase and its protein substrate was based on the hypothesis that many signaling proteins form complexes with each other that are robust enough to allow them to be co-purified. This phenomenon has been described for the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, which forms a so-called “signal transduction particle” with PLCγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, GAP, and raf (15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). Other signal tranduction protein kinases, such as those of the MAP kinase pathway, form signaling complexes that require the presence of scaffolding proteins (16Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In the present study we analyzed chromatographic fractions from rat brain for the presence of co-purifying InsP6-regulated protein kinase and its substrate proteins. We found that a 52-kDa protein eluting from an anion exchange column was phosphorylated in response to InsP6. This protein was determined to be the synaptic vesicle protein, pacsin/syndapin I, on the basis of MALDI-TOF and amino acid sequence analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments. The identification of the phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I is the first demonstration of a protein phosphorylation that is regulated by InsP6. We are currently using the InsP6-dependent phosphorylation of the GST-pacsin/syndapin I fusion protein in an assay to purify the InsP6-regulated protein kinase.Pacsin/syndapin I is a 52-kDa protein that is highly enriched in brain and associated with presynaptic terminals where it co-localizes with dynamin I (14Plomann M. Lange R. Vopper G. Cremer H. Heinlein U.A.O. Scheff S. Baldwin S.A. Leitges M. Cramer M. Paulsson M. Barthels D. Eur. J.

In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that the SH3 domain of pacsin/syndapin I is able to bind to the proline-rich C terminus of dynamin I, as well as a number of other brain-specific proteins including synaptojanin, synapsin Ia/Ib and the neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (17Qualmann B.

Cell Sci..EMBOJ. 2011; 113: 4511-4521Google Scholar). These proteins are known to form part of the multicomponent protein complex involved in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling at nerve terminals (20Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).The assembly of this multiprotein complex has been demonstrated to be regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle that is controlled by calcium entry at the nerve terminal (21Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.-C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of synaptic vesicle proteins such as dynamin I, synaptojanin and amphiphysin results in a decreased ability of these proteins to associate with other synaptic vesicle endocytic proteins. Assembly of the endocytic machinery occurs on calcium entry via dephosphorylation mediated by the calcium-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin (21Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.-C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our data indicate the presence of an additional novel mechanism in the regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytsis where InsP6-mediated phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I is able to increase the ability of pacsin/syndapin I to interact with dynamin I. This process may either contribute to the assembly of the endocytic machinery or tether the endocytic multiprotein complex to the cytoskeleton.Our study, therefore, adds to a growing body of evidence to suggest that InsP6 is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and membrane trafficking. The clathrin assembly proteins AP2 and AP3, together with the visual and non-visual arrestins and synaptotagmin, have been shown to bind InsP6 with high affinity (9Voglmaier S.M. Keen J.H.

The binding of InsP6 to these proteins regulates their interaction with the endo/exocytic pathways. The present study extends a role for InsP6 in endocytosis by demonstrating that InsP6-dependent phosphorylation is a mechanism that can increase the interaction between specific endocytic proteins.The discovery of an InsP6-regulated protein kinase supports a signaling role for this inositol polyphosphate. Importantly, none of the lower inositol phosphates stimulated kinase activity. Furthermore, kinase activity was not stimulated by the polyphosphoinositides. This is of significance because a number of high affinity InsP6-binding proteins have also been shown to bind the polyphosphoinositides, and it is in fact the binding of polyphosphoinositides that is thought in some instances to be the physiological regulators of these proteins (11Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Hao W. Tan Z. Prasad K. Reddy K.K. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Flack J.R. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6393-6398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also tested the ability of the inositol pyrophosphates to stimulate kinase activity. Both isomers of PP-InsP5 stimulated kinase activity with a concentration-response curve that was very similar to InsP6. Thus, the InsP6-regulated protein kinase is activated by inositol that contains a phosphate group on all 6 positions of the inositol ring and that addition of a further phosphate to make a pyrophosphate at positions 5 or 2 does not change the activation profile. It is, therefore, possible that both InsP6 and/or 5-PP-InsP5 could be the physiological activators of the protein kinase identified here. However, it is interesting to note that the concentration-response curve for InsP6 is consistent with a protein kinase that would be expected to respond to cellular concentrations of InsP6, which are thought to be in the μmrange (5Szwergold B.S. Graham R.A. Brown T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6Pittet D. Schlegel W. Lew D.P. Monod A. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18483-18489Google Scholar).Early work on InsP6 demonstrated that it is ubiquitously present at high cellular levels, and it was thought to be involved in metal ion chelation or act as a phosphate store (25Hughes P.J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, studies demonstrating that InsP6 levels can change in response to receptor stimulation suggested that InsP6 may have a signaling role (27Guse A.H. Greiner E. Emmrich F. Brand K. J. Biol.

Our studies demonstrating the presence of a protein kinase that is specifically activated by InsP6 adds a novel signaling pathway for this inositol polyphosphate. A large number of G-protein-coupled and growth factor receptors activate phospholipase C to stimulate the hydrolysis of the phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)1 and diacylglycerol. InsP3 has an established second messenger role in mobilizing intracellular calcium stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar) and can be phosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4), which is proposed to play a role in capacitative calcium entry (2Irvine R.F.

The sequential dephosphorylation of InsP3 and InsP4gives rise to a host of inositol phosphate isomers in a cyclic metabolic pathway that results in inositol returning to the phosphoinositide pool (4Shears S.B.

In contrast to this well understood signaling pathway the role of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), the most abundant cellular inositol metabolite, is very poorly understood. Present at concentrations 10–100 times greater than InsP3 (15–60 μm) (5Szwergold B.S. Graham R.A. Brown T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6Pittet D. Schlegel W. Lew D.P. Monod A. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18483-18489Google Scholar), InsP6 has long been thought of as metabolically rather inert with levels that do not change in response to cell surface receptor activation. However, the discovery of higher phosphorylated forms of InsP6 has led to the realization that the InsP6 pool is rapidly turning over in a continual cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (7Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stephens L. Radenberg T. Thiel U. Vogel G. Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Jackson T.R.

Furthermore, a role for InsP6 in synaptic vesicle trafficking has emerged from studies showing that InsP6 binds with high affinity to a number of proteins that are involved in exo/endocytosis including the clathrin assembly proteins AP2 and AP3 and the synaptic vesicle calcium-sensing protein synaptotagmin (9Voglmaier S.M.

We found that the pacsin/syndapin I, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein that acts as a molecular link coupling the endocytic machinery to the cytoskeleton, is phosphorylated by a protein kinase that is regulated by InsP6. In addition, InsP6-regulated phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I increases the interaction between pacsin/syndapin I and dynamin I. These data provide a novel model by which InsP6 can regulate synaptic vesicle endocytosis. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have shown that the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, pacsin/syndapin I, is phosphorylated by a novel protein kinase that is regulated by InsP6. Furthermore, InsP6-dependent phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I increases the ability of pacsin/syndapin I to interact with dynamin I.The strategy we adopted for the discovery of the InsP6-regulated protein kinase and its protein substrate was based on the hypothesis that many signaling proteins form complexes with each other that are robust enough to allow them to be co-purified. This phenomenon has been described for the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, which forms a so-called “signal transduction particle” with PLCγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, GAP, and raf (15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). Other signal tranduction protein kinases, such as those of the MAP kinase pathway, form signaling complexes that require the presence of scaffolding proteins (16Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In the present study we analyzed chromatographic fractions from rat brain for the presence of co-purifying InsP6-regulated protein kinase and its substrate proteins. We found that a 52-kDa protein eluting from an anion exchange column was phosphorylated in response to InsP6. This protein was determined to be the synaptic vesicle protein, pacsin/syndapin I, on the basis of MALDI-TOF and amino acid sequence analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments. The identification of the phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I is the first demonstration of a protein phosphorylation that is regulated by InsP6. We are currently using the InsP6-dependent phosphorylation of the GST-pacsin/syndapin I fusion protein in an assay to purify the InsP6-regulated protein kinase.Pacsin/syndapin I is a 52-kDa protein that is highly enriched in brain and associated with presynaptic terminals where it co-localizes with dynamin I (14Plomann M.

In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that the SH3 domain of pacsin/syndapin I is able to bind to the proline-rich C terminus of dynamin I, as well as a number of other brain-specific proteins including synaptojanin, synapsin Ia/Ib and the neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (17Qualmann B.

Cell Sci..EMBOJ. 2011; 113: 4511-4521Google Scholar). These proteins are known to form part of the multicomponent protein complex involved in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling at nerve terminals (20Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).The assembly of this multiprotein complex has been demonstrated to be regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle that is controlled by calcium entry at the nerve terminal (21Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.-C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of synaptic vesicle proteins such as dynamin I, synaptojanin and amphiphysin results in a decreased ability of these proteins to associate with other synaptic vesicle endocytic proteins. Assembly of the endocytic machinery occurs on calcium entry via dephosphorylation mediated by the calcium-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin (21Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.-C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Our data indicate the presence of an additional novel mechanism in the regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytsis where InsP6-mediated phosphorylation of pacsin/syndapin I is able to increase the ability of pacsin/syndapin I to interact with dynamin I. This process may either contribute to the assembly of the endocytic machinery or tether the endocytic multiprotein complex to the cytoskeleton.Our study, therefore, adds to a growing body of evidence to suggest that InsP6 is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and membrane trafficking. The clathrin assembly proteins AP2 and AP3, together with the visual and non-visual arrestins and synaptotagmin, have been shown to bind InsP6 with high affinity (9Voglmaier S.M. Keen J.H.

The binding of InsP6 to these proteins regulates their interaction with the endo/exocytic pathways. The present study extends a role for InsP6 in endocytosis by demonstrating that InsP6-dependent phosphorylation is a mechanism that can increase the interaction between specific endocytic proteins.The discovery of an InsP6-regulated protein kinase supports a signaling role for this inositol polyphosphate. Importantly, none of the lower inositol phosphates stimulated kinase activity. Furthermore, kinase activity was not stimulated by the polyphosphoinositides. This is of significance because a number of high affinity InsP6-binding proteins have also been shown to bind the polyphosphoinositides, and it is in fact the binding of polyphosphoinositides that is thought in some instances to be the physiological regulators of these proteins (11Gaidarov I.

We also tested the ability of the inositol pyrophosphates to stimulate kinase activity. Both isomers of PP-InsP5 stimulated kinase activity with a concentration-response curve that was very similar to InsP6. Thus, the InsP6-regulated protein kinase is activated by inositol that contains a phosphate group on all 6 positions of the inositol ring and that addition of a further phosphate to make a pyrophosphate at positions 5 or 2 does not change the activation profile. It is, therefore, possible that both InsP6 and/or 5-PP-InsP5 could be the physiological activators of the protein kinase identified here. However, it is interesting to note that the concentration-response curve for InsP6 is consistent with a protein kinase that would be expected to respond to cellular concentrations of InsP6, which are thought to be in the μmrange (5Szwergold B.S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 18483-18489Google Scholar).Early work on InsP6 demonstrated that it is ubiquitously present at high cellular levels, and it was thought to be involved in metal ion chelation or act as a phosphate store (25Hughes P.J.

https://openalex.org/W1977208266,"The MgCl2-induced folding of defined 12-mer nucleosomal arrays, in which ubiquitinated histone H2A (uH2A) replaced H2A, was analyzed by quantitative agarose gel electrophoresis and analytical centrifugation. Both types of analysis showed that uH2A arrays attained a degree of compaction similar to that of control arrays in 2 mM MgCl2. These results indicate that attachment of ubiquitin to H2A has little effect on the ability of nucleosomal arrays to form higher order folded structures in the ionic conditions tested. In contrast, uH2A arrays were found to oligomerize at lower MgCl2 concentrations than control nucleosomal arrays, suggesting that histone ubiquitination may play a role in nucleosomal fiber association."
https://openalex.org/W1509646835,"Receptor-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport is dependent on the GTPase Ran and Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1). The acidic C terminus of Ran is required for high affinity interaction between Ran and RanBP1. We found that a novel Ran mutant with four of its five acidic C-terminal amino acids modified to alanine (RanC4A) has an ∼20-fold reduced affinity for RanBP1. We investigated the effects of RanC4A on nuclear import and export in permeabilized HeLa cells. Although RanC4A promotes accumulation of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 at the cytoplasmic nucleoporin Nup214, it strongly stimulates nuclear export of GFP-NFAT. Since RanC4A exhibits an elevated affinity for CRM1 and other nuclear transport receptors, this suggests that formation of the export complex containing CRM1, Ran-GTP, and substrate is a rate-limiting step in export, not release from Nup214. Conversely, importin α/β-dependent nuclear import of bovine serum albumin, coupled to a classical nuclear localization sequence is strongly inhibited by RanC4A. Inhibition can be reversed by additional importin α, which promotes the formation of an importin α/β complex. These results provide physiological evidence that release of Ran-GTP from importin β by RanBP1 and importin α is critical for the recycling of importin β to a transport-competent state.

Molecular transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs),1 large supramolecular structures that span the nuclear envelope (for review, see Refs. 1Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and2Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Small molecules such as ions and metabolites cross the NPC by passive diffusion. In contrast, most macromolecules are transported through the NPC by signal- and energy-dependent processes. Much of the signal-dependent nucleocytoplasmic transport is mediated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling receptor proteins of the importin β/karyopherin β family. These receptors are thought to transfer their cargoes between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by sequentially interacting with a series of NPC proteins (nucleoporins; for review, see Refs. 3Görlich D.

Transport mediated by importin/karyopherin β-type transport receptors is dependent on the small GTPase Ran, which shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (3Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Due to the segregation of the RanGEF in the nucleus and the RanGAP in the cytoplasm, the GTP-bound form of Ran is thought to be concentrated in the nucleus and the GDP-bound form in the cytoplasm. Ran-GTP, which binds to all importin β-type import receptors, promotes the association of cargoes with export receptors and the dissociation of cargoes from import receptors in vitro and thus appears to regulate receptor loading and unloading in the nucleus (see below). The best characterized nuclear import pathway involves cargo proteins carrying a basic amino acid-rich nuclear localization sequence (NLS). A trimeric import complex is formed by the binding of the cargo to the adapter protein importin α, which interacts with the import receptor importin β via its importin β-binding (IBB) domain (3Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). After the import complex is translocated to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran-GTP is thought to dissociate importin α from importin β and importin β from nucleoporins. The resulting Ran-GTP-importin β complex is exported back to the cytoplasm, whereas importin α is recycled to the cytoplasm by the export receptor CAS (5Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In the most extensively studied nuclear protein export pathway, Ran-GTP and a cargo protein containing a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) bind cooperatively to the export receptor CRM1 (6Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 7Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). After translocation of this trimeric export complex to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, RanBP1 and the related Ran-GTP binding domains of the nucleoporin Nup358/RanBP2 are thought to disassemble the export complex (8Bischoff F.R. Görlich D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as well as release it from a terminal cytoplasmic nucleoporin in the pathway, Nup214/CAN (10Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). RanBP1 is a cytosolic protein that further enhances the rate of GTP hydrolysis on free Ran-GTP that is stimulated by the GTPase-activating protein RanGAP (11Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 12Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). When Ran-GTP is complexed with import or export receptors, such as occurs when import receptors are recycled or export complexes are translocated to the cytoplasm, the Ran-GTP is GAP-insensitive. In this case, RanBP1 strongly promotes GTPase stimulation by RanGAP because it releases Ran-GTP from the receptors (8Bischoff F.R. Görlich D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, RanBP1 may play a crucial role in the termination of nuclear export reactions in the cytoplasm by promoting the dissociation of Ran from the receptors and, as a consequence, the hydrolysis of Ran-GTP. An acidic stretch at the C terminus of Ran is important for its interaction with RanBP1, since a mutant in which the last six amino acids of Ran are removed (RanΔDEDDDL; RanΔC) does not interact with Ran-GTP and RanBP1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (13Ren M. Villamarin A. Shih A. Coutavas E. Moore M.S. LoCurcio M. Clarke V. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32834-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, RanΔC has a greatly reduced affinity for RanBP1 in solution (15Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Villa Braslavsky C.I. Nowak C. Görlich D. Wittinghofer A. Kuhlmann J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whereas the acidic tail of Ran strongly promotes the interaction with RanBP1, it is inhibitory for binding to importin β (14Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32834-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Villa Braslavsky C.I. Nowak C. Görlich D. Wittinghofer A. Kuhlmann J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), perhaps due to competition with an acidic loop in importin β for binding to a basic patch on Ran (17Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Görlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We have characterized a novel Ran mutant, RanC4A, which has four of its five C-terminal acidic residues exchanged with alanine (18Assheuer R. Mutational Structure-Function Analysis of the Nuclear GTPase Ran. Ph.D. thesis. University of Bochum, Bochum, Germany1997Google Scholar), to examine the role of Ran-RanBP1 interactions in nuclear import and exportin vitro. As RanΔC, RanC4A has a reduced affinity for RanBP1 and an increased affinity for importin β and also for CRM1. Using well established in vitro nuclear transport systems, we show that RanC4A strongly stimulates CRM1-mediated nuclear export of GFP-NFAT, whereas it inhibits importin α-dependent nuclear import by importin β. Our findings shed light on rate-limiting steps of CRM1-mediated export and provide physiological evidence for a role of RanBP1 in the recycling of import receptors. HeLa cells were grown on either plastic dishes or coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or in suspension in Joklik's modified S-MEM.

The intrinsic GTPase activity was measured by reverse-phase HPLC analysis (21Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 400 μmRan-GTP was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithioerythritol, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at regular intervals and applied to HPLC analysis to measure the protein-bound GTP and GDP concentration. The HPLC data were expressed as ln((GTP + GDP)/GTP) and plotted as a function of time. The GTP hydrolysis rate,kcat (min−1), was calculated by linear regression of the data with Kaleidagraph 3.0.5 (Synergy Software). The RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of Ran analyzed in Table I was measured by radioactive filter assays as described previously (30Becker J. Melchior F. Gerke V. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H.

The GST-RanBP1-Ran interaction was analyzed by determining the dissociation constant Kd =koff/kon using fluorescence spectroscopy (15Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The association kinetics were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions with 200 nmRan-mant-Gpp(NH)p and increasing concentrations of GST-RanBP1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 μm). The signal of the Ran-bound fluorescence-labeled nonhydrolyzable GTP analog mant-Gpp(NH)p (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 440 nm) was followed in a SX16MV stopped flow system (Applied Photophysics). The kinetic constantkon of the Ran-GST-RanBP1 association was calculated with Kaleidagraph 3.0.5 (Synergy Software) as described previously (15Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A.

For the measurement of the dissociation kinetics (koff), a 1:1 complex between 200 nmRan-mant-Gpp(NH)p and GST-RanBP1 was generated in 20 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithioerythritol, in a titration experiment at 25 °C. The titration was followed in a SPEX Fluoromax fluorescence spectrometer (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 440 nm; Ref. 15Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After formation of the GST-RanBP1-Ran complex, it was dissociated by adding a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled RanGpp(NH)p. The data of the dissociation reaction were fitted as first-order exponentials with Kaleidagraph 3.0.5 to calculate the kinetic constant koff. The two kinetic constants were used to calculate the equilibrium constant Kd =koff/kon, which characterizes the affinity between Ran and RanBP1. For the analysis of the Ran-RCC1 interaction, different Ran-GDP concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 mm) were incubated in the presence of 5 nm RCC1 and 200 μm mant-GDP at 25 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithioerythritol. The reaction rates of the RCC1-catalyzed GDP dissociation on Ran were measured as a decrease in fluorescence (excitation, 295 nm; emission, 335 nm) due to energy transfer, using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS SOB fluorescence spectrophotometer (31Klebe C.

After 10 min at 20 °C, reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of stop buffer (7% charcoal, 10% ethanol, 0.1 m HCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4). After centrifugation, the released [32P]phosphate in 700 μl of the supernatant was measured by scintillation counting. Background values of samples with radioactive Ran added immediately to the stop buffer were subtracted, and GTP hydrolysis was expressed as the percentage of the maximal value of recovered radioactivity, as obtained in the absence of inhibiting transport receptors. For nuclear import assays on adherent cells, HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and permeabilized with 30 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem) in transport buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. The permeabilized cells were incubated in nuclear import reactions for 30 min at 30 °C as described (34Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J.

Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and then analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody against β-galactosidase (Promega) to detect the IBB-βGal. Nuclear import was visualized by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal unit attached to a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope. All digital data sets were processed identically using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe).

Reactions were standardized by assigning a fluorescent value of 100 arbitrary units to a reaction resulting in optimal import. The nuclear export assay using GFP-NFAT-transfected HeLa cells was carried out as described (37Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J.

Monoclonal anti-Ran antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. The polyclonal anti-importin β and anti-importin α antibodies were raised in rabbits against recombinant proteins and used after affinity purification. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose using standard methods.

https://openalex.org/W1548741427,"We have previously reported a physical association between STAT1 and the protein kinase double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). PKR inhibited STAT1 function in a manner independent of PKR kinase activity. In this report, we have further characterized the properties of both molecules by mapping the sites of their interaction. A STAT1 mutant unable to interact with PKR displays enhanced interferon γ (IFN-γ)-induced transactivation capacity compared with STAT1. This effect appears to be mediated by the higher capacity of STAT1 mutant to heterodimerize with STAT3. Furthermore, expression of STAT1 mutant in STAT1−/−cells enhances both the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of IFNs as opposed to STAT1. We also provide evidence that STAT1 functions as an inhibitor of PKR in vitro and in vivo. That is, phosphorylation of eIF-2α is enhanced in STAT1−/−than STAT1+/+ cells in vivo, and this correlates with higher activation capacity of PKR in STAT1−/− cells. Genetic experiments in yeast demonstrate the inhibition of PKR activation and eIF-2α phosphorylation by STAT1 but not by STAT1 mutant. These data substantiate our previous findings on the inhibitory effects of PKR on STAT1 and implicate STAT1 in translational control through the modulation of PKR activation and eIF-2α phosphorylation.

STATs are subsequently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerize by phosphotyrosyl·SH2 interactions, and translocate to the nucleus to induce transcription of cytokine-responsive genes (3Darnell Jr., J.E.

Upon virus infection or exposure to interferons (IFNs), STAT1 is found in protein complexes that bind specific DNA sequences upstream to genes responsible for host resistance. For instance, IFN-α/β induces formation of the heterodimeric ISGF3, whereas IFN-γ induces binding of homodimeric STAT1 (2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Harding H.P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 547-560Google Scholar) and the mouse homolog of the yeast eIF-2α kinase, GCN2 (19Berlanga J.J. Santoyo J. de Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We previously described an association between PKR and STAT1 (6Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Yang Y.L. Cuddihy A.R. Li S. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Decker T. Koromilas A.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This interaction takes place in unstimulated cells and diminishes upon treatment with IFNs or dsRNA. Increased levels of PKR·STAT1 complex have a negative effect on STAT1 DNA-binding and transactivation capacities. In this report we have mapped the interaction sites between the two proteins and have identified a novel function of STAT1. Specifically, we demonstrate that STAT1 functions as an inhibitor of PKR activation and eIF-2α phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. A mutant of STAT1, which was unable to interact with PKR, could not inhibit PKR function in yeast and was better able to mediate the transcriptional, antiviral, and antiproliferative responses of IFNs compared with STAT1. Taken together, these findings not only support our previous observations, but they also provide strong evidence for tight regulation of PKR and STAT1 functions by virtue of their interaction. In addition, our data suggest that STAT1 has a dual role in regulation of gene expression by functioning as a transcriptional factor and possibly as translational regulator through PKR activation and eIF-2α phosphorylation. HeLa S3, U3A, STAT1+/+, STAT1−/−, PKR+/+, and PKR−/− cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). For IFN treatment, cells were incubated with 1000 IU/ml of recombinant murine IFN-α/β (Lee Biomolecules) or 100 IU/ml of IFN-γ (PharMingen).

The Dual Luciferase system (Promega) was used to assess the transactivation potential of STAT1. Briefly, STAT1−/− cells or cells expressing STAT1 WT or TM were transfected with Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) and pGL-2XIFP53 GAS luciferase. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were replated and treated with IFN-γ for 18 h before harvesting. The results presented represent quadruplicate experiments where GAS luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Isoelectric focusing and immunoblot analysis of yeast eIF-2α were performed as previously described (29Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Silverman J.B. Ung T.L. Dever T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4146-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKR in vitro kinase assays were carried as previously described (6Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Yang Y.L. Cuddihy A.R. Li S. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Decker T. Koromilas A.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Protein production and extraction were performed according to previously described protocols (25Cuddihy A.R. Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Li S. Koromilas A.E.

Normalized GST fusion proteins were co-incubated with HeLa whole cell lysates or [35S]methionine in vitro translated proteins, washed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography (25Cuddihy A.R. Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Li S. Koromilas A.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2690-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutants of HA-STAT1 1–413 were subcloned by restriction digest of BamHI-NotI sites into a modified form of the yeast expression vector, pEMBL/yex4 (29Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Silverman J.B. Ung T.L. Dever T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4146-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing a NotI site in the multiple cloning site. Transformation of yeast strains H2544 and J110 and growth analyses were performed as previously described (31Dever T.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 167-178PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of PKR specifically associates with the DNA-binding domain of STAT1. To map the PKR·STAT1 interaction we performed a series of binding assays using full-length GST-PKRK296R mutant (GST-PKR WT could not be overexpressed in bacteria (32Rende-Fournier R. Ortega L.G. George C.X. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1997; 238: 410-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) or truncations of PKR bearing either the dsRNA-binding (GST-PKR N, amino acids 1–262) or catalytic (GST-PKR C, amino acids 263–551) domain (Fig. 1 A). HeLa S3 extracts expressing human HA-STAT1α were incubated with GST-PKR fusion proteins, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B (top panel), both full-length GST-PKR (lane 5) and the carboxyl terminus of PKR (lane 4) interacted with STAT1 whereas binding to the amino terminus was not detectable (lane 3). Furthermore, this interaction is specific for STAT1, because we could not detect binding of GST-PKR proteins with other STATs (Fig. 1 B). We previously reported that binding of PKR to STAT1 is independent of RNA but requires an intact RNA-binding domain, because the dsRNA-binding-defective mutant PKRLS4 (Arg58-Ser59-Lys60 to Gly58-Ala59-Leu60) (33Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) does not interact with mouse STAT1 in NIH3T3 cell extracts stably expressing this PKR mutant (6Wong A.H.

Based on this, we proposed that the integrity of the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR plays a role in PKR·STAT1 interactionin vivo (6Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Yang Y.L. Cuddihy A.R. Li S. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H.

The observation, however, that the carboxyl terminus of PKR is required for binding to STAT1 in vitro(Fig. 1 B) prompted us to examine the interaction of STAT1 with GST-PKR bearing either the LS4 or the LS9 mutation (Ala66-Ala68 to Gly66-Pro68), which also abolishes RNA binding (33Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). The RNA-binding-defective mutants were expressed and purified in the GST-PKRK296R background, because expression of LS4 and LS9 in the GST-PKR WT background could not be achieved (data not shown). HeLa S3 extracts containing HA-STAT1α were incubated with GST-PKRK296R, GST-PKRK296RLS4, or GST-PKRK296RLS9, and GST-PKR bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. All GST-PKR mutants interacted with STAT1 equally well (Fig.1 C, top panel), suggesting that mutations within the dsRNA-binding domain do not interfere with PKR binding to STAT1in vitro. To map the region on STAT1 that facilitates its interaction with PKR, we used truncated STAT1 proteins corresponding to its amino-terminal, DNA-binding, linker, SH2, or transactivation domains (Fig.2 A). The pull-down assays were performed with GST-PKR C, because this protein binds to STAT1 (Fig.1 A) and is more stable than GST-PKRK296R (data not shown). We observed that GST-PKR C specifically interacted with the DNA-binding domain of STAT1 (Fig. 2B, lane 14). Upon truncation of the STAT1 DNA-binding domain from the carboxyl-terminal end, a critical junction is reached when binding to PKR is retained (middle panel, HA-STAT1 1–364, lane 13) and when binding is abolished (HA-STAT1 1–342, lane 12). Further truncation of STAT1 from the amino terminus also presented a similar junction between amino acids 343–365 (Fig. 2 C, lower panel, compare lanes 25 and 26). Moreover, truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the DNA-binding domain of STAT1 at positions 348 and 357 still retained binding to GST-PKR (Fig. 2 D,lanes 10 and 11), suggesting that the region of interaction lies between amino acids 343 and 348 (β-sheet 3) on the DNA-binding domain of STAT1 (33Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E.J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). To identify amino acids in STAT1 that form contacts with PKR, we next constructed mutations within amino acids 343–348 of HA-STAT1 1–413 that abolished binding to PKR. Alanine-scan mutagenesis of each of the six amino acids did not yield a point mutant of HA-STAT1 1–413 that disrupted interaction with PKR (data not shown). However, a three-amino acid substitution (TM; Arg346-Leu347-Leu348 to Ala346-Asp347-Asp348) within this region disrupted the ability of STAT1 to interact with GST-PKR C (Fig.2 E, lane 6). Interestingly, HA-STAT1 1–413 TM possessed faster mobility on SDS-PAGE gels compared with WT most likely through changes in the overall charge of the molecule. To further characterize the interaction of full-length HA-STAT1α TM with PKR, we utilized the human fibrosarcoma, U3A cell line, which lacks endogenous STAT1 (35McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). HA-STAT1α WT or TM were co-transfected with PKRK296R into U3A cells, after which, the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated against PKR and immunoblotted with HA antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2 F, STAT1α WT associated with both transfected and endogenous PKR (upper panel, lanes 2 and 5). Conversely, STAT1 TM binding with endogenous PKR was completely abolished (lane 3) and displayed very marginal binding to transfected PKR, which was detectable only after long exposures (lane 6). In contrast to HA-STAT1 1–413 TM, full-length STAT1α TM did not display any difference in its migration pattern compared with STAT1α WT. These in vitro findings were also verified in vivo by the yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Taken together, it appears that the DNA-binding domain of STAT1 interacts with PKR in vitro and in vivo. To test the ability of STAT1 TM to respond to IFN-γ treatment, we performed transient transfection assays in STAT1−/− cells using STAT1 WT or STAT1 TM and a luciferase reporter construct driven by two copies of the GAS element from the IFP53 gene (28Eilers A. Baccarini M. Horn F. Hipskind R.A. Schindler C. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, we observed that luciferase expression in cells transfected with STAT1 WT was induced by IFN-γ treatment. However, in cells transfected with STAT1 TM, we observed, after normalization to Renillaluciferase, a much higher basal luciferase activity (∼5-fold) that could be slightly induced by IFN-γ stimulation. To better characterize STAT1 TM, we infected STAT1−/−fibroblasts with retroviruses harboring the puromycin-resistant gene and HA-STAT1α WT or HA-STAT1α TM. As a control, retroviruses containing only the puromycin-resistant gene were used. After puromycin selection, polyclonal populations of STAT1 WT-expressing cells showed ∼5-fold greater expression over STAT1 TM pools (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). Transactivation assays using the 2XIFP53-GAS luciferase reporter correlated with our findings in transient transfection experiments that STAT1 TM confers higher basal reporter activity, which can be induced by IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 3 B). We next tested whether STAT1 TM could bind DNA after IFN treatment. Although we could not detect ISGF3 formation in STAT1 TM cells in response to IFN-α/β (data not shown), IFN-γ stimulation resulted in the formation of DNA-binding complexes consisting of either STAT1·STAT3 heterodimers or STAT3 homodimers, but not that of STAT1 homodimers (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 7–16). This finding is consistent with previous reports that STAT3 is activated following IFN treatment (3Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). Moreover, the intensity of the STAT3 homodimer appears to be higher compared with control or STAT1 WT cells (compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). The ability of STAT1 to be phosphorylated upon IFN stimulation was also examined (Fig. 3 D). To compare STAT1 phosphorylation per equal amounts of STAT1 protein, we used a 5-fold higher amount of STAT1 TM extracts versus STAT1 WT before and after IFN stimulation. These reactions were also normalized to total protei"

Rab proteins are Ras-like GTPases that play important roles in mediating vesicular membrane trafficking in eucaryotic cells (1Novick P. Brennwald P.

Mice with Rab3a genetically removed show a variety of alterations in synaptic transmission consistent with Rab3a modulating vesicular trafficking in the nerve terminal (11Geppert M. Goda Y.

Rabphilin3 and Rim1 both enhance secretion and possess similar domains. Both contain an N-terminal zinc finger domain and two C-terminal C2 domains. The C2 domains of Rabphilin3 bind calcium and acidic phospholipids (20Chung S.-H. Song W.-J. Kim K. Bednarski J.J. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

The C2 domains of Rabphilin3 and Rim1 are not highly homologous, suggesting that the lipid and Ca2+ binding characteristics are different. Rim, but not Rabphilin3, contains a PDZ domain that may contribute to its reported localization to presynaptic release sites (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar).Rabphilin3 is present on synaptic vesicles and secretory granule membranes and binds Rab3a in situ (22Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Overexpression of full-length Rabphilin3 increases secretion by 30% in chromaffin cells (23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and 2-fold in insulin-secreting cells (24Arribas M. Regazzi R. Garcia E. Wollheim C.B.

Binding of Rab3a-GTP stabilizes Rabphilin3 in chromaffin cells (23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and probably in brain (17Li C. Takei K. Geppert M. Daniell L. Stenius K.R. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 885-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) but is not necessary for the enhancement of secretion (23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3579-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although Rim1 and Rabphilin3 have structural homologies, the proteins have different functions and characteristics in situ. Rim1 is stable in Rab3a knockout mice, and its localization in nerve terminals is reported to be at active zones and not on synaptic vesicles (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). N-terminal Rim1, which contains the Rab3a binding domain, enhances secretion in PC12 cells (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), in contrast to the homologous domain of Rabphilin3, which inhibits secretion (23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Chung S.-H. Takai Y. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16714-16718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The zinc finger-containing region in Rabphilin3 is also required for binding to Rab3a-GTP (22Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In this study, we determined the minimal domains of Rim1 necessary for Rab3a binding and for the enhancement of secretion. We found that the domains are distinct, are both located in the N terminus of Rim1, and can function independently. Surprisingly, the Rab3a binding domain of Rim1 does not include the zinc finger domain but requires only a short segment of ∼30 amino acids N-terminal to the zinc finger domain. Finally, we determined the step in the secretory pathway at which N-terminal Rim1 enhances secretion.DISCUSSIONRim1 is a large Rab3a-binding protein with multiple domains including a N-terminal zinc finger domain, a central PDZ domain, potential phosphorylation sites, and two C2 domains at the C terminus (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the structural basis for the ability of Rim1 to bind Rab3a-GTP and to stimulate exocytosis from chromaffin cells. We found that the abilities of Rim1 to enhance secretion and to bind Rab3a-GTP reside on distinct and relatively small domains that act independently. An analysis of the characteristics of the enhancement of secretion indicates that Rim1 acts at a step after Ca2+ entry in the cells to enhance the ATP-dependent priming of secretion.Rim1 and Rabphilin3 Possess Different Rab3a Binding DomainsThe N termini of Rim1 and Rabphilin3 have similar structures with homologous zinc finger regions and a distinctive SGAWFF motif (Fig. 1). They both preferentially bind the GTP-bound form of Rab3a. Surprisingly, the region of Rim1 that binds Rab3a-GTP is distinct from that in Rabphilin3. In Rabphilin3, an ∼140-amino acid is responsible for the binding of Rab3a-GTP (Fig. 1 B) (22Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28McKiernan C. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The domain includes the entire zinc finger and flanking sequences. Ostermeier and Brunger explored the crystal structure of Rab3a-GTP/Rabphilin3 and report two contact areas in the complex (39Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although the zinc finger does not directly contact Rab3a, it serves as a scaffold to hold the Rab3a-interacting domains in a binding conformation. The SGAWFF motif that is C-terminal to the zinc finger directly interacts with Rab3a.Neither the zinc finger nor the SGAWFF motif of Rim1 is required for binding to Rab3a-GTP. Either or both can be totally removed from N-terminal constructs without altering the specific binding to Rab3a-GTP. The minimal Rab3a binding domain in Rim1 was mapped to residues 19–50, immediately N-terminal to the zinc finger. This domain is predicted to be a coiled-coil domain (40Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). It has little homology to the corresponding region in Rabphilin3. Thus, Rim1 and Rabphilin3 possess different Rab3a binding domains, suggesting that their interaction sites on Rab3a are distinct.Full Length Rim1 and Its Zinc Finger Domain Enhance Secretion in Chromaffin CellsA previous study had demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of Rim1 enhances secretion when transiently expressed in PC12 cells (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrated that full-length Rim1 and as well as truncation mutants without the two C2 domains and the PDZ domain stimulate secretion similarly in chromaffin cells. The ability of full-length Rim1 to stimulate secretion suggests that the endogenous protein normally acts as a positive regulator of exocytosis.The minimal N-terminal domain required for the enhancement of secretion was located between residues 51 and 190 and did not require a splice insert. It contains the 90 amino acids comprising the cysteine-rich, zinc finger region. Importantly, the ability of transiently expressed full-length and N-terminal constructs of Rim1 to stimulate secretion in permeabilized cells indicates that the enhancing effects are a direct effect of the proteins on the Ca2+ -dependent secretory pathway and not on Ca 2+ entry.The N-terminal Domain of Rim1 Stimulates Secretion by Enhancing ATP-dependent PrimingWe had previously demonstrated that ATP acts before the final Ca2+-triggering step to prime the cells for exocytosis (31Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16219-16225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Holz R.W. Bittner M.A. Peppers S.C. Senter R.A. Eberhard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5412-5419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we found that Rim1 increased the ability of ATP to prime secretion in permeabilized cells without altering the sensitivity of the secretory response to Ca2+ (Figs. 3 and 4). Rim1 also increased, but to a lesser degree, secretion that did not require the continuing presence of ATP (Fig. 4). This seemingly ATP-independent secretion probably reflects the prior effects of ATP in the intact cell before permeabilization (34Holz R.W. Bittner M.A. Peppers S.C. Senter R.A. Eberhard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5412-5419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the enhancement of ATP-independent secretion reflects an increase in the degree of priming in the intact cells.ATP-dependent priming is a dynamic process (31Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16219-16225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Holz R.W. Bittner M.A. Peppers S.C. Senter R.A. Eberhard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5412-5419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rim(1–399) could be either increasing the rate of priming or decreasing the rate of unpriming. If Rim(1–399) decreased the rate of unpriming, then the primed state would be stabilized in the presence of Rim(1–399), and the decline in the secretory response in the absence of ATP would be slowed. We investigated the effects of Rim(1–399) on the stability of the primed state after permeabilization in the absence of ATP. When Ca2+ was added after 4 min of permeabilization, primed secretion decreased similarly in the presence and absence of Rim(1–399) (75 and 73% declines, respectively, data not shown). The data support the notion that Rim(1–399) increases the rate of ATP-dependent priming rather than decreasing the rate of unpriming.Localization of Rim1 Constructs in Chromaffin CellsEndogenous Rim1 is concentrated to presynaptic active zones in neurons and presynaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Because of the variety of possible splice variants, the actual protein that was visualized in these experiments is unknown. The full-length Rim1 protein that we constructed had a diffuse, cytoplasmic distribution with no evident plasma membrane association when transiently expressed in chromaffin cells. The localization of endogenous Rim1 to the active zone in neurons may require interaction with active zone-specific proteins that are not present in the chromaffin cell plasma membrane. The different subcellular distributions (diffuse, patchy, or nuclear) of the various deletion mutations investigated in this study suggest that multiple domains could determine localization. Despite differences in subcellular distribution in chromaffin cells, all of the constructs with an intact zinc finger domain similarly enhanced secretion.Although Rim(1–399) was detected in the cytoplasm, its predominant localization to the nucleus was unexpected and raised the possibility that Rim1 enhances secretion because of an effect on gene expression. However, an analysis of other Rim1 mutants revealed that nuclear localization was unnecessary for the enhancement of secretion. Highly charged Rim(226–399) localized entirely to the nucleus, indicating that this sequence contains a nuclear localization domain. It had no effect on secretion. Rim(1–190), a construct without the nuclear localization domain, was entirely cytoplasmic and enhanced secretion. Thus, it is likely that cytoplasmic rather than nuclear Rim1 enhances secretion.Full-length Rim1 (Rim(1–1553)) was not concentrated in the nucleus. Its cytoplasmic localization was not altered significantly by leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. It is possible that deletion of the C terminus in Rim(1–399) exposed a nuclear localization signal whose function is suppressed in the full-length protein.Comparison of the Effects on Secretion of Rim1 and Rabphilin3The domains required for the enhancement of secretion by Rim1 and Rabphilin3 are strikingly different. In previous studies, we found that both C2 domains as well as the zinc finger were required for the enhancement of secretion by Rabphilin3 (23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J.

In fact, N-terminal Rabphilin3 constructs terminating after the zinc finger inhibit rather than enhance secretion. The enhancement of secretion by Rim1 requires only the zinc finger region and not the C-terminal C2 or other identified domains. In addition, Rim1 (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) but not Rabphilin3 (data not shown) enhanced secretion from permeabilized cells. These differences are likely to reflect different mechanisms underlying the enhancements of secretion by these two Rab3a-binding proteins.The enhancements of secretion by Rim1 and Rabphilin3 are similar in that neither requires interaction with Rab3a. The main function of the interaction of Rabphilin3 and Rab3a is to stabilize Rabphilin3 in chromaffin cells (23Chung S.-H. Stabila P. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Rim1 constructs that were unable to bind Rab3a were well expressed in chromaffin cells (e.g. Rim(51–399), Rim(71–399)). There was no evidence that interaction with Rab3a stabilized Rim1 in chromaffin cells.Other Rim Family MembersRim1 belongs to a family of proteins, each of which has many possible splice variants. Rim2 is highly homologous to Rim1 (19Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although we did not investigate Rim2, it is likely that its N terminus functions similarly to that of Rim1. Amino acids 19–50 of Rim1 constitute the minimal sequence necessary to bind Rab3a-GTP. Twenty-seven of the 32 amino acids are identical to corresponding amino acids in Rim2 (residues 23–54). Similarly, Rim2 has a region that is 79% homologous to the smallest Rim1 construct that enhanced secretion. This region contains a zinc finger whose integrity is required for the enhancement of secretion. The zinc finger domains in Rim1 and Rim2 are 90% identical.Nim2 and Nim3 have been also identified as part of the Rim family (19Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Both these smaller proteins contain a C2 domain and flanking domains that are highly homologous to the C2B and adjacent regions in Rim1 (19Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Neither contains zinc finger domains. Nim3 enhances elevated K+-induced secretion in PC12 cells (19Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is possible that C2B region as well as the zinc finger region in Rim1 can stimulate secretion. Thus, the protein may contain two regions that enhance the secretory response.Several Rim-binding proteins have been identified. Two of them bind through SH3 domains to a specific region in the C terminus of Rim (19Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Their function in secretion has not been investigated. Another protein, cAMP-GEFII, binds to a region C-terminal to the zinc finger domain and N-terminal to the first C2 domain (C2A) in Rim2 (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). CAMP-GEFII enhances secretion from PC12 and insulin-secreting cells through a mechanism that requires both interaction with Rim2 and the direct binding of cAMP. None of these Rim-binding proteins are likely to play a role in the enhancement of secretion caused by the zinc finger of Rim1, which does not contain the specific binding sites for these various proteins.In summary, our investigation together with other recent studies highlights the importance of Rim as a regulator of exocytosis. Its many distinct domains are likely to reflect a role of the protein in integrating cellular signals, including those that modulate secretion. Although chromaffin cells do not normally express Rim1, we suspect that the activity of the transiently expressed protein in chromaffin cells reflects aspects of the function of the endogenous protein. We have identified the zinc finger domain as being sufficient for the enhancement of secretion. The interaction with Rab3a-GTP, although not necessary for the enhancement of secretion, is likely to serve another function, perhaps allowing the proper transport of the protein in the neuron. Rab proteins are Ras-like GTPases that play important roles in mediating vesicular membrane trafficking in eucaryotic cells (1Novick P. Brennwald P.

They are localized in different compartments and control distinct transport systems. The Rab3 subfamily is associated with secretory granules and vesicles and plays a role in regulated secretion. Rab3a and Rab3c are associated with synaptic vesicles and chromaffin granules (4Darchen F. Zahraoui A. Hammel F. Monteils M.P. Tavitian A. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mice with Rab3a genetically removed show a variety of alterations in synaptic transmission consistent with Rab3a modulating vesicular trafficking in the nerve terminal (11Geppert M. Goda Y.

To date, three possible Rab3a effectors have been identified: Rabin (14Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C. Fortner K.A. Stabila P. Holz R.W. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell.

Rabphilin3 and Rim1 both enhance secretion and possess similar domains. Both contain an N-terminal zinc finger domain and two C-terminal C2 domains. The C2 domains of Rabphilin3 bind calcium and acidic phospholipids (20Chung S.-H. Song W.-J. Kim K. Bednarski J.J. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

The C2 domains of Rabphilin3 and Rim1 are not highly homologous, suggesting that the lipid and Ca2+ binding characteristics are different. Rim, but not Rabphilin3, contains a PDZ domain that may contribute to its reported localization to presynaptic release sites (18Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Rabphilin3 is present on synaptic vesicles and secretory granule membranes and binds Rab3a in situ (22Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C.

Isolated β is also active in this reaction. In contrast, neither β nor α2β is able to interact with a chimeric molecule composed of rifampicin attached to an initiation substrate. Based on these results, we conclude that the RNA polymerase initiation site, specific for purine nucleotides, which ultimately become the 5′-end of the transcript, is essentially complete in the absence of the largest subunit, β′. However, the rifampicin binding center is formed only in the α2ββ′ core enzyme. We interpret our results in light of the high resolution structure of core RNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus.

However, the rifampicin binding center is formed only in the α2ββ′ core enzyme. We interpret our results in light of the high resolution structure of core RNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 is a multisubunit, multifunctional molecular machine. RNAP from Escherichia coli (subunit composition α2ββ′ω) is the most studied enzyme of its class. Apart from its ability to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation, the partial biochemical functions ofE. coli RNAP include the binding of single- and double-stranded DNA, limited melting of double-stranded DNA, binding of single- and double-stranded RNA, binding of nucleoside triphosphates, and binding of transcription inhibitors rifampicin and streptolydigin. Most of the functions common to all RNAPs are carried out by the two largest subunits, β′ and β. The two largest subunits are the most evolutionary conserved and constitute >70% of the enzyme mass. Together, β′ and β contain 17 segments conserved from bacteria to man (1Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell.. 1985; 42: 599-610Google Scholar, 2Sweetser D. Nonet M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1987; 84: 1192-1196Google Scholar). It is likely that the conserved segments participate in the formation of the enzyme functional sites as well as in intersubunit interactions stabilizing the core assembly. Because the biochemical functions of the enzyme are lost upon the separation of RNAP subunits (3Zillig W. Palm P. Heil A. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1976; : 101-125Google Scholar), the assignment of partial functions to a particular subunit or subunit segment is done indirectly by a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. To directly establish the roles of different subunits in transcription, new approaches need to be developed. In this report, we used a modification of the highly selective affinity labeling technique (4Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1987; 163: 113-121Google Scholar) to study the ability of RNAP subassemblies to interact with the transcription initiation substrate and the transcription initiation inhibitor Rif. We present evidence that the purine-specific initiation site of RNAP (5Wu C.W. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry.. 1969; 8: 4450-4458Google Scholar,6Wu C.W. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry.. 1969; 8: 4458-4464Google Scholar) is essentially complete in the physiological α2β subassembly (7Ishihama A. Adv. Biophys... 1981; 14: 1-35Google Scholar) and is also present in the isolated β subunit. In contrast, we found that the Rif-binding site is present only in the complete RNAP core, suggesting that β′ plays an unexpectedly critical role in the assembly of this site. We interpret our data in light of the high resolution three-dimensional structure of the RNAP core fromThermus aquaticus (8Zhang G. Campbell L. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell.. 1999; 98: 811-824Google Scholar). RNAP subunits were overexpressed and purified as described elsewhere (9Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4902-4906Google Scholar). RNAP reconstitution was performed essentially as described by Borukhov and Goldfarb (10Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif... 1993; 4: 503-511Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies containing overexpressed β or β′ subunit were solubilized in denaturing buffer (10Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif... 1993; 4: 503-511Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and dialyzed against two changes of a 30-fold excess of reconstitution buffer (10Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif... 1993; 4: 503-511Google Scholar). The supernatant after dialysis was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until further use. RNAP was reconstituted in 25-μl reactions containing 2.5 μg of β, 2.5 μg of β′, and 0.6 μg of hexahistidine-tagged α prepared as described (9Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4902-4906Google Scholar). RNAP was assembled by incubating the reactions for 30 min at 30 °C. The synthesis of the affinity labeling reagents, AMP- and ATP-based aldehydes and derivatized Rif-A, was as described (4Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1987; 163: 113-121Google Scholar, 11Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 12036-12040Google Scholar). 10 μl of individually renatured RNAP subunits or subunit combinations were incubated for 15-min at 30 °C in renaturation buffer (10Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif... 1993; 4: 503-511Google Scholar) in the presence of varying concentrations of cross-linking reagent followed by the addition of 10 mmborohydride and an additional 15 min incubation at 37 °C. Missing RNAP subunits were then added, and reactions (total volume 25 μl) were incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were supplemented with 0.5 μg of recombinant ς70 (9Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4902-4906Google Scholar), 50 ng of a DNA fragment containing the T7 A1 promoter (12Heumann H. Lederer H. Kammerer W. Palm P. Metzger W. Baer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1987; 909: 126-132Google Scholar), and 0.3 μm α-[32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions proceeded for 3 h at 25 °C and then were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of Laemmli loading buffer. Proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% SDS-gels. Labeled subunits were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimagery. Coupled RNAP reconstitution and affinity labeling were performed as above. Reactions were supplemented with NTPs (500 μm ATP, 50 μmCTP and GTP, 2.5 μm α-[32P]UTP (300 Ci/mmol)), and transcription was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of formamide-containing loading buffer. Products were analyzed by urea-PAGE (7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide) followed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. Coupled RNAP reconstitution and affinity labeling reactions and product separation were performed as above, and affinity labeled β subunits were extracted from the SDS gels by crushing the gel chips and soaking them in 0.2% SDS overnight. Extracted subunits were dried in vacuo and dissolved in a small volume of water, and HCl was added to 50 mm. Cleavage was initiated by the addition of CNBr to a final concentration of 50 mm and allowed to proceed for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of a double volume of Laemmli loading buffer. The reaction products were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Available cross-linking and mutational data indicate that the RNAP β subunit makes extensive contacts with the initiating purine nucleotide, which will ultimately become the 5′-end of the transcript (4Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1987; 163: 113-121Google Scholar, 14Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Lee J.Y. Polyakov A. Lebedev A. Zalenskaya K. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol.

Thus, β appears to be principally responsible for the formation of the 5′-face of the catalytic center. We were interested to know whether the purine-specific initiation site might be present in the α2β RNAP subassembly or in the β subunit alone. Accordingly, we developed an assay to monitor the interaction of isolated RNAP with derivatized initiating nucleotide analogues. Our assay combines two powerful methods of RNAP study, highly selective affinity labeling with initiation substrate analogues (4Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1987; 163: 113-121Google Scholar) and in vitro RNAP reconstitution (3Zillig W. Palm P. Heil A. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1976; : 101-125Google Scholar, 10Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif... 1993; 4: 503-511Google Scholar). The original selective affinity labeling protocol consists of two steps. In the first step, the open RNAP-promoter complex is formed and then RNAP is cross-linked to a derivatized, cross-linkable initiating nucleotide as specified by the +1 position of the template. In the second step, the cross-linked nucleotide is extended (“developed”) in a template-dependent manner with radiolabeled nucleoside triphosphate specified by the +2 position of the template. As a result, a radioactive dinucleotide is covalently attached to the RNAP subunit(s), which can then be visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. The purine-specific initiation site (i-site) is present even in the free RNAP core (5Wu C.W. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry.. 1969; 8: 4450-4458Google Scholar, 6Wu C.W. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry.. 1969; 8: 4458-4464Google Scholar), so it should be possible to carry out the first step of the affinity labeling protocol in the absence of promoter DNA, followed by promoter complex formation and the template-dependent extension of cross-linked nucleotide. One can extend this approach even further and perform the cross-linking step in the absence of one or two RNAP subunits. To visualize the cross-link, one would then have to add the missing RNAP subunit(s) to reconstitute the active enzyme. The standard RNAP reconstitution protocol involves mixing the RNAP subunits under denaturing conditions followed by dialysis into reconstitution buffer. However, active RNAP can also be assembled from individually renatured subunits (3Zillig W. Palm P. Heil A. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1976; : 101-125Google Scholar, 13Markov D. Naryshkina T. Mustaev A. Severinov K. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 2439-2448Google Scholar). Therefore, after the addition of ς and template DNA, the original cross-link can be developed with radioactive nucleoside triphosphate specified by position +2 of the promoter. We used the modified affinity labeling protocol described above to ask whether the RNAP subassembly α2β, and even β alone, can be affinity labeled with initiating AMP derivatized with a cross-linkable aldehyde group (4Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1987; 163: 113-121Google Scholar). In this experiment, as shown in Fig.1, derivatized AMP was added to the indicated renatured RNAP subunits or subunit combinations (Crosslinking to), and the cross-linking reaction was induced by the addition of 10 mm sodium borohydride for 15 min at 37 °C. The RNAP core was then assembled by the addition of individually renatured subunits omitted in the first step (Addition of). The cross-link was then developed by the addition of ς, the T7 A1 promoter-containing DNA fragment, and α-[32P]UTP specified by the +2 position of the template. As expected, robust labeling of β was observed in the complete reaction, which contained all the RNAP core subunits at the initial cross-linking step (lane 10). Approximately 5% of β was radioactively labeled in the complete reaction, which represented ∼40% of the labeling achieved in the standard affinity labeling protocol when RNAP open complex was used at the cross-linking stage (data not shown). Surprisingly, a high level of β labeling was observed when the mixture of α and β was modified in the absence of β′ (lane 9). The labeling efficiency dropped to ∼20% of that seen in the complete reaction when β alone was used at the cross-linking step (lane 7). Similar results were obtained with initiating ATP derivatized with a cross-linkable aldehyde group positioned at the γ-phosphate (data not shown). Importantly, no labeling occurred in reactions when no extra core subunits were added in the development step, indicating that the preparations of renatured β and α were free of contaminating RNAP or β′, which would have revealed themselves by affinity labeling of β in Fig. 1 a(lanes 6 and 8). Because the assembly of active RNAP is required for β labeling to occur, the amount of radioactive labeling depends not only on the binding of the initiating nucleotide analogue by the i-site at the cross-linking step but also on the amount of active RNAP present at the final stages of the reaction. To determine the efficiency of the RNAP assembly, aliquots of reactions from lanes 7,9, and 10 of Fig. 1 a were supplemented with NTPs and in a steady-state transcription assay (Fig.1 b). RNAP activity in this assay correlated with the affinity labeling results; the amount of full-sized transcript produced was the highest when the α/β mixture was used for cross-linking, followed by the addition of β′ (lane 2), or when individually renatured α, β, and β′ were combined simultaneously (lane 3). Only ∼20% of RNAP activity could be recovered when β alone was cross-linked to the initiating substrate analogue followed by the addition of α and β′ (lane 1). Thus, the relative cross-linking efficiency of the initiating AMP analogue to β in reactions containing the isolated subunit or in the α/β mixture is comparable with that achieved in the complete RNAP labeling reaction. Additional control experiments are presented in Fig. 1 c. When the initiating AMP analogue alone was reacted with 10 mm sodium borohydride for 15 min, followed by the addition of RNAP core subunits, no labeling was observed (Fig.1 c, compare lanes 5 and 6). This order-of-addition experiment establishes that the cross-linking reaction was complete by the time the missing subunits were added at the second stage of the reaction. Further, no labeling was observed when the initiating AMP analogue was incubated with individually renatured β′ followed by the reaction with 10 mm sodium borohydride for 15 min and the addition of the missing α and β (Fig. 3 c, lane 3). Thus, the reagent used is strictly specific for the β subunit, as expected from previous work (4Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1987; 163: 113-121Google Scholar). We used several controls to establish that the observed labeling of β resulted from the specific binding of the purine nucleotide analogue to the RNAP i-site. The presence of unlabeled ATP during the cross-linking step abolished labeling (Fig.2 a). This suggests that the affinity labeling of β reflects the interaction of the derivatized AMP with a specific nucleotide-binding site rather than a nonspecific interaction of the cross-linker with the lysines of the protein. Interestingly, the addition of UTP did not interfere with the labeling, suggesting as expected that the pyrimidine nucleotide poorly competes for the purine-specific i-site (data not shown). To map the initiating nucleotide cross-link sites, purified radiolabeled subunits were cleaved at Met residues under “single-hit” conditions to yield families of nested, easily identifiable fragments (Fig. 2 b). The pattern of radioactive CNBr-generated fragments was the same whether β alone, the α/β mixture, or the complete reaction containing α, β, and β′ was used at the cross-linking step (compare lanes 4–6 and7–9). Previous work demonstrated that standard affinity labeling with the AMP-based reagent resulted in exclusive cross-linking to universally conserved Lys1065 in the β conserved segment H (14Mustaev A.

Chem... 1991; 266: 23927-23931Google Scholar); the ATP-based reagent cross-linked to βLys1242 in the universally conserved segment I. 2M. Kozlov, I. Bass, K. Severinov, and A. Mustaev, unpublished observations. The experiment of Fig.2 b reveals that the ATP-based reagent also cross-links to Lys1242 in our protocol because the smallest radioactive fragment visible on the gel corresponded to cleavage at βMet1243 whether β, the α/β mixture, or the complete mixture of RNAP core subunits was modified. The smallest radiolabeled CNBr fragment observed with the AMP-based reagent corresponded to cleavage at βMet1085, not to Met951 as has been previously reported for this reagent (14Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Lee J.Y. Polyakov A. Lebedev A. Zalenskaya K. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 23927-23931Google Scholar). Thus, with our labeling protocol at least a fraction of the cross-links occurred to a lysine between βMet1066 and Met1085, leaving Lys1073 and/or Lys1078 as possible candidates. Lys1073 is the most likely target because structural analysis of the T. aquaticus RNAP core (8Zhang G. Campbell L. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell.. 1999; 98: 811-824Google Scholar) reveals that the T. aquaticusLys846 (E. coli Lys1073) is located within 5 Å of Lys838 (E. coliLys1065), which is the site of AMP reagent cross-linking at standard affinity labeling conditions (4Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1987; 163: 113-121Google Scholar, 14Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Lee J.Y. Polyakov A. Lebedev A. Zalenskaya K. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 23927-23931Google Scholar). In contrast, theT. aquaticus Lys851 (E. coliLys1078) is more than 17 Å away from Lys838. The shift in the cross-link site can be explained by conformational changes, which occur during the holoenzyme and/or promoter complex formation. We also note that affinity labeling of the E. coli RNAP carrying the K1065A mutation results in Lys1073 labeling even when the standard affinity labeling protocol is used. 3A. Mustaev, V. Sagitov, and A. Goldfarb, unpublished observations. The apparent Km values for initiating ATP analogue binding to β, α/β, or α/β/β′ were calculated from the extent of β affinity labeling as a function of the analogue concentration (data not shown). The calculated values were similar (650 μm (β), 500 μm (α/β), and 575 μm (α/β/β′)) and close to the publishedKm value for the RNAP i-site determined by independent methods (5Wu C.W. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry.. 1969; 8: 4450-4458Google Scholar, 6Wu C.W. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry.. 1969; 8: 4458-4464Google Scholar). We conclude that the observed affinity labeling is the result of the specific interaction of the initiating nucleotide with the α2β subassembly or isolated β and that this interaction occurs in the i-site. Rifampicin forms a tight complex with RNAP and prevents promoter escape (3Zillig W. Palm P. Heil A. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1976; : 101-125Google Scholar, 16McClure W.R. Cech C.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1978; 253: 8949-8956Google Scholar). Mutations in β abolish or weaken Rif binding to RNAP, suggesting that β forms at least a part of the Rif binding center (17Jin D.J. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol... 1988; 202: 45-58Google Scholar, 18Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 14280-14825Google Scholar). To test this idea directly and to study the binding of Rif to RNAP subassemblies, we used a chimeric compound comprising Rif covalently attached to ATP (Rif-A, as reviewed in Ref. 11Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 12036-12040Google Scholar). The chimeric molecule interacts with RNAP core with high affinity because of the strong Rif-RNAP interaction. The molecule also serves as a primer for the transcription reaction because the linker between Rif and the nucleotide moiety allows Rif-A to interact with RNAP in a bifunctional manner such that each ligand occupies its natural binding site (11Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 12036-12040Google Scholar). Rif-A was derivatized with the cross-linkable aldehyde group positioned next to the α-phosphate of the nucleotide and specific for βLys1065 (11Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 12036-12040Google Scholar). RNAP β, α2β, or a mixture of α, β, and β′ was preincubated with varying concentrations of derivatized Rif-A, and cross-linking was induced by the addition of borohydride. After the cross-linking reaction was complete, the missing RNAP subunits were added, followed by the template-dependent development of the cross-link using radioactive UTP (Fig. 3 a). As a control, affinity labeling reactions were also performed with various concentrations of the AMP-based reagent (Fig. 3 b). In reactions containing all RNAP subunits, comparable levels of labeling were achieved with both Rif-A and AMP. However, the concentration dependence of labeling was dramatically different, as expected. Reactions containing Rif-A saturated at low concentrations of the reagent because of the very high affinity of Rif for its RNAP-binding site. In contrast, β labeling with the AMP-based reagent increased linearly over the whole concentration range tested because of the lower affinity of AMP for the i-site. Strikingly, no labeling with the Rif-A reagent was observed when cross-linking was performed with isolated β or in the mixture of the α and β subunits (Fig.3 a, lanes 1–6 and 1′–6′). We conclude that the β′ subunit is required for the formation of the high affinity Rif-binding site. The complete lack of labeling of RNAP subassemblies by Rif-A at 50 μm concentrations contrasts with observable levels of modification with 50 mmderivatized AMP (compare lanes 4 and 4′ in Fig.3, a and b). Thus, Rif binding may inhibit AMP binding in the i-site, consistent with earlier kinetic data (16McClure W.R. Cech C.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1978; 253: 8949-8956Google Scholar). The principal result of this work is the demonstration that the purine-specific RNAP initiation i-site is essentially complete in the α2β subassembly and is even present in the isolated β subunit. In contrast, the Rif-binding site requires β′ for its formation. The critical role of β in the formation of the i-site is supported by affinity labeling data, which demonstrate that the initiating substrate makes extensive contacts with several regions of the β subunit (14Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Lee J.Y. Polyakov A. Lebedev A. Zalenskaya K. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 23927-23931Google Scholar, 15Severinov K. Mustaev A. Severinova E. Kozlov M. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 29428-29432Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that β residues in conserved segments H and I can specifically interact with the initiating nucleotide even in the absence of other RNAP subunits. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the assembly-competent C-terminal module of β (amino acids 643–1342), which contains conserved segments F, G, H, and I, can also be affinity-labeled by the derivatized initiating nucleotides in our assay, albeit with low efficiency. 4K. Severinov, unpublished observations. In contrast, our results reveal an absolute requirement of β′ for the formation of the Rif-binding site as we were unable to detect an interaction between the α2β subassembly and Rif-A. Extensive genetic data indicate that mutations that cause Rif resistance and decrease Rif binding to RNAP are found exclusively in the rpoB gene, coding for β. Early biochemical experiments demonstrated that, in agreement with our data, rifampicin derivatives cross-link to β nonspecifically (20Lowder J.F. Johnson R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1987; 147: 1129-1136Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that α2β weakly binds Rif as judged by spectral, gel filtration-based, and proteolytic assays (21,22). However, in these later studies the authors did not determine whether their α2β preparation was free of traces of the RNAP core and whether the observed interaction was specific because no controls using α2β containing the β subunit carrying a Rif resistance mutation were used. In addition, there is a formal possibility that the difference between our results and those reported by previous researchers is attributable to differences between Rif and Rif-A interactions with RNAP. However, the absence of Rif-A binding and cross-linking to RNAP harboring known Rif resistance mutations makes this possibility unlikely (11Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 12036-12040Google Scholar). Recently, an atomic structure of the RNAP core enzyme from the Eubacterium T. aquaticus was determined (8Zhang G. Campbell L. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell.. 1999; 98: 811-824Google Scholar). The structure revealed a molecule with a “crab-claw” shape. In the view presented in Fig. 4, the upper jaw of the claw is made mostly of β and is bilobal; the lower jaw is made mostly of β′. The deep cleft that separates the jaws harbors the catalytic magnesium ion and binds the DNA template (8Zhang G. Campbell L. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell.. 1999; 98: 811-824Google Scholar, 23Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Science.. 2000; 289: 619-625Google Scholar). Analysis of theT. aquaticus RNAP structure validates the biochemical data obtained in this work with the E. coli enzyme. As can be seen, the Rif-binding site (defined by sites that, when mutated, prevent Rif binding and result in Rif resistance (green,yellow, blue, and white spheres on Fig. 4)) and the i-site (as defined by cross-link points in conserved segments H and I (red spheres in Fig. 4)) come from clearly different “domains” of the structure. 5K. Severinov and A. Mustaev, unpublished observations. The i-site lies on the face of the β sheet domain made up from the β subunit conserved segments F, G, and H and a portion of segment I. Proteolytic studies, in vitroreconstitution, and two-hybrid analysis indicate that in E. coli, this domain is capable of independent folding and specific binding to RNAP α subunit (24Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 270: 648-662Google Scholar, 25Naryshkina T. Rogulja D. Golub L. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 31183-31190Google Scholar) and that evolutionary conserved residue Asp1084 in segment H is particularly important for α2β formation (25Naryshkina T. Rogulja D. Golub L. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 31183-31190Google Scholar). Our results show that this domain is also capable of interacting with the initiating nucleotide α-phosphate through βLys1073. On the structure, αI (white in Fig. 4) is immediately behind this domain, consistent with the observed stimulatory effect of α on β labeling. It should be noted that the i-site residues revealed by affinity labeling cannot be essential for catalysis because detecting cross-linking at these residues in the affinity labeling protocol requires catalysis to attach the radioactive label (14Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Lee J.Y. Polyakov A. Lebedev A. Zalenskaya K. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 23927-23931Google Scholar, 26Kashlev M. Lee J. Zalenskaya K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Science.. 1990; 248: 1006-1009Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the 5′-phosphate cross-links do not allow to model the position of the initiating nucleotide on the structure with confidence. However, the highlighted residues of β must be very close to the initiating nucleotide bound in the i-site to be cross-linked to the derivatized nucleotide. Mustaev et al. (27Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Zaychikov E. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 19185-19187Google Scholar) used selective affinity labeling of RNAP promoter complexes to study the extension of initiating nucleotides cross-linked to the E. coliβLys1065 and His1237. They demonstrated that the initiating nucleotides cross-linked to Lys1065 could be extended by only one nucleotide specified by the second position of the template. In contrast, initiating nucleotides cross-linked to His1237 could be extended by as much as nine nucleotides. These results were taken as strongly supporting the inchworming model of transcription. This model attempts to explain the high processivity of transcription elongation by postulating that the catalytic center of RNAP can move with respect to the RNAP mainframe (28Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1997; 66: 117-172Google Scholar). In contrast, rigid body models postulate that no extensive movements of the catalytic center occur and that the addition of a single nucleotide to the nascent RNA 3′-terminus is coupled to the translocation of the whole complex along the DNA. Structural analysis indicates that the data of Mustaev et al. (27Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Zaychikov E. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 19185-19187Google Scholar) can be explained without invoking the inchworming model. In the T. aquaticus RNAP structure Lys838, which is homologous to the E. coli Lys1065, is located in an inner strand of the β sheet domain and is firmly anchored on the RNAP mainframe. In contrast, His999, which is homologous to the E. coli His1237, is located on an unstructured loop that traverses the main channel of the enzyme and appears to be flexible. Thus, the extension of the cross-link at this position may simply reflect the flexibility of the cross-link site rather than the movement of the catalytic center. The Rif pocket, as defined by Rif resistance mutations, is farther away from the catalytic center, at the interface between several structural elements of β. Mutations toward Rif resistance occur at the base of and in between the two lobes formed by the β jaw (Fig. 4). Residues defining the N-terminal-most cluster of Rif mutations (E. coli position 146, T. aquaticus position 137 (white sphere)) and the C-terminal-most cluster (E. coli position 687, T. aquaticus position 566 (blue sphere)) occur at the place where the two lobes meet. Cluster I mutations (E. coli positions 507–534, T. aquaticus positions 387–414 (green spheres)) affect both lobes. Cluster II mutations (E. coli positions 563–574, T. aquaticus β positions 443–454 (yellow spheres)) affect the downstream lobe only. Cluster II amino acids lie at the base of a hairpin-like structure (blue in Fig.4). This hairpin is directly supported by the β′ segment F helix (running vertically on the left in Fig. 4 (red andmagenta)). In particular, evolutionary conserved T. aquaticus segment F residues 1085–1088, corresponding to E. coli β′ positions 786–789, make van der Waals contacts with cluster II amino acids 447–451, corresponding to the E. coli β amino acids 567–571. In addition, the T. aquaticus β′Arg1077 (E. coliArg780) is in direct contact with the T. aquaticus βPro444. The corresponding residue inE. coli, βPro564, can be mutated toward Rif resistance (18Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 14280-14825Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that cluster II would be unable to fold properly in the absence of β′, which may explain the requirement for β′ for the formation of the Rif site. In E. coli, the segment F amino acid Ser793, which is only three amino acids away from the β′ amino acids involved in the stabilization of the Rif-cluster II structure, could be mutated toward streptolydigin resistance (19Severinov K. Markov D. Nikiforov V. Severinova E. Landick R. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 23926-23929Google Scholar). The main cluster of streptolydigin resistance mutations is in β, between Rif cluster I and II. Our biochemical and structural analysis suggests that mutations toward Rif resistance can also be obtained in the β′ segment F. We are currently performing targeted searches for such mutations. If found, such mutants may explain the nature of infrequent Rif-resistant bacterial isolates that do not contain any changes in the known Rif resistance sites in β.

https://openalex.org/W2021056685,"A wide variety of proteins have been shown to recognize and bind to specific amino acid sequences on other proteins. These sequences can be readily identified using combinatorial peptide libraries. However, peptides containing these preferred sequences (consensus sequence peptides) typically display only modest affinities for the consensus sequence-binding site on the intact protein. In this report, we describe a parallel synthesis strategy that transforms consensus sequence peptides into high affinity ligands. The work described herein has focused on the Lck SH2 domain, which binds the consensus peptide acetyl-Tyr(P)-Glu-Glu-Ile-amide with a K(D) of 1.3 micrometer. We employed a strategy that creates a series of spatially focused libraries that challenge specific subsites on the target protein with a diverse array of functionality. The final lead compound identified in this study displayed a 3300-fold higher affinity for the Lck SH2 domain than the starting consensus sequence peptide."

To further understand structure-function relationships of the cyclin A- and cyclin B-CDK complexes, we have extended our mutational analysis of the N-terminal helix of mitotic cyclin B to the N-terminal helix of cyclin A and to the interacting site of this N-terminal helix on the CDK subunit. In this study we have generated a series of mutations in the N-terminal helix of cyclin B and of cyclin A that alter the ability of the cyclin to bind to Cdc2 and Cdk2. We have also identified specific mutations in the C-terminal lobe of Cdc2 and Cdk2 both by genetic screens suppressing the toxicity of vertebrate cyclin expression in yeast and by site-directed mutagenesis. We show here that the N-terminal helix of cyclin B, as well as that of cyclin A, is required for specific interactions between cyclin and CDK, because these mutations prevented the formation of a complex between the cyclin and a CDK subunit. Furthermore, we found that the association of cyclin A/B with a preferred substrate Cdc6/Cdc25C, respectively, was impaired by mutations in the N-terminal helix. The N-terminal helix of mitotic cyclins may contribute to the binding specificity of the cyclin-CDK complex through interaction with the CDK C-terminal lobe. Internal deletions of Xenopus cyclin B2 were constructed as described previously (17Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R. Adamczewski J.P. Gannon J. Hunt T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1279-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Xenopuscyclin B2 S90A in pGEM1 was cleaved at the unique NcoI site between Ala90 and Pro91 and then the linearized cyclin B2 was digested by Bal31 endonuclease to make a series of internal deletions. The DNA was repaired with T4 DNA polymerase, ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and introduced intoEscherichia coli strain TG1. Mutant DNA was then prepared from individual colonies and sequenced. Selected mutants were transcribed using an in vitro system (Stratagene) and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (RPN3151; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). [35S]Methionine-labeled products were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A series of point mutants of Xenopus cyclin A1 and cyclin B2 were constructed according to the Kunkel method (28Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Themyc-tagged cyclin A1 mutants were constructed by subcloning from cyclin A1 mutants in pGEM1 to myc-tagged cyclin A1 in pGEM1. Xenopus Cdc2 and Cdk2 mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis (29Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae 15Dau carryingXenopus wild-type cyclin B2 or cyclin A1 in pNV7 were incubated on minimal plates containing galactose at 26 °C for about 10 days. Colonies growing at 26° C but not at 37 °C were isolated as temperature-sensitive suppressor mutants (30Funakoshi M. Sikder H. Ebihara H. Irie K. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Hunt T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Colonies on galactose plates harboring the vector pYS91 that contains a galactose-inducible actin gene ACT1, whose expression is lethal to the wild-type strain, were excluded as mutants in galactose-promoter function. Tetrad analysis was employed to show that both suppression of growth toxicity and temperature sensitivity for the growth are caused by a mutation of a single locus. To identify the suppressor gene, each temperature-sensitive strain was transformed with a yeast genomic library contained in the YCp50 vector. Colonies that were no longer temperature-sensitive for growth and that were sensitive toXenopus cyclin expression were isolated. After the plasmid DNA was recovered from these colonies, the minimal length of DNA required for complementation was determined and sequenced to identify the mutated gene. Among them, only cdc28 mutations were isolated as suppressors of Xenopus cyclin expression. The mutation sites in the CDC28 gene of the suppressor strains were determined by the gap-repair method (31Orr-Weaver T.L. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Xenopus CSF extracts and interphase extracts were prepared by the standard method (26Funakoshi M. Geley S. Hunt T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5009-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). An mCAPTM RNA capping kit (Stratagene) was used forin vitro transcription of cyclins and CDKs and their mutants. 0.5 μCi of [35S]methionine and mRNAs to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl were added to 10 μl of RNase-treated or non-treated Xenopus egg extracts containing 50% rabbit reticulocyte lysate. After incubating at 23 °C for 90 min, 1 μl of samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation, reactions (10 μl) were diluted with 300 μl of bead buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmNaF, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 15 μg/ml benzamidine) and incubated with anti-Cdc2, anti-Cdk2, anti-cyclin B2, or anti-myc antibody at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The beads were recovered after washing with bead buffer three times. [35S]-labeled cyclins or CDKs were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For precipitation with p13suc1 beads, reactions (10 μl) were diluted with 300 μl of bead buffer, mixed with p13suc1 beads, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The beads were washed with bead buffer three times and then [35S]-labeled cyclins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. XenopusCdc6 (a gift from J. Blow) in pGEX-KG was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 8 h at 26 °C. The bacteria were lysed in ELB+ (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione (pH 7.0).Xenopus Cdc25C (a gift from N. Sagata) in pGEX-KG was prepared similarly. For GST pull-down assays, Xenopus cyclin and mutant cyclin mRNAs were in vitro-translated with [35S]methionine in the RNase-treated CSF/reticulocyte lysate mixture (1:1). 10 μl of this reaction mixture diluted with 200 μl of ELB+ was incubated with 2 μg of either GST-XCdc6 or GST for 1 h on ice. GSH-agarose beads were then added, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation and washed three times with ELB+, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Xenopus cyclin A1 mRNA was translated in the RNase-treated CSF/reticulocyte mixed extracts (1:1) with [35S]methionine at 23 °C for 2 h. In the case ofXenopus cyclin B2, the CSF extract was replaced with interphase extracts (9:1). 1 μl of the reaction were incubated with 9 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 μg/μl histone H1) at 23 °C for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the case of assay ofXenopus Cdc25C phosphorylation, GST-XCdc25C (0.1 μg/μl) was replaced by histone H1 and assayed for phosphorylation as described above. For histone H1 kinase assay with the precipitated cyclin-CDK complex, mRNAs of Xenopus cyclin mutants were cotranslated with Cdc2 or Cdk2 mRNA in RNase-treated and Ca2+-treated CSF/reticulocyte mixed extracts (1:1) with [35S]methionine at 23 °C for 2 h. Cyclin mutants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc2 or anti-Cdk2 antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed with bead buffer three times and then incubated with the reaction mixture (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 mg/ml histone H1) at 23 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. XCdc6 phosphorylation was assayed similarly, except that 4myc-Cdc2 and mutant cyclin A were cotranslated and that GST-XCdc6 (0.1 μg/μl) was replaced by histone H1 as substrate. Anti-Cdc2 monoclonal (A17) and anti-cyclin B2 monoclonal (X121) antibodies were provided by T. Hunt, and anti-Cdk2 antibody was provided by N. Sagata. Anti-c-myc antibody (A14) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The N-terminal helix in cyclin B2 is required for binding to Cdc2—The cyclin N-terminal helix is well conserved in all mitotic A- and B-type cyclins (Fig.1 B). To explore its role in the cyclin-CDK interaction, we first made internal deletions withinXenopus cyclin B2 and tested the ability to bind to Cdc2 inXenopus egg extracts by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-Cdc2 antibody. Fig. 2 A summarizes our results, which show that B2 cyclins that lack the N-terminal helix (Δ86–131 and Δ73–156) are unable to bind to Cdc2, whereas B2 cyclins with smaller deletions (Δ87–96, Δ86–110, and Δ87–122) bind to Cdc2. Therefore, there is a possibility that the sequence upstream of the N-terminal CBF that includes the sequence encoding the N-terminal helix is required for Cdc2 binding. Next we examine whether the conserved residues in the cyclin B2 N-terminal helix are actually required for Cdc2 binding. To do this, we generated a series of alanine mutants of these residues and tested their ability to bind to Cdc2. Mutations in the conserved residues in the cyclin B2 N-terminal helix (Y131A, I135A, Y136A, Y138A, L139A, and E143A), with the exception of V132A and D134A, yielded proteins that were unable to bind to Cdc2 (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, mutants both upstream (D121A, L127A, and S129A) and downstream (Y152A and L153A) of the N-terminal helix bound Cdc2. The cyclin box mutant R163A, which was used as a control, was unable to bind Cdc2. From this analysis we concluded that the N-terminal helix in cyclin B2 is required for binding to Cdc2. To determine whether the cyclin N-terminal helix mutants were able to activate CDK activity, mRNAs encoding mutant cyclins were translated in nuclease-treated interphase extracts, and phosphorylation of histone H1 was assayed. Fig. 2 D shows that those N-terminal helix mutants that failed to bind Cdc2 also little activate histone H1 kinase. Four of the mutants tested are at residues in the N-terminal helix of cyclin B (Tyr131, Ile135, Tyr138, and Glu143) that are highly conserved in all known mitotic cyclins (see Fig. 1 B). It has been demonstrated previously that the N-terminal deletions of cyclin A abolish CDK binding (17Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R. Adamczewski J.P. Gannon J. Hunt T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1279-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Lees E.M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To assess the requirement for conserved residues in the cyclin A N-terminal helix for CDK binding, we constructed a series of alanine mutants of Xenopus cyclin A1 and assayed the ability to bind Cdc2. Fig. 3 A shows a list of the constructs and a summary of binding, and Fig. 3 B shows a representative binding assay. Mutants in the N-terminal helix of cyclin A1 (Y164A, I168A, and E176A) with one exception (E167A) failed to bind to Cdc2 (see also Fig. 4). In control experiments, mutants outside the N-terminal helix (V159A, S162A, Y185A, and M186A) bound Cdc2. The results using the cyclin A1 mutants paralleled our earlier results with mutants of cyclin B2.Figure 4The cyclin A1 E167A mutant binds Cdc2 but not Cdk2. A, coimmunoprecipitation of CDK withmyc-tagged cyclin A1. Both CDK (Cdc2 or Cdk2) andmyc-tagged cyclins (wild-type (WT) cyclin A1, E167A, or Δ231–232) were [35S]-labeled in nuclease-treated extracts (upper panels). Cdc2 or Cdk2 were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody against cyclin A1.

B, coimmunoprecipitation of cyclin A1 mutants. Both CDK (Cdc2 or Cdk2) and cyclins were [35S]-labeled in the nuclease-treated extracts (Translation, upper panels) and immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK antibody. Cyclins that coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc2 or anti-Cdk2 antibody were identified by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography (Immunoprecipitation, middle panels). Immunoprecipitates with anti-CDK antibody were assayed for histone H1 phosphorylation (H1 kinase, lower panels).Lanes 1–4, Cdc2 binding; lanes 5–8, Cdk2 binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cyclin A1 mutants Y171A and L172A behaved differently in Cdc2 binding assay to the equivalent cyclin B2 mutants Y138A and L139A. Both Y171A and L172A mutants bound normally to Cdc2, whereas the equivalent cyclin B2 mutants did not. To confirm this difference, we used nuclease-treated egg extracts, from which endogenous cyclin mRNAs had been eliminated to translate the cyclin, and tested the binding to endogenous Cdc2 (Fig. 3 C). Cdc2 bound to the cyclin A1 Y171A and L172A mutants (lanes 2 and 3) but did not bind to the equivalent cyclin B2 mutants Y138A and L139A (lanes 6 and 7). Therefore, Tyr138 and Leu139 in the N-terminal helix of cyclin B2 are essential for the interaction with Cdc2, but the equivalent residues in cyclin A1 (Tyr171and Leu172) are not required for the cyclin A1-Cdc2 interaction. The cyclin A1 N-terminal helix mutants possess residual histone H1 kinase activity in accordance with the binding ability, when assayed in the nuclease-treated extracts (Fig. 3 D, Y164A and I168A). Therefore, in contrast to our results with mutants in the N-terminal helix of cyclin B, the N-terminal helix mutants of cyclin A1 can, but not fully, activate histone H1 kinase. This result suggests that these mutations cause a decrease in the stability of the cyclin-CDK complex. Cyclin A binds to both Cdc2 and Cdk2. To test whether a specific residue in the N-terminal helix of cyclin A can affect the ability of cyclin A to bind to Cdc2 and Cdk2, we compared the abilities of cyclin A1 mutants to bind to Cdk2 and Cdc2. Because the level of endogenous Cdk2 is relatively low in the extracts used in the assay, Cdk2 protein was expressed from its mRNA to increase its concentration to a similar level to that of the endogenous Cdc2. We then tested a series of alanine mutants of cyclin A1 for the ability to bind to Cdk2 by immunoprecipitation with anti-Cdk2 antibody (Fig. 3,A and B). The mutants in the cyclin A1 N-terminal helix that failed to bind to Cdc2 also abolished cyclin A1 binding to Cdk2 (Fig. 3 B, see I168A). However, one mutation, E167A, showed greatly reduced affinity for Cdk2 but still bound Cdc2 (denoted by an asterisk in Fig. 3 B). The cyclin A1 mutant Y164A also showed reduced Cdk2 binding. To confirm this result, the cyclin A1 mutant, E167A, was analyzed further. Cdk2 or Cdc2 and myc-tagged E167A were [35S]-labeled by cotranslation in nuclease-treated extracts, and the ability of myc-tagged E167A to bind to Cdk2 or Cdc2 was tested by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-myc-antibody, followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the cyclin A1 E167A mutant was able to bind Cdc2 (lane 2) but not to Cdk2 (lane 6). In the control experiments, wild-type cyclin A1 bound to both Cdc2 and Cdk2 (lanes 1 and 5), and the cyclin box mutant Δ231–232 bound neither CDK (lanes 3 and 7). The same results were obtained by coimmunoprecipitation of cyclin A1 E167A with anti-Cdc2 and -Cdk2 antibodies (see Fig. 4 B,lanes 2 and 6). To show that the E167A specifically lacks Cdk2-dependent kinase activity, the kinase activity of E167A coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc2 and Cdk2 was compared (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Consistent with the observed difference in binding affinity, E167A associated with Cdc2 displayed histone H1 kinase activity (lane 2), but the E167A with Cdk2 showed reduced activity (lane 6). Therefore, residue Glu167 in the cyclin A1 N-terminal helix is important for interaction of cyclin A with Cdk2. Next we investigated CDK mutations at residues that interact with the cyclin N-terminal helix. To do this, we applied a genetic approach using budding yeast system. Ectopic expression of vertebrate A- or B-type cyclins inhibits growth, and the inhibition is dependent upon association with endogenous yeast Cdc28 (30Funakoshi M. Sikder H. Ebihara H. Irie K. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Hunt T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Sikder H. Funakoshi M. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). By taking advantage of this effect, we have isolated temperature-sensitive cdc28 mutants that suppress the growth inhibition induced by ectopic cyclin expression. The procedure for isolation of the cdc28 mutations is described under “Experimental Procedures.” With reference to the results of this yeast cdc28 mutant screen and the structure of the cyclin A-CDK2 complex (11Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), we constructed equivalentXenopus CDK (Cdc2 and Cdk2) mutants by site-directed mutagenesis (Table I). Some of these CDK mutations would be expected to have significant effects on the cyclin-CDK interaction, because the equivalent mutations in yeast Cdc28 have been shown to possess preferential affinities for different endogenous cyclins (30Funakoshi M.

Open table in a new tab NT, not tested; +, binding; −, no binding; NT#, a loss of cyclin binding in yeast, but not tested in Xenopus. To show that the mutated residues in CDK are actually required for cyclin binding, Cdc2 mutants and wild-type cyclins A1 and B2 were [35S]-labeled in nuclease-treated extracts and then the abilities of Cdc2 mutants to bind to cyclins A and B were tested by coimmunoprecipitation with cyclin A1 or cyclin B2 (Fig.5 A). The result is summarized in Table I. As expected, two Cdc2 mutants, C119Y and A281E, failed to bind to both cyclin A1 and cyclin B2 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 5). Equivalent mutations in Cdk2, C118Y and A280E, also abolished the binding to cyclin A1 (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2 and 5). Thus, both Cys119/118and Ala281/280 in Cdc2/Cdk2, respectively, are required for the interactions of both Cdc2 and Cdk2 with cyclins A and B. Interestingly, the Cdc2 mutant S121A bound normally to cyclin A1 and B2, but the equivalent Cdk2 mutant S120A was impaired in its binding affinity to cyclin A1 (Fig. 5, A and B,lane 3). This result suggests that Ser120 may be involved in stabilizing the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. In contrast, the Cdk2 mutant F152A bound strongly to cyclin A1, but the equivalent Cdc2 mutant F153A showed reduced binding to cyclin A1 and severely reduced to cyclin B (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 4). This result suggests that residue Phe153 in Cdc2 has a role in stabilizing in the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex. The cyclin subunit plays a primary role in substrate binding and recruitment to the catalytic site of the cyclin-CDK complex. To investigate whether the cyclin N-terminal helix is important for the interaction of the complex with substrate, we tested the effects of the mutations in the N-terminal helix on substrate binding usingXenopus Cdc6 and Cdc25C as a preferred substrate for cyclin A and cyclin B, respectively. First, we confirmed that XCdc6 binds to cyclin A (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1 and 3) but not to cyclin B (lane 5). The interaction of XCdc6 and cyclin A1 was impaired by the mutations in the cyclin A1 N-terminal helix (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2 and4). The cyclin A1 N-terminal helix mutants that did not bind CDK also failed to phosphorylate XCdc6 (Fig. 6 C). XCdc6 bound to cyclin A1 and Cdc2 only when cyclin A1 was coexpressed in the extracts (Fig. 6 D, lane 3) and not to free Cdc2 (lane 4). Free cyclin A1 also fails to bind to XCdc6, because the C-terminal deletion ΔC14 that cannot bind to Cdc2 (17Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R. Adamczewski J.P. Gannon J. Hunt T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1279-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) did not bind to XCdc6 (Fig. 6 E, lane 2). Furthermore, cyclin A1 and Cdc2 that coprecipitated with XCdc6 was proportional to the increasing amounts of Cdc2 present in the extracts (data not shown), thereby indicating that the association of XCdc6 with cyclin A depends upon cyclin A forming a complex with Cdc2. These results suggest that the cyclin A1 N-terminal helix is required for XCdc6 phosphorylation, because it is required for formation of the cyclin-CDK complex. Next we investigated the effects of the cyclin B2 N-terminal helix mutants on phosphorylation of Xenopus Cdc25C, a preferred substrate of the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex (Fig.7 A). XCdc25C was phosphorylated preferentially by the cyclin B2-dependent kinase (Fig. 7 A, middle panel, lane 2), although the association of XCdc25C with cyclin B2 was not detected in this condition (data not shown). By contrast, XCdc25C was phosphorylated little by the cyclin A1-dependent kinase (lane 1). As a control, histone H1 was phosphorylated both by cyclin A1- and B2-dependent kinases (lower panel). These results suggest that, in contrast to XCdc6 for a preferred cyclin A-Cdc2 substrate, XCdc25C is associated and rapidly turned over on the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex. Then we tested the effects of cyclin B2 N-terminal helix mutants on XCdc25C phosphorylation. The cyclin B2 N-terminal helix mutants that did not bind Cdc2 also failed to phosphorylate XCdc25C (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that the cyclin B2 N-terminal helix is required for XCdc25C phosphorylation and thereby for the interaction of XCdc25C with the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex. The binding of a cyclin to a CDK is essential for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. The crystal structure of the human cyclin A-CDK2 complex has shown that the interaction between the cyclin A CBF and the CDK2 PSTAIRE motif is required for complex formation. In this paper we show that the N-terminal helix of cyclin B, as well as that of cyclin A, is also essential for the cyclin-CDK interaction. The crystal structure of the cyclin A-CDK2 complex revealed that the cyclin A N-terminal helix contacts the CDK C-terminal lobe and that the CDK buries a number of hydrophobic residues that are exposed on the cyclin A surface (11Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 13Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our work shows that the cyclin B2 N-terminal helix is also important for formation of the cyclin-CDK complex. As illustrated in a helix wheel projection of the cyclin N-terminal helix (Fig.8), conserved residues, mutation of which abolish CDK binding, lie along one side of α-helical surface (i.e. Tyr131, Ile135, Tyr138, and Leu139 in cyclin B2). Analysis of the cyclin A1 N-terminal helix mutants gave a similar result. Moreover, Cdc2/Cdk2 mutations to residues Cys119/118, Ser121/120, Phe153/152, and Ala281/280, respectively, affected differentially their ability to bind to cyclins (Table I). These residues are located in the region of the CDK C-terminal lobe that contacts the cyclin N-terminal helix (11Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). We have shown that these conserved residues of the N-terminal helix interact with this region located on the surface of the CDK C-terminal lobe and function in formation of specific cyclin-CDK complexes. These conserved residues are all hydrophobic (Tyr131, Ile135, Tyr138, and Leu139 in cyclin B2 and Tyr164 and Ile168 in cyclin A1), demonstrating the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the formation of these cyclin-CDK complexes. These N-terminal helix mutants can be degraded normally in Xenopus Ca2+-treated CSF extracts (data not shown), suggesting that they are correctly folded. By contrast, a mutation in conserved glutamic acid (Glu143 in cyclin B2 and Glu176 in cyclin A1) abolished not only the binding to CDK (see Figs. 2 and 3) but also its degradation in the extracts (data not shown). This result suggests that the mutations in these acidic residues have impaired the structural integrity of the protein. This glutamic acid does not appear to be in contact with CDK but to be deeply buried in the cyclin A structure. A CDK is composed of a C-terminal and an N-terminal lobe, and its active site is located at the catalytic cleft between the two (11Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 12De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H.

The interaction between the cyclin N-terminal helix and the C-terminal lobe of CDK may play a distinct role in determining the selectivity of cyclin-CDK complex formation. For example (a) the cyclin A1 E167A mutant bound to Cdc2 but not to Cdk2 (Fig. 4); (b) the Cdk2 S120A mutant showed reduced cyclin A binding, whereas an equivalent S121A mutant in Cdc2 bound both cyclin A and cyclin B (Fig. 5); (c) the cyclin B2 mutations Y138A and L139A specifically abolished Cdc2 binding, whereas an equivalent Y171A and L172A in cyclin A1 did not (Fig. 3 C); (d) the F153A mutant of Cdc2 bound to cyclin A but not to cyclin B (Fig. 5). In agreement with the ternary structure of the complex (11Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P.

Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), Glu167 of cyclin A and Ser120 of Cdk2 are interfaced with each other in the complex. Phe152 of human Cdk2 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket with the CDK structure. Conserved residues on each of the four turns of the cyclin B N-terminal helix might contribute to the formation of the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex (see residues indicated by boxed bold letters in Fig.8 B). In contrast, conserved residues on only two turns of the helix seem to contribute to the cyclin A-Cdc2 complex formation (Fig. 8 A). Therefore, the contacts within the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex appear to be more extensive in this region than those in the cyclin A-Cdc2 complex. These results support our previous study on differential stability of cyclin-CDK complexes, where we determined that cyclin A-Cdc2 dissociates more readily than cyclin B-Cdc2 (34Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R.Y.C. Hunt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29153-29160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cyclin A1-Cdc2 complex seems to be more stable than the cyclin A1-Cdk2 complex (data not shown). These differences might explain why the Cdc2 forms predominantly a complex with cyclin A1 in embryonic cells (35Kobayashi H. Minshull J. Ford C. Golsteyn R. Poon R. Hunt T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As well as the interactions made by the first two turns of the N-terminal helix (Tyr164 in turn 1 and Ile168in turn 2), the interaction of cyclin A1 with Cdk2 requires the acidic residue Glu167, whereas the cyclin A1-Cdc2 complex does not (Fig. 4). Ser120 in Cdk2 is 3.4 Å away from, and forms a hydrogen bond with, Asp181 in human cyclin A, which is equivalent to Glu167 of frog cyclin A (12De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 13Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This glutamic acid (Glu167) also forms a salt bridge with Cdk2 residue Lys278 that is predicted to be conserved in Cdc2 and Cdk2 complexes with cyclins A and B. Mutations that disrupt these interactions have a differential affect on the overall stability of the different cyclin-CDK complexes. In the case of cyclin A2-CDK binding, a similar affect was observed in the Tyr160 mutant of cyclin A2 (data not shown). Tyr164 of cyclin A1, which is equivalent to this Tyr160, is close to Glu167in the α-helix structure (Fig. 8 A). Cyclin H also contains the N-terminal helix. Cyclin H, from which this helix has been removed, can still bind to Cdk7, but the resulting complex does not exhibit kinase activity (36Anderson G. Busso D. Poterszman A. Hwang J.R. Wurtz J.-M. Ripp R. Thierry J.-C. Egly J.-M. Moras D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 958-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The location of the N-terminal helix of cyclin H is different from that of cyclin A. In cyclin H, the N-terminal helix primarily contacts the N-terminal CBF (37Kim K.K. Chamberlin H.M. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity profile of the N-terminal helix of cyclin A is quite different to that of cyclin H. This observation suggests that the role of the N-terminal helix of cyclin H may be different from that of cyclin A and hence from that of cyclin B. Cyclin plays a major role in substrate recognition (3Roberts J.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 129-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 38Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The best characterized docking site on cyclin A is found on the opposite surface of the cyclin-CDK complex from that of the catalytic site. This hydrophobic patch can interact with an RXL motif in substrates such as p107, pRb, and Myt1 (7Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 39Liu F. Rothblum-Oviatt C. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5113-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, this hydrophobic patch is found in all A, B, D, and E cyclins, suggesting that another motif must play a critical role in defining CDK substrate selectivity. We have found that the binding of substrate XCdc6 to cyclin A is dependent upon cyclin A forming a complex with a CDK; XCdc6 does not bind to either monomeric cyclin A or to monomeric CDK (Fig.6). We also found that XCdc25C was a preferred substrate for the cyclin B2-dependent kinase (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the binding manner of XCdc25C for the cyclin B-Cdc2 substrate appears to be different from that of XCdc6 for the cyclin A-Cdc2 substrate. In these interactions, the cyclin N-terminal helix could contribute to the binding site of substrates XCdc6/XCdc25C differently via a conformational change in the complex, which enables it to recruit a specific substrate into the catalytic cleft. The substrate specificity might depend upon binding specificity of the cyclin-CDK complex, which is due to the cyclin N-terminal helix. We are most grateful to Dr. Jane Endicott for valuable comments on the structure of the cyclin A-CDK2 complex and critical reading of the manuscript. We thank Drs. Tim Hunt and Julian Gannon for constructs and antibodies of cyclins, Cdc2, and Cdk2, Dr. Noriyuki Sagata for the use of frogs, XCdc25C, and anti-Cdk2 antibody, and Dr. Julian Blow for XCdc6. We also thank Drs. Mark Carrington and Tim Hunt for their support and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2025048322,"The human and murine MOK2 orthologue genes encode Krüppel/TFIIIA-related zinc finger proteins, which are factors able to recognize both DNA and RNA through their zinc finger motifs. MOK2 proteins have been shown to bind to the same 18-base pair (bp)-specific sequence in duplex DNA. This MOK2-binding site was found within introns 7 and 2 of human PAX3 and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) genes, respectively. As these two genes are expressed in the brain asMOK2, we have suggested that PAX3 andIRBP genes are two potentially important target genes for the MOK2 protein. In this study, we focused our attention onIRBP as a potential MOK2 target gene. Sequence comparison and binding studies of the 18-bp MOK2-binding sites present in intron 2 of human, bovine, and mouse IRBP genes show that the 3′-half sequence is the essential core element for MOK2 binding. Very interestingly, 8-bp of this core sequence are found in a reverse orientation, in the IRBP promoter. We demonstrate that MOK2 can bind to the 8-bp sequence present in the IRBP promoter and repress its transcription when transiently overexpressed in retinoblastoma Weri-RB1 cells. In the IRBP promoter, it appears that the TAAAGGCT MOK2-binding site overlaps with the photoreceptor-specific CRX-binding element. We suggest that MOK2 represses transcription by competing with the cone-rod homeobox protein (CRX) for DNA binding, thereby decreasing transcriptional activation by CRX. Furthermore, we show that Mok2 expression in the developing mouse and in the adult retina seems to be concordant with IRBP expression.

The human and murine MOK2 orthologue genes, which are preferentially expressed in brain and testis tissues, encode two different Krüppel/TFIIIA-related zinc finger proteins. The human and murine genes have been localized to band q13.2–q13.3 of chromosome 19 and chromosome 6, respectively (1Arranz V. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 77-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 2Ernoult-Lange M. Arranz V. Leconiat M. Berger R. Kress M. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The human hsMOK2 protein shows substantial differences with the murine MOK2 protein. The mouse MOK2 protein contains seven tandem zinc finger motifs with only five additional amino acids at its COOH-terminal end (3Ernoult-Lange M. Kress M. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The seven fingers motifs are highly similar to one another but are distinct from those of other zinc finger proteins. The structural feature of murine MOK2 protein is also found at the end of human hsMOK2 protein. Furthermore, the human protein contains three additional zinc finger motifs in tandem with the others and a nonfinger acidic domain of 173 amino acids at the NH2-terminal end (2Ernoult-Lange M. Arranz V. Leconiat M. Berger R. Kress M. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that human MOK2 RNA maturation results in three mRNAs with different 5′-untranslated exons. One of these three mRNAs encodes a smaller MOK2 protein (hsMOK2Δ) containing 10 zinc finger motifs and a small NH2-acidic domain made up of 76 amino acids. We have shown that the human and murine MOK2 proteins are able to recognize both DNA and RNA through their zinc finger motifs (4Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and specific RNA homopolymer binding activity showed clearly that the murine and human MOK2 proteins are RNA-binding proteins that associate mainly with nuclear RNP components, including nucleoli and extranucleolar structures. Murine and human MOK2 proteins have been shown to bind the same 18-base pair (bp) 1The abbreviations used are:bpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s)IRBPinterphotoreceptor retinoid-binding proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPCRpolymerase chain reactionCBDcellulose-binding domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseCMVcytomegalovirusMBPmaltose-binding proteinPBSphosphate-buffered saline-specific sequence in duplex DNA (4Arranz V.

This 18-bp-specific sequence has been identified by two approaches, randomized oligonucleotide and whole genome PCR techniques. The 18-bp MOK2-binding site occurs in an intron of two different human genes. It is interesting to note that these two potential target genes for MOK2 protein function in the brain, where the MOK2 gene is preferentially expressed. The first one is the human PAX3gene, a transcription factor expressed during brain development (5Stoykova A. Gruss P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1395-1412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gérard M. Abitbol M. Delezoide A. Dufier J. Mallet J. Vekemans M. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1995; 318: 57-66PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this gene, the MOK2-binding site occurs in the last intron (7Macina R.A. Barr F.G. Galili N. Riethman H.C. Genomics. 1995; 26: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in which disruption is associated with the translocation in human alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (8Barr F.G. Galili N. Holick J. Biegel J.A. Rovera G. Emanuel B.S. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The second potential target gene encodes the human interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), which is expressed exclusively in retinal photoreceptor cells and in a subgroup of pinealocytes. IRBP is thought to be involved in the visual cycle of vertebrate retina (9Chader G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 7-22PubMed Google Scholar, 10Liou G. Geng L. Baehr W. Prog. Clin. Biol.

In developing mice, IRBP is first expressed at the birth of the photoreceptors, suggesting that it may also be involved in photoreceptor differentiation (12Liou G.I. Wang M. Matragoon S. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The importance of IRBP in normal photoreceptor development has been demonstrated by the recent generation of mice with a targeted disruption of the IRBP gene (13Liou G.I. Fei Y. Peachey N.S. Matragoon S. Wei S. Blaner W.S. Wang Y. Liu C. Gottesman M.E. Ripps H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4511-4520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of theIrbp gene, there is a slowly progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors. The MOK2-binding site is located in intron 2 of human and bovine IRBP genes. It has been suggested that the highly conserved introns 2 and 3 of the IRBP gene might contain important regulatory elements for IRBP gene expression (14Fong S.L. Fong W.B. Morris T.A. Kedzie K.M.

Furthermore, we show that Mok2 expression in the developing mouse organism and adult retina seems to be concordant with IRBP expression. All plasmids generated for this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant GST-hsMOK2 and CBD-hsMOK2 fusion proteins were obtained by inserting the blunt-endedXbaI-EcorI fragment (1850 bp) into EcoRI/Klenow fragment-treated pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) andBamHI/Klenow fragment-treated pET35 (Novagen), respectively. The pET35 vector contains the cellulose-binding domain tag (CBD). TheXbaI-EcorI fragment, which contains the entire coding sequence of hsMOK2, was obtained from pBhsMOK2. The pBhsMOK2 plasmid and the eukaryotic expression CMV-hsMOK2 vector were obtained by inserting the blunt-ended AcsI fragment from cDNA1 (2Ernoult-Lange M. Arranz V. Leconiat M. Berger R. Kress M. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of pBluescript KS+(Stratagene) and NotI/Klenow fragment-treated pCMV, respectively. The plasmids encoding recombinant maltose-binding (MBP)-MOK2 fusion proteins and the eukaryotic expression vector CMV-MOK2 were described previously (4Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this article, the eukaryotic expression vector referred to as pCMV-hsMOK2, which encodes an isoform containing a smaller NH2-acidic domain, was renamed CMV-hsMOK2Δ (4Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The plasmid phsIRBPCAT contains a 332-bp fragment from the humanIRBP gene (from −291 to +41 relative to the transcription start site) inserted upstream of the CAT reporter gene (10Liou G. Geng L. Baehr W. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1991; 362: 115-137PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment of the human IRBP gene promoter was obtained from genomic DNA by PCR using a 5′ primer containing an addedStuI site and a 3′ primer containing an added Tth111I site. The product was digested by StuI-Tth111I and cloned into the corresponding sites of the PSV2CAT vector. In the phsIRBPCAT vector, the SV40 promoter was replaced by the human IRBPpromoter. A 276-bp fragment from intron 2 of the bovine IRBP gene (nt 7130–7406 (15Borst D.E. Redmond T.M. Elser J.E. Gonda M.A. Wiggert B. Chader G.J. Nickerson J.M. J. Biol.

Murine intron 2 of the Irbp gene was obtained from C3H mouse genomic DNA by PCR amplification with a human 5′ primer that localizes to exon 2 (nt 5045–5065) and a 3′ reverse human primer that localizes to exon 3 (nt 7017–7037 (14Fong S.L. Fong W.B. Morris T.A. Kedzie K.M. Bridges C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3648-3653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The fragment (∼2000 bp, EMBL/AJ294749) was cloned into the SmaI site of the pBluescript KS+ vector and sequenced. For transient transfection assays, HeLa cells were plated at 106 cells on a 100-mm Petri dish for 24 h prior to the addition of the recombinant plasmids by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (16Arranz V. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Gene. 1994; 149: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For nuclear extracts, the HeLa cells were transfected with 15 μg of MOK2 expression vectors. For CAT assays, Weri-RB1 retinoblastoma cells were transfected in 6-well plates with GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy System) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. About 106 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of IRBP promoter-CAT reporter vector (phsIRBPCAT) and 2 μg of MOK2 expression vector or parental pCMV plasmid. The cells were harvested 36 h later for the reporter gene assay using the freeze/thaw method (Promega). The activity of the resulting extracts was determined using the CAT assay protocol (Promega). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie protein assay (Pierce). For data interpretation, CAT activity was normalized to the protein concentration of the extracts. All transfection experiments were repeated at least five times with different CsCl-DNA preparations. The plasmids containing human, bovine, or mouse intron 2 of IRBP genes (1.5 μg) were cut once with the appropriate restriction enzymes, treated with intestine phosphatase alkaline, and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. After a second digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, each end-labeled fragment was purified on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The double strand oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and purified on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. For DNA probes containing dITP, dUTP, or deaza-dATP, a 189 bp-fragment of intron 2 of humanIRBP (nt 6660–6849) was amplified by PCR using two primers, one of which was 5′ end-labeled by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The PCR products were purified on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The 92-bp fragment of the human IRBP promoter (−88 to +4) was labeled by PCR using [α-32P]CTP and purified on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Nuclear extracts were prepared from five 100-mm Petri dishes of transfected HeLa cells by a modified method of Dignam et al.(17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The crude nuclei were resuspended in 250 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 0.05 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) with a protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the nuclear extract was stored at −70 °C. For bacteria expressing fusion proteins, the crude protein extracts were prepared as described previously (4Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The standard DNA binding reaction (20 μl) contained 20.000 cpm of32P-labeled probe, 2.5 μg of crude MBP fusion protein or 10 μg of nuclear extract, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.05 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol). Complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing premigrated 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bis ratio of 19:1) or 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TB buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3) at 4 °C at 200 or 120 V, respectively. EDTA was omitted in all binding and electrophoresis buffers to avoid denaturing MOK2. All probes were gel-purified. The purified GST-hsMOK2 fusion protein was injected into a New Zealand White rabbit. Affinity-purified hsMOK2 antibodies were obtained by elution of immunoglobulins bound to the human CBD-hsMOK2 protein as described previously (4Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNAs were extracted from normal tissues of 1-month-old mice by the guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNAs were prepared using oligo(dT) cellulose (Type III, Collaborative Research) columns (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Five μg of poly(A)+ RNAs from each tissue was used for Northern blot analysis, using nucleotides 1848–2276 of the mouse Mok2 cDNA as probe (3Ernoult-Lange M. Kress M. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For S1 nuclease analysis, 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs from mouse embryos were hybridized with a single strand of the mouse genomic fragment (nt −563 to +51 (16Arranz V. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Gene. 1994; 149: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). 5′ end-labeled with 32P at nt +51. 5′ end-labeling and strand separation were carried out by standard techniques. The S1 nuclease-resistant products were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and detected by autoradiography. In situ reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed as described by Thaker (20Thaker V. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 115: 379-402PubMed Google Scholar). The eyes of 1-month-old mice were enucleated, immediately frozen in OCT (TissueTek, Sakura, Netherlands) and sectioned (10 μm). Cryosections were collected on silane-coated glass slides. The sections were fixed for 1 h with a 10% Formalin/PBS for 1 h, washed three times in a 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min at −20 °C in an ethanol/acetic acid solution, washed three times in PBS, and dehydrated in graded alcohols. mRNAs were reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 42 °C with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase RNase H minus, using random hexamers (Promega). Sections were washed twice in PBS and dehydrated in graded alcohols. PCR reactions were carried out with the 5′ primer (5′-TCTAACTGTCTCCACTTCCCA-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-AAGGCACATAATTTCAGAGGA-3′) located in the 3′-untranslated region ofMok2 mRNA at nucleotides 1848–1869 and 2276–2297 in the presence of Biotin16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a 1:19 ratio of dTTP. The amplification program was as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min repeated for 40 cycles. The slides were subsequently washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h in 1/100 extravidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) in PBS solution. The signal was revealed using a nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) containing levimasol and a subsequent phosphatase alkaline-catalyzed color reaction with Xphosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium salt, which produces a precipitate. Control sections were done in the same way except that the reverse transcriptase reaction was omitted. The high homology found in introns 2 and 3 of the human and bovine IRBP genes suggested that these sequences might contain important regulatory elements for IRBP gene expression (14Fong S.L. Fong W.B. Morris T.A. Kedzie K.M. Bridges C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3648-3653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these elements might be the MOK2-binding site, which is highly conserved between the intron 2 regions of human and bovine IRBP genes. In bovine intron 2, we observed a deletion of one nucleotide at position 7 in the 18-bp MOK2-binding site (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this sequence was also conserved in murine intron 2, a fragment (∼2000 bp) obtained from mouse genomic DNA by PCR using human-specific primers, which localized to exon 2 and 3, was sequenced. Intron 2 of the murine Irbp gene shows a similar high level of homology with intron 2 of human and bovine IRBP genes (62.3 and 58.2%, respectively). Sequence comparison of the 18-bp MOK2-binding sites of the human, bovine, and murine genes showed that the MOK2-binding site of mouse intron 2 was the most divergent. Four nucleotides present in the first 9 bp did not agree with the previously determined consensus sequence for MOK2 binding (4Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or with the human or bovine MOK2-binding sites in intron 2 (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, EMSAs showed that the truncated human MBP-hsMOKΔ and mouse MBP-MOK2 fusion proteins were still able to interact with the murine MOK2-binding site (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the nucleotides at positions 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 within the 18-bp MOK2-binding site were not crucial for MOK2 protein binding. We performed EMSAs using a series of probes containing a modified nucleotide to determine which bases were crucial for MOK2 binding. The probes were obtained by PCR using dITP, deaza-dATP, or dUTP instead of dGTP, dATP, or dTTP, respectively. Fig. 2shows that the human and murine MBP-MOK2 fusion proteins were only unable to bind to the probe containing deaza-adenines instead of adenines. This result suggested that the adenines located in the 18-bp DNA-binding site were essential for the binding of human and murine MOK2 proteins. Transgenic and other studies have identified regulatory regions in the promoter important for the expression of the IRBP protein (10Liou G. Geng L. Baehr W. Prog. Clin. Biol.

Sci. 1994; 35: 1083-1088PubMed Google Scholar). The IRBP upstream region has been found to have a 156-bp sequence that is well conserved between human, bovine, and mouse (26Liou G.I. Matragoon S. Overbeek P.A. Fei Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The short promoter fragment from −123 to + 18 (relative to the transcription start site) was found to confer photoreceptor-specific expression in transgenic mice (22Bobola N. Hirsch E. Albini A. Altruda F. Noonan D. Ravazzolo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the 123-bp sequence, we found 8 bp corresponding to the 3′ end of MOK2-binding consensus sequence. The TAAAGGCT sequence is present in a reverse orientation compared with that of intron 2 (Fig.3A). To determine whether this sequence binds MOK2, we performed an EMSA. The nuclear extract from control HeLa cells (transfected with the pCMV vector alone) and cells overexpressing human or murine MOK2 were used for comparison. Nuclear extracts were mixed with a labeled 92-bp fragment from the humanIRBP promoter (−88 to +4) and then electrophoresed. The weak bands with different mobilities obtained with control HeLa cell extract correspond to endogenous binding proteins that were not affected by anti-hsMOK2 antibody (Fig. 3B, left panel,lanes 1 and 2). A retarded complex was detected with nuclear extract from hsMOK2-overexpressing HeLa cells (lane 3). The anti-hsMOK2 antibody clearly supershifted the DNA-protein complex, showing that this complex contains human hsMOK2 protein (lanes 4 and 5). In lane 6, a faster migrating complex produced by murine MOK2 protein can be seen. The difference in the mobilities of murine and human MOK2 proteins-DNA complexes can be accounted for by the difference in the molecular mass of these two proteins (22.8 and 51.5 kDa, respectively). To test whether MOK2 interacts directly with the 8-bp partial MOK2-binding site, we used two different mutated oligonucleotides as probes. These two oligonucleotides contained 6- and 5-bp modifications of the potential MOK2-binding site and the previously described AP-4-binding element, respectively (21Boatright J.H. Borst D.E. Peoples J.W. Bruno J. Edwards C.L. Si J.S. Nickerson J.M. Mol. Vis. 1997; 3: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complex was abolished when we used the mutant MOK2 probe but not the mutant AP-4 probe (Fig.3B, right panel). These data illustrate that MOK2 proteins are able to bind to the 8-bp partial MOK2-binding site present in theIRBP promoter. Having shown that human and murine MOK2 proteins bind the 8-bp partial MOK2-binding site in the IRBP promoter, we analyzed whether MOK2 proteins were able to repress or transactivate the IRBP promoter. The retinoblastoma cell line Weri-RB1, which expresses IRBP as well as other photoreceptor genes (27Fong S.L. Morris T.A. Lee C.H. Donoso L.A. Fong W.B. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 322-329Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was used for transient transfections to assay the effect of MOK2 on the IRBPpromoter. Cells were transiently cotransfected with the reporter construct phsIRBPCAT, which contains the −291 to +41 region of theIRBP promoter, and the human or murine MOK2 expression vectors or the corresponding empty plasmid (pCMV). In the presence of MOK2 protein, a significant reduction in transcription activity was observed (Fig. 4). The most important reduction, about 70%, was found with the human hsMOK2 protein. Both the hsMOK2Δ isoform, which is truncated for its NH2-acidic domain, and the murine MOK2 protein repressed CAT activity by about 50%. No effect was seen on the SV40early viral promoter (data not shown). This result directly demonstrates the ability of MOK2 to act as a transcriptional repressor of the IRBP promoter. It has been shown that IRBP protein and mRNA appear at early developmental stages (12Liou G.I. Wang M. Matragoon S. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Carter-Dawson L. Alvarez R.A. Fong S.L. Liou G.I. Sperling H.G. Bridges C.D. Dev.

Therefore, we investigatedMok2 expression during mouse embryogenesis. In previous work, we found that MOK2 mRNAs are present at low levels in cells and tissues proficient for the expression of the murine or human MOK2 gene (2Ernoult-Lange M. Arranz V. Leconiat M. Berger R. Kress M. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3Ernoult-Lange M. Kress M. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression of the Mok2gene during mouse embryogenesis was consequently determined by S1 nuclease, a more sensitive method than Northern blot analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.5A, S1 nuclease products were detected at all developmental stages tested. The presence ofMok2 mRNA at embryonic day 9.5 shows that theMok2 gene is expressed early during mouse embryogenesis. We have previously shown that murine and human MOK2 genes are preferentially expressed in the brain (2Ernoult-Lange M. Arranz V. Leconiat M. Berger R. Kress M. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3Ernoult-Lange M. Kress M. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). First, we investigated MOK2 expression in the eyes. Northern blot analyses showed that the murine Mok2 gene is faintly expressed in the eye of 1-month-old mice (Fig. 5B). To know whether Mok2 is expressed in the retina, we used thein situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, which provides a very powerful tool for the study of the in situexpression of rare genes. The results showed that Mok2expression in the retina of 1-month-old mice was restricted to the outer nuclear layer, which corresponds to the photoreceptors cells of the retina (Fig. 6). However, we observed that not all of the cells were stained within the outer nuclear layer (ONL, green or white arrow in Fig. 6). The outer nuclear layer of the mouse retina is composed of two kinds of photoreceptors, rods and cones, but contains a majority of rods. One possible explanation could be that only one kind of photoreceptor was stained within the outer nuclear layer. In our previous studies, we showed that human and murine MOK2 bind to an 18-bp sequence (A/G)CCTT(A/G)TCAG(A/G)GCCTTTA in duplex DNA (4Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This MOK2-binding site was found within introns 7 and 2 of humanPAX3 and IRBP genes, respectively. As these two genes are expressed in the brain as MOK2, we suggested thatPAX3 and IRBP"

The ability to form a pore has been ascribed to the ectodomain of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) E1 spike protein. To elucidate whether the E1 protein per se is sufficient for low pH-dependent pore formation, we expressed E1 inEscherichia coli in an inducible manner using the pET11c expression system. The data obtained clearly showed that the E1 protein was expressed in the bacterial cell membrane and that exposure ofE. coli expressing the SFV E1 protein to low pH (<6.2) resulted in a permeability change of the membrane. Thus, we conclude that the E1 protein of SFV per se is sufficient to promote pore formation under mildly acidic conditions.

Semliki Forest virus base pair(s) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorescence-activated cell sorter The entry of a virus into a host cell is an essential step in the chain of events leading to infection. A multitude of viruses use the endocytotic pathway to access host cells. As a model for the entry of enveloped animal viruses into cells, the α virus Semliki Forest virus has been extensively studied (1Simons K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1984; 36: 79-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Once attached, the virus is internalized via coated vesicles and transferred to the endosome. Due to the acidic conditions within this organelle, the lipid envelope of SFV fuses with the endosomal membrane of the target cell (2Kielian M. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 113-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This low pH-induced fusion is mediated by the so called virus spikes (3Marsh M. Bolzau E. Helenius A. Cell. 1983; 32: 931-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 4Väänänen P. Kääriäinen L. J Gen. Virol. 1980; 46: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5White J. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Each spike is a heterotrimer, being composed of the type I integral membrane glycoproteins E1 (50.786 kDa) and E2 (51.855 kDa), plus the peripheral glycoprotein E3 (11.369 kDa), which is associated with E2 (6Garoff H. Kondor-Koch C. Riedel H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1982; 99: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). Several functions have been ascribed to the spike proteins;e.g. the E2 and E3 precursor protein p62 forms a heterodimer with E1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and is responsible for the transport of the complex to the plasma membrane (6Garoff H. Kondor-Koch C. Riedel H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1982; 99: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). The E1 protein is involved in the acid-induced fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes (7Justman J. Klimjack M.R. Kielian M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7597-7607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Levy-Mintz P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4292-4300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Under mildly acidic conditions (pH 5.8) the spike proteins undergo an irreversible conformational change that results in the dissociation of the E1/E2/E3 complex, the formation of an E1 homotrimer and the exposure of a fusion peptide on the E1 protein (7Justman J. Klimjack M.R. Kielian M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7597-7607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conformational change also leads to the formation of a pore, which causes an alteration in the permeability of the virion membrane or of a cell membrane expressing the spike proteins (10Lanzrein M. Käsermann N. Kempf C. Biosci. Rep. 1992; 12: 221-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Lanzrein M. Weingart R. Kempf C. Virology. 1993; 193: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Schlegel A. Kempf C. NATO ASI Ser. Ser. H Cell Biol. 1992; 63: 375-386Google Scholar, 13Schlegel A. Omar A. Jentsch P.

It has been suggested that this acid-induced pore formation plays a crucial role in the penetration and uncoating process of SFV (15Lanzrein M. Schlegel A. Kempf C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several experiments have shown that pore formation is dependent on the ectodomain of the E1 spike protein (14Spyr C.A. Käsermann Kempf C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Omar A. Koblet H. Virology. 1988; 166: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Käsermann F. Kempf C. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 3025-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the E1 protein per se would be sufficient for triggering acid-induced pore formation. So far, all attempts to express isolated E1 protein on the surface of eukaryotic cells have failed. The E1 protein was synthesized but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, since efficient transport of the glycoproteins to the plasma membrane requires heterodimerization of E1 with E2/E3 (18Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to further investigate the role of E1 during pore formation, we decided to express E1 in the prokaryotic hostEscherichia coli. Our data clearly demonstrate that the E1 protein, although lacking a signal sequence, is transported to the plasma membrane of E. coli. Furthermore, we have shown that E1 is capable of modifying the membrane permeability of E. coli in a pH-dependent manner, leading to pore formation. DNA manipulations were performed by the use of standard cloning procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.R. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the SFV1 E1 gene from pSKm-E1′. This plasmid contains the entire E1 gene and was derived by subcloning a 1951-bp SpeI-EcoRV fragment from pSP6-SFV4, which contains the full-length cDNA sequence of SFV (20Dick M. Barth B.U. Kempf C. Virology. 1996; 220: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The primers were designed to introduce a start and an additional stop codon for translation. To facilitate cloning of the E1 gene into the expression vector pET11c (Stratagene AG, Amsterdam, Netherlands), the oligonucleotides encoded a unique NdeI andBamHI restriction site at their 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. Since the E1 gene contains an intragenic NdeI restriction site, the 3′ primer was designed to introduce a silent point mutation (A>G) that eliminated this NdeI cutting site. The 1340-bp E1 polymerase chain reaction fragment was purified using a polymerase chain reaction purification kit (Qiagen AG, Basel, Switzerland), digested with the restriction enzymesBamHI and NdeI, and ligated into the pET11c vector. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent XL-1 blue E. coli cells and the resulting colonies screened by digestion of the isolated plasmid DNA with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The plasmid containing the E1 gene (pET11c-E1) was then used to transform BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Most of the E2 protein sequence was cut out from the plasmid pSp6-SFV4 (21Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) using the restriction enzymes BglI and SgrAI. The ends of the resulting fragment of 1262 bp were polished with Klenow enzyme and mung bean nuclease. The plasmid pMSEH1_E1/23_phoA (Nyfeleret al.) 2F. Käsermann, S. Nyfeler, T. Roten, and C. Kempf, unpublished data. was digested with PstI and SalI, resulting in a 5371-bp fragment whose ends were blunted, too. This fragment was ligated with the 1262-bp-long fragment encoding the “E2” protein (432 amino acids, no signal sequence), and the resulting plasmids were transformed into XL-1 blue. Plasmids derived from growing colonies were analyzed for correct orientation of the insert. The correctly oriented plasmid was designated as pMSEH1_E1/23_E2/432. The region encoding for the “E1/”E2 fusion protein (1385 bp; 467 amino acids) was cut out with XbaI and HindIII and subcloned into a pET11c vector. This newly constructed plasmid pET11c_E1/23_E2/432 encoded for a fusion protein composed of the 23 N-terminal amino acids of E1, 12 amino acids resulting from the cloning strategy, and the C-terminal 432 amino acids of the E2 protein. Single colonies of BL21(DE3) E. coli cells harboring either pET11c-E1 or pET11c (control) plasmids were grown in M9 medium, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 2 mmMgSO4, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (22Sanz M.A. Pérez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12106-12110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h the cultures were split, half of the cultures were induced with 50 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration; Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Rotkrenz, Switzerland), and bacterial growth was recorded by measuringA600. In another set of experiments bacteria harboring the pET11c-E1 plasmid were grown to an A600 of ∼0.1 before the pH was adjusted to either 7.4, 6.4, or 5.0, respectively, and the cells induced by addition of 50 μm IPTG. Bacterial growth was recorded by measuring the A600. Expression of E1 was tested in bacteria that had been induced with IPTG for 3.5 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.10 of the original volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8, 1 mm Dithiothreitol), disrupted with a French press, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was washed twice with buffer A and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.3, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The supernatant of the 12,000 × g centrifugation was centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 50 min and the pellet resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B, homogenized, and centrifuged at 300′000 g for 60 min. Finally, the pellet containing the membranes was resuspended in 400 μl of buffer B. To demonstrate that the E1 protein was inserted into the E. coli plasma membrane, different control experiments were performed. E. coli expressing the E1 protein were mixed with E. coliharboring a plasmid pTSGH11 encoding the enzyme IICB of the glucose transporter (23Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then the cell membranes of this E. colimixture were isolated and the proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting using antibodies against E1 and enzyme IICB, respectively. Alternatively the enzyme IICB was co-expressed in pET11cE1 harboring cells using the plasmid pAGB421 (24Lanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells containing both plasmids were selected based on the kanamycin (pAGB421) and ampicillin resistance (pET11cE1). The presence of both plasmids in the growing colonies was verified by plasmid isolation and subsequent restriction analysis. Membranes of E. coli containing both plasmids were isolated and analyzed for the presence of the two proteins as described above. Urea treatment has been used to distinguish between peripheral and integral membrane proteins (25Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Nguyen N.Y. J. Interferon. Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and to solubilize inclusion bodies. Hence, to determine the localization of the E1 protein, urea was added to the purified membrane fraction and to the cell debris pellet to a final concentration of 8 m. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 45 min and then centrifuged for 18 min at 300,000 × g. The pellets were washed with 8 m urea, centrifuged as above, and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A. The resulting fractions were dialyzed against 1% SDS, electrophoretically separated, and immunoblotted as described above. The proteins of the purified membranes and of the pellet consisting of cell debris, respectively, were separated by SDS-PAGE (10 or 20%) under reducing conditions. Expression of E1 and enzyme IICB was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal rabbit anti-SFV and rat anti-enzyme IICB antibody, respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad AG, Glostrup, Switzerland) and anti-rat IgG (Dako, Glattbrugg, Denmark). Visualization occurred by either using a BM chemiluminescence kit (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Rotkrenz, Switzerland) or diaminobenzidine as substrate for the horseradish peroxidase. E. coli BL21DE3 containing the pET11cE1 plasmid were grown in M9 medium. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG. After 2–3 h of induction cells were harvested, and spheroplasts were prepared as described by Osborn et al. (27Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversion of bacteria to spheroplasts was monitored by phase contrast microscopy and was generally between 95 and 99%. Spheroplasts were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde immediately after isolation, washed, incubated with rabbit anti-SFV antibodies, washed, subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, and finally subjected to FACS analysis. FACS analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer. To test the integrity of the spheroplasts FACS analysis was performed in the presence of propidium iodide. For controls anti-SFV antibodies were replaced with a preimmune serum. E. coli cells expressing the pET11cE1 plasmid were converted into spheroplasts as described above. The spheroplasts were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 20 mm glucose and subsequently incubated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 min on ice either in the presence or absence 0.4% Triton X-100. Control samples consisted of spheroplasts kept under the same conditions but in the absence of proteinase K. To test changes in membrane permeability, cells were loaded with [14C]choline, and the released radioactivity was measured. Cells were grown and induced as described above, loaded with [14C]choline chloride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Dübendorf, Switzerland) at a concentration of 2 μCi/ml and incubated for 45 min. Cells were then pelleted, washed three times, and resuspended in M9 medium (pH 7.5 or 5.85). Aliquots of 1 ml were taken at different time points and cells separated from the supernatant either by centrifugation through a silicon oil cushion or by filtration through a 0.2-μm Dyna guard filter (Spectrum Laboratories Inc.). Aliquots form supernatants were mixed with a phenylxylylethane-based scintillation fluid (Beckman AG, Zürich, Switzerland), and radioactivity was measured in a Kontron MR 300 β-counter. Cells were grown, preloaded, and washed as described above. Cells were then resuspended in M9 medium at different pH values and choline efflux measured after 10-min incubation as described previously. Comparison of the growth of noninduced bacteria harboring either the pET11c or pET11c-E1 at various pH (5.4–7.2) showed no significant difference. However, induction with 50 μm IPTG strongly hampered the growth of bacteria containing the pET11c plasmid, but not bacteria containing the pET11c-E1. Under mildly acidic condition (pH 5) proliferation of induced cells containing the pET11c-E1 was strongly impeded, whereas at pH 6.4 and 7.4, respectively, growth appeared to be normal (data not shown). These results would be in agreement with a functional expression of the E1 protein in the E. colimembrane. Expression of E1 was detected by analyzing whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting using a polyclonal rabbit anti-E1 antibody (data not shown). Separation of the bacterial plasma membrane from other cell components followed by Western blot analysis revealed that E1 was not solely localized in the membrane but also associated with cell wall fragments or other protein aggregates (Fig.1 A). To further determine whether the E1 protein found in the cell membrane fraction is indeed a membrane-bound protein and does not represent a contamination by inclusion bodies, we used 8 m urea (25Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Nguyen N.Y. J. Interferon. Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to treat the fraction containing the bacterial membrane as well as the “cell debris” pellet. SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis of the different fractions showed that the E1 protein remained associated with urea-treated membranes (Fig. 1 B, lane MiUp), whereas the corresponding supernatant fraction revealed no signal for E1 (lane MiUu). Treatment of the cell debris pellet with 8 m urea demonstrated that a significant amount of E1 protein was most probably localized intracellularly in inclusion bodies or was associated with cell wall components (Fig. 1 B,lane PiUu). These results were further strengthened by demonstrating the co-localization of the E1 protein and the enzyme IICB in isolated membranes obtained from either a mixture of E. coli expressing E1 and enzyme IICB, respectively, or membranes isolated from E. coli that expressed both proteins simultaneously (Fig. 1, C and D). Incorporation of the E1 protein into the plasma membrane of E. coli was further assessed by FACS analysis of spheroplasts generated from E. coli containing the pET11c-E1 plasmid that were labeled with rabbit anti-SFV and fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-rabbit antibodies. FACS analysis in the presence of propidium iodide showed that the membranes of the spheroplasts were intact and non leaky (Fig. 2,A2 and B2). Hence, the positive signal depicted in Fig. 2, B1 proves that the E1 protein faces the extracellular space of the spheroplasts. To further analyze the orientation of the protein in the membrane, spheroplasts were exposed either in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 to proteinase K and the remaining membrane-associated protein fragments analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-SFV antibodies. The results (Fig. 3) clearly show that a residual fragment of 3 kDa (lanes 2 and3) was unaffected by the digestion. The size of the fragment and its reactivity with antibodies strongly suggest that it is the anchoring region (25 amino acids) of the E1 protein. Hence, the E1 protein was correctly oriented in the membrane.Figure 3Association of the E1 protein and fragments thereof with the cytoplasmic membrane. E. coli cells expressing the E1 protein were converted into spheroplasts (lane 1), subsequently incubated with proteinase K in the absence (lane 2) or presence of Triton X-100 (lane 3).

Weingart R. Kempf C. Virology. 1993; 193: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence lead to the assumption that the SFV E1 protein is responsible for this process (14Spyr C.A. Käsermann Kempf C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Dick M. Barth B.U. Kempf C. Virology. 1996; 220: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we have performed efflux experiments, as described under “Materials and Methods,” by using E. colicontaining either the pET11c-E1, or as controls the pET11c_E1/23_E2/432 or pET11c plasmids, respectively. At neutral pH, the [14C]choline efflux of E. coli cells expressing the E1 protein remained unchanged compared with controls. As depicted in Fig. 4, lowering the pH (pH = 5.85) resulted in an increase in choline release within the first 10 min in E. coli expressing E1. In contrast E. coli exposed to mildly acidic pH and harboring either the fusion protein E1/E2 or the pET11c plasmid only showed no or only a marginal increase in choline release compared with pH 7.5. To test the pH influence on choline efflux, preloaded cells expressing the E1 protein were resuspended in medium ranging from pH 4 to 7. After 10 min of incubation, choline release was measured. As shown in Fig.5, choline efflux in E1-expressing cells was strongly dependent on the pH of the extracellular medium, starting at a pH < 6.2 and reaching a maximum efflux rate at a pH of ∼5.2. The entry of many enveloped animal viruses into cells is mediated by conformational changes of the viral envelope proteins. These changes are triggered by binding of the virion to the receptor and/or by low pH, e.g. within the endosome, leading to fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. This membrane fusion is essential for a successful infection. In the case of the Semliki Forest virus this membrane fusion in the acidic milieu of the endosome is catalyzed by the envelope spike proteins (15Lanzrein M. Schlegel A. Kempf C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previous findings indicate that these spike proteins may be responsible not only for membrane fusion but also for pore formation across the viral envelope (13Schlegel A. Omar A. Jentsch P. Morell A. Kempf C. Biosci. Rep. 1991; 11: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Spyr C.A. Käsermann Kempf C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the membrane of infected insect cells (10Lanzrein M. Käsermann N. Kempf C. Biosci. Rep. 1992; 12: 221-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Lanzrein M. Weingart R. Kempf C. Virology. 1993; 193: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) under slightly acidic conditions. It was postulated that this pore formation plays a crucial role in the penetration process of SFV (15Lanzrein M. Schlegel A. Kempf C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but the question which of the viral structural proteins plays the key role in this process remained open. One possible candidate is the small structural membrane protein 6K, which is present only in small amounts in the viral membrane. Upon expression in E. coli 6K was capable of increasing the membrane permeability leading to cell lysis (22Sanz M.A. Pérez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12106-12110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have been demonstrated for poliovirus protein 3A (28Lama J. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, a deletion mutant of SFV lacking the 6K protein showed unaltered behavior with respect to low pH-induced pore formation in infected eukaryotic cells (20Dick M. Barth B.U. Kempf C. Virology. 1996; 220: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), although there was a reduction in virus release (21Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This may indicate that the 6K protein plays a role in the budding process rather than in pore formation, as suggested by Loewy et al. (29Loewy A. Smyth J. Von Bonsdorff C.H. Liljeström P. Schlesinger M.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that low pH-induced pore formation is dependent on the ectodomain of the viral spike (13Schlegel A. Omar A. Jentsch P. Morell A. Kempf C. Biosci. Rep. 1991; 11: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other findings using various mutant viruses strongly suggest that the E1 protein plays a crucial role in this process (20Dick M. Barth B.U. Kempf C. Virology. 1996; 220: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Experiments showing that pore formation also takes place in the so-called E1 particles, where the E2 ectodomain has been removed by proteolysis (14Spyr C.A. Käsermann Kempf C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) supported this notion. However, since E1 particles still contain the trans-membrane part of the E2 protein, an involvement of E2 could not be entirely excluded. Independent expression of E1 protein on the cell surface of vertebrate cells has not yet been achieved (the protein is produced, but not transported to the plasma membrane) (18Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has not been possible to prove that the E1 protein per se is sufficient for the formation of pores across the membrane. In this study we have therefore expressed the E1 protein in E. coli in an inducible manner using the pET11c expression system (30Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) and showed that these E1 proteins are indeed integrated into the plasma membrane of E. coli cells in an identical orientation as in SFV or SFV-infected cells. Fig. 3 clearly shows that in spheroplasts exposed to proteinase K the E1 protein is digested. An E1-derived peptide of ∼3 kDa is protected from the proteinase digestion, i.e. is localized inside the periplasmic membrane. The size of this peptide is in agreement with the expected size of the anchoring region (2.9 kDa) and strongly supports our findings that the E1, in the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane, is correctly oriented. To investigate whether pH-dependent pore formation occurs, [14C]choline release assays were performed. An enhanced choline efflux at pH 6–6.2 and below was found. It was maximal at a pH around 5.2, which is a pH similar to the one prevailing in endosomes. Lanzrein et al. (10Lanzrein M. Käsermann N. Kempf C. Biosci. Rep. 1992; 12: 221-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have reported corresponding results using SFV-infected insect cells: upon lowering the extracellular pH, efflux of a radiolabeled tracer molecule started at a pH of ∼6.2 and reached a maximal level at a pH of ∼5.5. Furthermore, these data are in accordance with what is known about the pH dependence of the SFV membrane fusion reaction (5White J. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) that in turn is dependent on the conformational change of the spike proteins. The fact that exposure of E. coli expressing the E1 protein to mildly acidic pH results in a change of the membrane permeability, which shows the characteristics of previously described acid-induced pore formation by the virus proteins, further strengthens the notion that the E1 protein is indeed incorporated into the cell membrane. The formation of pores at a pH below 6.2 also explains the observations that the growth of bacteria containing the pET11c-E1 plasmid was strongly hampered at pH 5, but not at pH 6.4 or 7.4, respectively. In conclusion, the data presented demonstrate that the E1 per se is sufficient to form acid-induced pores. Thus, these results confirm the previously proposed hypothesis (15Lanzrein M. Schlegel A. Kempf C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, these data also raise the interesting question how the E1 protein gets inserted into the E. coli cell membrane. In a regular infection of eukaryotic cells the viral spike proteins are synthesized as a polyprotein, which is cleaved co-translationally into the single proteins, and the signal for the insertion of the E1 protein into the membrane is contained within the 6K protein that precedes E1 on the polyprotein (6Garoff H. Kondor-Koch C. Riedel H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1982; 99: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). Within the membrane the E1 protein has a type I orientation (C terminus inside, N terminus outside). The membrane anchor sequence is located within the C-terminal 25 amino acids with just two arginines on the inside. With the selected strategy of cloning the E1 protein coding sequence into the pET11c vector, all of the 6K sequence was omitted and replaced by a start codon. Analysis of the E1 sequence (439 amino acids) for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal sequences using the PSORT program (31Nakai K. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 32Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Proteins. 1991; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) predicted the protein to reside in the cytoplasm. Hence, the cloned DNA containing the sequence encoding the E1 protein lacks a known signal that would govern the insertion of the protein into the cell membrane. To identify the sequences within the E1 protein responsible for protein insertion into the membrane, further experiments are needed. The two plasmids encoding the enzyme IICB as well as the anti-enzyme IICB antibodies were kindly provided by Prof. B. Erni (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern, Switzerland)."

In eukaryotic cells the signal recognition particle (SRP)1 targets ribosomes synthesizing secretory and membrane proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The Escherichia coli SRP is composed of a single protein subunit, termed Ffh, which binds to a 114-nucleotide RNA molecule, 4.5 S RNA. The E. coli SRP has been shown to direct nascent membrane proteins into the inner membrane and therefore bears a strong functional resemblance to its counterparts in eukaryotic organisms (1Ulbrandt N.D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis experiments define two domains in Ffh termed the “NG” and “M” domains (5Scoulica E. Krause E. Meese K. Dobberstein B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The C-terminal M domain contains the RNA-binding site and can be cross-linked to signal sequences (6Zopf D. Bernstein H.D. Johnson A.E. Walter P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4511-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The NG domain contains a Ras-like GTPase domain and a novel small helical N-domain (7Freymann D.M. Keenan R.J. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nature. 1997; 385: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The crystal structure ofThermus aquaticus Ffh shows the M domain to consist of four α-helices with a long, flexible loop, denoted the “finger loop,” between the first and second α-helices (Fig. 1 A) (8Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This loop contains a number of conserved hydrophobic residues, which are illustrated in red. A groove on the surface of the M domain formed by the finger loop and the first, second, and fourth α-helices has been proposed to represent the signal sequence-binding site (8Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As yet there is no clear explanation why RNA is necessary for SRP function (9Althoff S. Selinger D. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on the recent crystal structure of the M domain-4.5 S RNA complex, it has been proposed that RNA interacts directly with the signal peptide (10Batey R.T. Rambo R.T. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our previous studies withE. coli Ffh point to an important structural role for RNA (11Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our circular dichroism and proteolysis experiments showed that 4.5 S RNA stabilizes the tertiary fold of the M domain, which is highly flexible in the absence of 4.5 S RNA. Indeed the recent observation that RNA catalyzes the association of Ffh with its receptor has been attributed to possible RNA-induced conformational changes in the protein (12Peluso P. Herschlag D. Nock S. Freymann D.M. Johnson A.E. Walter P. Science. 2000; 288: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We now report that the metastability of the E. coli Ffh M domain in the absence of RNA can be attributed to the presence of the long, hydrophobic finger loop. This loop is conserved in all homologues of SRP and thus may have a critical role in the function of the SRP. In turn, we propose that RNA is functionally necessary to counter the destabilizing effect associated with this loop. Ffh and 4.5 S RNA were prepared as described previously (11Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The M domain (residues Gly326–Met435), amino deletion mutant (residues Lys365–Met435) and finger loop deletion mutant (from Gly326–Met435 with Gln340–Asp370 replaced by a GAGG linker sequence) were overexpressed from pET20b vectors (Novagen) in BL21DE3pLysS (Stratagene) cells and purified under denaturing conditions by cation exchange chromatography using CM-Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma) resin. Removal of denaturant by dialysis against water was used to refold all of these proteins. To prepare the Lys324 Ffh truncation mutant, a stop codon was introduced into the Ffh expression plasmid at the Lys325 codon by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol. To prepare the finger loop deletion mutant, a polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a unique NarI restriction site and two Gly codons into the M domain expression plasmid upstream of the Lys371 codon (via the 5′-primer) and to introduce a secondNarI site downstream of the Arg339 codon (via the 3′-primer). The linear polymerase chain reaction product was then cut with NarI, purified, and circularized with DNA ligase. The identities of the M domain, amino deletion mutant, and finger loop deletion mutant were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (see Fig. 3 Afor a schematic description of these constructs). Ffh (1 mg ml−1) was digested in the presence or absence of ∼0.7 mg ml−1 4.5 S RNA at 30 °C with either 0.1 mg ml−1 (Fig. 2) or 5 μg ml−1 (Figs. 4, A and B) porcine pancreatic elastase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in buffer A, 50 mm triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.5, 25 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (Fluka). To purify the digests by Ni-NTA chromatography, KCl and imidazole were added to them in the amounts of 300 and 5 mm, respectively, before loading onto a Ni-NTA column; the column was washed with at least 30 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 20 mm imidazole and 300 mm KCl and eluted with buffer A supplemented with 500 mm imidazole and 300 mm KCl. The eluate was concentrated by precipitation with 15% trichloroacetic acid before analysis by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Sypro-Orange dye (Molecular Probes) and analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. To check the consistency of the observed increase in the amount of fragment A in the digest when RNA is present, we analyzed four pairs of proteolysis reactions set up under identical conditions in the presence and absence of 4.5 S RNA. To identify N-terminal protease cleavage products by Western blotting, protease digests were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes after SDS-PAGE. After a 1-h incubation in PBS (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, and 100 mm NaCl pH 7.5) containing 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 2 h in the same buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of mouse antihistidine tag antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After several washes in PBS containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 2 h in the same buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of an anti-mouse antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bands on the membrane were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Figure 4The recombinant M domain binds 4.5 S RNA with the same affinity as Ffh. Both the M domain and Ffh form RNA-protein complexes with slower electrophoretic mobility than 4.5 S RNA (lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). The M domain is able to compete with Ffh at comparable concentrations for binding the RNA (lanes 4 and 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All CD data were acquired in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) in a 2-mm path length cell with protein concentrations of 5–10 μm. For thermal unfolding experiments, the sample was heated at a rate of 20 °C h−1; ellipticity measurements at 222 nm were taken at 0.1 °C intervals with a response time of 8 s per measurement. Gel filtration analysis of the amino deletion mutant at 200 μm protein concentration confirmed that the protein is monomeric at concentrations more than 10 times those used for the CD analysis (data not shown). 0.2 μm 4.5 S RNA was mixed with various concentrations of Ffh and M domain in buffer A supplemented with 10% glycerol. 10-μl binding reactions were supplemented with 3 μg of bakers' yeast tRNA (Sigma) per binding reaction to reduce nonspecific binding. For competition binding reactions, all components were thoroughly premixed before adding the 4.5 S RNA. The binding reactions were separated on 7% polyacrylamide gels as described by Lentzen et al. (13Lentzen G. Dobberstein B. Wintermeyer W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the E. coli Ffh M domain-4.5 S RNA complex (10Batey R.T. Rambo R.T. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and of the homologous M domain from the mammalian SRP (14Clemons Jr., W.M. Gowda K. Black S.D. Zwieb C. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) both revealed lengthy loops equivalent to the T. aquaticus Ffh finger loop. Moreover, sequence comparisons among homologues showed the size and character of this loop to be largely conserved (Fig.1 B). Using limited proteolysis, we found evidence that this disordered, exposed loop is retained as a feature of the E. coli Ffh M domain in solution. Elastase digestion of Ffh in the presence of 4.5 S RNA generates an 8-kDa truncated fragment of the M domain which starts, by N-terminal sequence analysis, at Lys365 (Fig.2). Based on its approximate size on the SDS-PAGE and on analysis of the digest by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, we concluded that this elastase-resistant fragment corresponds with Lys365–Met435. Thus, the protease cleaves within the finger loop and leaves the region that encompasses helices 2–4 intact in the presence of 4.5 S RNA. This protease-stable core of the M domain is marked in magenta on the structure in Fig.1 A. In our subsequent analysis of recombinant versions of the elastase fragment (Lys365–Met435, termed here the “amino deletion mutant”; see Fig.3 A) and the M domain (residues Gly326–Met435, see Fig. 3 A), we found that the finger loop has a markedly destabilizing effect on the fold of the M domain. CD spectra of the amino deletion mutant and the M domain both reveal a substantial amount of α-helical secondary structure (Fig. 3 B). As expected from our previous studies with an M domain construct purified from a proteolytic digest of Ffh (11Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), thermal unfolding of the recombinant M domain construct studied here was highly noncooperative (Fig. 3 C). The near-linear decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm between 4 and 80 °C shows that the M domain does not adopt a stable tertiary structure in solution. Despite this structural flexibility, the M domain construct used here retained the same binding affinity for 4.5 S RNA as Ffh (Fig.4), arguing that it is a valid representation of the M domain within the native protein. Remarkably, the smaller amino deletion mutant had a considerably more cooperative thermal unfolding profile than the fully intact M domain. Its 222 nm ellipticity signal changed in a sigmoidal manner between 4 and 80 °C, with the transition fully reversible. These combined structural data therefore revealed, quite unexpectedly, that the truncated amino deletion mutant has a higher propensity to form a tertiary structure than the fully intact M domain. The unexpected gain in structural stability upon removing helix 1 and the finger loop to form the amino deletion mutant suggests that the unusually long hydrophobic finger loop (amino acids Leu338–Asp370) destabilizes the folding of the M domain. A contribution from helix 1 cannot be excluded, however. To analyze the effect of the finger loop more directly, we prepared an additional construct in which finger loop residues Gln340–Asp370 were replaced with a flexible GAGG linker sequence. Thirty-one residues in the loop, including the conserved hydrophobic residues, were thus removed, creating the finger loop deletion mutant (Fig. 3 A). Strikingly, the protein remained highly α-helical by CD and had a significantly more cooperative thermal unfolding profile than did the M domain (Figs. 3,B and C). The properties of this protein were thus entirely consistent with a destabilizing influence of the finger loop on the M domain. We surmised that the destabilizing effect associated with the loop might be due to the exposure of its many hydrophobic residues on the protein surface. However, whether the loop is surface-exposed when the protein is in solution is left uncertain by the way it is involved in extensive intermolecular packing interactions in the crystal structures of both T. aquaticus Ffh (8Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) andHomo sapiens Ffh M domain (14Clemons Jr., W.M. Gowda K. Black S.D. Zwieb C. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The facile elastase cleavage we observe within the finger loop region (Fig. 2) suggested that this loop is exposed on the surface of the M domain in solution. Milder conditions biased toward only one protease cut per molecule were used in further experiments to probe whether the loop is surface-exposed within intact Ffh, prior to cleavage of the NG-M domain linker. Ffh bearing an N-terminal dodecahistidine tag was digested with a low concentration of elastase, and N-terminal fragments were identified by monitoring for fragments that bound to Ni-NTA resin. Two N-terminal fragments were identified that can be assigned as the products of cleavage after Lys325, the starting point of the M domain, by virtue of their slower electrophoretic mobility in comparison with that of a mutant truncated at Lys324 (Fig.5 A, fragments labeledA and B), and by the fact that they bind both to Ni-NTA resin and to an anti-His tag antibody in Western blots (data not shown). The cleavage region can be further narrowed down to between Lys325 and Lys365 because proteolysis under harsher conditions (Fig. 2) revealed that the Lys365–Met435 region is highly stable to proteolytic cleavage in the presence of RNA. Given that the bulk of the Lys325–Lys365 region encompasses the finger loop and that limited proteolysis generally cleaves flexible loops with much higher propensity than regular secondary structure elements (15Fontana A. Polverino de Laureto P. De Filippis V. Scaramella E. Zambonin M. Folding Des. 1997; 2: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), we conclude that the cleavages occur within the finger loop. Furthermore, because fragments A and B retained the linker between the NG and M domains, it follows that cleavage of the NG-M domain linker is not a prerequisite for the finger loop to become protease-accessible. These results therefore strongly argue that the finger loop is solvent-exposed within the context of intact Ffh. Intriguingly, analysis of the band intensities revealed an increase in the amount of fragment A when the digestion of Ffh is conducted under identical conditions in the presence of 4.5 S RNA (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2 and 3). Complicating the interpretation of these data is the difficulty of quantitating the amount of fragment A in a way that accounts for any differences in gel loading or proteolysis efficiency between lanes. However, this apparent increase was observed consistently after conducting several parallel proteolysis reactions under identical conditions in the presence and absence of 4.5 S RNA. Any increase in the exposure of the finger loop to the protease must be induced in the intact protein by the RNA prior to cleavage. The alternative possibility, that the RNA protects fragment A from further cleavages, is ruled out because the product lacks the bulk of the RNA-binding region and thus should not bind RNA. It is thus possible that RNA binding drives the unfavorable exposure of the loop on the protein surface. In addition, clear changes in the pattern of 27–37 kDa-sized fragments in the presence of RNA further indicate significant RNA-induced structural changes in Ffh (Fig. 5 B). Previously we found that the Ffh M domain lacks a stable tertiary structure as an isolated fragment in the absence of 4.5 S RNA (11Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We can now reconcile this finding with the presence of the finger loop, which is shown here to destabilize the fold of the M domain. This result may be explained by the nonpolar character of the loop, which contains a number of highly conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1,A and B). Inspection of the crystal structure ofT. aquaticus Ffh (8Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) revealed that these conserved hydrophobic residues neither pack into the hydrophobic core of the M domain nor interact with the NG domain but are instead buried by packing interactions between molecules in the crystal lattice. Similar packing interactions are observed in the crystal structure of the homologous M domain from H. sapiens SRP (14Clemons Jr., W.M. Gowda K. Black S.D. Zwieb C. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In both cases the finger loop on one molecule interacts with the proposed signal sequence binding groove on a neighboring molecule, thus satisfying the need of both molecules to sequester hydrophobic residues. These two crystal structures therefore provide evidence that the finger loop has a preference for hydrophobic environments and cannot easily accommodate its hydrophobic residues intramolecularly within the hydrophobic core of the M domain. Notably, however, neither these crystal structures nor the recent structure of E. coli M domain bound to a fragment of 4.5 S RNA (10Batey R.T. Rambo R.T. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) provided a picture of the finger loop interactions when the M domain is in the context of soluble, intact Ffh. Our proteolysis data have provided evidence that the finger loop, despite its hydrophobicity, is exposed on the surface of the Ffh protein. Two protease-susceptible regions were identified that can be mapped to a portion of the M domain sequence dominated by the finger loop. Therefore, any destabilizing effect produced by the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids in the finger loop should be significant within intact Ffh. However, proteolytic susceptibility does not necessarily imply that the finger loop is exposed at all times. The loop could be in a dynamic equilibrium between exposed and buried states. Further work will be required to verify whether the loop is permanently exposed or partially buried, for example, at the interface between the NG and M domains. In addition to its high content of hydrophobic amino acids, the length of the finger loop is expected to destabilize the fold of the M domain. Statistical analyses have shown that loop regions of more than 10 amino acids in length are rare in protein structures (16Martin A.C.R. Toda K. Stirk H.J. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Experimental studies have verified that there is an inverse correlation between loop length and the stability of proteins (17Nagi A.D. Anderson K.S. Regan L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Regan L. Nagi A.D. Folding Des. 1997; 2: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Viguera A.-R. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses in fact reveal that shortening of exposed loop regions has been used by thermophilic organisms as an evolutionary mechanism to create more thermally stable proteins (21Eisenberg D. Thompson M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The destabilizing effect of loop length has been rationalized theoretically by the increase in the entropic cost of forming a loop as the length of the spacer between the ends of the loop increases (22Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 179-180Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the retention of the finger loop in the Ffh protein through the course of evolution reflects an essential role for this exposed hydrophobic finger loop in the function of the SRP. This conclusion is consistent with the proposed signal sequence-binding site of Ffh (8Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) that implies a role for the finger loop in the recognition of the signal peptide. Nonetheless, more definitive experiments are needed to confirm that the finger loop interacts with the signal sequence. We propose that the functional necessity for the exposure of the hydrophobic finger loop, in turn, underlies the requirement of RNA for SRP function. The fact that RNA has been conserved through evolution in all the cytoplasmic SRPs identified to date clearly implies an indispensable role. Our previous studies show that RNA has the capacity to order the tertiary structure within the M domain (11Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The proteolysis data reported here provide additional evidence that RNA induces structural changes in Ffh. In summary, we propose that a major role of the 4.5 S RNA is to counter the destabilizing effect of the finger loop and thereby maintain the M domain in a functionally competent conformation.

Actin appears to take the role of a static, rigid lattice upon which the other muscle proteins shift in order to produce and regulate muscle movement. However, with numerous studies showing the dynamic nature of filamentous actin (F-actin), this may not, in fact, be the case. F-actin, depending on the ligands bound and/or the stage in the cross-bridge cycle, becomes more or less flexible (2Oosawa F. Stracher A. Muscle and Non-muscle Motility. 1.

J. 1996; 70: 1439-1446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating direct or indirect interactions between subdomain 2 and the myosin head (S1). Modifications of the C-terminal Cys374 are also known to cause reagent-dependent changes in the actomyosin ATPase activity and the in vitro motility of actin filaments (7Crosbie R.H. Miller C. Cheung P. Goodnight T. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1957-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, there are certainly strong indications that the dynamic properties of actin in general, and of subdomain 2 in particular, may play important roles in actomyosin interactions.The position of Tm on F-actin has been modeled to a high degree of resolution (13Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 24Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P.

Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Residues likely involved in Tm-F-actin interactions, as suggested by these models, are all located in subdomains 3 and 4. While subdomain 2 does not seem to be involved in the Tm-F-actin interaction, an interesting biochemical study by Bonafé et al. (28Bonafé N. Mathieu M. Kassab R. Chaussepied P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) implicates (either through direct or indirect effects) the DNase I loop of subdomain 2 in such an interaction. In this study the presence of Tm and the Tm·Tn complex interfered with the cross-linking of Lys50 of actin to the central 48 kDa of the S1 heavy chain. This inhibition of cross-linking indicates Tm- and Tm/Tn-induced changes in either the reactivities of, and/or the distances between, the cross-linking sites on actin and S1. A more explicit suggestion of subdomain 2 movement during actin regulation was advanced by Squire and Morris (1Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in their review on muscle thin filament regulation. According to their hypothesis, the structural changes seen in electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction studies of regulated thin filaments may be due not only to shifts of the Tm·Tn complex, but also to subdomain movements within each actin protomer. This hypothesis, together with the results of Bonaféet al. (28Bonafé N. Mathieu M. Kassab R. Chaussepied P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the role of subdomain 2 movements in the regulatory process.To study the role of subdomain 2 in the Tm/Tn regulation of actomyosin, we attached fluorescent probes (1,5-IAEDANS or pyrene maleimide) to three fully functional mutant yeast actins, Q41C/C374S, D51C/C374S, and Q41C at positions 41 or 51, and in the case of Q41C, also at position 374 (Fig. 1). The first two mutants have the reactive Cys374 replaced by Ser and new reactive cysteine residues replacing Gln41 and Asp51, respectively. The third mutant retains the reactive Cys374 while adding an additional reactive cysteine in place of Gln41. Using these labeled mutants, we monitored their fluorescence by means of direct excitation, energy transfer, and, in the case of the doubly labeled Q41C, excimer fluorescence during the various regulatory steps. We also used Gln41/ANP (azidonitrophenyl putrescine)-labeled α-skeletal actin (both cross-linked and uncross-linked) in conjunction with rhodamine phalloidin, and in this way, measured the quenching of rhodamine fluorescence by ANP during regulation. Also, using the cross-linked species, we were able to investigate the regulatory properties of F-actin with an immobilized subdomain 2.Our results show that there are no significant changes in the probe environment, nor in the relative position of subdomain 2, in the course of Ca2+ regulation by Tm/Tn. In addition, we found that despite intrastrand cross-linking, the ANP-labeled α-skeletal actin remained fully regulated, indicating that a mobile subdomain 2 is not a necessary component in actomyosin regulation.DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that subdomain 2 movements are an important component of actin regulation by the Tm·Tn complex. Squire and Morris (1Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) raised this possibility, suggesting that changes in x-ray diffraction patterns of regulated actin could, in part, be attributed to subdomain 2 movements and not solely to the shifting of the regulatory proteins. To explore this possibility, we used labeled skeletal α-actin and yeast actin mutants whose reactive cysteines on the DNase I loop (Cys41 or Cys51) were labeled with fluorescent probes. We anticipated that changes in the environment of these probes and in their distance from native actin tryptophan residues would be reflected in their fluorescence and in the fluorescence energy transferred to them. While such FRET measurements between tryptophans and the AEDANS probes in actin mutants were suitable for monitoring regulatory shifts between the blocked (+Tm-Tn; −Ca2+) and the closed (+Tm-Tn; +Ca2+) states, they could not be used to investigate the open state because of the strong tryptophan fluorescence of S1. By using ANP-labeled skeletal α-actin, we were able to look for changes in the quenching of rhodamine phalloidin fluorescence by ANP possibly stemming from shifts between the closed and open states. In its cross-linked state, ANP-actin also allowed us to investigate whether subdomain 2 movement is required for the regulation of actin by Tm-Tn.Functional assays of labeled α-actin and yeast actin mutants confirmed their suitability for testing regulation-linked changes in actin structure. All actins polymerized well and were fully regulated in acto-S1 ATPase experiments (Table I). In vitro motilities were similar for wild type and both labeled and unlabeled mutant actins. A previous study showed that uncross-linked ANP-labeled skeletal α-actin has sliding speeds virtually the same as those of unlabeled α-actin, while the sliding of cross-linked ANP-actin is impaired (42Kim E. Bobkova E. Miller C.J. Orlova A. Hegyi G. Egelman E.H. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17801-17809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Emission Spectra of Labeled Yeast Actin MutantsAs revealed by our results, adding regulatory proteins to Q41CAEDANS/C374S produced no significant changes in probe fluorescence, indicating that whatever effect Tm/Tn have on this subdomain, it is not discernible in any environmental changes of the probe. In the case of D51CAEDANS/C374S, addition of Tn to the F-actin·Tm complex increased the probe fluorescence by ∼10%. Yet, since Tn is added to actin-Tm in the presence of Ca2+, there should be no shift in Tm position, as both Tm alone and the Tm·Tn complex (+Ca2+) lie in the closed state (13Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 25Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As the presence or absence of Tm does not change the probe environment, the small effect of Tn on AEDANS fluorescence in this actin mutant appears unrelated to the state of regulated actin. This conclusion is confirmed by the lack of fluorescence differences between the blocked (−Ca2+) and closed(+Ca2+) regulatory states of this actin, indicating an absence of regulation-dependent changes in the probes environment. At this stage, the nature of the Tn-specific and Ca2+ insensitive perturbation at the Cys51 site on actin is unclear.The availability of the actin mutant Q41C with its two reactive cysteines, Cys41 and Cys374, allowed us to examine the subdomain 2/1 interface in regulated F-actin. Upon polymerization this double pyrene-labeled mutant exhibits an excimer, indicating the stacking of pyrene labels attached to Cys41and Cys374 on adjacent protomers within the same filament strand (37Kim E. Reisler E. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As reported under “Results,” neither the addition of regulatory proteins nor the switch from the blocked to theclosed state had any effect on the excimer fluorescence. This suggests that there is little, if any, change in the overlap of pyrene probes, and/or regulation-induced movement at the subdomain 2/1 interface in F-actin.Fluorescence Energy Transfer ExperimentsWe took advantage of the inherent sensitivity of FRET measurements to distance changes (in the donor-acceptor pair), and of the now available information on the relative fluorescence levels of the four actin tryptophans, to monitor possible subdomain 2 movements due to actin regulation.According to the Doyle et al. (45Doyle T. Hansen J.E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) analysis of tryptophan yeast actin mutants, the contributions of Trp79, Trp86, Trp340, and Trp356 to actin fluorescence are 1, 11, 37, and 51%, respectively, while theR0 value for the tryptophan-AEDANS donor-acceptor pair is 22 Å (47Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). These contributions permit the calculation of FRET efficiency in F-actin using the distances from the tryptophans to Gln41 and Asp51 derived from the Holmes et al. (48Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and Lorenz et al. (49Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) models of F-actin. Obviously, such calculations of intra- and inter-protomer FRET in F-actin are model-dependent and their predictive value is further reduced by the unknown orientation of AEDEANS at the Cys41 and Cys51 sites. Despite these limitations and regardless of the exact partitioning of energy transfer between the different tryptophan residues, these calculations provide strong evidence for a major contribution to FRET by the inter-protomer (on adjacent actins within the same strand) transfer of energy from Trp340 and Trp356 to AEDANS on either Cys41 on Cys51. This conclusion is consistent with the much greater efficiency of FRET in F- than in G-actin (Figs. 3 A and 5 A). Thus, changes in AEDANS fluorescence during excitation at 295 nm (i.e. at the tryptophan excitation band) should monitor, to a large extent, distance changes between the probe and Trp340 and Trp356on the adjacent protomer.Our main results show that the stimulated fluorescence of AEDANS attached to either Cys41 or Cys51 does not change upon the binding of Tm to F-actin or upon the switch of the actin·Tm·Tn complex from the blocked to theclosed state (EGTA/Ca2+ switch). The fact that acceptor probes located at two different sites in subdomain 2 yield the same results regarding distance changes during Ca2+regulation of these well regulated actins suggests that subdomain 2 remains static during this process. Our strategy of probing (by FRET) distance changes from tryptophan donors to two acceptor sites makes it unlikely that a movement of subdomain 2 escapes our detection due to compensating changes in energy transfer. Moreover, the absence of any perturbation of the pyrene excimer band in the course of regulatory transitions in Q41C yeast actin adds credence to the static picture of subdomain 2.ANP-labeled Skeletal α-ActinOur experiments involving the yeast actin mutants were limited to evaluating two states of the “three-state model” of actin regulation (46McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar); theblocked and closed states. The transition to theopen state requires the presence of S1, which would introduce additional energy donors to the environment of the AEDANS probes on actin. We were able to surmount this complication by using ANP-labeled (at Gln41) α-actin and monitoring the quenching of rhodamine phalloidin fluorescence by ANP. The ANP-labeled actin allowed us to look for subdomain 2 movements during the shift to the open state since the presence of S1 has no effect on rhodamine fluorescence. Not only did this particular experiment allow us to “fill-in the gap” left by our yeast actin mutant experiments, it provided yet another donor/acceptor configuration (with rhodamine phalloidin as a donor) for following actin regulatory transitions. Our results show no significant differences in energy transfer between rhodamine and ANP in any of the actin regulatory states, including theopen state (Table II). These findings confirm our results obtained with AEDANS-labeled actin mutants, namely, that there seem to be no significant movements of subdomain 2 during actin regulation.The labeling of the skeletal actin with ANP had the additional advantage of allowing us to arrest subdomain 2 movement through the cross-linking of Gln41 to Cys374 on adjacent protomers (18Hegyi G. Mak M. Kim E. Elzinga M. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17784-17792Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We found that despite this modification, which significantly impairs the motility of F-actin, the thin filaments remained regulated. This outcome alone does not preclude subdomain 2 movement during regulation; it simply demonstrates that such movement is not a requirement for regulation, and it serves to reinforce our results from the previous experiments that indicate no discernible regulation-based subdomain 2 movements.Care must always be exercised in interpreting data generated through the use of probes. Probes may affect the characteristics of their host proteins and alter the dynamic properties of mobile sites. In the case of labeled actins, probes may stabilize or destabilize DNase I loop/C terminus interactions, or even produce a particular conformation that may not reflect normal function. However, the fact that the probes did not introduce marked changes in the in vitro motility of the actins, and especially in the regulation of their acto-S1 ATPase activities, indicates that they do not introduce noteworthy changes in the actins. Moreover, our multiple experiments, each yielding similar results, suggest that subdomain 2 movements seem neither to occur during, nor play an important role in, the regulation of actin by tropomyosin and troponin. Descriptions of the molecular mechanism of muscle function tend to focus on the dynamic properties of the myosin motor or the steric shift of the tropomyosin/troponin (Tm1·Tn) complex on actin. Actin appears to take the role of a static, rigid lattice upon which the other muscle proteins shift in order to produce and regulate muscle movement. However, with numerous studies showing the dynamic nature of filamentous actin (F-actin), this may not, in fact, be the case. F-actin, depending on the ligands bound and/or the stage in the cross-bridge cycle, becomes more or less flexible (2Oosawa F. Stracher A. Muscle and Non-muscle Motility. 1.

J. 1996; 70: 1439-1446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating direct or indirect interactions between subdomain 2 and the myosin head (S1). Modifications of the C-terminal Cys374 are also known to cause reagent-dependent changes in the actomyosin ATPase activity and the in vitro motility of actin filaments (7Crosbie R.H. Miller C. Cheung P. Goodnight T. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1957-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, there are certainly strong indications that the dynamic properties of actin in general, and of subdomain 2 in particular, may play important roles in actomyosin interactions. The position of Tm on F-actin has been modeled to a high degree of resolution (13Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 24Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P.

Residues likely involved in Tm-F-actin interactions, as suggested by these models, are all located in subdomains 3 and 4. While subdomain 2 does not seem to be involved in the Tm-F-actin interaction, an interesting biochemical study by Bonafé et al. (28Bonafé N. Mathieu M. Kassab R. Chaussepied P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) implicates (either through direct or indirect effects) the DNase I loop of subdomain 2 in such an interaction. In this study the presence of Tm and the Tm·Tn complex interfered with the cross-linking of Lys50 of actin to the central 48 kDa of the S1 heavy chain. This inhibition of cross-linking indicates Tm- and Tm/Tn-induced changes in either the reactivities of, and/or the distances between, the cross-linking sites on actin and S1. A more explicit suggestion of subdomain 2 movement during actin regulation was advanced by Squire and Morris (1Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in their review on muscle thin filament regulation. According to their hypothesis, the structural changes seen in electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction studies of regulated thin filaments may be due not only to shifts of the Tm·Tn complex, but also to subdomain movements within each actin protomer. This hypothesis, together with the results of Bonaféet al. (28Bonafé N. Mathieu M. Kassab R. Chaussepied P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the role of subdomain 2 movements in the regulatory process. To study the role of subdomain 2 in the Tm/Tn regulation of actomyosin, we attached fluorescent probes (1,5-IAEDANS or pyrene maleimide) to three fully functional mutant yeast actins, Q41C/C374S, D51C/C374S, and Q41C at positions 41 or 51, and in the case of Q41C, also at position 374 (Fig. 1). The first two mutants have the reactive Cys374 replaced by Ser and new reactive cysteine residues replacing Gln41 and Asp51, respectively. The third mutant retains the reactive Cys374 while adding an additional reactive cysteine in place of Gln41. Using these labeled mutants, we monitored their fluorescence by means of direct excitation, energy transfer, and, in the case of the doubly labeled Q41C, excimer fluorescence during the various regulatory steps. We also used Gln41/ANP (azidonitrophenyl putrescine)-labeled α-skeletal actin (both cross-linked and uncross-linked) in conjunction with rhodamine phalloidin, and in this way, measured the quenching of rhodamine fluorescence by ANP during regulation. Also, using the cross-linked species, we were able to investigate the regulatory properties of F-actin with an immobilized subdomain 2. Our results show that there are no significant changes in the probe environment, nor in the relative position of subdomain 2, in the course of Ca2+ regulation by Tm/Tn. In addition, we found that despite intrastrand cross-linking, the ANP-labeled α-skeletal actin remained fully"

In this work, stalk segments S4 and S5 of the yeast H+-ATPase were examined for helical character, optimal length, and segment orientation by a combination of proline substitution, insertion/deletion mutagenesis, and second-site suppressor analyses. The substitution of various residues for helix-disrupting proline in both S4 (L353P,L353G; A354P; and G371P) and S5 (D676P and I684P) resulted in highly defective or inactive enzymes supporting the importance of helical character and/or the maintenance of essential interactions. The contiguous helical nature of transmembrane segment M5 and stalk element S5 was explored and found to be favorable, although not essential. The deletion or addition of one or more amino acids at positions Ala354 in S4 and Asp676 in S5, which were intended to either rotate helical faces or extend/reduce the length of helical segments, resulted in enzyme destabilization that abolished most enzyme assembly. Second-site suppressor mutations were obtained to primary site mutations G371A (S4) and D676G (S5) and were analyzed with a molecular structure model of the H+-ATPase. Primary site mutations were predicted to alter the site of phosphorylation either directly or indirectly. The suppressor mutations either directly changed packing around the primary site or altered the environment of the site of phosphorylation. Overall, these data support the view that stalk segments S4 and S5 of the H+-ATPase are helical elements that are optimized for length and interactions with other stalk elements and can influence the phosphorylation domain.

It belongs to the superfamily of P-type ion-translocating ATPases for which there are more than 150 members known (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The fungal H+-ATPase is a class II, non-heavy metal-transporting enzyme that includes the plant H+-ATPase and the animal Na+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and H+,K+-ATPase (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). It couples ATP hydrolysis in the cytoplasmic domain to ion transport in the membrane-embedded domain forming an acyl-phosphate intermediate during catalysis. Recently, the molecular structure of the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a)1 was solved at 2.6-Å resolution (3Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). As expected, it confirmed a membrane transport domain with 10 transmembrane segments, a large cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis domain, and a narrow stalk domain that links the cytoplasmic and membrane domains. The cytoplasmic region consists of three well separated domains, with the phosphorylation site in the central catalytic domain assuming a fold similar to haloacid dehalogenase and the adenosine-binding site formed 25 Å away on another domain (3Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). These essential features are conserved among P-type enzymes despite wide ranges in amino acid conservation between family members. A detailed comparison of 8 Å structures (4Stokes D.L. Auer M. Zhang P. Kuhlbrandt W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) of the H+-ATPase from Neurospora (5Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and the Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum (6Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Greene M.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) confirmed that important structural properties are highly conserved. There is extensive evidence that dynamic changes in protein structure occur during catalysis (7Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 8Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Jorgensen P.L. Nielsen J.M. Rasmussen J.H. Pedersen P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how conformational changes in the catalytic region are transmitted to the transmembrane domain. It has been suggested that positional changes in the stalk segments could play a role in mediating the coupling process (10Kaplan J.H. Gatto C. Holden J.P. Thornewell S.J. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 99-105PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the Ca2+-ATPase, the stalk region is ∼24 Å long and is divided into four largely helical, rod-like structures (3Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar,6Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Greene M.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 12Toyoshima C. Sasabe H. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The stalk densities are not as apparent in the 8-ÅNeurospora H+-ATPase structure, which likely reflects an open conformation being used to derive structural information (5Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the helical stalk region is expected to provide a direct physical linkage between functional domains involved in ATP hydrolysis and ion transport. The H+-ATPase stalk segments, designated S2 (Gln164–Val189), S3 (Gly270–Asn291), S4 (Val348–Val372), and S5 (Gly670–Tyr689), are the cytoplasmic extensions from transmembrane segments M2, M3, M4 and M5, respectively. Segments M4–6 have been implicated in ion binding/release (13Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). S4 and S5 are presumed to play a pivotal role in coupling because they are contiguous with these transmembrane segments and are directly linked to the nucleotide binding-phosphorylation domain (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). S4 is within 10 residues or 2.5 helix turns from the site of phosphorylation, Asp378. A mutation in the Ca2+-ATPase, Y763G, near the membrane interface of S5 uncouples ion transport from ATP hydrolysis (14Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the Ca2+-ATPase structure, M5–S5 is a long, centrally oriented, contiguous helical segment that forms a “mast-like” element extending from the outer membrane surface to the center of the cytosolic domain (3Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the helical properties of S2 and S3 are important to enzyme function (15Soteropoulos P. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26426-26431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this report, we have extended that analysis to examine the importance of helical character in S4 and S5, which are more directly linked to coupling of ion transport. In addition, we have examined spatial interactions of S4 and S5 by identifying second site suppressor mutations that reverse the defective phenotypes observed from point mutations within the stalk segments. Our results strongly support the view that the helical properties of stalk segments S4 and S5 are important for H+-ATPase function, and the length of these segments as well as the juxtaposition of helical faces are optimized to interact with the phosphorylation domain. Primary site mutations generated in vitro were transformed into yeast strain SH122 (HO ade6-1 trp5-1 leu2-1 lys1-1 ura3-1 pma1Δ::LEU2/PMA1) (16Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J.

Some suppressor mutations were isolated in the strain YAK2 (MATα ade2-101 leu2Δ1 his3-Δ200, ura3-52 trp1Δ63 lys2-801 pma1Δ::HIS3 pma2-Δ::TRP1) (18de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P.

Site-directed mutants were created in plasmids pGW201 (19Wang G. Tamas M.J. Hall M.J. Pascual-Ahuir A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For chromosomal integration, a 6.1-kilobase pair HindIII fragment containing a desiredpma1 mutation linked to URA3 was transplaced into yeast strain SH122. Isogenic pma1 mutants were isolated as described by Harris et al. (16Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All transformations were performed using the Alkali-Cation Yeast Transformation Kit (Bio 101). pma1 mutants were grown in a 3-ml YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, pH 5.7) culture for 18–20 h, and chromosomal DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). The PMA1 structural gene was amplified as a 3.5-kilobase pair fragment by the polymerase chain reaction using flanking primers (5′-GCTCCCCTCCATTAGTTTCG and 5′-GCGTGTTGTGAATTGTGC). PCR products were purified by the Wizard PCR Preps Purification System (Promega). All mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis of PCR-amplified products. Suppressor mutations were generated by treating vector pRS201ΔURA3 containing the primary site mutation with 1 m hydroxylamine HCl, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm EDTA for 1–2 h at 75 °C. Hydroxylamine was removed from the plasmid using the Wizard PCR Preps Purification System (Promega). Additional suppressor mutations were generated by passing the plasmid through an XL1-Red mutator Escherichia coli strain (Stratagene). The mutagenized plasmids were used to transform the strain YAK2 (18de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), as described above. The transformed YAK2 were cured of their primary plasmid by plating on media containing 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid, 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.2% (w/v) CSM-URA, 2% (w/v) dextrose, 50 μg/ml uracil, 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid, 2% agar). After 5 days of growth, colonies were isolated and suppressors selected on the basis of full or partial reversion to wild type growth. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard Plasmid Purification Kit (Promega), and suppressor mutations were located by DNA sequence analysis of the entire gene. Resistance to hygromycin B was determined on YPD agar plates containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (20McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). pH-dependent growth measurements were made on YPD agar at pH 2.5 with 20 mm acetate added or in liquid YPD with 20 mm acetate and the pH ranging from 2.5 to 8.0, as described previously (21Seto-Young D. Na S. Monk B.C. Haber J.E. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth rates were evaluated by inoculating a 50-ml culture of YPD (to A590 ∼0.2) with stationary phase cultures of pma1 mutants and growing cells with shaking at 30 or 37 °C. Aliquots (0.3 ml) were removed every hour, and the optical density at 590 nm was determined. Plasma membranes were isolated from cells grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C, as described previously (22Seto-Young D. Monk B.C. Perlin D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Secretory vesicles were isolated as described Nakamoto et al. (17Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis assays were performed in 96-well microplates, as described in Wang et al. (19Wang G. Tamas M.J. Hall M.J. Pascual-Ahuir A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25438-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of ATP hydrolysis was determined in a standard reaction medium with the pH adjusted to 4.5–8.5. Vanadate sensitivity was measured in a standard reaction containing 0–100 μm sodium vanadate. Kinetic parametersKm and Vmax were determined by measuring ATP hydrolysis with equimolar (1:1) complexes of ATP and MgSO4 from 0 to 10 mm. Glucose-dependent medium acidification by carbon-starved cells was examined, as described previously (23Soteropoulos P. Wang G. Perlin D.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar). All mutations were identified by DNA sequence analysis at the New York University Medical Center Sequencing Facility. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed using pre-cast 10% minigels (NOVEX). Relative protein abundance measurements were made by gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, as described previously (21Seto-Young D. Na S. Monk B.C. Haber J.E. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning proline mutagenesis has been used to probe the helical properties of stalk segments S2 and S3 (15Soteropoulos P. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26426-26431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This approach was extended to assess the importance of helical backbone structure in S4 and S5 by making strategic substitutions in largely non-conserved residues near the ends of the two stalk segments. Table I shows the positions of these mutations and their affects on cell viability, H+-ATPase-dependent growth phenotypes, hygromycin B resistance, low pH sensitivity (20McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Soteropoulos P. Wang G. Perlin D.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar), enzyme kinetics, and sensitivity to orthovanadate. The substitution of proline in S4 for residues Leu353 and Ala354 near the membrane interface of M4 and at Gly371 resulted in defective enzymes incapable of supporting growth. A L353G mutation was also highly disruptive. In each case, the introduction of other amino acid substitutions produced active enzymes, which demonstrated that the disruptive propensity of proline, and in some cases glycine, was most likely due to its affect on backbone structure and not on amino side group character. An S368P substitution was viable, although the cells grew slowly and the enzyme displayed less than 50% of normal catalytic activity (Table I). Several mutations (e.g. S368F) at this position are known to induce >500-fold decreases in vanadate sensitivity (16Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the viable S368P mutant was fully vanadate-sensitive (Table I). However, a G371A mutation did show ∼10-fold less vanadate sensitivity consistent with a recent study of this region (24Ambesi A. Miranda M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The viable mutant enzymes, L353I, A354G, G371A, and S386P, showed normal Km values and sensitivity to vanadate and, other than S368P, showed Vmaxlevels that were ≥78% of wild type enzyme.Table IGrowth phenotypes and kinetic properties of glycine/proline pma1 mutantsMutantLocationGrowthDoublingKmVmaxVanadateLow pHHyg Bminmmμmol Pimg−1μmGW201+++−73 ± 11.6 ± 0.13.7 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.1pma1 L353G4Lethalpma1 L353I4+++−74 ± 31.0 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.61.3 ± 0.3pma1 L353P4Lethalpma1 A354G4++++72 ± 10.6 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.40.6 ± 0.1pma1 A354P4Lethalpma1 S368P4−+++136 ± 50.8 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.1pma1 G371A4−+++69 ± 11.2 ± 0.24.2 ± 1.18.0 ± 1.0pma1 G371P4Lethalpma1 P669A5++++70 ± 11.0 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.1pma1 P669G5++++73 ± 21.0 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.1pma1 D676A5+++−72 ± 20.8 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.1pma1 D676G5−+++82 ± 11.4 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.72.1 ± 0.4pma1 D676P5Lethalpma1 D676R5−+++94 ± 11.4 ± 0.42.3 ± 0.51.6 ± 0.1pma1 I684A5+++−72 ± 11.7 ± 0.24.8 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.3pma1 I684G5−−96 ± 11.9 ± 0.33.5 ± 0.90.9 ± 0.2pma1 I684P5Lethal1-a Growth at low pH was determined in YPD at pH 3.0 with 20 mm acetate.1-b Hygromycin B resistance (Hyg B) was assessed on YPD agar with 200 μg/ml hygromycin.1-c Values represent the S.E.

The prominent growth defects induced by the S368P mutation were most pronounced when assessing the proton transport properties of this mutant. Fig. 1 shows a detailed profile for pH-dependent growth in which the S368P mutant was most sensitive to acidic medium conditions. This enzyme appeared less competent in regulating intracellular pH via the H+-ATPase. The kinetic defect in this enzyme was apparent when examining whole-cell proton efflux mediated by the H+-ATPase from carbon-starved cells (Fig. 2). In this case, S368P pumped protons routinely at a rate 55–65% (n = 3) that of wild type enzyme or other mutants, which is consistent with its reduced Vmax in vitro. Mutant enzymes A354G and G371A were somewhat less efficient (15–20%) than wild type (Fig. 2). Interestingly, both of these enzymes showed rates of ATP hydrolysis that were >92% of wild type (Table I), suggesting that they may be partially uncoupled. Most of the other mutants showed wild type-like rates of H+-ATPase-mediated proton transport.Figure 2H+-ATPase-mediated medium acidification. Carbon-starved cells were incubated in weakly buffered medium, and H+-ATPase-mediated proton efflux was assessed by following medium acidification with the pH indicator dye bromphenol blue. Changes in the initial linear rate of acid efflux relative to wild type (GW201) were taken as differences in the rate of H+-ATPase-mediated proton efflux. Each point is the average of three measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the Ca2+-ATPase, M5 and S5 form a contiguous, long central helical element (3Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) that has been proposed to play a critical role in the coupling reaction (25Sorensen T.L. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Ca2+-ATPase and related higher eukaryotic enzymes, the fungal H+-ATPase has a naturally occurring proline, Pro669, as well as a Gly670, near the M5 interface, which should disrupt helical continuity in this region and create hinge-like flexibility. The conversion of Pro669 to glycine and alanine had modest effects on enzyme function (Table I), suggesting that backbone flexibility is not important at this position. In contrast, the introduction of proline at both Asp676 and Ile684 at opposite ends of S5 resulted in highly defective enzymes incapable of supporting growth. As observed with S4 mutations, the introduction of either glycine or alanine at these positions was well tolerated by the enzyme (Table I). These results suggest that helical character of S5 is important for function. Mutations D676R and D676G, but not D676A, produced enzymes with low rates of ATP hydrolysis, hygromycin B resistance, and low pH sensitivity indicative of a highly defective enzyme (Table I; Fig. 1). Whole-cell proton transport assays also confirmed that these mutant enzymes were less efficient in H+-ATPase-directed proton transport (Fig. 2). It is likely that side group mass at this position is more important than charge. The prominent growth characteristics of mutants G371A in S4 and D676G in S5 permitted the isolation of second-site suppressor mutations to evaluate short and long range protein-protein interactions. Spontaneous suppressor mutants were readily isolated but generally resulted in gene replacement events that restored the wild type PMA1 gene. To promote the generation of second site suppressor mutations, plasmid pRS201ΔURA3 containing a primary site mutation was either chemically mutagenized by treatment with hydroxylamine or passaged through a bacterial mutator strain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Suppressors to G371A were found at M405I and P535L, both located within the catalytic domain, and T608I, located in stalk segment S5. One suppressor mutation of D676G resulted from two second site mutations at E288K and V562I, which are located in Stalk segment S3 and the catalytic domain, respectively. The two other D676G suppressors were found at V748I in the cytoplasmic turn between membrane segments M6 and M7 and G888S in transmembrane segment M9. All suppressor mutations restored phenotypic wild type growth and yielded enzymes that had rates of ATP hydrolysis that were 100% of wild type for G371A and 81% for D676G. Whole-cell proton transport assays also indicated that the suppressor mutations largely restored wild type proton transport function (not shown). The helical character of the stalk elements was further probed by single residue deletion and sequential four amino acid insertions (i + 1 … i + 4) around Asp354 in S4 and Asp676 in S5. The deletion and alanine insertion mutants were expressed in a secretory vesicle system (17Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to better determine the biochemical properties of the mutant H+-ATPase enzymes. Fig. 3shows the level of assembled enzyme and rates of ATP hydrolysis for the mutant enzymes. The data indicate that both S4 and S5 are highly sensitive to changes in the helical axis. In all cases, except for a single alanine insertion in S4, the deletion and addition mutations were highly disruptive resulting in an unstable enzyme that assembled poorly, even in the Sec vesicles. These mutants were highly reminiscent of assembly defects encountered with mutations of the phosphorylation site, Asp378 close to S4 (26DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A single alanine addition was tolerated resulting in a largely assembled enzyme (65% of wild type) with only 35% of wild type enzyme activity. The P-type ATPase stalk region is widely viewed as a mediator of energy coupling between the catalytic ATP binding/hydrolysis and ion translocation domain. Genetic evidence from several systems support this view by demonstrating that mutations in several stalk elements either partially or fully uncouple ion transport from ATP hydrolysis. These mutations include I183A in S2 (19Wang G. Tamas M.J. Hall M.J. Pascual-Ahuir A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25438-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), G158D near the S2/M2 interface (27Anand S. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), H285Q in S3 (28Wach A. Supply P. Dufour J.-P. Goffeau A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) of the yeast H+-ATPase, and Y763G in the S5 (14Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) of the Ca2+-ATPase. The Y763G mutation in S5 has been proposed to directly modulate coupling via an affect on M5/M6, which has been implicated in ion binding (11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Shin J.M. Sachs G. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13737-13740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a K758I mutation in the Ca2+-ATPase leads to changes in the rates of dephosphorylation and Ca2+ binding (30Sorensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and perturbations in S3 produced by either mutation or the binding of the inhibitor thapsigargin interfere with energy coupling (31Ma H. Zhong L. Inesi G. Fortea I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this work, the helical character and length of stalk segments S4 and S5 of the yeast H+-ATPase were shown to be important for enzyme function and stability. The substitution of various residues for helix-disrupting proline (or in some cases glycine) in both S4 (L353P,L353G; A354P; and G371P) and S5 (D676P and I684P) resulted in highly defective or inactive enzymes (Table I). In each case, substitutions with residues other than proline restored normal or near-normal enzymatic function (Table I). Deletion or addition of one or more amino acids at positions Ala354 in S4 and Asp676 in S5, intended to either rotate helical faces or extend/reduce the length of helical segments, were in most cases deleterious resulting in enzyme destabilization that significantly decreased enzyme assembly (Fig. 3). The assembly defects observed were comparable to those observed by mutation of Asp378, the site of phosphorylation, and neighboring residues (26DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Ambesi A. Miranda M. Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 155-160PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that S4 and S5 play more than a simple structural role bridging the catalytic phosphorylation and nucleotide binding domains to the membrane-embedded ion transport domain. Rather, the helical elements are juxtaposed or packed in an optimal manner that is not highly flexible. Scanning alanine mutagenesis of S4 by Ambesi et al. (24Ambesi A. Miranda M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) supports the notion that side group interactions are essential in this segment. A sided preference was observed for inactivating mutations from Lys362 to Leu375 which may define potential interaction sites. These authors further demonstrated that various mutations in consecutive residues Ile359 through Gly371 produced enzymes with significantly reduced sensitivity to orthovanadate. Similarly, G371A in this study showed a 10-fold reduced vanadate sensitivity. This behavior is linked to a shift in E1–E2equilibrium toward the vanadate-insensitive E1conformation. It is supported by previous studies on vanadate insensitivity (16Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21857-21864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by related studies on yeast H+-ATPase M4 (34Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and S4 (24Ambesi A. Miranda M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as S4 in the Ca2+-ATPase. In the latter study, mutations in the S4 region altered E1–E2and/or Ca2+·E1P → Ca2+·E2-P transitions suggesting that this segment links phosphorylation and Ca2+ binding (35Garnett C. Sumbilla C. Belda F.F. Chen L. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11019-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that perturbations in S4 are linked directly to changes in the disposition of the site of phosphorylation Asp378. In the 2.6-Å resolution structure of the Ca2+-ATPase, S5 and M5 form a long continuous α-helical structure of ∼60 Å that spans the membrane domain and a significant portion of the cytoplasmic domain. It is worth noting that a naturally occurring proline, Pro669, occurs at the interface of S5 and M5 in the yeast H+-ATPase. This proline could disrupt the continuity of the extended M5-S5 helical segment observed in the Ca2+-ATPase. However, it is likely that the distortion imposed by the naturally occurring proline is minimal since Pro669 can be converted to alanine thereby restoring helical integrity with little affect on enzyme behavior (Table I). This behavior may reflect the fact that Pro669 lies at the interface of helical elements constrained by different dielectric environments and/or through close interactions with other stalk and membrane elements. The directed proline mutagenesis, helix lengthening, and shortening and twisting of stalk segment S5 in this work supports the importance of an optimized helical element. This likely results from the location of specific residues on one or more faces of the helix to form critical interactions. In fact, saturation mutagenesis of S5 2M. Miranda and C. W. Slayman, unpublished observations. revealed two faces of the helix that tolerate mutation poorly and may be potential regions of interaction. Assorted S5 mutations in the Ca2+-ATPase alter the rate of the reaction sequence Hn E2→ Ca2 E1 associated with Ca2+ binding on sites at the cytoplasmic face sites and on the rate of the dephosphorylation of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme, Hn E2P → Hn E2 (25Sorensen T.L. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). S5 is likely to play a pivotal role in mediating communication between the Ca2+-binding pocket and the catalytic domain. In addition, a critically conserved residue, Arg751, appears important for both structural and functional integrity of the enzyme (25Sorensen T.L. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). S5 is linked directly to the transmembrane ion binding domain composed of M4–M6, and M8, through its connection with M5. The intramolecular rearrangement of stalk segments during catalysis remains obscure. The analysis of second site suppressor mutations (SSSM) enables short and long range interactions within a protein to be explored. In the current context, the presumptive behavior of primary and secondary site mutations were analyzed by superposition of the yeast H+-ATPase primary sequence on conserved portions of the molecular coordinates of the SERCA Ca2+-ATPase (Fig.4). Primary site mutation G371A lies on the edge of stalk 4, seven residues upstream of the site of phosphorylation Asp378 (Fig. 4). This mutation introduces a slightly bulkier side group at this position suggesting some steric crowding. Given its proximity to Asp378 and the finding that mutations in this region influence the phosphorylation state of the enzyme (32Ambesi A. Miranda M. Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 155-160PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the G371A mutation alters the environment around Asp378 via main chain interactions involving twisting or other distortions. The introduction of proline at this position was highly destabilizing resulting in a non-viable enzyme (Table I). Second site mutations appear to have both short and long range effects that in each case stabilize the main chain containing Asp378. SSSM T680I lies on an adjacent descending chain and shows close contact with the primary site mutation G371A. The side group change may relieve some steric crowding introduced by the primary site mutation. SSSM P535L lies within the highly conserved sequence D534PPR, which has been linked to coordination of Mg2+ ions (36Farley R.A. Heart E. Kabalin M. Putnam D. Wang K. Kasho V.N. Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This side group and backbone change may compensate for the primary site effect by directly impacting the environment around Asp378, perhaps by making it more favorable for phosphate transfer through a decreased polarity. SSSM M405I lies 27 residues downstream of the phosphorylation site. In the Ca2+-ATPase structure, this residue lies at the end of an elongated chain that turns abruptly back toward the membrane. It may exert its effects via main chain twisting, but there is no indication that the chain is sufficiently structured to facilitate such a molecular distortion. Rather, in the H+-ATPase, it appears more likely that M405I actually lies closer to Asp378 because the next 62 of 82 residues, including the immediately following 34 residues of the SERCA pump, are absent in the yeast enzyme (Fig. 4). This gap is predicted to bring M405I much closer to Asp378 in which the isoleucine side group can more directly impact the environment of the site of phosphorylation. Overall, it is suggested the primary impact of the G371A mutation is to alter the environment around Asp378, and the role of the second site suppressor mutations is to restore a more normal environment either by changing the immediate environment or altering the main chain distortion. Primary site mutation D676G on stalk 5 is complemented by SSSM V748I, G888S, and E288K,V562I. Asp676 is upstream of the highly conserved Asp634 and Asp638, which are presumed to help coordinate nucleotide-bound divalent cation (37Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Collet J.F. Stroobant V. van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33985-33990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One likely effect is that the D676G mutation alters this coordination. SSSM E288K maps to stalk segment S3 that lies in the same horizontal plane as D676G, suggesting a close interaction during catalysis. SSSM V748I maps to the cytoplasmic region between M6 and M7 further suggesting another potential interaction with S5. Finally, V562I lies just outside the conserved motif LTGD560. In the haloacid dehalogenase family, the highly conserved residue, Ser118, which is equivalent to PMA1 Thr558, is believed to form a hydrogen bond with substrate carboxylate (37Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Collet J.F. Stroobant V. van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33985-33990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The V562I mutation may help increase this interaction, which was diminished by the primary site mutation D676G. In this scenario, changes in S5 are strongly linked to changes in nucleotide binding at the catalytic site. The wide distribution of second site suppressor mutations clustering on protein structure elements that directly or indirectly impinge upon the catalytic Asp378 suggests that the conformational dynamics of the enzyme are highly dependent on the phosphorylation state of this residue, as expected. More generally, this work suggests that second site suppressor studies, when coupled with a working molecular structure model, can yield valuable information about local protein structure interactions and dynamics. Such studies can be especially useful when evaluating interactions occurring as a result of a primary site mutation that alters a short lived conformational state. Overall, the results in this study provide evidence that stalk segments S4 and S5 of the yeast H+-ATPase are optimized helical elements that are closely linked to phosphorylation events occurring within the catalytic site."
