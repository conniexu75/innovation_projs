The currently predominant view is that literary fiction—often described as narratives that focus on in-depth portrayals of subjects' inner feelings and thoughts—can be linked to theory of mind processes, especially those that are involved in the understanding or simulation of the affective characteristics of the subjects. Kidd and Castano (p. 377 , published online 3 October) provide experimental evidence that reading passages of literary fiction, in comparison to nonfiction or popular fiction, does indeed enhance the reader's performance on theory of mind tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2096290681,"The recognition of autophagy related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) as a genetic risk factor has exposed the critical role of autophagy in Crohn's disease. Homozygosity for the highly prevalent ATG16L1 risk allele, or murine hypomorphic (HM) activity, causes Paneth cell dysfunction. As Atg16l1(HM) mice do not develop spontaneous intestinal inflammation, the mechanism(s) by which ATG16L1 contributes to disease remains obscure. Deletion of the unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription factor X-box binding protein-1 (Xbp1) in intestinal epithelial cells, the human orthologue of which harbours rare inflammatory bowel disease risk variants, results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Paneth cell impairment and spontaneous enteritis. Unresolved ER stress is a common feature of inflammatory bowel disease epithelium, and several genetic risk factors of Crohn's disease affect Paneth cells. Here we show that impairment in either UPR (Xbp1(ΔIEC)) or autophagy function (Atg16l1(ΔIEC) or Atg7(ΔIEC)) in intestinal epithelial cells results in each other's compensatory engagement, and severe spontaneous Crohn's-disease-like transmural ileitis if both mechanisms are compromised. Xbp1(ΔIEC) mice show autophagosome formation in hypomorphic Paneth cells, which is linked to ER stress via protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), elongation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Ileitis is dependent on commensal microbiota and derives from increased intestinal epithelial cell death, inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-regulated NF-κB activation and tumour-necrosis factor signalling, which are synergistically increased when autophagy is deficient. ATG16L1 restrains IRE1α activity, and augmentation of autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells ameliorates ER stress-induced intestinal inflammation and eases NF-κB overactivation and intestinal epithelial cell death. ER stress, autophagy induction and spontaneous ileitis emerge from Paneth-cell-specific deletion of Xbp1. Genetically and environmentally controlled UPR function within Paneth cells may therefore set the threshold for the development of intestinal inflammation upon hypomorphic ATG16L1 function and implicate ileal Crohn's disease as a specific disorder of Paneth cells."

https://openalex.org/W2030430693,"Nutrient deprivation is a stimulus shared by both autophagy and the formation of primary cilia. The recently discovered role of primary cilia in nutrient sensing and signalling motivated us to explore the possible functional interactions between this signalling hub and autophagy. Here we show that part of the molecular machinery involved in ciliogenesis also participates in the early steps of the autophagic process. Signalling from the cilia, such as that from the Hedgehog pathway, induces autophagy by acting directly on essential autophagy-related proteins strategically located in the base of the cilium by ciliary trafficking proteins. Whereas abrogation of ciliogenesis partially inhibits autophagy, blockage of autophagy enhances primary cilia growth and cilia-associated signalling during normal nutritional conditions. We propose that basal autophagy regulates ciliary growth through the degradation of proteins required for intraflagellar transport. Compromised ability to activate the autophagic response may underlie some common ciliopathies."

https://openalex.org/W2079525834,"The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that functions in sensory and signalling pathways. Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a group of genetic syndromes known as ciliopathies. However, the regulatory mechanisms of primary ciliogenesis in normal and cancer cells are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that autophagic degradation of a ciliopathy protein, OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1), at centriolar satellites promotes primary cilium biogenesis. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway in which cytosol, damaged organelles and protein aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for destruction. We show that the population of OFD1 at the centriolar satellites is rapidly degraded by autophagy upon serum starvation. In autophagy-deficient Atg5 or Atg3 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, OFD1 accumulates at centriolar satellites, leading to fewer and shorter primary cilia and a defective recruitment of BBS4 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4) to cilia. These defects are fully rescued by OFD1 partial knockdown that reduces the population of OFD1 at centriolar satellites. More strikingly, OFD1 depletion at centriolar satellites promotes cilia formation in both cycling cells and transformed breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally do not form cilia. This work reveals that removal of OFD1 by autophagy at centriolar satellites represents a general mechanism to promote ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings define a newly recognized role of autophagy in organelle biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1979099335,"Conform to the Norm Human societies have always enforced compliance with norms of acceptable behavior among their members by threatening punishment. It has been proposed that the human brain may have developed neural processes that support norm enforcement behavior and generate appropriate behavioral responses to social punishment threats. However, evidence for the neural circuitry underlying sanction-induced norm compliance in humans is limited. Using noninvasive brain stimulation, Ruff et al. (p. 482 , published online 10 October) observed that alteration of the activity and excitability of the right lateral prefrontal cortex affected norm compliance, without affecting awareness of the content of the respective norms, or the expected sanctions. These alterations were much larger in a social, as compared to a nonsocial, context."

Studying genetically modified mice lacking two receptors for the peptide hormone vasopressin under experimental conditions simulating jet lag, Yamaguchi et al. (p. 85 ; see the Perspective by Hastings ) concluded that vasopressin signaling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—a region of the brain known to control circadian rhythms—impedes adjustment to the environmental clock. Infusion of vasopressin receptor antagonists directly into the SCN of wild-type mice accelerated their recovery from jet lag, suggesting that this pathway may merit further investigation as a pharmacological target for treating jet lag."

Such universality, combined with the relationship between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer. We report on the quantitative measurement of the quantum limited heat flow for Fermi particles across a single electronic channel, using noise thermometry. The demonstrated agreement with the predicted $G_Q$ establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport. The achieved accuracy of below 10\% opens access to many experiments involving the quantum manipulation of heat."

https://openalex.org/W1994900858,"The development of strategies to eradicate primary human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells is a major challenge to the leukemia research field. In particular, primitive leukemia cells, often termed leukemia stem cells, are typically refractory to many forms of therapy. To investigate improved strategies for targeting of human AML cells we compared the molecular mechanisms regulating oxidative state in primitive (CD34(+)) leukemic versus normal specimens. Our data indicate that CD34(+) AML cells have elevated expression of multiple glutathione pathway regulatory proteins, presumably as a mechanism to compensate for increased oxidative stress in leukemic cells. Consistent with this observation, CD34(+) AML cells have lower levels of reduced glutathione and increased levels of oxidized glutathione compared with normal CD34(+) cells. These findings led us to hypothesize that AML cells will be hypersensitive to inhibition of glutathione metabolism. To test this premise, we identified compounds such as parthenolide (PTL) or piperlongumine that induce almost complete glutathione depletion and severe cell death in CD34(+) AML cells. Importantly, these compounds only induce limited and transient glutathione depletion as well as significantly less toxicity in normal CD34(+) cells. We further determined that PTL perturbs glutathione homeostasis by a multifactorial mechanism, which includes inhibiting key glutathione metabolic enzymes (GCLC and GPX1), as well as direct depletion of glutathione. These findings demonstrate that primitive leukemia cells are uniquely sensitive to agents that target aberrant glutathione metabolism, an intrinsic property of primary human AML cells."
https://openalex.org/W2150954587,"Animals display a repertoire of different social behaviours. Appropriate behavioural responses depend on sensory input received during social interactions. In mice, social behaviour is driven by pheromones, chemical signals that encode information related to age, sex and physiological state. However, although mice show different social behaviours towards adults, juveniles and neonates, sensory cues that enable specific recognition of juvenile mice are unknown. Here we describe a juvenile pheromone produced by young mice before puberty, termed exocrine-gland secreting peptide 22 (ESP22). ESP22 is secreted from the lacrimal gland and released into tears of 2- to 3-week-old mice. Upon detection, ESP22 activates high-affinity sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ, and downstream limbic neurons in the medial amygdala. Recombinant ESP22, painted on mice, exerts a powerful inhibitory effect on adult male mating behaviour, which is abolished in knockout mice lacking TRPC2, a key signalling component of the vomeronasal organ. Furthermore, knockout of TRPC2 or loss of ESP22 production results in increased sexual behaviour of adult males towards juveniles, and sexual responses towards ESP22-deficient juveniles are suppressed by ESP22 painting. Thus, we describe a pheromone of sexually immature mice that controls an innate social behaviour, a response pathway through the accessory olfactory system and a new role for vomeronasal organ signalling in inhibiting sexual behaviour towards young. These findings provide a molecular framework for understanding how a sensory system can regulate behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W1971010506,"Aggregated Tau proteins are hallmarks of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies. Recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated that both active and passive immunizations reduce Tau pathology and prevent cognitive decline in transgenic mice. To determine the efficacy and safety of targeting the prominent 396/404 region, we developed two novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with distinct binding profiles for phospho and non-phospho epitopes. The two mAbs significantly reduced hyperphosphorylated soluble Tau in long term brain slice cultures without apparent toxicity, suggesting the therapeutic importance of targeting the 396/404 region. In mechanistic studies, we found that neurons were the primary cell type that internalized the mAbs, whereas a small amount of mAbs was taken up by microglia cells. Within neurons, the two mAbs were highly colocalized with distinct pathological Tau markers, indicating their affinity toward different stages or forms of pathological Tau. Moreover, the mAbs were largely co-localized with endosomal/lysosomal markers, and partially co-localized with autophagy pathway markers. Additionally, the Fab fragments of the mAbs were able to enter neurons, but unlike the whole antibodies, the fragments were not specifically localized in pathological neurons. In summary, our Tau mAbs were safe and efficient to clear pathological Tau in a brain slice model. Fc-receptor-mediated endocytosis and the endosome/autophagosome/lysosome system are likely to have a critical role in antibody-mediated clearance of Tau pathology."

https://openalex.org/W1994224177,"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is well known for its ability to promote cell migration through deacetylation of its cytoplasmic substrates such as α-tubulin. However, how HDAC6 itself is regulated to control cell motility remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that one third of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton in cells. Yet, no connection between HDAC6 and ERK has been discovered. Here, for the first time, we reveal that ERK binds to and phosphorylates HDAC6 to promote cell migration via deacetylation of α-tubulin. We have identified two novel ERK-mediated phosphorylation sites: threonine 1031 and serine 1035 in HDAC6. Both sites were phosphorylated by ERK1 in vitro, whereas Ser-1035 was phosphorylated in response to the activation of EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in vivo. HDAC6-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts rescued by the nonphosphorylation mimicking mutant displayed significantly reduced cell migration compared with those rescued by the wild type. Consistently, the nonphosphorylation mimicking mutant exerted lower tubulin deacetylase activity in vivo compared with the wild type. These data indicate that ERK/HDAC6-mediated cell motility is through deacetylation of α-tubulin. Overall, our results suggest that HDAC6-mediated cell migration could be governed by EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1996682649,"Complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in mammalian mitochondria is an L-shaped assembly of 44 subunits. One arm is embedded in the inner membrane with the other protruding ∼100 Å into the matrix of the organelle. The extrinsic arm contains binding sites for NADH and the primary electron acceptor FMN, and it provides a scaffold for seven iron-sulfur clusters that form an electron pathway linking FMN to the terminal electron acceptor, ubiquinone, which is bound in the region of the junction between the arms. The membrane arm contains four antiporter-like domains, probably energetically coupled to the quinone site and involved in pumping protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space contributing to the proton motive force. Complex I is put together from preassembled subcomplexes. Their compositions have been characterized partially, and at least 12 extrinsic assembly factor proteins are required for the assembly of the complex. One such factor, NDUFAF7, is predicted to belong to the family of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases characterized by the presence in their structures of a seven-β-strand protein fold. In the present study, the presence of NDUFAF7 in the mitochondrial matrix has been confirmed, and it has been demonstrated that it is a protein methylase that symmetrically dimethylates the ω-N(G),N(G') atoms of residue Arg-85 in the NDUFS2 subunit of complex I. This methylation step occurs early in the assembly of complex I and probably stabilizes a 400-kDa subcomplex that forms the initial nucleus of the peripheral arm and its juncture with the membrane arm."
https://openalex.org/W2033265108,"The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay is widely used to capture interactions between chromatin and regulatory proteins, but it is unknown how stable most native interactions are. Although live-cell imaging suggests short-lived interactions at tandem gene arrays, current methods cannot measure rapid binding dynamics at single-copy genes. We show, by using a modified ChIP assay with subsecond temporal resolution, that the time dependence of formaldehyde cross-linking can be used to extract in vivo on and off rates for site-specific chromatin interactions varying over a ~100-fold dynamic range. By using the method, we show that a regulatory process can shift weakly bound TATA-binding protein to stable promoter interactions, thereby facilitating transcription complex formation. This assay provides an approach for systematic, quantitative analyses of chromatin binding dynamics in vivo."

We expressed and purified AtAMY3 from Escherichia coli and carried out a biochemical characterization of the protein to find factors that regulate its activity. Recombinant AtAMY3 was active toward both insoluble starch granules and soluble substrates, with a strong preference for β-limit dextrin over amylopectin. Activity was shown to be dependent on a conserved aspartic acid residue (Asp666), identified as the catalytic nucleophile in other plant α-amylases such as the barley AMY1. AtAMY3 released small linear and branched glucans from Arabidopsis starch granules, and the proportion of branched glucans increased after the predigestion of starch with a β-amylase. Optimal rates of starch digestion in vitro was achieved when both AtAMY3 and β-amylase activities were present, suggesting that the two enzymes work synergistically at the granule surface. We also found that AtAMY3 has unique properties among other characterized plant α-amylases, with a pH optimum of 7.5–8, appropriate for activity in the chloroplast stroma. AtAMY3 is also redox-regulated, and the inactive oxidized form of AtAMY3 could be reactivated by reduced thioredoxins.

https://openalex.org/W2087657929,"This study was aimed to characterize the depression-like behaviour in the classical model of chronic inflammation induced by Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA). Male Swiss mice received an intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of CFA (50 µl/paw) or vehicle. Behavioural and inflammatory responses were measured at different time-points (1 to 4 weeks), and different pharmacological tools were tested. The brain levels of IL-1β and BDNF, or COX-2 expression were also determined. CFA elicited a time-dependent edema formation and mechanical allodynia, which was accompanied by a significant increase in the immobility time in the tail suspension (TST) or forced-swimming (FST) depression tests. Repeated administration of the antidepressants imipramine (10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) and bupropion (30 mg/kg) significantly reversed depression-like behaviour induced by CFA. Predictably, the anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg), indomethacin (10 mg/kg) and celecoxib (30 mg/kg) markedly reduced CFA-induced edema. The oral treatment with the analgesic drugs dipyrone (30 and 300 mg/kg) or pregabalin (30 mg/kg) significantly reversed the mechanical allodyinia induced by CFA. Otherwise, either dipyrone or pregabalin (both 30 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the paw edema or the depressive-like behaviour induced by CFA, whereas the oral treatment with dipyrone (300 mg/kg) was able to reduce the immobility time in TST. Noteworthy, CFA-induced edema was reduced by bupropion (30 mg/kg), and depression behaviour was prevented by celecoxib (30 mg/kg). The co-treatment with bupropion and celecoxib (3 mg/kg each) significantly inhibited both inflammation and depression elicited by CFA. The same combined treatment reduced the brain levels of IL-1β, as well as COX-2 immunopositivity, whilst it failed to affect the reduction of BDNF levels. We provide novel evidence on the relationship between chronic inflammation and depression, suggesting that combination of antidepressant and anti-inflammatory agents bupropion and celecoxib might represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for depression."

In addition, the mechanisms underlying the increased levels of α7-nAChRs (in response to nicotine) in non-neuronal cells remain to be fully understood. Studies by Lam et al. (20Lam D.C. Girard L.

Nicotine increased the levels of α7-nAChR by transcriptional mechanisms involving the Sp1-GATA2 pathway in human keratinocytes (19Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Jolkovsky D.L. Pinkerton K.E.

Taken together, these observations suggest that nicotine can increase the levels of α7-nAChR by transcriptional mechanisms in non-neuronal cells. The α7-nAChR promoter has several binding sites for Sp1 (21Finlay-Schultz J. Canastar A. Short M. El Gazzar M. Coughlan C. Leonard S.

They performed siRNA experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays which showed that the GATA2 transcription factor was bound to the α7-nAChR promoter upon nicotine treatment (19Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Jolkovsky D.L. Pinkerton K.E. Grando S.A. Receptor-mediated tobacco toxicity.

They inferred that nicotine-induced α7-nAChR up-regulation was mediated by the Sp1-GATA2 pathway in human keratinocytes. It is known that the Sp1 protein can directly associate with the GATA family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression (24Molkentin J.D. The zinc finger-containing transcription factors GATA-4, -5, and -6. Ubiquitously expressed regulators of tissue-specific gene expression.J. Biol.

Based on these results we decided to investigate whether the Sp1-GATA pathway was responsible for nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR in human SCC-Ls. Data from several laboratories have shown that α7-nAChRs do not undergo long term inactivation after chronic exposure to nicotine at levels that are present in the plasma of heavy and light smokers (16Fenster C.P. Rains M.F. Noerager B. Quick M.W. Lester R.A. Influence of subunit composition on desensitization of neuronal acetylcholine receptors at low concentrations of nicotine.J.

Up-regulation of nuclear factor-κB expression by SLURP-1 is mediated by α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and involves both ionic events and activation of protein kinases.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C903-C911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have shown that the biological activity of nAChRs in non-neuronal cells can be attributed to both ion channel-dependent and ion channel-independent events. The ion channel-independent events include activation of protein kinases, second messengers, and transcription factors (28Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Galitovskiy V. Qian J. Grando S.A. Up-regulation of nuclear factor-κB expression by SLURP-1 is mediated by α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and involves both ionic events and activation of protein kinases.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C903-C911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that a large fraction of α7-nAChRs are biologically functional during sustained nicotine exposure (10Schuller H.M. Regulatory role of the α7nAChR in cancer.Curr. Drug Targets. 2012; 13: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present manuscript we show that nicotine up-regulates α7-nAChR expression in human SCC-L cells and in chicken chorioallantoic membrane models. Similarly, the levels of α7-nAChR in human SCC-L tumors isolated from patients (who are active smokers) correlate with their smoking history and amount of cigarette consumption. Luciferase assays revealed that nicotine increased transcription of α7-nAChR in human SCC-Ls. RNAi experiments showed that nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR was mediated by GATA4 and GATA6. Finally, chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that nicotine induced the recruitment of Sp1-GATA4 or Sp1-GATA6 complexes on the α7-nAChR promoter, inducing its transcription and increasing its expression in human SCC-Ls. The reason we decided to study the mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR is that it may have considerable implications in the pathophysiology of human lung cancers. This is especially true of human SCC-L whose development is closely associated with smoking habits, more so than other non-small cell lung cancers (3Lee P.N. Forey B.A. Coombs K.J.

Systematic review of observational studies with meta-analysis.BMJ. 2010; 340: b5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). People usually smoke for decades before being diagnosed with SCC-Ls. Previous studies show that ∼30% of smokers with lung cancer continue to smoke after their diagnosis (29Parsons A. Daley A. Begh R. Aveyard P.

Systematic review of observational studies with meta-analysis.BMJ. 2010; 340: b5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 30Kawahara M. Ushijima S. Kamimori T. Kodama N. Ogawara M. Matsui K.

Cancer. 1998; 78: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, many SCC-Ls patients are exposed to secondhand smoke, electronic cigarettes, or nicotine patches/gums. It can be envisaged that such long term exposure of human SCC-L tumors to nicotine increases the expression of α7-nAChR on the lung tumor, thereby facilitating its progression and eventual metastasis. Therefore, the study of molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChRs in SCC-L is clinically relevant and will increase our understanding of the role of nAChRs in human lung cancers. Nicotine, atropine, and α-bungarotoxin were purchased from Sigma. The nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine was obtained from Tocris Biosciences (Ellisville, MO).

The tissues were incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold red blood cell lysis buffer (0.14 m NH4Cl and 0.017 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) on ice for 5 min. The cells were washed three times in red blood cell lysis buffer until red blood cells were no longer visible. The cell pellet was resuspended in one packed cell volume of M2 lysis buffer. The rest of the protocol was the same as described for preparing lysates from cultured cells. The expression of α7-nAChR and α3-nAChR subunits in human SCC-L cell lines was analyzed by using ELISA kits (Antibodies Online Inc., Atlanta, GA). Each of these assays was completed in duplicate, and the whole experiment was performed two independent times for each cell line. H520 human SCC-Ls were plated in 8-well chamber slides at a density of 104 cells/well. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the medium of the cells was changed to RPMI containing 2.5% FBS in the presence or absence of 100 nm nicotine. This was designated as day 0. On days 2, 4, and 6, the old medium was aspirated, and new medium containing 100 nm nicotine was added. The rate of BrdU incorporation was measured using a BrdU Labeling and Detection Kit II (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of positive cells on day 0 was assumed to be 1. Increases in the number of cells in BrdU-labeled cells (as a result of nicotine treatment) were calculated as a -fold increase of the number of BrdU-positive cells on day 0 (31Brown K.C. Witte T.R.

Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the BrdU assay was performed two independent times. H520 cells (3.0 × 106) were suspended in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of serum-free medium and Matrigel (BD Biosciences). This cell suspension was treated with 100 nm nicotine at 4 °C for 30 min and subsequently applied to the 9-day-old chicken embryo CAM as described previously (31Brown K.C. Witte T.R. Hardman W.E.

The chicken embryos were incubated for 7 days. After incubation, the H520 tumor implants were removed and weighed. A total of seven eggs were assayed for each group. Cell lysates were made from the above H520 tumors grown on CAM using T-Per tissue lysis buffer according to manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Scientific). H520 and H226 human SCC-L cells were grown to 50% confluence. Subsequently, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in RPMI containing 2.5% FBS in the presence or absence of 100 nm nicotine for 72 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen Sciences Inc., Valencia, CA). This kit was also used to isolate total RNA from human SCC-L tumors isolated from patients.

By grafting cells from different stages and regions of blastemas induced to form on donor animals expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), to non-GFP host animals, we have determined that the cells from early stage blastemas, as well as cells at the tip of late stage blastemas are developmentally labile such that their positional identity is reprogrammed by interactions with more proximal cells with stable positional information. In contrast, cells from the adjacent, more proximal stump tissues as well as the basal region of late bud blastemas are positionally stable, and thus form ectopic limb structures when grafted. Finally, we have found that a nerve is required to maintain the blastema cells in a positionally labile state, thus indicating a role for reprogramming cues in the blastema microenvironment."

The moss Physcomitrellapatens is a model basal land plant with well-developed research tools, including a high efficiency of gene targeting and substantial genomics resources. However, current systems for controlled transgene expression remain limited. Here we report the development of an estrogen receptor mediated inducible gene expression system, based on the system used in flowering plants. After identifying the appropriate promoters to drive the chimeric transducer, we succeeded in inducing transcription over 1,000-fold after 24 h incubation with β-estradiol. The P. patens system was also effective for high-level long-term induction of gene expression; transcript levels of the activated gene were maintained for at least seven days on medium containing β-estradiol. We also established two potentially neutral targeting sites and a set of vectors for reproducible expression of two transgenes. This β-estradiol-dependent system will be useful to test genes individually or in combination, allowing stable, inducible transgenic expression in P. patens."
https://openalex.org/W2010953747,"Endocannabinoid signaling has been implicated in modulating insulin release from β cells of the endocrine pancreas. β Cells express CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs), and the enzymatic machinery regulating anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol bioavailability. However, the molecular cascade coupling agonist-induced cannabinoid receptor activation to insulin release remains unknown. By combining molecular pharmacology and genetic tools in INS-1E cells and in vivo, we show that CB1R activation by endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) or synthetic agonists acutely or after prolonged exposure induces insulin hypersecretion. In doing so, CB1Rs recruit Akt/PKB and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 to phosphorylate focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK activation induces the formation of focal adhesion plaques, multimolecular platforms for second-phase insulin release. Inhibition of endocannabinoid synthesis or FAK activity precluded insulin release. We conclude that FAK downstream from CB1Rs mediates endocannabinoid-induced insulin release by allowing cytoskeletal reorganization that is required for the exocytosis of secretory vesicles. These findings suggest a mechanistic link between increased circulating and tissue endocannabinoid levels and hyperinsulinemia in type 2 diabetes."

We recently solved the crystal structures of the V1 moiety of Enterococcus hirae V-ATPase (EhV1) and proposed a model for its rotation mechanism. Here, we characterized the rotary dynamics of EhV1 using single-molecule analysis employing a load-free probe. EhV1 rotated in a counterclockwise direction, exhibiting two distinct rotational states, namely clear and unclear, suggesting unstable interactions between the rotor and stator. The clear state was analyzed in detail to obtain kinetic parameters. The rotation rates obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a maximal rotation rate (Vmax) of 107 revolutions/s and a Michaelis constant (Km) of 154 μm at 26 °C. At all ATP concentrations tested, EhV1 showed only three pauses separated by 120°/turn, and no substeps were resolved, as was the case with Thermus thermophilus V1-ATPase (TtV1). At 10 μm ATP (⪡Km), the distribution of the durations of the ATP-waiting pause fit well with a single-exponential decay function. The second-order binding rate constant for ATP was 2.3 × 106 m−1 s−1.

Our results identify the common properties of rotary catalysis of V1-ATPases that are distinct from those of F1-ATPases and will further our understanding of the general mechanisms of rotary molecular motors. Background: The chemomechanical coupling scheme of the rotary motor V1-ATPase is incompletely understood. Results: Enterococcus hirae V1-ATPase (EhV1) showed 120° steps of rotation without substeps, as commonly seen with F1-ATPase. Conclusion: The basic properties of rotary dynamics of EhV1 are similar to those of Thermus thermophilus V1-ATPase. Significance: This study revealed the common properties of V1-ATPases as rotary molecular motors, distinct from those of F1-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2028851357,"Prejudice and discrimination in the workplace regarding the risk of transmission of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are increased by excess concerns due to a lack of relevant knowledge. Education to increase knowledge about HBV and HCV and their prevention could be the first step to reduce prejudice and discrimination. This study aimed to determine the association between the level of knowledge and negative attitudes toward HBV- and HCV-infected colleagues among the Japanese working population. An online anonymous nationwide survey involving about 3,000 individuals was conducted in Japan. The questionnaire consisted of knowledge of HBV and HCV, and attitudes toward HBV- and HCV-infected colleagues in the workplace. Knowledge was divided into three categories: “ensuring daily activities not to be infected”; “risk of infection”; and “characteristics of HBV/HCV hepatitis”, based on the result of factor analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied. A total of 3,129 persons responded to the survey: 36.0% reported they worried about the possibility of transmission of HBV and HCV from infected colleagues; 32.1% avoided contact with infected colleagues; and 23.7% had prejudiced opinions about HBV and HCV infection. The participants were classified into tertiles. A higher level of knowledge of HBV and HCV was significantly associated with these three negative attitudes (P for trend < 0.005). This study suggests that increasing knowledge may decrease individuals’ negative attitudes towards HBV- and HCV-infected colleagues. Thus, we should promote increased knowledge of HBV and HCV in stages to reduce negative attitudes toward HBV- and HCV-infected colleagues."

Both involve an orchestrated process of invasion into and egress from host cells. The Plasmodium SUB1 protease plays a dual role at the blood stage by enabling egress of the progeny merozoites from the infected erythrocyte and priming merozoites for subsequent erythrocyte invasion. Here, using conditional mutagenesis in P. berghei, we show that SUB1 plays an essential role at the hepatic stage. Stage-specific sub1 invalidation during prehepatocytic development showed that SUB1-deficient parasites failed to rupture the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and to egress from hepatocytes. Furthermore, mechanically released parasites were not adequately primed and failed to establish a blood stage infection in vivo. The critical involvement of SUB1 in both pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic developmental phases qualifies SUB1 as an attractive multistage target for prophylactic and therapeutic anti-Plasmodium intervention strategies.

https://openalex.org/W2151414988,"Misregulation of acid-base transport plays central roles in cancer development. We previously demonstrated the strong up-regulation of the Na(+),HCO3(-) cotransporter NBCn1 (SLC4A7) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by a truncated, constitutively active ErbB2 (HER2) receptor, ΔNErbB2, and showed that NBCn1 expression and activity are increased in breast cancer tissue from patients. Here, we present the first in-depth characterization of an SLC4A7 promoter and identify its minimal ΔNErbB2-sensitive region. Inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of PI3K, Akt1, ERK1/2, or Src decreased the NBCn1 protein level in ΔNErbB2-expressing MCF-7 cells by ~50, 60, 30 and 35%, respectively. Further, knockdown of the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) reduced NBCn1 protein expression by ~40%, and KLF4 overexpression increased NBCn1 expression by 50-80%. In contrast, knockdown of the closely related transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) or transfection with dominant-negative Sp1 increased NBCn1 expression by ~35 and ~50%, respectively. NBCn1 expression was also increased by stimulation of full-length ErbB1, -2, and -3 receptors in SKBr3 cells (1.5- and 2-fold by NRG1 or EGF, respectively) or after their exogenous expression in MCF-7 cells. Finally, stimulation with NRG1 or EGF more than doubled acid extrusion capacity in SKBr3 cells. In conclusion, NBCn1 is strongly upregulated by ErbB receptor signaling in a manner involving opposite effects of KLF4 and Sp1, transcription factors with central roles in cancer development. ErbB-induced up-regulation of NBCn1-mediated acid extrusion may play important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the breast epithelium and other tissues with high ErbB receptor levels."
https://openalex.org/W2002631420,"Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) is critical for both solid and non-solid malignancies. Recently, TRIB2 was identified as a liver cancer-specific Wnt/β-catenin signaling downstream target and is functionally important for liver cancer cell survival and transformation. TRIB2 functions as a protein that interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases and thereby modulates protein stability of downstream effectors. However, the regulation underlying TRIB2 protein stability per se has not yet been reported. In this study, we found that TRIB2 was up-regulated and exhibited high stability in liver cancer cells compared with other cells. We performed a structure-function analysis of TRIB2 and identified a domain (amino acids 1–5) at the N terminus that interacted with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 and was critical for protein stability. Deletion of this domain extended TRIB2 half-life time accompanied with a more significant malignant property compared with wild type TRIB2. Furthermore, Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination required phosphorylation of TRIB2 by p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) via another domain (amino acids 69–85) that is also essential for correct TRIB2 subcellular localization. Mutation of Ser-83 diminished p70S6K-induced phosphorylation of TRIB2. Moreover, the high stability of TRIB2 may be due to the fact that both p70S6K and Smurf1 were down-regulated and negatively correlated with TRIB2 expression in both liver cancer tissues and established liver cancer cell lines. Taken together, impaired phosphorylation and ubiquitination by p70S6K and Smurf1 increase the protein stability of TRIB2 in liver cancer and thus may be helpful in the development of diagnosis and treatment strategies against this malignant disease.

https://openalex.org/W2008083367,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disease among premenopausal women, is caused by both genes and environment. We and others previously reported association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DENND1A gene and PCOS. We therefore sequenced the DENND1A gene in white patients with PCOS to identify possible alterations that may be implicated in the PCOS pathogenesis. Patients were referred with PCOS and/or hirsutism between 1998 and 2011 (n = 261). PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria (n = 165). Sequence analysis was performed in 10 patients with PCOS. Additional patients (n = 251) and healthy female controls (n = 248) were included for SNP genotyping. Patients underwent clinical examination including Ferriman-Gallwey score (FG-score), biochemical analyses and transvaginal ultrasound. Mutation analysis was carried out by bidirectional sequencing. SNP genotyping was tested by allelic discrimination in real-time PCR in the additional patients and controls. Sequencing of the DENND1A gene identified eight SNPs; seven were not known to be associated with any diseases. One missense SNP was detected (rs189947178, A/C), potentially altering the structural conformation of the DENND1A protein. SNP genotyping of rs189947178 showed significantly more carriers among patients with PCOS and moderate hirsutism compared to controls. However, due to small sample size and lack of multiple regression analysis supporting an association between rs189947178 and FG-score or PCOS diagnosis, this could be a false positive finding. In conclusion, sequence analysis of the DENND1A gene of patients with PCOS did not identify alterations that alone could be responsible for the PCOS pathogenesis, but a missense SNP (rs189947178) was identified in one patient and significantly more carriers of rs189947178 were found among patients with PCOS and moderate hirsutism vs. controls. Additional studies with independent cohort are needed to confirm this due to the small sample size of this study."
https://openalex.org/W2039306840,"There is emerging evidence that the IFN-inducible family of Slfn genes and proteins play important roles in cell cycle progression and control of cellular proliferation, but the precise functional roles of different Slfn members in the regulation of tumorigenesis remain unclear. In the present study, we undertook a systematic analysis on the expression and functional relevance of different mouse Slfn genes in malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma cells. Our studies demonstrate that several mouse Slfn genes are up-regulated in response to IFN treatment of mouse melanoma and renal cell carcinoma cells, including Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn4, Slfn5, and Slfn8. Our data show that Slfn2 and Slfn3 play essential roles in the control of mouse malignant melanoma cell proliferation and/or anchorage-independent growth, suggesting key and non-overlapping roles for these genes in the control of malignant melanoma tumorigenesis. In renal cell carcinoma cells, in addition to Slfn2 and Slfn3, Slfn5 also exhibits important antineoplastic effects. Altogether, our findings indicate important functions for distinct mouse Slfn genes in the control of tumorigenesis and provide evidence for differential involvement of distinct members of this gene family in controlling tumorigenesis. They also raise the potential of future therapeutic approaches involving modulation of expression of members of this family of genes in malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2072468553,"Lactoferrin, a key component of innate immunity, is a cationic monomeric 80-kDa glycoprotein of the transferrin superfamily. Recombinant human lactoferrin, known as talactoferrin (TLF), induces a distinct functional maturation program in human dendritic cells (DCs) derived from peripheral blood monocytes. However, the receptors and molecular mechanisms involved in this induction have not been fully determined. By exploiting genome-wide transcription profiling of immature DCs, TNF-α- and IL-1β-matured DCs (m-DCs), and TLF-matured DCs (TLF-DCs), we have detected a set of transcripts specific for m-DCs and one specific for TLF-DCs. Functional network reconstruction highlighted, as expected, the association of m-DC maturation with IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-κB, whereas TLF-DC maturation was associated with ERK and NF-κB. This involvement of ERK and NF-κB transduction factors suggests direct involvement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in TLF-induced maturation. We have used MyD88 inhibition and siRNA silencing TLRs on human DCs and mouse TLR-2-knockout cells, to show that TLF triggers the maturation of both human and mouse DCs through TLR-2 and TLR-4."
https://openalex.org/W1968887936,"During the plant immune response, large-scale transcriptional reprogramming is modulated by numerous transcription (co) factors. The Arabidopsis basic leucine zipper transcription factors TGA1 and TGA4, which comprise the clade I TGA factors, have been shown to positively contribute to disease resistance against virulent strains of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Despite physically interacting with the key immune regulator, NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1), following elicitation with salicylic acid (SA), clade I function was shown to be largely independent of NPR1. Unlike mutants in NPR1, tga1-1 tga4-1 plants do not display reductions in steady-state levels of SA-pathway marker genes following treatment with this phenolic signaling metabolite or after challenge with virulent or avirulent P. syringae. By exploiting bacterial strains that have limited capacity to suppress Arabidopsis defence responses, the present study demonstrates that tga1-1 tga4-1 plants are compromised in basal resistance and defective in several apoplastic defence responses, including the oxidative burst of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition, as well as total and apoplastic PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1 (PR-1) protein accumulation. Furthermore, analysis of npr1-1 and the tga1-1 tga4-1 npr1-1 triple mutant indicates that clade I TGA factors act substantially independent of NPR1 in mediating disease resistance against these strains of P. syringae. Increased sensitivity to the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin and elevated levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker genes encoding ER-resident chaperones in mutant seedlings suggest that loss of apoplastic defence responses is associated with aberrant protein secretion and implicate clade I TGA factors as positive regulators of one or more ER-related secretion pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1969154419,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) interacts with and mediates protein trafficking and various cellular functions. Derlin-1 is a candidate for the retrotranslocation channel of endoplasmic reticulum proteins. However, little is known about how Derlin-1 mediates glycosylated protein degradation. Here, we identified Cav-1 as a key player in Derlin-1- and p97-mediated cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) ubiquitination and degradation. Derlin-1 augmented the interaction of Cav-1 and COX-2 and mediated the degradation of COX-2 in a COX-2 C terminus-dependent manner. Suppression of Cav-1 decreased the ubiquitination of COX-2, and mutation of Asn-594 to Ala to disrupt N-glycosylation at the C terminus of COX-2 reduced the interaction of COX-2 with Cav-1 but not Derlin-1. Moreover, suppression of p97 increased the ubiquitination of COX-2 and up-regulated COX-2 but not COX-1. Cav-1 enhanced the interaction of p97 with Ufd1 and Derlin-1 and collaborated with p97 to interact with COX-2. Cav-1 may be a cofactor in the interaction of Derlin-1 and N-glycosylated COX-2 and may facilitate Derlin-1- and p97 complex-mediated COX-2 ubiquitination, retrotranslocation, and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2011421397,"High concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce cellular damage, however at lower concentrations ROS act as intracellular second messengers. In this study, we demonstrate that serotonin (5-HT) transactivates the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) type β receptor as well as the TrkB receptor in neuronal cultures and SH-SY5Y cells, and that the transactivation of both receptors is ROS-dependent. Exogenous application of H2O2 induced the phosphorylation of these receptors in a dose-dependent fashion, similar to that observed with 5-HT. However the same concentrations of H2O2 failed to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Yet, the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium chloride and apocynin blocked both 5-HT-induced PDGFβ receptor phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The increases in PDGFβ receptor and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also dependent on protein kinase C activity, likely acting upstream of NADPH oxidase. Additionally, although the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine abrogated 5-HT-induced PDGFβ and TrkB receptor transactivation, it was unable to prevent 5-HT-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, the divergence point for 5-HT-induced receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) transactivation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurs at the level of NADPH oxidase in this system. The ability of 5-HT to induce the production of ROS resulting in transactivation of both PDGFβ and TrkB receptors may suggest that instead of a single GPCR to single RTK pathway, a less selective, more global RTK response to GPCR activation is occurring."

https://openalex.org/W1980372798,"The mitochondrial 45 S SSU* complex in Trypanosoma brucei contains the 9 S SSU ribosomal RNA, a set of SSU ribosomal proteins, several pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, and proteins not typically found in ribosomes, including rhodanese domain protein (Rhod) and a 200-kDa coiled-coil protein. To investigate the function of this complex, PPR29, Rhod, 200-kDa protein, and mitochondrial ribosomal protein S17 were knocked down by RNAi in procyclic T. brucei. A growth retardation phenotype, a reduction in the amount of the 45 S SSU* complexes, and the preferential inhibition of synthesis of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I over apocytochrome b were observed as early as day 2 postinduction of RNAi. On the contrary, the down-regulation of mitochondrial ribosomal protein L3 drastically reduced the amount of the large subunit and indiscriminately inhibited mitochondrial translation. The relative amounts of translation-competent, long poly(AU)-tailed cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and edited apocytochrome b mRNAs were selectively reduced by ablation of the 45 S SSU* complex. The formation of the 80 S translation complexes, identified by association of the long-tailed mRNAs with the mitoribosomes, was also disrupted. On the other hand, the relative amount of long-tailed edited RPS12 mRNA was not substantially affected, and there was no noticeable effect on the RPS12 translation complexes. In bloodstream trypanosomes, the amount of the 45 S complexes was drastically reduced compared with procyclics. We propose that the 45 S SSU* complex represents a factor required for normal mitochondrial translation that may have selective effects on different mRNAs."

Physiological concentration of NaCl did not attenuate the activity of the peptides against Gram-negative bacteria considerably, while some attenuation of activity was observed against S. aureus. Variable attenuation of activity was observed in the presence of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺. Introduction of D-amino acids abrogated the need for a disulfide bridge for exhibiting activity. Confocal images of carboxyfluorescein (CF) labeled peptides indicated initial localization on the membrane and subsequent translocation into the cell. Analogs corresponding to cationic rich segments of human defensins substituted with L- and D-arginine, could be attractive candidates for development as future therapeutic drugs."

These studies suggested the possibility that Hox proteins were involved in expansion of the leukemia stem cell population in 11q23-AML. In various forms of AML this population has generally been defined as a GMP with HSC-like characteristics (20.Goardon N. Marchi E. Atzberger A. Quek L. Schuh A. Soneji S. Woll P. Mead A. Alford K.A.

In these studies we identified the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2, or basic Fgf) as a HoxA10 target gene (26.Shah C.A. Bei L. Wang H. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A.

Fgf2 is produced by bone marrow stromal cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and mature phagocytes (27.Yoon S.Y. Tefferi A. Li C.Y. Cellular distribution of platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, basic fibroblast growth factor, and their receptors in normal bone marrow.Acta Haematol. 2000; 104: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Increased Fgf2 production by AML cells is described, and a search of publically available data bases specifically associated this with 11q23-AML (28.Aguayo A. Kantarjian H. Manshouri T. Gidel C.

Fgf2 plays a key role in expanding hematopoietic progenitor cell populations and is essential for hematopoietic and embryonic stem cell maintenance (30.Wilson E.L. Rifkin D.B. Kelly F. Hannocks M.J. Gabrilove J.L. Basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates myelopoiesis in long-term human bone marrow cultures.Blood. 1991; 77: 954-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In myeloid progenitor cells, Fgf2 binding to Fgf-R1/R2 activates phosphoinositol 3-kinase (31.Holnthoner W. Pillinger M. Groger M. Wolff K. Ashton A.W. Albanese C. Neumeister P. Pestell R.G.

Biol. 2008; 28: 7427-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositol 3-kinase activates Akt kinase, which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of β-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase 3β leads to β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, Fgf2-induced activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase stabilizes β-catenin and enhances β-catenin activity (26.Shah C.A. Bei L. Wang H. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 18230-18248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We previously found that autocrine production of Fgf2 contributed to cytokine hypersensitivity of HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells in a phosphoinositol 3-kinase and β-catenin-dependent manner (26.Shah C.A. Bei L. Wang H. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. HoxA10 protein regulates transcription of gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in myeloid cells.J. Biol.

HoxA9 and HoxA10 have highly conserved DNA binding homeodomains, suggesting the possibility of common target genes (33.Eklund E. The role of Hox proteins in leukemogenesis. Insights into key regulatory events in hematopoiesis.Crit. Rev. Oncog. 2011; 16: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, HoxA9 and HoxA10 diverge outside of the homeodomain, suggesting the possibility of differential effects on some target genes. Consistent with the latter, we found that CYBB was a common target gene for HoxA10 and HoxA9 (the only previously identified common target gene) (34.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R.

CYBB encodes gp91phox; a rate-limiting component of the NADPH oxidase that generates H2O2/O3− during the innate immune response. We found that HoxA10 interacted with and repressed a CYBB cis element in myeloid progenitor cells (34.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R.

During myeloid differentiation, phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the DNA binding homeodomain (HD) of HoxA10 decreased binding affinity for CYBB (34.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R.

Chem. 2007; 282: 2237-2249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HoxA9 activated CYBB transcription through the same cis element, but in this case phosphorylation of the conserved HD tyrosine residues of HoxA9 increased CYBB binding affinity during differentiation (37.Bei L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 12359-12370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies identified an antagonistic role for HoxA9 and HoxA10 during myeloid differentiation. This was consistent with previous studies indicating that HoxA10 was involved in a differentiation block in AML, but HoxA9 conferred a myeloid phenotype upon leukemia cells (13.Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kamps M.P.

Chem. 2009; 284: 2549-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, in the current study we found that HoxA9 and HoxA10 activated common cis elements in the FGF2 promoter in myeloid progenitor cells and throughout myeloid differentiation. Expression of the leukemia-associated MLL fusion protein Mll-Ell also activated these two FGF2 cis elements in a HoxA9- and HoxA10-dependent manner. This resulted in autocrine production of Fgf2 by Mll-Ell-expressing myeloid progenitor cells and Fgf2-dependent cytokine hypersensitivity. This is a previously un-described and therapeutically targetable mechanism for MLL fusion proteins to influence expansion of myeloid progenitor cells. The cDNA for human HoxA10 was obtained from C. Largman (University of California, San Francisco) (38.Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. LeBeau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C.

HoxA10- and HoxA9-specific shRNA and scrambled control sequences were designed using the Promega website (Promega, Madison, WI) and subcloned into the pLKO.1puro vector (from Dr. Kathy Rundell, Northwestern University, Chicago). Several sequences were tested, and the most efficient were combined. The FGF2 5′-flank was obtained from the genomic DNA of U937 cells by PCR. The sequence was compared with the published FGF2 5′-flank sequence (ENSEMBL database), and promoter fragments were subcloned into the pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega) as described (26.Shah C.A.

Reporter constructs were also generated using the pGL3-promoter vector (with a minimal promoter and reporter) and three copies of the proximal (−287 to −266 bp) or distal (−448 to −425 bp) Hox binding cis elements from the FGF2 promoter as described (26.Shah C.A.

This study was aimed at investigating molecular changes at the level of the proteome that are associated with the activation of pancreatic stellate cells by proinflammatory factors, namely TNF-α, FGF2, IL6, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4). They were added individually to cells growing in serum-free medium next to controls in medium supplemented with serum, thus containing a mixture of them all, or in serum-free medium alone. Variations were detected by means of a microarray of 810 antibodies targeting relevant proteins. All tested factors triggered increased proliferation and migration. Further analysis showed that TNF-α is the prime factor responsible for the activation of pancreatic stellate cells. CCL4 is associated with cellular neovascularization, whereas FGF2 and IL6 induction led to better cellular survival and decreased apoptotic activity of the stellate cells. The identified direct effects of individual cytokines on human pancreatic stellate cells provide new insights about their contribution to pancreatic cancer promotion."
https://openalex.org/W2078362730,"Understanding the evolution of functional RNA molecules is important for our molecular understanding of biology. Here we tested experimentally how two evolutionary parameters, selection pressure and recombination, influenced the evolution of an evolving RNA population. This was done using four parallel evolution experiments that employed low or gradually increasing selection pressure, and recombination events either at the end or dispersed throughout the evolution. As model system, a trans-splicing group I intron ribozyme was evolved in Escherichia coli cells over 12 rounds of selection and amplification, including mutagenesis and recombination. The low selection pressure resulted in higher efficiency of the evolved ribozyme populations, whereas differences in recombination did not have a strong effect. Five mutations were responsible for the highest efficiency. The first mutation swept quickly through all four evolving populations, whereas the remaining four mutations accumulated later and more efficiently under low selection pressure. To determine why low selection pressure aided this evolution, all evolutionary intermediates between the wild type and the 5-mutation variant were constructed, and their activities at three different selection pressures were determined. The resulting fitness profiles showed a high cooperativity among the four late mutations, which can explain why high selection pressure led to inefficient evolution. These results show experimentally how low selection pressure can benefit the evolution of cooperative mutations in functional RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1980727836,"Magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus receive glutamatergic excitatory inputs that regulate the firing activity and hormone release from these neurons. A strong, brief activation of these excitatory inputs induces a lingering barrage of tetrodotoxin-resistant miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) that lasts for tens of minutes. This is known to accompany an immediate increase in large amplitude mEPSCs. However, it remains unknown how long this amplitude increase can last and whether it is simply a byproduct of greater release probability. Using in vitro patch clamp recording on acute rat brain slices, we found that a brief, high frequency stimulation (HFS) of afferents induced a potentiation of mEPSC amplitude lasting up to 20 min. This amplitude potentiation did not correlate with changes in mEPSC frequency, suggesting that it does not reflect changes in presynaptic release probability. Nonetheless, neither postsynaptic calcium chelator nor the NMDA receptor antagonist blocked the potentiation. Together with the known calcium dependency of HFS-induced potentiation of mEPSCs, our results imply that mEPSC amplitude increase requires presynaptic calcium. Further analysis showed multimodal distribution of mEPSC amplitude, suggesting that large mEPSCs were due to multivesicular glutamate release, even at late post-HFS when the frequency is no longer elevated. In conclusion, high frequency activation of excitatory synapses induces lasting multivesicular release in the SON, which is independent of changes in release probability. This represents a novel form of synaptic plasticity that may contribute to prolonged excitatory tone necessary for generation of burst firing of magnocellular neurons."
