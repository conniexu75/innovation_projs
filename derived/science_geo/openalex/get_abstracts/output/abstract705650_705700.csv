https://openalex.org/W4312018959,"We present a multiomic cell atlas of human lung development that combines single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing, high-throughput spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell imaging. Coupling single-cell methods with spatial analysis has allowed a comprehensive cellular survey of the epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and erythrocyte/leukocyte compartments from 5-22 post-conception weeks. We identify previously uncharacterized cell states in all compartments. These include developmental-specific secretory progenitors and a subtype of neuroendocrine cell related to human small cell lung cancer. Our datasets are available through our web interface (https://lungcellatlas.org). To illustrate its general utility, we use our cell atlas to generate predictions about cell-cell signaling and transcription factor hierarchies which we rigorously test using organoid models."
https://openalex.org/W4311662347,"Adult mammalian skin wounds heal by forming fibrotic scars. We report that full-thickness injuries of reindeer antler skin (velvet) regenerate, whereas back skin forms fibrotic scar. Single-cell multi-omics reveal that uninjured velvet fibroblasts resemble human fetal fibroblasts, whereas back skin fibroblasts express inflammatory mediators mimicking pro-fibrotic adult human and rodent fibroblasts. Consequently, injury elicits site-specific immune responses: back skin fibroblasts amplify myeloid infiltration and maturation during repair, whereas velvet fibroblasts adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype that restricts leukocyte recruitment and hastens immune resolution. Ectopic transplantation of velvet to scar-forming back skin is initially regenerative, but progressively transitions to a fibrotic phenotype akin to the scarless fetal-to-scar-forming transition reported in humans. Skin regeneration is diminished by intensifying, or enhanced by neutralizing, these pathologic fibroblast-immune interactions. Reindeer represent a powerful comparative model for interrogating divergent wound healing outcomes, and our results nominate decoupling of fibroblast-immune interactions as a promising approach to mitigate scar."
https://openalex.org/W4311662851,"Cone-rod dystrophies (CORDs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited retinopathies (IRDs) with more than 30 already known disease-causing genes. Uncertain phenotypes and extended range of intra- and interfamilial heterogenicity make still difficult to determine a precise genotype-phenotype correlation. Here, we used a next-generation sequencing approach to study a Sicilian family with a suspected form of CORD. Affected family members underwent ophthalmological examinations and a proband, blind from 50 years, underwent whole genome and exome sequencing. Variant analysis was enriched by pathway analysis and relevant variants were, then, investigated in other family members and in 100 healthy controls from Messina. CORD diagnosis with an intricate pattern of symptoms was confirmed by ophthalmological examinations. A total of about 50,000 variants were identified in both proband’s genome and exome. All affected family members presented specific genotypes mainly determined by mutated GUCY2D gene, and different phenotypical traits, mainly related to focus and color perception. Thus, we looked for possible modifier genes. According to relationship with GUCY2D , predicted functional effects, eye localization, and ocular disease affinity, only 9 variants, carried by 6 genes ( CACNG8 , PAX2 , RXRG , CCDC175 , PDE4DIP and LTF ), survived the filtering. These genes encode key proteins involved in cone development and survival, and retina neurotransmission. Among analyzed variants, CACNG8 c.*6819A&gt;T and the new CCDC175 c.76C&gt;T showed extremely low frequency in the control group, suggesting a key role on disease phenotypes. Such discovery could enforce the role of modifier genes into CORD onset/progression, contributing to improve diagnostic test towards a better personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W4312018621,"Selective breeding of domestic dogs has generated diverse breeds often optimized for performing specialized tasks. Despite the heritability of breed-typical behavioral traits, identification of causal loci has proven challenging due to the complexity of canine population structure. We overcome longstanding difficulties in identifying genetic drivers of canine behavior by developing a framework for understanding relationships between breeds and the behaviors that define them, utilizing genetic data for over 4,000 domestic, semi-feral, and wild canids and behavioral survey data for over 46,000 dogs. We identify ten major canine genetic lineages and their behavioral correlates and show that breed diversification is predominantly driven by non-coding regulatory variation. We determine that lineage-associated genes converge in neurodevelopmental co-expression networks, identifying a sheepdog-associated enrichment for interrelated axon guidance functions. This work presents a scaffold for canine diversification that positions the domestic dog as an unparalleled system for revealing the genetic origins of behavioral diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4312019583,"The ATP-dependent ring-shaped chaperonin TRiC/CCT is essential for cellular proteostasis. To uncover why some eukaryotic proteins can only fold with TRiC assistance, we reconstituted the folding of β-tubulin using human prefoldin and TRiC. We find unstructured β-tubulin is delivered by prefoldin to the open TRiC chamber followed by ATP-dependent chamber closure. Cryo-EM resolves four near-atomic-resolution structures containing progressively folded β-tubulin intermediates within the closed TRiC chamber, culminating in native tubulin. This substrate folding pathway appears closely guided by site-specific interactions with conserved regions in the TRiC chamber. Initial electrostatic interactions between the TRiC interior wall and both the folded tubulin N domain and its C-terminal E-hook tail establish the native substrate topology, thus enabling C-domain folding. Intrinsically disordered CCT C termini within the chamber promote subsequent folding of tubulin’s core and middle domains and GTP-binding. Thus, TRiC’s chamber provides chemical and topological directives that shape the folding landscape of its obligate substrates."
https://openalex.org/W4311027336,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are channels for nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and RNAs. However, it remains unclear whether composition, structure, and permeability of NPCs dynamically change during the cleavage period of vertebrate embryos and affect embryonic development. Here, we report that the comprehensive NPC maturity (CNM) controls the onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) during zebrafish early embryogenesis. We show that more nucleoporin proteins are recruited to and assembled into NPCs with development, resulting in progressive increase of NPCs in size and complexity. Maternal transcription factors (TFs) transport into nuclei more efficiently with increasing CNM. Deficiency or dysfunction of Nup133 or Ahctf1/Elys impairs NPC assembly, maternal TFs nuclear transport, and ZGA onset, while nup133 overexpression promotes these processes. Therefore, CNM may act as a molecular timer for ZGA by controlling nuclear transport of maternal TFs that reach nuclear concentration thresholds at a given time to initiate ZGA."
https://openalex.org/W4312067238,"Although adult pluripotent stem cells (aPSCs) are found in many animal lineages, mechanisms for their formation during embryogenesis are unknown. Here, we leveraged Hofstenia miamia, a regenerative worm that possesses collectively pluripotent aPSCs called neoblasts and produces manipulable embryos. Lineage tracing and functional experiments revealed that one pair of blastomeres gives rise to cells that resemble neoblasts in distribution, behavior, and gene expression. In Hofstenia, aPSCs include transcriptionally distinct subpopulations that express markers associated with differentiated tissues; our data suggest that despite their heterogeneity, aPSCs are derived from one lineage, not from multiple tissue-specific lineages during development. Next, we combined single-cell transcriptome profiling across development with neoblast cell-lineage tracing and identified a molecular trajectory for neoblast formation that includes transcription factors Hes, FoxO, and Tbx. This identification of a cellular mechanism and molecular trajectory for aPSC formation opens the door for in vivo studies of aPSC regulation and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4311028526,"Variation in lung alveolar development is strongly linked to disease susceptibility. However, underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are difficult to study in humans. We have identified an alveolar-fated epithelial progenitor in human fetal lungs, which we grow as self-organizing organoids that model key aspects of cell lineage commitment. Using this system, we have functionally validated cell-cell interactions in the developing human alveolar niche, showing that Wnt signaling from differentiating fibroblasts promotes alveolar-type-2 cell identity, whereas myofibroblasts secrete the Wnt inhibitor, NOTUM, providing spatial patterning. We identify a Wnt-NKX2.1 axis controlling alveolar differentiation. Moreover, we show that differential binding of NKX2.1 coordinates alveolar maturation, allowing us to model the effects of human genetic variation in NKX2.1 on alveolar differentiation. Our organoid system recapitulates key aspects of human fetal lung stem cell biology allowing mechanistic experiments to determine the cellular and molecular regulation of human development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4311676229,"Healthcare personnel have faced unprecedented mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study objective is to assess differences in depression, anxiety, and burnout among healthcare personnel with various occupational roles and whether financial and job strain were associated with these mental health outcomes.We employed an anonymous survey between July and August 2020 at an urban county hospital in California, USA. We assessed depression, anxiety, and burnout using validated scales, and asked questions on financial strain and job strain. We performed logistic and linear regression analyses.Nurses (aOR 1.93, 95% CIs 1.12, 3.46), social workers (aOR 2.61, 95% CIs 1.35, 5.17), service workers (aOR 2.55, 95% CIs 1.20, 5.48), and administrative workers (aOR 2.93, 95% CIs 1.57, 5.61) were more likely than physicians to screen positive for depression. The odds of screening positive for anxiety were significantly lower for ancillary workers (aOR 0.32, 95% CIs 0.13-0.72) compared with physicians. Ancillary (aB = -1.77, 95% CIs -1.88, -0.47) and laboratory and pharmacy workers (aB -0.70, 95% CI -1.34, -0.06) reported lower levels of burnout compared with physicians. Financial strain partially accounted for differences in mental health outcomes across job categories. Lack of time to complete tasks and lack of supervisory support were associated with higher odds of screening positive for depression. Less job autonomy was associated with higher odds of screening positive for anxiety and higher burnout levels.We found significant disparities in mental health outcomes across occupational roles. Policies to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on health workers' mental health should include non-clinical staff and address financial support and job characteristics for all occupational roles."
https://openalex.org/W4311679154,"The D 3 -Creatine (D 3 Cr) dilution method is a direct and accurate measure of skeletal muscle mass. In this study, we examined the association of D 3 Cr muscle mass with measures of insulin-glucose homeostasis in community dwelling postmenopausal women. Additionally, we examined association of sarcopenic obesity, defined as low D 3 Cr muscle mass and high percent body fat, with fasting plasma glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostatic measure of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). This pilot study included 74 participants (mean age = 82.3 years) from the Women’s Health Initiative-Buffalo site. The D 3 Cr method was initiated at a clinic visit and used to measure muscle mass via remote urine sample collection. Descriptive and graphical approaches and age-adjusted linear regression models were used to analyze study data. We examined muscle mass as an absolute value (kg) and scaled to body weight (D 3 Cr muscle mass/kg). There was an inverse relationship between skeletal muscle mass, and impaired insulin-glucose homeostasis. Women with low muscle mass had higher levels of insulin (uIU/mL; β = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.01), fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL; β = -0.1; 95% CI: -0.2, 0.03), HbA1c (%; β = -2.30; 95% CI: -5.7, 1.1), and calculated homeostatic model of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR, (β = -1.49; 95% CI: -2.9, -0.1). Sarcopenic obesity was common in this population of women; 41% of participants were categorized as having low muscle mass and high percent body fat. Results demonstrate that D 3 Cr muscle mass is independently associated with measures of insulin-glucose homeostasis, but obesity is a stronger predictor of insulin resistance than muscle mass."
https://openalex.org/W4311662139,"Lipid membranes in nature adapt and reconfigure to changes in composition, temperature, humidity, and mechanics. For instance, the oscillating mechanical forces on lung cells and alveoli influence membrane synthesis and structure during breathing. However, despite advances in the understanding of lipid membrane phase behavior and mechanics of tissue, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the response of lipid membranes to micromechanical forces. Most studies of lipid membrane mechanics use supported lipid bilayer systems missing the structural complexity of pulmonary lipids in alveolar membranes comprising multi-bilayer interconnected stacks. Here, we elucidate the collective response of the major component of pulmonary lipids to strain in the form of multi-bilayer stacks supported on flexible elastomer substrates. We utilize X-ray diffraction, scanning probe microscopy, confocal microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation to show that lipid multilayered films both in gel and fluid states evolve structurally and mechanically in response to compression at multiple length scales. Specifically, compression leads to increased disorder of lipid alkyl chains comparable to the effect of cholesterol on gel phases as a direct result of the formation of nanoscale undulations in the lipid multilayers, also inducing buckling delamination and enhancing multi-bilayer alignment. We propose this cooperative short- and long-range reconfiguration of lipid multilayered films under compression constitutes a mechanism to accommodate stress and substrate topography. Our work raises fundamental insights regarding the adaptability of complex lipid membranes to mechanical stimuli. This is critical to several technologies requiring mechanically reconfigurable surfaces such as the development of electronic devices interfacing biological materials."
https://openalex.org/W4311662849,"To assess whether dietary knowledge of Chinese children and adolescents and their mothers was associated with childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity.This cross-sectional study obtained data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) between 2004 and 2015. Dietary knowledge of children and adolescents and their mothers was assessed by asking questions and statements on diets, and clustered by K-means clustering. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were used to evaluate overweight and obesity among children and adolescents. The association of dietary knowledge with childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity was evaluated by multivariate regression analysis, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated.A total of 2,338 children and adolescents were included. Children and adolescents with low dietary knowledge were demonstrated to have significantly higher risks of BMI-defined overweight or obesity (OR = 1.66, 95%CI = 1.21-2.28, P = 0.002), and WC-defined obesity (OR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.12-2.06, P = 0.007) than those with high dietary knowledge. Compared with high dietary knowledge in mothers, low dietary knowledge was associated with significantly elevated risks of BMI-defined overweight or obesity (OR = 1.48, 95%CI = 1.08-2.02, P = 0.014), and WC-defined obesity (OR = 1.59, 95%CI = 1.18-2.16, P = 0.003). Furthermore, significantly increased odds of BMI-defined overweight or obesity and WC-defined non-obesity in children and adolescents were related to low dietary knowledge versus high dietary knowledge of children and adolescents (OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.08-2.74, P = 0.023), while there was no association of BMI-defined non-overweight and non-obesity and WC-defined obesity with dietary knowledge among children and adolescents (OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 0.89-2.04, P = 0.161). Additionally, no association was found between dietary knowledge of mothers and BMI-defined overweight or obesity and WC-defined non-obesity among children and adolescents (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 0.89-2.17, P = 0.155), while low dietary knowledge of mothers was associated with increased odds of BMI-defined non-overweight and non-obesity and WC-defined obesity in children and adolescents (OR = 1.58, 95%CI = 1.03-2.43, P = 0.036).Dietary knowledge of children and adolescents and their mothers was associated with childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity. Dietary knowledge of children and adolescents negatively related to the risk of BMI-defined overweight or obesity, and dietary knowledge of mothers to odds of WC-defined obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4311665506,"Nadorcott is a well-established and appreciated mandarin by the fresh market. However, it produces seeds due to cross-pollination with other compatible varieties, which is quite frequent in most producing countries. Consumers prefer seedless mandarins and, therefore, citrus growers need techniques to avoid seeds forming. This study aims to evaluate the effect of six treatments (ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sulfur, saccharose, methylcellulose, callose) on seed number per fruit when applied to Nadorcott trees. In this way, we evaluate which of them is more efficient and can be used in the future as an agronomic treatment to avoid seeds in mandarins. The effect of treatments on yield and fruit quality is also reported. To fulfill this main objective, a randomized complete block design experiment with three applications at flowering was performed on trees. Of the six tested treatments, only elemental sulfur was able to significantly reduce seed number by 87% compared to the positive control. This is a very novel result because it is the first time that such an effective treatment has been found. The biggest seed number per fruit was obtained for the saccharose treatment. Treatments did not significantly influence yield or fruit quality. These results are entirely consistent with a previous study that evaluated the effect of the same products on pollen tube growth, and they can help to develop new techniques. Nevertheless, more studies are necessary to test, for example, different treatment doses."
https://openalex.org/W4311668365,"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an important model organism for the study of many cellular processes, and protein tagging is an increasingly indispensable tool for these studies. To circumvent the disadvantages of conventional approaches in creating a tagged cell line, which involve transforming either a wild-type or null-mutant cell line with an exogenous DNA construct that inserts randomly into the genome, we developed a strategy to tag the endogenous gene in situ. The strategy utilizes TIM, a CRISPR/Cas9-based method for targeted insertional mutagenesis in C. reinhardtii. We have tested the strategy on two genes: LF5/CDKL5, lack of which causes a long-flagella phenotype, and Cre09.g416350/NAP1L1, which has not been studied previously in C. reinhardtii. We successfully tagged the C-terminus of wild-type LF5 with the hemagglutinin (HA) tag with an efficiency of 7.4%. Sequencing confirmed that these strains are correctly edited. Western blotting confirmed the expression of HA-tagged LF5, and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that LF5-HA is localized normally. These strains have normal length flagella and appear wild type. We successfully tagged the N-terminus of Cre09.g416350 with mNeonGreen-3xFLAG with an efficiency of 9%. Sequencing showed that the tag region in these strains is as expected. Western blotting confirmed the expression of tagged protein of the expected size in these strains, which appeared to have normal cell size, growth rate, and swimming speed. This is the first time that C. reinhardtii endogenous genes have been edited in situ to express a wild-type tagged protein. This effective, efficient, and convenient TIM-tagging strategy promises to be a useful tool for the study of nuclear genes, including essential genes, in C. reinhardtii."

This study was aimed to assess the attitude, level of COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and its determinants among patients with chronic diseases visiting Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 randomly selected patients with chronic disease visiting Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from February 1 to March 30, 2022. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were done to identify associations between dependent and independent variables.Among all participants, only 29.6% of patients were vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines at least one dose. Age from 31 to 40 years (AOR = 6.26, 95% CI: 2.69-14.56), attended collage and above (AOR = 6.3, 95% CI: 1.37, 28.68), positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 9.07, 95% CI: 4.51-18.22), good knowledge (AOR = 7.63, 95% CI: 1.08-16.85), history of COVID-19 (AOR = 4.33, 95% CI: 1.85-10.17), family history of COVID-19 (AOR = 3.99, 95% CI = 1.89-8.48), ever been tested for COVID-19 (AOR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.74) were determinant factors for COVID-19 vaccine uptake.COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients with chronic disease was very low. The main reasons for not being vaccinated were doubts about vaccine efficacy, the vaccine may cause disease by itself, and fear of adverse effects. Therefore, different stakeholders should enforce vaccine uptake and awareness creation."
https://openalex.org/W4311674403,"The majority of studies that assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) induced radiofrequency (RF) heating of the tissue when active electronic implants are present have been performed in horizontal, closed-bore MRI systems. Vertical, open-bore MRI systems have a 90° rotated magnet and a fundamentally different RF coil geometry, thus generating a substantially different RF field distribution inside the body. Little is known about the RF heating of elongated implants such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices in this class of scanners. Here, we conducted the first large-scale experimental study investigating whether RF heating was significantly different in a 1.2 T vertical field MRI scanner (Oasis, Fujifilm Healthcare) compared to a 1.5 T horizontal field MRI scanner (Aera, Siemens Healthineers). A commercial DBS device mimicking 30 realistic patient-derived lead trajectories extracted from postoperative computed tomography images of patients who underwent DBS surgery at our institution was implanted in a multi-material, anthropomorphic phantom. RF heating around the DBS lead was measured during four minutes of high-SAR RF exposure. Additionally, we performed electromagnetic simulations with leads of various internal structures to examine this effect on RF heating. When controlling for RMS B1+, the temperature increase around the DBS lead-tip was significantly lower in the vertical scanner compared to the horizontal scanner (0.33 ± 0.24°C vs. 4.19 ± 2.29°C). Electromagnetic simulations demonstrated up to a 17-fold reduction in the maximum of 0.1g-averaged SAR in the tissue surrounding the lead-tip in the vertical scanner compared to the horizontal scanner. Results were consistent across leads with straight and helical internal wires. Radiofrequency heating and power deposition around the DBS lead-tip were substantially lower in the 1.2 T vertical scanner compared to the 1.5 T horizontal scanner. Simulations with different lead structures suggest that the results may extend to leads from other manufacturers."

Twenty-four semi-professional soccer players participated in the study. The exercise test consisted of ten 6-second maximal efforts on a cycloergometer. A 90-second passive rest interval was used. The test was performed in a Weiss Technik WK-26 climate test chamber in two different conditions: 1) thermo-neutral conditions (NC-20.5°C; 58.7% humidity); and 2) simulated conditions for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar (QSC-28.5 ± 1.92°C; 58.7 ± 8.64% humidity). Power-related, physiological, psychomotor, blood, and electrolyte variables were recorded. Results showed that (1) players achieved higher peak power (max 1607,46 ± 192,70 [W] - 3rd rep), needed less time to peak power (min 0,95 ± 0,27 [s] - 3rd rep), and had a higher fatigue slope (max 218,67 ± 59,64 [W/sek] - 7th rep) in QSC than in NC (in each repetition of study protocol); (2) between the 1st repetition and subsequent repetitions a number of significants in among physiological, blood-related, and electrolyte variables were noted, but their direction was similar in both simulated conditions (e.g. V'O2/kg 37,59 ± 3,96 vs 37,95 ± 3,17 [ml/min/kg] - 3rd rep, LAC 13,16 ± 2,61 vs 14,18 ± 3,13 [mg/dl] - 10th rep or K 4,54 ± 0,29 vs 4,79 ± 0,36 [mmol/l] - 2nd rep when compare QCS and NC respectively); (3) an 8°C of temperature difference between the climatic conditions did not significantly affect the soccer players' physical and physiological responses in RME. The study results can be used in the design of training programs aimed to increase players' physiological adaptations by simulating soccer-specific conditions of play in terms of anaerobic capacity, in particular, repetitive maximal efforts. These findings will be useful during the upcoming 2022 World Cup in Qatar and in locations where high ambient temperatures are customary."
https://openalex.org/W4311679242,"Electrical line workers (ELWs) experience harsh environments, characterized by long shifts, remote operations, and potentially risky tasks. Wearables present an opportunity for unobtrusive monitoring of productivity and safety. A prerequisite to monitoring is the automated identification of the tasks being performed. Human activity recognition has been widely used for classification for activities of daily living. However, the literature is limited for electrical line maintenance/repair tasks due to task variety and complexity. We investigated how features can be engineered from a single wrist-worn accelerometer for the purpose of classifying ELW tasks. Specifically, three classifiers were investigated across three feature sets (time, frequency, and time-frequency) and two window lengths (4 and 10 seconds) to identify ten common ELW tasks. Based on data from 37 participants in a lab environment, two application scenarios were evaluated: (a) intra-subject, where individualized models were trained and deployed for each worker; and (b) inter-subject, where data was pooled to train a general model that can be deployed for new workers. Accuracies ≥ 93% were achieved for both scenarios, and increased to ≥96% with 10-second windows. Overall and class-specific feature importance were computed, and the impact of those features on the obtained predictions were explained. This work will contribute to the future risk mitigation of ELWs using wearables."
https://openalex.org/W4311662144,"This research employs the gradient descent learning (FIR.DM) approach as a learning process in a nonlinear spectral model of maximum overlapping discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) to improve volatility prediction of daily stock market prices using Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange (Tadawul) data. The MODWT comprises five mathematical functions and fuzzy inference rules. The inputs are the oil price (Loil) and repo rate (Repo) according to multiple regression correlation, and the Engle and Granger Causality test Engle RF, (1987). The logarithm of the stock market price (LSCS) in Tadawul reflects the output variable. The correlation matrix reveals that there is no collinearity between the input variables, and the causality test demonstrates that the input variables significantly influence the outcome variable. According to the multiple regression, there is a substantial negative influence between Loil and LSCS but a significant positive effect between Repo and output. For the 80% dataset under ME (0.000005), MAE (0.003214), and MAPE (0.064497), the MODWT-LA8 (ARIMA(1,1,0) with drift) for the LSCS variable performs better than other WT functions. In the novel hybrid model MODWT-FIR.DM, each function’s approximation coefficient (LSCS) is applied with input variables (Loil and Repo). We evaluate the performance of the proposed model (MODWT-LA8-FIR.DM) using different statistical measures (ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE) and compare it to two established models: the original FIR.DM and other MODWT-FIR.DM functions for forecasting 20% of datasets. The outcomes show that the MODWT-LA8-FIR.DM performs better than the traditional models based on lower ME (3.167586), RMSE (3.167638), MAE (3.167586), and MPE (80.860849). The proposed hybrid model may be a potential stock market forecasting model."
https://openalex.org/W4311662574,"The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of race tactics for performance in the heats of an international sprint cross-country (XC) skiing competition in the classical style. Thirty elite male XC skiers (age: 24±3 years, sprint International Ski Federation [FIS] points: 61±27) performed a sprint time-trial (STT) followed by one to three 'knock-out' heats on a 1.7 km racecourse. An integrated GNSS/IMU system was used to determine position, sub-technique distribution and kinematics. Positioning was analysed using the television broadcast of the race. STT rank correlated positively with the final rank [(rs (28) = .72, P = .001)]. The top-two finishers in each heat were on average ~3.8% slower in the heats compared to the STT (237.1±3.9 vs. 228.3±4.0 seconds, P = .001). On average, the skiers performed ~10 overtakings per 100 meters from the start to the last uphill segment but only ~3 overtakings per 100 meters in the last two segments in each heat. 93.8% of the top-two finishing skiers positioned themselves at top 2 before approaching the final uphill, in which the top-two finishers and the skiers ranked 3-4 were generally faster than those ranked 5-6 in the heats (both, P = .01). Here, top-four skiers employed 5.3% longer cycle lengths and 3.4% higher cycle rates in the diagonal sub-technique than skiers ranked 5-6 (all, P = .01). The present study demonstrates the importance of race tactics for performance in the heats of sprint XC skiing, in which the main performance-determining factors in the present racecourse were a front position when approaching the final uphill segment combined with the ability to ski fast in that segment. In general, this illustrates how accurate racecourse analyses may help skiers to optimize their race-individual race-strategies in the heats of sprint XC skiing competitions."
https://openalex.org/W4311663123,"Background Childhood anemia is a global public health issue. In this study, we assessed the potential sociodemographic and dietary factors associated with the prevalence of anemia among children aged 6–59 months in Nigeria. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we collected dietary information and demographic data on 6,338 children with anemia from the Nigerian Demographic and Health Surveys (2018). The association between the occurrence of anemia and the demographic and dietary factors was determined by conducting Chi-squared tests. Additionally, bivariate and multivariate order logit models were constructed and reported as odds ratios. Results The results of the multivariate analysis showed that the risk of anemia was reduced by 13% and 44% in children aged 13–36 months (OR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.77–0.98; p = 0.019) and 37–59 months (OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.49–0.63; p &lt; 0.001), respectively, compared to the risk of anemia in children aged 6–12 months. Anemia was 28% less likely in children of non-anemic mothers (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.66–0.80; p &lt; 0.001) than children of anemic mothers. Children fed pumpkin, carrot, squash, and sweet potato showed a lower occurrence of anemia by 17% (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70–0.99; p = 0.036) compared to those who were not fed these vegetables. Chances of anemia increased by 14% in children who were fed white potatoes, white yams, manioc, cassava, and other root-based foods (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.01–1.29; p = 0.036). Conclusion This study highlighted the impact of a plant-based diet on the high prevalence of childhood anemia in Nigeria. Therefore, reformation of dietary habits, the inclusion of nutritional supplements, and food-fortification programs with reductions in maternal anemia are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4311664036,"The analysis of urban spatial form is the basic research of urban development. Traditional fractal research often focuses on the urban spatial layout, which cannot visually express the specific form, change characteristics and development trend of urban architectural spaces.The urban architectural form is simplified and the basic architectural form templates are extracted, and then, the correlations between architecture form and fractal dimension are built. The results of the case study show that the architectural layout of Zhengzhou City exhibits obvious fractal characteristics, and the combination of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional fractal dimensions is helpful for comprehensively revealing the architectural layout information. Moreover, the fractal dimension of buildings shows that the gradient from the inner to outer ring decreases, similar to the 'annual growth rings' of trees. Obvious differences exist in the fractal dimensions of urban buildings in different directions, reflecting the urban expansion direction. This study promotes the visualization of fractal theory and the expression of fractal theory in spatial gradient, providing theoretical and data reference for urban spatial form optimization."
https://openalex.org/W4311672102,"To investigate whether culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Western Sydney have experienced any positive effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if so, what these were.A cross-sectional survey with ten language groups was conducted from 21st March to 9th July 2021 in Sydney, Australia. Participants were recruited through bilingual multicultural health staff and health care interpreter service staff and answered a question, 'In your life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic?' Differences were explored by demographic variables. Free-text responses were thematically coded using the Content Analysis method.707 people completed the survey, aged 18 to >70, 49% males and 51% females. Only 161 (23%) of those surveyed reported any positive impacts. There were significant differences in the proportion of those who reported positives based on age (p = 0.004), gender (p = 0.013), language (p = 0.003), health literacy (p = 0.014), English language proficiency (p = 0.003), education (p = <0.001) and whether participants had children less than 18 years at home (p = 0.001). Content Analysis of open-ended responses showed that, of those that did report positives, the top themes were 'Family time' (44%), 'Improved self-care' (31%) and, 'Greater connection with others' (17%).Few surveyed participants reported finding any positives stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding is in stark contrast to related research in Australia with participants whose native language is English in which many more people experienced positives. The needs of people from CALD backgrounds must inform future responses to community crises to facilitate an equitable effect of any collateral positives that may arise."
https://openalex.org/W4311672718,"Background Suppression of cardiac iinflammasome, which can be inhibited by Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, can ameliorate cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Increased cardiac inflammasome decrease the abundance of regulatory T (Treg) cells and exacerbate cardiac dysfunction. Interaction between cardiomyocytes and Treg cells is involved in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cardiac dysfunction. Aims This study evaluates whether the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) treatment improves NASH-associated cardiac dysfunction. Methods The in vivo and in vitro mechanisms and effects of two weeks of OCA treatment on i nflammasome and Treg dysregulation-related cardiac dysfunction in NASH mice (NASH-OCA) at systemic, tissue and cellular levels were investigated. Results The OCA treatment suppressed the serum and cardiac inflammasome levels, reduced the cardiac infiltrated CD3 + T cells, increased the cardiac Treg-represented anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10/IL-10R) and improved cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and function [decreased left ventricle (LV) mass and increased fractional shortening (FS)] in NASH-OCA mice. The percentages of OCA-decreased cardiac fibrosis and OCA-increased FS were positively correlated with the percentage of OCA-increased levels of cardiac FXR and IL-10/IL-10R. In the Treg cells from NASH-OCA mice spleen, in comparison with the Treg cells of the NASH group, higher intracellular FXR but lower inflammasome levels, and more proliferative/active and less apoptotic cells were observed. Incubation of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts with Treg-NASHcm [supernatant of Treg from NASH mice as condition medium (cm)], increased inflammasome levels, decreased the proliferative/active cells, suppressed the intracellular FXR, and downregulated differentiation/contraction marker. The Treg-NASHcm-induced hypocontractility of H9c2 can be attenuated by co-incubation with OCA, and the OCA-related effects were abolished by siIL-10R pretreatment. Conclusions Chronic FXR activation with OCA is a potential strategy for activating IL-10/IL-10R signalling, reversing cardiac regulatory T cell dysfunction, and improving inflammasome-mediated NASH-related cardiac dysfunction."

We previously characterized neurogenic bladder dysfunction in a mouse model of MS induced by a coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The aim of the study was to identify genes and pathways linking neuroinflammation in the central nervous system with urinary bladder (UB) dysfunction to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying LUTS in demyelinating diseases. Adult C57BL/6 male mice (N = 12) received either an intracranial injection of MHV (coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis, CIE group), or sterile saline (control group). Spinal cord (SC) and urinary bladders (UB) were collected from CIE mice at 1 wk and 4 wks, followed by RNA isolation and NanoString nCounter Neuroinflammation assay. Transcriptome analysis of SC identified a significantly changed expression of >150 genes in CIE mice known to regulate astrocyte, microglia and oligodendrocyte functions, neuroinflammation and immune responses. Two genes were significantly upregulated (Ttr and Ms4a4a), and two were downregulated (Asb2 and Myct1) only in the UB of CIE mice. Siglec1 and Zbp1 were the only genes significantly upregulated in both tissues, suggesting a common transcriptomic link between neuroinflammation in the CNS and neurogenic changes in the UB of CIE mice."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the PT services, and the associated psychological distress endured by PT practitioners in Saudi Arabia.A cross-sectional study was conducted to survey on-duty PT practitioners using a web-based questionnaire. Licensed PT practitioners working in Saudi Arabia (n = 265) participated and completed all the survey questions. The questionnaire comprised 30 questions covering the sociodemographic data and the outcome measures, which included the impact of the pandemic on the PT practice, use of telerehabilitation, administrative response during the pandemic, and PT practitioners' anxiety measured by the General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale.During the lockdown, disruptive impact on the PT practice was reported by most of the participants (80%). The majority of PT clinics/departments were either partially (43.8%) or completely (31.3%) shutdown, and therapists treated patients less than usual. Around 30% of participants reported using a telerehabilitation approach during the pandemic to communicate with patients, and about 33% received online courses and webinars to adapt the PT practice in response to the pandemic. About 21% of participants endured moderate to severe levels of anxiety, which was more pronounced among females.The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the PT services in Saudi Arabia. Consequently, the number of patients treated was reduced, and therapists suffered notable psychological stress. Furthermore, although implemented, adaptive administrative measures were inadequate. Physical therapy practitioners and administrative authorities are encouraged to prioritize training and implementation of telerehabilitation as a likely prospective approach of PT practice."
https://openalex.org/W4311679971,"Background In the United States, national ecological studies suggest a positive impact of COVID-19 vaccination coverage on outcomes in adults. However, the national impact of the vaccination program on COVID-19 in children remains unknown. To determine the association of COVID-19 vaccination with U.S. case incidence, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions for pediatric populations during the Delta and Omicron periods. Methods We conducted an ecological analysis among children aged 5–17 and compared incidence rate ratios (RRs) of COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions by pediatric vaccine coverage, with jurisdictions in the highest vaccine coverage quartile as the reference. Results RRs comparing states with lowest pediatric vaccination coverage to the highest pediatric vaccination coverage were 2.00 and 0.64 for cases, 2.96 and 1.11 for emergency department visits, and 2.76 and 1.01 for hospital admissions among all children during the Delta and Omicron periods, respectively. During the 3-week peak period of the Omicron wave, only children aged 12–15 and 16–17 years in the states with the lowest versus highest coverage, had a significantly higher rate of emergency department visits (RR = 1.39 and RR = 1.34, respectively). Conclusions COVID-19 vaccines were associated with lower case incidence, emergency department visits and hospital admissions among children during the Delta period but the association was weaker during the Omicron period. Pediatric COVID-19 vaccination should be promoted as part of a program to decrease COVID-19 impact among children; however, vaccine effectiveness may be limited when available vaccines do not match circulating viral variants."

Pipkin J. Marder E. Neuronal morphologies built for reliable physiology in a rhythmic motor circuit.eLife. 2019; 8e41728Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the physiological setting, dendrite diameters of central auditory neurons are correlated with their frequency response (49Sanes D.H. Goldstein N.A. Ostad M. Hillman D.E. Dendritic morphology of central auditory neurons correlates with their tonotopic position.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 294: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the pathological setting, exposure of hippocampal neurons to amyloid Aβ results in a decrease in dendrite diameters (50Smith D.L. Pozueta J. Gong B. Arancio O. Shelanski M. Reversal of long-term dendritic spine alterations in Alzheimer disease models.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 16877-16882Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which could contribute to defective information processing in Alzheimer's disease. However, the regulation of neurite thickness remains little understood. In this study, we found that PtdIns(3,5)P2 regulates neurite thickness through NSG1/NEEP21. Suppressing either PtdIns(3,5)P2 pathway or NSG1 expression resulted in thinner neurites. Proteins in the PtdIns(3,5)P2 machinery colocalized and physically interacted with NSG1. Perturbation of PtdIns(3,5)P2 dynamics led to the mislocalization of NSG1. Importantly, overexpression of NSG1 rescued the neurite thickness defect in neurons defective of PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis. This study revealed a novel role of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in neuron morphology and provided a novel target pathway for treating PtdIns(3,5)P2-related neuropathies. In previous studies, we noticed that neurites of PtdIns(3,5)P2-impaired neurons such as Vac14−/− neurons were often thinner than WT controls (28Zhang Y. Zolov S.N. Chow C.Y. Slutsky S.G. Richardson S.C. Piper R.C. et al.Loss of Vac14, a regulator of the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, results in neurodegeneration in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17518-17523Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is possibly involved in regulating neurite thickness. To examine this possibility, we investigated the role of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in neuron development by inhibiting PIKfyve. PIKfyve is the only lipid kinase that synthesizes PtdIns(3,5)P2, so PIKfyve inhibitors are known to abolish PtdIns(3,5)P2 almost completely (29Zolov S.N. Bridges D. Zhang Y. Lee W.W. Riehle E. Verma R. et al.In vivo, Pikfyve generates PI(3,5)P2, which serves as both a signaling lipid and the major precursor for PI5P.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 17472-17477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mouse hippocampal neurons were cultured in vitro and treated with a selective PIKfyve inhibitor YM201636 (51Jefferies H.B. Cooke F.T. Jat P. Boucheron C. Koizumi T. Hayakawa M. et al.A selective PIKfyve inhibitor blocks PtdIns(3,5)P(2) production and disrupts endomembrane transport and retroviral budding.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations (30Zhang Y. McCartney A.J. Zolov S.N. Ferguson C.J. Meisler M.H. Sutton M.A. et al.Modulation of synaptic function by VAC14, a protein that regulates the phosphoinositides PI(3,5)P₂ and PI(5)P.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3442-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), swollen vacuoles were observed in both cell bodies (soma) and neurites in YM201636-treated neurons (Fig. 1, B and C). Such vacuolation is a hallmark phenotype of PtdIns(3,5)P2-deficient cells (52Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. Mammalian cell morphology and endocytic membrane homeostasis require enzymatically active phosphoinositide 5-kinase PIKfyve.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). When neurons were exposed to YM201636 during early development, from 0 days in vitro (div) to 3 div after plating, neurite outgrowth was impaired, forming shorter and thinner neuronal processes (Fig. 1, B and D). Meanwhile, axon specification, an event during early development characterized by the selection of only one of the neurites to become the axon (53Winans A.M. Collins S.R. Meyer T. Waves of actin and microtubule polymerization drive microtubule-based transport and neurite growth before single axon formation.eLife. 2016; 5e12387Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was not affected by YM201636. The axon marker, Tau, was still restricted to only one neurite in YM201636-treated neurons at 3 div, indicating that PtdIns(3,5)P2 was not involved in axon/dendrite polarization (Fig. 1, B and E). The effect of PtdIns(3,5)P2 abolishment was also examined during late neuron development (7 div to 9 div), when neurites were already formed. In YM201636-treated older cultures, dendrites labeled by Map2 were noticeably thinner, and axon networks marked by Tau were much sparser (Fig. 1, C and F). Taken together, these results suggest that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is involved in regulating and maintaining neurite morphology, particularly neurite thickness, but not axon/dendrite polarization. It was reported that inhibition of PIKfyve could result in cell death in primary neuron cultures (54Martin S. Harper C.B. May L.M. Coulson E.J. Meunier F.A. Osborne S.L. Inhibition of PIKfyve by YM-201636 dysregulates autophagy and leads to apoptosis-independent neuronal cell death.PLoS One. 2013; 8e60152Google Scholar). To exclude the effect of neuronal viability on neurite morphology, we made use of Cath.a-differentiated cells (CAD) cells, a neuron cell line derived from catecholaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (55Qi Y. Wang J.K. McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. Characterization of a CNS cell line, CAD, in which morphological differentiation is initiated by serum deprivation.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurite growth in CAD cells can be conveniently initiated by serum withdrawal from culturing media, which provides a unique system of “on-demand” neurite growth. A fluorescent protein, Citrine, was transfected into CAD cells to serve as a volume marker. When treated by YM201636, or another structurally distinct PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod (56Cai X. Xu Y. Cheung A.K. Tomlinson R.C. Alcázar-Román A. Murphy L. et al.PIKfyve, a class III PI kinase, is the target of the small molecular IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor apilimod and a player in Toll-like receptor signaling.Chem. Biol. 2013; 20: 912-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), CAD neurites were significantly thinner than the controls (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with the results in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1, D and F). Moreover, to exclude possible side effects of chemical inhibitors, PIKfyve expression was specifically stably knocked down with lentivirus-mediated shRNA expression (shPIKfyve) in CAD cells (Fig. 2C). After differentiation, stable shPIKfyve cells actively developed much thinner neurites than control cells with empty vector infection (shNC) (Fig. 2, D and E). Note that neurite growth occurred after PIKfyve knockdown, excluding cell viability as the explanation for the thinner neurites. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PIKfyve inhibition resulted in thinner neurites in both primary hippocampal neurons and CAD neurons, suggesting that regulation of neurite thickness by PtdIns(3,5)P2 is a common mechanism in multiple neuronal types. NSG1/NEEP21 is a neuron-specific membrane protein involved in the trafficking of a number of physiologically critical cargoes. We noticed that there is a significant overlap in phenotypes regulated by PtdIns(3,5)P2 or NSG1, including AMPA receptor–mediated synaptic plasticity (37Alberi S. Boda B. Steiner P. Nikonenko I. Hirling H. Muller D. The endosomal protein NEEP21 regulates AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus.Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and APP processing (38Norstrom E.M. Zhang C. Tanzi R. Sisodia S.S. Identification of NEEP21 as a β-amyloid precursor protein-interacting protein in vivo that modulates amyloidogenic processing in vitro.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15677-15685Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to determine the relationship between NSG1 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 in regulating neurite thickness. Firstly, NSG1 expression was knocked down in CAD cells by three independent shRNA constructs. Neurite thinning was observed in all of them (Fig. 3, A and B), similar to shPIKfyve cells. This phenotype could be rescued when an mCherry-tagged NSG1 (mCherry-NSG1) was reintroduced to the NSG1 knockdown cells (Fig. S1, A–C). This result suggests that both PtdIns(3,5)P2 and NSG1 regulate neurite thickness. The localization of NSG1 was determined with mCherry-NSG1 in CAD cells. Consistent with previous reports (35Steiner P. Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. Modulation of receptor cycling by neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kD.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), mCherry-NSG1 localized to punctate endosomal structures (Video S1 and Fig. 3C). Notably, mCherry-NSG1 puncta exhibited active long-range and bidirectional movements along the neurites, as well as between neurites and soma (Video S1). At the steady state, the distribution of mCherry-NSG1 between soma and neurites varied among individual cells, ranging from mainly soma-localized (Fig. 3, C1) to almost exclusively neurite-localized (Figure 3, Figure 4), with many intermediate states in between. Similar patterns were also observed in PC12 cells, another commonly used neuronal cell line (Fig. S1D). These results suggest an active transport route for NSG1-positive vesicles between soma and neurites. To determine the spatial relationship between NSG1 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 machinery, mCherry-NSG1 was coexpressed with Citrine-tagged Vac14 (Cit-Vac14). Vac14 is an essential component in the PtdIns(3,5)P2 machinery that forms a star-shaped pentameric scaffold and nucleates PIKfyve and Fig4 in the same assembly (4Lees J.A. Li P. Kumar N. Weisman L.S.

In this study, we aimed at describing CAR T-cells effectiveness, safety and costs in a Portuguese Comprehensive Cancer Center. We performed a retrospective descriptive study of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and transformed follicular lymphoma referred to CAR T-cell therapy, between May 2019 and February 2021. Rates of treatment response, toxicity and survival (Kaplan-Meier method) were analyzed by intention-to-treat. Direct medical costs stratified by inpatient-care, outpatient-care, and diagnostic-therapeutic procedures (DTP) were derived based on resources used and their respective unit costs. In twenty patients (median age 49.5y; 55%male; 70%DLBCL; 50% with primary refractory disease), best overall and complete response rates were 65.0% and 45.0%, respectively. Median overall (OS) and progression-free survivals were 9.2 and 7.3 months; 12-month OS rate was 42.6% (95%CI:23.2-78.3). Grade≥3 cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity occurred in 5.6% and 11.1% of patients, respectively. CAR T-cell therapy expenditure, including adverse events costs, was 7 176 196€, or 286 238€ when excluding drug cost. Median cost for treated patient was 355 165€ with CAR T-cell drug cost accounting for 97.0% of the overall expense. Excluding CAR T-cell acquisition cost, inpatient-care and DTP accounted for 57% and 38% of total cost/patient, respectively. Our findings highlight the heavy economic burden of CAR T-cell therapy driven by drug acquisition costs."

An ever-growing abundance of data about trajectories of individual users paves the way for various applications that utilize user mobility information. One of the most common analysis tasks in these new applications is to extract the sequential transition patterns between two consecutive timestamps from a collection of trajectories. Such patterns have been widely exploited in diverse applications to predict and recommend next user locations based on the current position. Thus, in this paper, we explore the computation of the transition patterns, especially with a trajectory dataset collected using differential privacy, which is a de facto standard for privacy-preserving data collection and processing. Specifically, the proposed scheme relies on geo-indistinguishability, which is a variant of the well-known differential privacy, to collect trajectory data from users in a privacy-preserving manner, and exploits the functionality of the expectation-maximization algorithm to precisely estimate hidden transition patterns based on perturbed trajectory datasets collected under geo-indistinguishability. Experimental results using real trajectory datasets confirm that a good estimation of transition pattern can be achieved with the proposed method."

The study aim was to determine pre-service factors associated with sexual offense conviction among U.S. Marines.This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from male active duty U.S. Marines (2003-2018). Pre-service factors were assessed using survey data from the Recruit Assessment Program, obtained prior to recruit training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California. These survey data were linked with sexual offense conviction data obtained from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center.Of the 146,307 participants, the majority were 18-19 years old (66.7%) and non-Hispanic, White (62.1%) with a high school education or less (76.8%); 107 received convictions for a sexual offense. In unadjusted analyses, race and ethnicity, parental education, type of primary caregiver, parental death, family economic status, childhood emotional trauma, childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, and unprotected sex were associated with a sexual offense conviction. In the final multivariable model, race and ethnicity (American Indian/Alaskan Native, odds ratio [OR]: 5.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.86-14.98; Hispanic, OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.06-3.18; multiracial/other, OR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.56-6.89), education (≤ high school, OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.21-5.80), parental death (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.16-4.45), unprotected sex (OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.03-3.05), and school suspension/expulsion (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.02-2.65) were significant predictors of a subsequent sexual offense conviction.Results underscore the importance of understanding factors associated with sexual offense and highlight the large discrepancy between self-reported estimates of sexual assault and sexual offense convictions. Findings may inform the development of effective strategies to reduce sexual misconduct, such as technology-facilitated programs that provide private, targeted education; supportive assistance; and prevention materials to individuals who may have elevated sexual misconduct risk."
https://openalex.org/W4311667132,"The intensity of barbell bench press exercise is generally prescribed as the load to be lifted for a specific number of repetitions; however, other factors (e.g., execution velocity) can affect bench press exercise intensity. Moreover, no study assessed whether load distribution (i.e., the distance between the disc stacks on the two sides of the barbell) affects exercise intensity. The present study aims to assess how different combinations of load, velocity, and barbell load distribution affect the number of repetitions to failure (REPfailure), and rating of perceived exertion (RPEfatigue) and number of repetitions (REPfatigue) at fatigue onset.Ten males (age 23.3±1.8 years) performed bench press exercises to exhaustion using random combinations of three loads (50%, 65%, and 80% of 1 repetition maximum), three execution velocities (50%, 70%, and 90% of maximal concentric velocity), and two load distributions (narrow and wide). Three separate three-way repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed to assess the effect of load, velocity, and load distribution on REPfailure, RPEfatigue, and REPfatigue expressed as a percentage of REPfailure.REPfailure was affected by load (p<0.001), velocity (p<0.001), and distribution (p = 0.005). The interactions between load and velocity (p<0.001) and load and distribution (p = 0.004) showed a significant effect on REPfailure, whereas the interaction between velocity and distribution was not significant (p = 0.360). Overall, more REPfailure were performed using lower loads, higher velocities, and a wider distribution. RPEfatigue and REPfatigue were affected by load (p<0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively) and velocity (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), and not by distribution (p = 0.510 and p = 0.571, respectively) or the two-way interaction effects. Overall, using higher loads yielded higher RPEfatigue but lower REPfatigue, while RPEfatigue and REPfatigue were higher when slower velocities were used.The current investigation shows that not only load but also velocity and barbell load distribution may influence bench press training volume and perceived exertion."

Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) was defined as the IR in the specific interest period divided by the IR in the control period. The control period was defied as 1 to 2 years before diagnosis of cirrhosis. The IRs before and after cirrhosis diagnosis were 3.56 and 7.54 per 100 person-year, respectively. The IRR was 2.12 (95% confidence Interval: 2.06–2.18). The IRR of developing depression mildly increased before diagnosis of cirrhosis (-360 days to -181 days, IRR 1.14, p &lt; 0.001; -180 days to -90 days, IRR 1.24, p &lt; 0.001; -90 days to -31 days, IRR 1.56, p &lt; 0.001) and rapidly increased immediately after diagnosis of cirrhosis (+30 days to +89 days, IRR 2.12, 95% confidence interval: 2.06–2.18, p &lt; 0.001). The pattern of increasing depression immediately after the diagnosis of cirrhosis was observed equally in all sexes and ages.

https://openalex.org/W4311667717,"In ecology, an increase in genetic diversity within a community in natural ecosystems increases its productivity, while in evolutionary biology, kinship selection predicts that relatedness on social traits improves fitness. Varietal mixtures, where different genotypes are grown together, show contrasting results, especially for grain yield where both positive and negative effects of mixtures have been reported. To understand the effect of diversity on field performance, we grew 96 independent mixtures each composed with 12 durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum Thell.) inbred lines, under two contrasting environmental conditions for water availability. Using dense genotyping, we imputed allelic frequencies and a genetic diversity index on more than 96000 loci for each mixture. We then analyzed the effect of genetic diversity on agronomic performance using a genome-wide approach. We explored the stress gradient hypothesis, which proposes that the greater the unfavourable conditions, the more beneficial the effect of diversity on mixture performance. We found that diversity on average had a negative effect on yield and its components while it was beneficial on grain weight. There was little support for the stress gradient theory. We discuss how to use genomic data to improve the assembly of varietal mixtures."

https://openalex.org/W4311667988,"As an important part of a modern economic system, a modern industrial system is the key to promoting high-quality economic development. China's modern industrial system construction focuses on industrial restructuring. At present, in order to strengthen the support and leading role of transportation in the modern economic system, China is actively promoting the construction of a competitive transportation power. Therefore, it is necessary to study whether large-scale investment in transportation infrastructure can promote industrial structure transformation and upgrade. This paper takes China as the research background. Firstly, a RAM model was employed to evaluate the unified economic and environmental efficiency of transportation infrastructure that measures the level of transportation infrastructure investment. Secondly, a PVAR model was built to evaluate the dynamic effects of transportation infrastructure investment on industrial structure transformation and upgrade. Finally, from the perspective of rational flow and optimal allocation of resource factors, the paper points out that transportation infrastructure investment can indirectly promote industrial structure transformation and upgrade through three paths, namely expanding market demand, reducing resource misallocation and increasing technological innovation, and the first half of these paths are positively regulated by policies. Then, an empirical test was done with the moderated mediation model. Research findings suggest that: first, improvements in the unified economic and environmental efficiency of transportation infrastructure can only promote industrial structure supererogation in a short time, but have no significant effect on promoting industrial structure rationalization in the short or long term. Second, in actual situation, transportation infrastructure investment can promote industrial structure transformation and upgrade only by expanding market demand and technological innovation, but not by reducing resource misallocation. Third, the first half of these paths through which transportation infrastructure investment promotes industrial structure transformation and upgrade are positively regulated by policies. This paper provided some theoretical reference for promoting industrial structure transformation and upgrade by virtue of the sustainable development of transportation."

The participant's 3D face scans with and without a surgical mask were taken by using a smartphone. The mask retainer was designed using the 3D face scan data based on the facial anthropometric landmarks. The fitting was inspected and adjusted using the masked face scan data. The retainer was fabricated using a 3D printer. The effectiveness of the retainer on the augmentation of the fit of the surgical mask was tested according to the Chinese Standard (GB 19083-2010). A questionnaire was used to assess the effect of wearing surgical masks with and without retainers and N95 respirators on subjective perception of discomfort. The effectiveness test of the retainer on the augmentation of the fit performance showed a better than 25-fold increase in the overall fit factor, meeting the fit requirement for KN95 respirators in China. The subjective perception of discomfort of wearing N95 was significantly greater than surgical mask with and without retainers. The fit factor results indicated that by using the retainer, the overall fit factors and that of each exercise significantly increased compared to that of the group with the surgical mask alone. And compared with N95, the surgical mask with the retainer significant improved comfort. The surgical mask with the retainer can provide an alternative of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers."

Meta-analyses have identified that interventions aimed at young people who report loneliness as their primary problem are lacking within the literature. In adults, the most effective interventions for loneliness are those which target the underlying maladaptive social cognitions. Therefore, we have developed a modular Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) intervention for children and young people. The aim of this study is to conduct a multiple baseline single-case experimental design (SCED) to assess the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. In total 6–8 11–18-year-olds and their families will be recruited. The design consists of AB+ post-intervention, where A is the baseline phase, B is the intervention phase and then a post-intervention phase. Participants will complete a baseline assessment, before being randomised to one of four different baseline lengths (12 days, 19 days, 26 days or 33 days). Participants will then complete an average of 12 sessions of CBT, with the aim being to reduce their feelings of loneliness. Participants will then complete a 12-day post-intervention phase. Participant loneliness will be repeatedly assessed throughout the three phases of the intervention using the Three-item Loneliness Scale, which will be the primary outcome.

However, there has been little exploration and examination of the mechanisms underlying the effects of extraverted leadership on performance. Drawing on distal-proximal motivational theory and situational strength theory, the present study proposes and examines a moderated mediation model that explains how leader extraversion affects team performance and how situational characteristics strengthen or constrain this relationship. Respondents were recruited through management team training courses run by the eight Chinese companies. We conducted two rounds of electronic questionnaire collection. The first round of data was collected during the training session. Four weeks later, we collected the data through the training courses' WeChat groups. Data collected from 226 Chinese team leaders was analyzed using SPSS 26 and Mplus 7. We find that leader extraversion predicts team performance through a motivational mechanism operationalized as leader work engagement. We further find that goal clarity and process clarity play an important role in strengthening the positive effect of leader extraversion on leader work engagement as well as the motivational mechanism, providing an empirical explanation of how leader extraversion affects team performance through a motivational mechanism operationalized as leader work engagement. We also explore how two potential situational characteristics, operationalized as goal clarity and process clarity of leaders, affect the relationship between leader extraversion and leader work engagement as well as the motivational mechanism. Addionally, the findings suggest important practical implications for the organizations seeking to identify effective team leaders."

The carbon storage presented a spatial distribution pattern of high–low from east to west. The soil conservation presented a spatial pattern of decreasing from west to east, and the water conservation increased from west to east. (3) We divided the research into four levels of importance: The area of general importance in the study site accounted for 1017.58 km 2 and was distributed in the northwest of the study site. The moderately important areas were distributed in the east of the study site, with an area of 1142.40 km 2 . The highly important areas were distributed in the west of the study site, totaling 2647.84 km 2 . Extremely important areas were distributed in the middle, with an area of 1451.32 km 2 . (4) The grid cell scale of the study area was used as the dataset to determine the weighting. This makes the weighting more objective and ensures that the spatial distribution of areas with different degrees of importance will be more accurate."

https://openalex.org/W4311674080,"Background Effective treatment and prevention of cardiovascular (CV) diseases requires reliable methods of assessing individual CV event risk. Although standardized risk calculators like Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) are sufficient in most instances, sometimes more specific clinical examination is needed to determine the most optimal intervention and its intensity. Aim To study whether carotid and femoral bruits provide prognostic information on CV events, CV mortality and all-cause mortality beyond traditional CV risk factors. Methods 1045 subjects (49.8% men), aged 51.3 ± 5.97 years were clinically examined in the beginning of 1990’s. The subjects were followed for over 20 years and data on CV events and causes of deaths was collected. Results During the follow-up period, 241 (23.1%) of the subjects died and 82 (34.6%) of the deaths were of CV origin. Carotid bruits were a significant risk factor for CV deaths only if subjects with previous CV events were included. After adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, LDL cholesterol, coronary artery disease and stroke, carotid bruits posed a hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval) of 4.15 (2.39–8.52) p&lt;0.001 for CV deaths. After excluding subjects with previous CV events (after which n = 941) neither carotid nor femoral bruits were statistically associated with CV events or all-cause mortality. Adding carotid or femoral bruits in the baseline risk model with traditional CV risk factors did not improve C-statistic, reclassification, or discrimination of the subjects. Conclusions Carotid and femoral bruits do not provide clinically useful information in a pure primary prevention setting. Carotid bruits might be useful in evaluating the overall CV risk in a population where recurrent CV events may occur."

However, assessments of cognitive status of epileptic patients are far too low during clinical visits. This calls for early neuropsychological assessment soon after the diagnosis of epilepsy for a better treatment plan and outcome for epileptic patients. Objective This study aimed to assess the cognitive adverse effects of epilepsy and its predictors attending outpatient departments of South Gondar Zone hospitals Amhara region Ethiopia 2020/2021. Methods A multi-center institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 509 respondents were included with a response rate of 93.9%. Previously adapted pretested structured questionnaire was used containing, socio-demographic, clinical, and seizure related factors. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognitive impairment. A systematic random sampling technique was applied. Data were entered into Epi data version 4.4.2 then exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regressions with odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were employed. The level of significance of association was determined at a p-value &lt; 0.05. Results Prevalence of cognitive impairment in this study was 69.2% (95%CI; 65.4, 73.1). Rural residents (AOR = 4.16,95%CI, 1.99,8.67), respondents who couldn’t read and write (AOR = 2.62, 95%CI; 1.24, 5.5,) longer duration of seizure disorder (AOR = 4.59,95%CI; 2.01,10.52), taking combined Phenobarbital and Phenytoin (AOR = 4.69,95%CI; 1.88,11.69), having history of head injury (AOR = 3.29,95%CI;1.30,8.32), having depression (AOR = 4.76,95%CI;2.83,7.98), and anxiety (AOR = 3.11,95%CI; 1.58,6.12) were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Conclusions Prevalence of cognitive impairment in this study was high. Regular neuropsychiatric assessment of patients with epilepsy should be encouraged especially for those participants with longer durations of illness, who are rural residents, who take combined Phenobarbital and Phenytoin, participants who had a history of head injury, depression, and anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W4311674679,"Andaman cattle is a precious indigenous livestock species endemic to Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. Till date, origin and genetic makeup of the breed which is warranted for breed conservation is not known. Moreover, the spread of zebu cattle from Indus valley to different parts of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) is not properly understood. Here, we report the genetic diversity, population structure of Andaman cattle and their evolution in the context of epicentre of zebu domestication and ISEA. High genetic diversity in complete mitochondrial D-loop sequences indicated the ability of the breed to withstand impending climate change. Total 81 haplotypes were detected and all of them except three belonged to Bos indicus. The presence of taurine haplotypes in Andaman cattle indicate introgression by European-derived cattle. A poor phylogenetic signal of Andaman cattle with genetic affinities with cattle of Indian subcontinent and ISEA was observed. The poor phylogenetic structure may be due to multidirectional gene flow from Indian subcontinent and ISEA, with which Andaman shares a close cultural and trade relationship from Neolithic age. We hypothesize that Andaman cattle is the outcome of Neolithic diffusion from centre of zebu domestication along with multidirectional commercial exchange between Indian subcontinent and ISEA."

In a project evaluating association between gender affirmation and suicide attempts in the US Transgender Survey, we evaluated the relationship between gender affirmation and risk for suicide attempts. One of the challenges is that the age at suicide attempts was only collected for the first and last attempt. The initial zero-inflated negative binomial model enabled us to evaluate the association between gender affirmation and number of suicide attempts per 5 years adjusting for other covariates. However, ignoring missing failure times of recurrent events may have caused bias and loss of efficiency. In this paper, we use a recurrent-event survival analysis incorporating time-varying covariates with three approaches to impute the age at suicide attempt, estimates from three imputation approaches are similar. We were able to confirm the findings from the initial model and identify additional associations that were not detected in the initial analysis. Findings suggest the need to consider additional analytical approaches in settings with high data missingness by design. Research to validate and compare measures that ask first and last attempt to those which enumerate all attempts in this population will be important for future surveys."
https://openalex.org/W4311677615,"The composition of the nasal microbiota in surgical patients in the context of general anesthesia and nasal povidone-iodine decolonization is unknown. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to determine: (i) if general anesthesia is associated with changes in the nasal microbiota of surgery patients and (ii) if preoperative intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization is associated with changes in the nasal microbiota of surgery patients.One hundred and fifty-one ambulatory patients presenting for surgery were enrolled in a quality improvement study by convenience sampling. Pre- and post-surgery nasal samples were collected from patients in the no intranasal decolonization group (control group, n = 54). Pre-decolonization nasal samples were collected from the preoperative intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization group (povidone-iodine group, n = 97). Intranasal povidone-iodine was administered immediately prior to surgery and continued for 20 minutes before patients proceeded for surgery. Post-nasal samples were then collected. General anesthesia was administered to both groups. DNA from the samples was extracted for 16S rRNA sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq.In the control group, there was no evidence of change in bacterial diversity between pre- and post-surgery samples. In the povidone-iodine group, nasal bacterial diversity was greater in post-surgery, relative to pre-surgery (Shannon's Diversity Index (P = 0.038), Chao's richness estimate (P = 0.02) and Inverse Simpson index (P = 0.027). Among all the genera, only the relative abundance of the genus Staphylococcus trended towards a decrease in patients after application (FDR adjusted P = 0.06). Abundant genera common to both povidone-iodine and control groups included Staphylococcus, Bradyrhizobium, Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, Lactobacillus, and Moraxella.We found general anesthesia was not associated with changes in the nasal microbiota. Povidone-iodine treatment was associated with nasal microbial diversity and decreased abundance of Staphylococcus. Future studies should examine the nasal microbiota structure and function longitudinally in surgical patients receiving intranasal povidone-iodine."
https://openalex.org/W4311678433,"A new virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control strategy was researched and proposed for a VSC-HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current Based on Voltage Source Converter) transmission system. It can be applied to half-bridge or full-half-bridge hybrid topology modular multi-level converter (MMC) to improve the stability and reliability of the system. First, it is proposed that the energy stored in the equivalent capacitor of MMC power module was used to imitate the rotor inertial of synchronous generator. It can buffer transient power fluctuations and synchronize autonomously with the grid. Then the impedance characteristics of the proposed control method have been deduced and analyzed. The results show that the VSG control loop mainly improves the low frequency characteristics of the converter. Secondly, the ability to suppress transient fault current is weak. So, a method, that the given values of inner current loop are calculated by grid impedance matrix, was used. A double closed loop control structure composed by a power outer loop based on VSG control and a current inner loop is obtained. The simulation results show that it can effectively improve the current control capability during the transient process for systems with a 1:2 ratio of converter capacity to grid capacity (The grid short-circuit capacity is 60MW and the MMC is 30 MW). Finally, a hybrid MMC simulation model was built based on PSCAD and the steady-state and transient fault ride-through simulations were performed. The power adjustment time of MMC under the proposed VSG control is about 1s, while the adjustment time under the conventional control strategy is greater than 4s."
https://openalex.org/W4311678610,"The current work explored the dimensionality and convergent validity of responses to Barrera et al.'s (2015) 29-item Formal Thought Disorder-Self Scale (FTD-SS) obtained in two non-clinical samples. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted in Sample 1 (n = 324), yielding evidence of three correlated factors, although simple structure was not achieved until nine items were removed. Support for the correlated three factors model of responses to the revised 20-item scale (FTD-SS-R) was replicated when a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in Sample 2 (n = 610). Finally, convergent associations were found between FTD-SS-R scores and scores from other schizotypy measures across both samples, though these measures only explained half of the variance in FTD-SS-R scores. Additional research is needed to evaluate the appropriateness of the items and incremental validity of the scale in non-clinical samples."
