We have used linear glycerol velocity and discontinuous sucrose gradient analysis to investigate the distribution and native conformation of PS1 and PS2 during this regulated processing in cultured cells and in brain. The PS1 NTF and CTF co-localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the Golgi apparatus, where they are components of a ∼250-kDa complex. This complex also contains β-catenin but not β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). In contrast, the PS1 holoprotein precursor is predominantly localized to the rough ER and smooth ER, where it is a component of a ∼180-kDa native complex. PS2 forms similar but independent complexes. Restricted incorporation of the presenilin NTF and CTF along with a potentially functional ligand (β-catenin) into a multimeric complex in the ER and Golgi apparatus may provide an explanation for the regulated accumulation of the NTF and CTF.

The presenilin holoproteins are maintained at low steady levels both in brain and in other peripheral tissues, probably by proteasome-mediated degradation (10Fraser P.E. Levesque G. Yu G. Mills L.

As a result, the presenilin species most readily detected are the stable NH2- and COOH-terminal endoproteolytic fragments, the stoichiometry of which appears to be tightly regulated (8Thinakaran G.

The functional role of the presenilins is still unknown, although roles in cellular differentiation, in signal transduction, in apoptosis, or in intracellular protein trafficking have been proposed. To better understand the presenilin proteins and their biological functions, we have investigated both the native state of these proteins and their biochemical subcellular localization in membrane fractions derived from cultured cells and from the human brain. Our data suggest that the presenilins form detergent-sensitive high molecular mass complexes. The PS1 holoprotein is a component of a complex of ∼180 kDa, while the endoproteolytic fragments are components of a ∼250-kDa complex that contains β-catenin (a member of the armadillo protein family which may have both structural and signal transduction roles) but not βAPP. In addition to forming complexes of differing sizes, the intracellular distribution of the holoprotein and the endoproteolytic fragments differ. Untransfected HEK293 cells (10-cm dishes) or the transfected HEK293 cell line stably expressing wild type human PS1 and APP695 (gift from Drs. D. Selkoe and M. Citron) were grown to confluence. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed at 4 °C for 30 min with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer containing either 1.0% digitonin (Sigma), 0.5% Triton X-100 (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Boehringer Mannheim), or 0.5% SDS (Sigma) plus 25 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml each of chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain. Other protease inhibitor mixtures have been tested but do not alter the results reported here. Insoluble material was removed from the lysates by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min. To prepare membrane extracts, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, containing protease inhibitors. After being swollen for 60 min, cells were subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C; the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 107,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed once with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, containing protease inhibitors, followed by extraction with lysis buffer as above. Human brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing 1.0 g of normal cerebral cortex in a total volume of 5.0 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, at 4 °C with protease inhibitors using a Polytron tissue shredder and a Teflon homogenizer followed by rehomogenization in the presence of 1.0% digitonin or 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for glycerol gradient centrifugation. The glycerol gradient centrifugation procedure was as described previously (12Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, 0.5 ml of total protein extracts or membrane extracts was applied to the top of a 11.5-ml 10–40% (w/v) linear glycerol gradient containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4% appropriate detergent. Gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 35,000 rpm and 4 °C using an SW41 rotor and collected by upward displacement into 1.0-ml fractions using an Isco model 640 density gradient fractionator. To quantitatively recover proteins, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin were added to 150-μl aliquots of each fraction, followed by precipitation with 5 volumes of −20 °C acetone.

Mouse anti-β-catenin and anti-γ-catenin (C-19220 and C-7207, respectively, Transduction Laboratories) were coupled to protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 1.0% digitonin- or 0.5% Triton X-100-extracted proteins from lysates (2 mg/ml) or gradient fractions were preabsorbed with preimmune serum linked to beads, then combined with the appropriate antibody linked to beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times for 15 min each with 1.0% digitonin or 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, neutralized with 1.0 m Tris, separated on Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Novex), and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore). Western blots were probed with the appropriate antibodies and detected using ECL (Amersham Corp.). ER and Golgi membrane-enriched fractions were isolated from HEK293 cells and from human brain as described previously (16Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J.

Briefly cells (5 × 107) or human brain tissue (0.25 g) were homogenized in 2 ml of sucrose medium (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mmHEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain), clarified by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min, and fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Following centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom, and the proteins were precipitated prior to separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Although the sedimentation profiles of ER and Golgi membranes in these gradients have been previously characterized (16Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J.

To determine the native state of PS1 protein, untransfected HEK293 cells were solubilized in nondenaturing digitonin buffers, and the extracted proteins were fractionated on a linear glycerol velocity gradient. Both NTF and CTF of PS1 were found in identical fractions (fractions 3–7) with a peak in fractions 5 and 6 corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa (note that because the apparent molecular mass is also dependent upon relative buoyancy, it is likely that the size of a multimeric complex estimated from the glycerol gradient will be underestimated) (Fig. 1 A). There was virtually no PS1 immunoreactivity in the fractions corresponding to molecular masses lower than 60 kDa even after prolonged exposure, implying that very little PS1 exists as stable monomers in the digitonin lysate. The NTF and CTF of PS1 may therefore be components of the same high molecular mass oligomeric complex in vivo. To explore this hypothesis further, we examined the sensitivity of the complexes to different detergents. When total proteins from the untransfected HEK293 cells were extracted in 0.5% Triton X-100 and then subjected to the same gradient centrifugation, the majority of the NTFs and a portion of the CTFs were detected in the low molecular mass range (less than 100 kDa) (Fig. 1 B). However, the bulk of the CTFs still appeared in the high molecular mass fractions at 150–200 kDa (Fig. 1 B) indicating either a stronger CTF self-association or high affinity interactions with other proteins. In the presence of 0.5% SDS, the high molecular mass complex was completely disassembled, so that both the NTF and CTF were found within the low molecular mass range (less than 69 kDa) (Fig. 1 C). In agreement with the observations from HEK293 cells, the majority of PS1 NTFs and CTFs from digitonin extracts of human brain were present in fractions 3 through 7, with a peak at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 250–300 kDa (Fig. 2 A). As with the HEK293 cells, the NTF and CTF complexes from human brain were detergent-sensitive. Thus, when extracted in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the brain NTFs were present in fractions 1–5, while the majority of the CTF were found in fractions 5 and 6 (Fig. 2 B). When brain tissue was extracted with Triton X-100 (data not shown), there was slightly more disassembly of the complex than was observed in the Nonidet P-40 treated brain extracts. Extraction of brain tissue with SDS resulted in complete dissociation of the PS1 complex (Fig. 2 C). The differential sensitivity of the complex to different detergents is therefore similar in brain and in cultured HEK293 cells. To investigate the distribution of the low abundance PS1 holoprotein, we examined glycerol velocity gradient fractions derived from digitonin extracts of an HEK293 cell line stably transfected with human PS1 and βAPP695, which expresses moderate levels of full-length PS1. As with the untransfected HEK293 cells, the NTF and CTF were components of a ∼250 kDa complex (fractions 5 and 6; Fig. 3). The PS1 holoprotein appeared in fractions 2–7 (molecular mass of 69–250 kDa), which partially overlapped with the fractions containing the NTF and CTF (Fig. 3). However, the strongest holoprotein signal was obtained in lower molecular mass fractions (Fig. 3, fractions 4 and 5). This suggests that PS1 holoprotein is either a digitonin-sensitive part of the high molecular mass fragment complex or, more likely, that it forms a distinct complex. The presence of both the NTF and CTF of PS1 in the same density gradient fractions does not preclude the possibility that they form independent complexes after endoproteolytic cleavage. To address this, fractions containing the 250-kDa complex were pooled (fractions 3–8) and used for reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies with anti-CTF antibody (Fig. 4), or with anti-NTF antibody (not shown). As with co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on whole cell lysates (Fig. 5 C andD; lanes 2 and 3), the CTF and NTF co-precipitate from glycerol gradient fractions containing the ∼250-kDa complex (Fig. 4). The specificity of the NTF-CTF association was confirmed by the absence of co-immunoprecipitation of holoprotein, NTF or CTF with: 1) preimmune serum (Fig. 4; lanes 4–6), or 2) with antibodies to irrelevant ER-resident proteins such as calnexin (data not shown). However, as would be expected from the detergent sensitivity of the ∼250-kDa complex, the NTF and CTF did not co-precipitate when the HEK293 cells were lysed with Triton X-100 (Fig. 5, C and D; lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these results indicate that the NTF and CTF of PS1 are components of the same ∼250-kDa complex. The NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments of PS2 are also present in a similar high molecular mass complex in digitonin lysates of HEK293 cells (data not shown). However, PS2 NTF does not co-precipitate with either the NTF or the CTF of PS1 (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that the two presenilins form distinct protein complexes of similar size.Figure 5The PS1 fragments and β-catenin are members of a ∼250-kDa complex and interact in a detergent-sensitive manner. Untransfected HEK293 cells were solubilized in either 1% digitonin (lanes 2–4) or 0.5% Triton X-100 (lanes 5–7) and immunoprecipitated using the antibodies as indicated at the top; PS1 NH2-terminal-specific antisera (Anti-PS1-N), COOH-terminal-specific antisera (Anti-PS1-C), and preimmune sera. The immunoprecipitation products resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the immunoblots investigated with antibodies to: β-catenin (A); the presenilin-2 NH2-terminal fragment (B), PS1-NTF (C), or the PS1-CTF (D). The column labeled Lysate (lane 1) represents about 30% of the starting digitonin lysate utilized for immunoprecipitation, which was used as a positive control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) While it is possible that the NTFs and CTFs of PS1 are the sole components of a high molecular mass complex (15Seeger M. Nordstedt C. Pentaceska S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K. Hahne S. Fraser P. Levesque L. Czernik A.J. St. George-Hyslop P. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Tanzi R.E. Greengard P. Gandy S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5090-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we consider this to be unlikely. In the Triton X-100 lysates of HEK293 cells (Fig. 1), and in the Nonidet P-40 lysates of human brain (Fig. 2), most of the CTF immunoreactivity is contained in high molecular mass fractions (150–250 kDa), whereas the majority of NTF is contained in lower molecular mass fractions (<100 kDa). This suggests that under slightly stronger detergent conditions, the CTF and NTF dissociate leaving the CTF still associated with partners other than the NTF. Using yeast two hybrid screens, we and others have found that members of the armadillo family such as β-catenin and hNPRAP can interact with presenilins (22Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). 2G. Levesque, G. Yu, M. Nishimura, D. M. Zhang, D. Xu, Y. Liang, E. Rogaeva, M.

Considering this, we examined the 250-kDa PS1 complex from HEK293 cells to determine whether it also contained endogenous β-catenin. Antibodies against either the NTF or the CTF of PS1 both co-precipitated β-catenin from digitonin lysates of native HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2–4). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that anti-β-catenin antibodies co-precipitate the PS1 NTF and CTF (Fig. 6, lane 2). We have shown that the armadillo-protein binding site of PS1 is located near residues 372–399 within the CTF.2 As would be expected from this, dissociation of the NTF and CTF by solubilization in Triton X-100 resulted in co-precipitation of β-catenin with the PS1 CTF but not with the NTF (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–7). These interactions are specific because the NTF and the CTF did not co-immunoprecipitate with either γ-catenin (Fig. 6, lane 3) or calnexin (data not shown). Finally, endogenous β-catenin was present in fractions 2–10 of digitonin-extracted HEK293 cells (Fig. 7 A). While the size distribution of β-catenin complexes overlaps that of PS1, it is obviously much broader than that of PS1. The broad size distribution of β-catenin complexes reflects the fact that β-catenin exists as free cytoplasmic molecules, and as complexes with proteins such as α-catenin, γ-catenin, cadherin, adenomatous polyposis coli, and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3β (23Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 24Miller J. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 25Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A direct interaction between PS1 and β-catenin within the same ∼250-kDa complex was confirmed by showing that antibodies to PS1-CTF could co-immunoprecipitate β-catenin and PS1-CTF only from the subset of fractions containing both proteins, i.e. fractions 3–7 (Fig. 7 B). The profile of PS1 CTF-precipitated β-catenin is very similar to the migration profile of the fragments of PS1 in the glycerol gradient (compare Figs. 1 A and 7). β-Catenin, NTF, and CTF are therefore tightly associated members of a ∼250-kDa complex. βAPP has also been proposed to interact with PS1 and PS2 (26Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 323-328Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 27Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8208-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, in the double stable PS1/βAPP HEK293 cell line, βAPP immunoreactivity was found predominantly at ∼150 kDa, close to its expected migration for a monomeric molecular mass of ∼110 kDa (Fig. 7 C). There was partial overlap with the migration of PS1 holoprotein although the peak immunoreactivities for each occur in different regions of the gradient (βAPP in fraction 3, Fig. 7 C; PS1 holoprotein in fraction 4, Fig. 3). In contrast to the co-immunoprecipitation of PS1 and β-catenin, βAPP and PS1 could not be co-immunoprecipitated from fractions containing either the ∼180-kDa or the ∼250-kDa complexes (data not shown). The apparent difference between the sizes of complexes containing PS1 holoprotein and those containing the NTF/CTF implies that they may exist in different intracellular compartments. We therefore examined the distribution of PS1 holoprotein and NTF/CTF complexes by subcellular discontinuous sucrose density fractionation of homogenates from human brain, untransfected HEK293 cells, and HEK293 cells overexpressing both wild-type human PS1 and βAPP. The organelle distribution within the gradient was confirmed using the Golgi-specific marker protein, p58 (19Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J.

In brain, as well as in transfected and untransfected HEK293 cells, PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF were both present in fractions from the Golgi apparatus and sER (Fig. 8). Slightly lower amounts were present in the rER (Fig. 8). This topographic co-localization of the NTF and CTF is in good agreement with the results described above showing that the NTF and CTF of PS1 form stable high molecular mass complexes. In fractions from the PS1/βAPP stable HEK293 cell line, PS1 holoprotein partially overlapped the distribution of PS1 NTF and CTF (Fig. 8 D). Thus, the majority of the holoprotein immunoreactivity was present in fractions corresponding to rER and sER, while the NTF and CTF predominated in fractions corresponding to Golgi as well as both the rER and the sER. Overexpression of PS1 may have caused a wider distribution of the holoprotein than might have occurred under physiologic conditions. Nevertheless, the disparity in the biochemical localization of the holoprotein versus the fragments is consistent with the fact that the holoprotein and the fragments associate into complexes of different sizes on glycerol velocity gradients (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data suggest that the PS1 holoprotein and its endoproteolytic fragments may exist within biochemically distinct complexes during the transportation and processing of PS1 from ER to Golgi apparatus. The sucrose gradient blots from the PS1/βAPP HEK293 stable cells and from human brain were investigated with anti-β-catenin antibodies (Fig. 8 E). Although β-catenin is a soluble protein, it co-purifies with PS1 holoprotein and PS1 CTF in the rER, sER, and Golgi membrane fractions. This would be expected from its interaction with a domain in the large cytoplasmic loop of PS1. We have identified a ∼250-kDa native protein complex which contains at least β-catenin, PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF. This complex is present in human brain, in native HEK293 cells, and in PS1 transfected HEK293 cells. It is apparent that the molecular masses of PS1-NTF (29 kDa), PS1-CTF (18 kDa), and β-catenin (92 kDa) on a 1:1:1 stoichiometry do not account for all of the estimated mass of the ∼250-kDa complex. It is unclear whether the additional mass reflects a different ratio of PS1 and β-catenin (e.g. 3:3:1 or 1:1:2) or, more probably, whether other unidentified PS1-associated proteins are present. Further studies will be required to address this question and identify these other components if they exist. Like many membrane proteins, presenilins have a tendency to aggregate under non-native conditions (28Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.L. Page K.J. Kim T.W. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E. Hollister R.D. Hallmark O.G. Mancini R. Felsenstein K.M. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the ∼250-kDa protein complex we have identified is authentic and is not caused by nonspecific aggregation. First, we analyzed the native state of endogenous PS1 by linear glycerol velocity gradients. Second, the same complex exists in both human brain and in the HEK293 cell line. Third, when PS1 is overexpressed the holoprotein complex appears to be smaller than the native fragment complex, an observation which contradicts the intuitive expectation that nonspecific aggregation should be more severe when PS1 is overexpressed. Fourth, the fact that the PS1 complex does not contain the highly homologous PS2 protein also contradicts the expectations for a nonspecific aggregation. Fifth, three components of the complex (PS1 NTF, PS1 CTF, and β-catenin) can be specifically co-immunoprecipitated from both whole cell lysates and from the appropriate glycerol gradient fractions. The identification of β-catenin as a member of the high molecular mass complex, but not other proteins such as γ-catenin, calnexin and βAPP (discussed below), also argues against a nonspecific aggregate. Finally, in agreement with previously published immunocytochemical studies on the intracellular distribution of presenilin proteins (4Walter J. Capell A. Grunberg J. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3590-3598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we can show that the three identified components of the ∼250 kDa presenilin complex (β-catenin and NTF and CTF of PS1) are located in the same biochemically defined subcellular compartment. βAPP has been reported to be capable of interacting with PS1 and PS2 (26Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 323-328Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 27Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8208-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, βAPP is unlikely to be a significant component of the ∼250-kDa PS1 complex described here for the following reasons. First, the expression level of endogenous βAPP is very low in HEK293 cells. Despite this, the glycerol gradient migration pattern of PS1 fragments in untransfected HEK293 cell lysates was very similar to that in lysates of both PS1/βAPP double-transfected HEK293 cells and of human brain. If βAPP is a major component of the complex, the PS1 complex would be expected to differ in size between the untransfected and the PS1/βAPP-transfected HEK293 cells. Second, the glycerol gradient fractionation profiles of βAPP and PS1 holoprotein only partly overlap even in digitonin extracts, and do not overlap at all with the PS1 fragment complex. Thus, only a small amount of βAPP and PS1 holoprotein would be available to interact. Finally, βAPP and PS1 do not co-precipitate from the glycerol gradient fractions containing PS1 and βAPP in digitonin lysates of βAPP/PS1 stable cells. However, we can not exclude the possibility of a greater detergent sensitivity of βAPP binding or that βAPP is a component of a minor PS1-containing complex. This would be especially true if this complex was the result of a weak or transient interaction with the PS1 holoprotein (27Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8208-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Whether the complex functions simply to fold, transport and process PS1, or whether it has other intrinsic functions remains to be determined. However, regulated insertion of the PS1 NTF and CTF into this complex does provide a potential explanation for the observation that the stoichiometry and level of these fragments appears to be tightly controlled in most cells (8Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovisky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Previous investigations have demonstrated that the majority of the PS1 and PS2 holoproteins are rapidly degraded by the proteasome with half-lives of ∼15 min (10Fraser P.E. Levesque G. Yu G. Mills L. Thirwell J. Frantseva M. Carlen P. St. George-Hyslop P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: S19-S21Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,11Kim T.W. Pettingell W.H. Hallmark C.G. Moir R.D. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11006-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is likely that this represents a separate pathway for the removal of full-length presenilins, and is consistent with our observation that most PS1 holoprotein exists as a separate complex which may be more susceptible to proteasome degradation. In contrast, PS1 CTF and NTF are incorporated into a stable ∼250-kDa complex which contains at least one other potentially functional ligand (β-catenin). The regulated incorporation into this complex (e.g. by limited availability of one or more other ligands) would provide an explanation for the regulated abundance of the CTF and NTF. Furthermore, inclusion of the CTF and NTF into a stable complex would also account for the long turnover times of the cleavage fragments. It is unclear whether endoproteolysis occurs before or following insertion into the ∼250-kDa complex. The transition from a lower molecular mass holoprotein enriched complex to the ∼250-kDa fragment enriched complex could be brought about by an enhanced PS1 NTF/CTF oligomerization following endoproteolytic cleavage. Alternatively, the endoproteolytic cleavage might occur beforehand, but could expose previously internalized domains which then facilitates binding of the other ligands. Understanding the mechanism and the composition of this complex will likely lead to a better understanding of PS1 function."

However, in apoptosis mediated by CD95 (Fas/APO-1), caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH/Mch5) is immediately activated and, in principle, could process other caspases directly. To investigate whether caspase-8 could also act through mitochondria, we added active caspase-8 to aXenopus cell-free system requiring these organelles. Caspase-8 rapidly promoted the apoptotic program, culminating in fragmentation of chromatin and the nuclear membrane. In extracts devoid of mitochondria, caspase-8 produced DNA degradation, but left nuclear membranes intact. Thus, mitochondria were required for complete engagement of the apoptotic machinery. In the absence of mitochondria, high concentrations of caspase-8 were required to activate downstream caspases. However, when mitochondria were present, the effects of low concentrations of caspase-8 were vastly amplified through cytochromec-dependent caspase activation. Caspase-8 promoted cytochrome c release indirectly, by cleaving at least one cytosolic substrate. Bcl-2 blocked apoptosis only at the lowest caspase-8 concentrations, potentially explaining why CD95-induced apoptosis can often evade inhibition by Bcl-2.

Engagement of CD95 leads to the formation, at the receptor's cytoplasmic side, of a protein complex known as the DISC (death-inducing signalingcomplex). This complex consists of CD95, FADD (MORT1), and pro-caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH/Mch5) (3Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Once caspase-8 is recruited in zymogen form to the DISC, it is processed and released from the complex in active form to cleave substrates in the cell interior. Caspase-8 can process other caspases in vitro, including caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain) (1Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A.

Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In theXenopus system, endogenous cytosolic factors promote the time- and temperature-dependent release of cytochromec from mitochondria. Cytochrome c, in concert with other cytosolic factors, then causes the activation of caspases (“DEVDases”) 1The abbreviations used are: DEVDases, DEVD-cleaving caspases; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: DEVDases, DEVD-cleaving caspases; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. similar to caspase-3, leading to downstream apoptotic events. The Bcl-2 protein blocks caspase activation in this system, and in at least some forms of apoptosis in mammalian cells, by preventing cytochrome ctranslocation (8Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We now show that caspase-8 can activate caspases through two pathways: mitochondria-dependent and -independent. In the absence of mitochondria, activation of a caspase cascade by caspase-8 produces only a partial apoptotic phenotype in nuclei added to the extract. In contrast, the mitochondria-dependent pathway, which involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, triggers full nuclear apoptosis. Moreover, engagement of the mitochondria-dependent pathway is more efficient than the mitochondria-independent pathway, as it can be activated even by small amounts of caspase-8. Thus, mitochondria provide an efficient means of amplifying the apoptotic signal transduced by caspase-8. Caspase-8 can activate the mitochondria-dependent pathway even when the Bcl-2 protein is present; this helps explain the failure of Bcl-2 to inhibit CD95-dependent apoptosis consistently.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExtract preparation, fractionation, and use were as described previously (8Kluck R.M.

The gel was washed in TBE containing ethidium bromide and 300 μg/ml ribonuclease A for 1 h and then destained for 1 h in TBE.DISCUSSIONOur results show that the addition of caspase-8 toXenopus egg extracts induces the rapid efflux of cytochromec from mitochondria. Because cytochrome c induces the activation of downstream caspases, in a manner sufficient to produce the complete set of apoptotic events occurring in theXenopus extracts and in other systems (20Liu X.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), this mitochondrial pathway can potently amplify the effects of small amounts of caspase-8. In a particular cell type, whether caspase-8 can trigger apoptosis through a direct (i.e. cytochromec-independent) caspase cascade would, according to our results, depend on the concentration of activated caspase-8 present in those cells. However, even in cells with high levels of caspase-8, our results suggest that, for the complete apoptotic phenotype, including disruption of the nuclear envelope, the release of cytochromec from mitochondria would be required.The inability of caspase-8 to produce nuclear membrane fragmentation in the absence of mitochondria argues that caspase-8, by itself, can induce the activation of only some of the downstream effectors of apoptosis. Based on the similarity in appearance of the nuclei in Fig. 2 (B and E) to those present in cells induced to enter apoptosis in the presence of non-degradable lamins (31Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), we suspected at first that caspase-8 failed to activate the laminase(s) present in the Xenopus extracts in the absence of mitochondria. Thus, we predicted that recombinant caspase-6, which is the presumed laminase in human cells (32Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Garg M. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D.

A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), would restore the complete apoptotic phenotype if added together with caspase-8. Indeed, caspase-6, while having no apoptosis-inducing activity of its own, acted synergistically with caspase-8 to produce complete nuclear fragmentation in Xenopus extracts lacking mitochondria (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, however, immunoblot analysis of the endogenousXenopus lamin proteins and of 35S-labeled lamins added exogenously to the extract showed that caspase-8 by itself was equally effective at triggering cleavage of these proteins in the presence or absence of mitochondria (data not shown.) This suggests either that caspase-8 can activate, in the absence of mitochondria, an endogenous Xenopus laminase differing in specificity from human caspase-6 or that caspase-8 itself can cleave lamin proteins. Furthermore, it suggests that caspase-6, as well as an endogenous protease activable by cytochrome c, is required to cleave substrates other than the lamins that are critical for vesicularization of the nuclear membrane during apoptosis.Our observations may help explain why Bcl-2 family members have been reported to block CD95-induced apoptosis in some circumstances, but not others (9Rodriguez I.

It is unclear how caspase-8 can overcome the inhibitory effects of Bcl-2 on cytochrome c release. While this manuscript was in preparation, Cheng et al. (37Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) reported that Bcl-2 is a substrate for caspase-3 in vitro. Bcl-2 is also cleaved, presumably by undetermined caspases, in cells undergoing CD95-induced apoptosis, although it is unclear from these studies whether Bcl-2 cleavage occurs prior to cytochrome crelease or after caspase-3 activation. If caspase-8 were to cleave Bcl-2, this might explain how caspase-8 could overcome the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in the Xenopus cell-free system, even when caspase-8 is present at levels too low to activate caspase-3 directly. However, we found that when baculovirus-expressed human Bcl-2 was added to a mixture of Xenopus cytosol and mitochondria, it was not cleaved following the addition of recombinant caspase-8 at 500 ng/ml. 2T. Kuwana and D. D. Newmeyer, unpublished data. Thus, caspase-8 in this system can apparently promote cytochrome c release despite the presence of intact Bcl-2 on mitochondrial surfaces.Cheng et al. (37Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) also found that when the Bcl-2 cleavage product was transfected into cells, it promoted or enhanced apoptosis. One might therefore ask whether caspase-8 functions in theXenopus cell-free system by cleaving an endogenous Bcl-2 relative, thereby converting it into a Bax-like pro-apoptotic molecule. This remains a formal possibility, as the caspase-8 substrate responsible for inducing cytochrome c release has not yet been identified. However, because this factor is cytosolic, it is unlikely to be a strict homolog of Bcl-2, which is entirely membrane-associated.In conclusion, our results link a proximal signaling event, the activation of caspase-8 at the plasma membrane, with a distal apoptotic pathway involving cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequent activation of executioner caspases. Why should the cell use this indirect pathway when caspase-8 could activate at least some of these downstream caspases simply and directly? Perhaps for three reasons: first, cytochrome c can amplify the effect of small amounts of active caspase-8; second, the participation of mitochondria would allow the cell greater flexibility in controlling the apoptotic process through modulating the events leading to cytochromec release; and third, the effects on mitochondria (including, but not necessarily limited to, cytochrome crelease) may lead to cell death even in the absence of functional executioner caspases, as has been shown for Bax-induced cell killing (38Xiang J.

In many cell types, apoptosis can be induced by cross-linking of the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) receptor, through engagement of the receptor either by its natural ligand or by agonistic antibodies (1Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Engagement of CD95 leads to the formation, at the receptor's cytoplasmic side, of a protein complex known as the DISC (death-inducing signalingcomplex). This complex consists of CD95, FADD (MORT1), and pro-caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH/Mch5) (3Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Once caspase-8 is recruited in zymogen form to the DISC, it is processed and released from the complex in active form to cleave substrates in the cell interior. Caspase-8 can process other caspases in vitro, including caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain) (1Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A.

Thus, it is commonly hypothesized that mature caspase-8 could, by itself, activate the downstream “effector” caspases, thus directly linking CD95 with the core apoptotic machinery. This attractive idea may explain why Bcl-2, which functions at mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (7Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that caspase-8 may not always act through a direct caspase cascade or that Bcl-2 can somehow inhibit caspase activation in a manner distinct from its effects on cytochrome c release. To investigate whether caspase-8 can trigger apoptosis via a pathway involving mitochondria, we used a Xenopus cell-free apoptosis system dependent on these organelles (19Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In theXenopus system, endogenous cytosolic factors promote the time- and temperature-dependent release of cytochromec from mitochondria. Cytochrome c, in concert with other cytosolic factors, then causes the activation of caspases (“DEVDases”) 1The abbreviations used are: DEVDases, DEVD-cleaving caspases; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: DEVDases, DEVD-cleaving caspases; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. similar to caspase-3, leading to downstream apoptotic events. The Bcl-2 protein blocks caspase activation in this system, and in at least some forms of apoptosis in mammalian cells, by preventing cytochrome ctranslocation (8Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We now show that caspase-8 can activate caspases through two pathways: mitochondria-dependent and -independent. In the absence of mitochondria, activation of a caspase cascade by caspase-8 produces only a partial apoptotic phenotype in nuclei added to the extract. In contrast, the mitochondria-dependent pathway, which involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, triggers full nuclear apoptosis. Moreover, engagement of the mitochondria-dependent pathway is more efficient than the mitochondria-independent pathway, as it can be activated even by small amounts of caspase-8. Thus, mitochondria provide an efficient means of amplifying the apoptotic signal transduced by caspase-8. Caspase-8 can activate the mitochondria-dependent pathway even when the Bcl-2 protein is present; this helps explain the failure of Bcl-2 to inhibit CD95-dependent apoptosis consistently.

DISCUSSIONOur results show that the addition of caspase-8 toXenopus egg extracts induces the rapid efflux of cytochromec from mitochondria. Because cytochrome c induces the activation of downstream caspases, in a manner sufficient to produce the complete set of apoptotic events occurring in theXenopus extracts and in other systems (20Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar, 21Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), this mitochondrial pathway can potently amplify the effects of small amounts of caspase-8. In a particular cell type, whether caspase-8 can trigger apoptosis through a direct (i.e. cytochromec-independent) caspase cascade would, according to our results, depend on the concentration of activated caspase-8 present in those cells. However, even in cells with high levels of caspase-8, our results suggest that, for the complete apoptotic phenotype, including disruption of the nuclear envelope, the release of cytochromec from mitochondria would be required.The inability of caspase-8 to produce nuclear membrane fragmentation in the absence of mitochondria argues that caspase-8, by itself, can induce the activation of only some of the downstream effectors of apoptosis. Based on the similarity in appearance of the nuclei in Fig. 2 (B and E) to those present in cells induced to enter apoptosis in the presence of non-degradable lamins (31Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), we suspected at first that caspase-8 failed to activate the laminase(s) present in the Xenopus extracts in the absence of mitochondria. Thus, we predicted that recombinant caspase-6, which is the presumed laminase in human cells (32Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Garg M. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D.

A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), would restore the complete apoptotic phenotype if added together with caspase-8. Indeed, caspase-6, while having no apoptosis-inducing activity of its own, acted synergistically with caspase-8 to produce complete nuclear fragmentation in Xenopus extracts lacking mitochondria (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, however, immunoblot analysis of the endogenousXenopus lamin proteins and of 35S-labeled lamins added exogenously to the extract showed that caspase-8 by itself was equally effective at triggering cleavage of these proteins in the presence or absence of mitochondria (data not shown.) This suggests either that caspase-8 can activate, in the absence of mitochondria, an endogenous Xenopus laminase differing in specificity from human caspase-6 or that caspase-8 itself can cleave lamin proteins. Furthermore, it suggests that caspase-6, as well as an endogenous protease activable by cytochrome c, is required to cleave substrates other than the lamins that are critical for vesicularization of the nuclear membrane during apoptosis.Our observations may help explain why Bcl-2 family members have been reported to block CD95-induced apoptosis in some circumstances, but not others (9Rodriguez I.

Bcl-2 is also cleaved, presumably by undetermined caspases, in cells undergoing CD95-induced apoptosis, although it is unclear from these studies whether Bcl-2 cleavage occurs prior to cytochrome crelease or after caspase-3 activation. If caspase-8 were to cleave Bcl-2, this might explain how caspase-8 could overcome the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in the Xenopus cell-free system, even when caspase-8 is present at levels too low to activate caspase-3 directly.

This remains a formal possibility, as the caspase-8 substrate responsible for inducing cytochrome c release has not yet been identified. However, because this factor is cytosolic, it is unlikely to be a strict homolog of Bcl-2, which is entirely membrane-associated.In conclusion, our results link a proximal signaling event, the activation of caspase-8 at the plasma membrane, with a distal apoptotic pathway involving cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequent activation of executioner caspases. Why should the cell use this indirect pathway when caspase-8 could activate at least some of these downstream caspases simply and directly? Perhaps for three reasons: first, cytochrome c can amplify the effect of small amounts of active caspase-8; second, the participation of mitochondria would allow the cell greater flexibility in controlling the apoptotic process through modulating the events leading to cytochromec release; and third, the effects on mitochondria (including, but not necessarily limited to, cytochrome crelease) may lead to cell death even in the absence of functional executioner caspases, as has been shown for Bax-induced cell killing (38Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Our results show that the addition of caspase-8 toXenopus egg extracts induces the rapid efflux of cytochromec from mitochondria. Because cytochrome c induces the activation of downstream caspases, in a manner sufficient to produce the complete set of apoptotic events occurring in theXenopus extracts and in other systems (20Liu X.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), this mitochondrial pathway can potently amplify the effects of small amounts of caspase-8. In a particular cell type, whether caspase-8 can trigger apoptosis through a direct (i.e. cytochromec-independent) caspase cascade would, according to our results, depend on the concentration of activated caspase-8 present in those cells. However, even in cells with high levels of caspase-8, our results suggest that, for the complete apoptotic phenotype, including disruption of the nuclear envelope, the release of cytochromec from mitochondria would be required. The inability of caspase-8 to produce nuclear membrane fragmentation in the absence of mitochondria argues that caspase-8, by itself, can induce the activation of only some of the downstream effectors of apoptosis. Based on the similarity in appearance of the nuclei in Fig. 2 (B and E) to those present in cells induced to enter apoptosis in the presence of non-degradable lamins (31Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), we suspected at first that caspase-8 failed to activate the laminase(s) present in the Xenopus extracts in the absence of mitochondria. Thus, we predicted that recombinant caspase-6, which is the presumed laminase in human cells (32Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Garg M. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D.

A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), would restore the complete apoptotic phenotype if added together with caspase-8. Indeed, caspase-6, while having no apoptosis-inducing activity of its own, acted synergistically with caspase-8 to produce complete nuclear fragmentation in Xenopus extracts lacking mitochondria (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, however, immunoblot analysis of the endogenousXenopus lamin proteins and of 35S-labeled lamins added exogenously to the extract showed that caspase-8 by itself was equally effective at triggering cleavage of these proteins in the presence or absence of mitochondria (data not shown.) This suggests either that caspase-8 can activate, in the absence of mitochondria, an endogenous Xenopus laminase differing in specificity from human caspase-6 or that caspase-8 itself can cleave lamin proteins. Furthermore, it suggests that caspase-6, as well as an endogenous protease activable by cytochrome c, is required to cleave substrates other than the lamins that are critical for vesicularization of the nuclear membrane during apoptosis. Our observations may help explain why Bcl-2 family members have been reported to block CD95-induced apoptosis in some circumstances, but not others (9Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Khatib K. Reed J.C.

It is unclear how caspase-8 can overcome the inhibitory effects of Bcl-2 on cytochrome c release. While this manuscript was in preparation, Cheng et al. (37Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) reported that Bcl-2 is a substrate for caspase-3 in vitro. Bcl-2 is also cleaved, presumably by undetermined caspases, in cells undergoing CD95-induced apoptosis, although it is unclear from these studies whether Bcl-2 cleavage occurs prior to cytochrome crelease or after caspase-3 activation. If caspase-8 were to cleave Bcl-2, this might explain how caspase-8 could overcome the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in the Xenopus cell-free system, even when caspase-8 is present at levels too low to activate caspase-3 directly. However, we found that when baculovirus-expressed human Bcl-2 was added to a mixture of Xenopus cytosol and mitochondria, it was not cleaved following the addition of recombinant caspase-8 at 500 ng/ml. 2T. Kuwana and D. D. Newmeyer, unpublished data. Thus, caspase-8 in this system can apparently promote cytochrome c release despite the presence of intact Bcl-2 on mitochondrial surfaces. Cheng et al.

However, mechanisms responsible for ceramide-induced apoptosis remain unclear. We investigated the possibility that ceramide may decrease antiapoptotic signaling in cells by inhibiting Akt kinase activity. Our data show that C2-ceramide induces apoptosis in HMN1 motor neuron cells and decreases both basal and insulin- or serum-stimulated Akt kinase activity 65–70%. These results are consistent with decreased Akt kinase activity being involved in the apoptotic effects of ceramide. This possibility is further supported by studies showing that constitutively active Akt kinase decreases C2-ceramide-induced death of HMN1 cells as well as COS-7 cells. Decreased Akt activity is not due to ceramide activating the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase or to a direct inhibition of Akt kinase by ceramide, suggesting that ceramide acts upstream of Akt kinase to decrease its activity. Treating cells with C2-ceramide does not affect phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, interactions between insulin receptor substrate-1 and p85, or insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, suggesting that the effects of C2-ceramide on Akt kinase are not mediated through modulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In sum, our results suggest that inhibition of the key antiapoptotic kinase, Akt, may play an important role in ceramide-induced apoptosis.

Although cellular mechanisms underlying apoptosis remain unclear, a number of recent studies suggest that activating sphingomyelinase and subsequent generation of ceramide play an important role in regulating apoptosis in many systems (9Obeid L.M.

Apoptosis induced by a variety of initiators such as tumor necrosis factor-α, Fas ligand, daunorubicin, removal of growth factors, UV irradiation, and x-irradiation is associated with increased ceramide production (11Testi R.

These observations are consistent with ceramide being a lipid second messenger that functions as part of a ubiquitous signaling system to link cell surface receptors and environmental stresses to the apoptotic pathway. However, signal transduction pathways mediating ceramide-induced apoptosis are largely unknown except for a recent study showing that the proapoptotic stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase is important for ceramide-induced apoptosis (12Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X. Yao B. Jarvis W. Grant S. Birrer M. Szabo E. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that apoptosis is the consequence of disrupting the balance of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic signaling within the cell. For instance, Bcl-2 and Bax, both members of the Bcl-2 family, have opposite effects on apoptosis, and the effect of each on apoptosis can be overcome by overexpressing the other (19Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar, 20Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

In addition, several studies suggest that a balance between signal transduction pathways controls apoptosis. Effector kinases having a proapoptotic role include stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 23Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Support for an antiapoptotic role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and Akt comes from studies showing that growth factors such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and nerve growth factor that block apoptosis activate these kinases and that increasing kinase activity by expressing either constitutively active forms of the kinases or their upstream regulators blocks apoptosis (22Xia Z.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Since survival and death likely represent a balance between antiapoptotic and proapoptotic signaling, we considered the possibility that the apoptotic lipid messenger ceramide may induce apoptosis by increasing proapoptotic signaling, by decreasing antiapoptotic signaling, or both. To explore the possibility that ceramide may decrease antiapoptotic signaling, we developed a model system for ceramide-induced apoptosis using the neuroblastoma-motor neuron cell line, HMN1 (28Salazar-Grueso E.F. Kim S. Kim H. Neuroreport. 1991; 2: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our data show that ceramide decreases activity of the antiapoptotic kinase, Akt, and induces apoptosis in HMN1 cells. Moreover, a constitutively active form of Akt inhibits ceramide-induced apoptosis in both HMN1 and COS-7 cells. Our data are consistent with ceramide inducing apoptosis by regulating multiple signaling pathways that involve decreasing antiapoptotic signals in addition to increasing proapoptotic signals.

Expression constructs pECE myr-Akt-HA (Δ 4–129) containing a consensus myristoylation signal and pECE A2myr-Akt-HA (Δ 4–129) containing an inactive point-mutated myristoylation signal were previously described (29Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). pCR3.1 myr-Akt-HA (Δ 4–129) was constructed by transferring the myr-Akt-HA (Δ 4–129) sequence from pECE myr-Akt-HA (Δ 4–129) to pCR3.1. Transient transfections of COS-7 and HMN1 cells were carried out using LipofectAMINE according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. HMN1 cells or COS-7 cells were co-transfected with a total of 4 μg of plasmid DNA in a 1:3 ratio of RSV-β-galactosidase with one of the following: pECE myr-Akt-HA, pECE A2myr-Akt-HA, pCR3.1, or pCR 3.1 myr-Akt-HA. 24 h after transfection, cells were changed into serum-free medium for 18–20 h prior to ceramide treatment. HMN1 cells or COS-7 cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM for 24 h prior to experiments. C2-ceramide, C8-ceramide, and C2-dihydroceramide were dissolved in ethanol at a stock concentration of 20 mm and then diluted into serum-free DMEM at the indicated concentrations and briefly sonicated. The final concentration of ethanol did not exceed 0.25%. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion or a 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide dye-reduction assay as described previously (30Pittman R.P. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 13: 3669-3680Crossref Google Scholar). All viability data using 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide were confirmed by trypan blue exclusion and cell counts. Viability of co-transfected cells was determined by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde and staining for β-galactosidase activity using 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactosidase, 5 mmpotassium ferricyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2. Blue cells were scored as apoptotic or normal based on morphological criteria: small, round, condensed cells were scored as apoptotic, and all other cells were scored as healthy. For each sample, about 500 cells were scored in a blinded manner, and experiments were repeated three times. DNA fragmentation was analyzed using a modification of a method described previously (30Pittman R.P. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 13: 3669-3680Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.2 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5, and lysates were treated for 2 h at 60 °C with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. Potassium acetate was then added to a final concentration of 1.5 m, and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were than centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and ethanol was added to precipitate the DNA. DNA pellets were washed three times with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Prior to electrophoresis, DNA samples were treated with DNase-free RNase A (0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was then analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Staining nuclei with Hoechst 33342 was performed by fixing cells with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 10 min, washing with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and then incubating for 10 min in 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in phosphate-buffered saline. Log phase HMN1 cells were subcultured and grown for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by the removal of serum for 24 h prior to performing the assays. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at the indicated times in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm Na3VO4), and supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were normalized for protein concentration using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of cell extracts were incubated with anti-Akt antibody and protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with rinse buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Precipitates were then incubated in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 μm ATP, 5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), 10 μCi of [γ-P32]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 2 μg of protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma)) at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 3× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 3 min. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylation was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. For immunoblotting Akt precipitates, samples were boiled in 3× Laemmli buffer for 3 min. Proteins were then resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane, incubated with sheep anti-Akt antibody, and visualized by ECL. In vitrophosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol was carried out in the immunocomplexes as described (31Sun X. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Log phase HMN1 cells were made quiescent by growing in serum-free DMEM medium for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with 30 μm C2-ceramide or 30 μm C2-dihydroceramide for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 μg/ml insulin for 10 min. Cells were then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and twice with buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4). The cells were solubilized in 1 ml of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol, and soluble cell lysates were collected after centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Cell lysates were normalized for protein concentration using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of cell extracts were incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibody and protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were then precipitated and washed. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (2 μg/μl), and 10 μl of 440 μm ATP containing 20 μCi [32P]ATP to each pellet. After 10 min at 22 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 mHCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). Samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate that had been coated with potassium oxalate. Thin layer chromatography plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, visualized, and quantified by autoradiography. The cell-permeable ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide, is toxic to HMN1 cells, with 90% of the cells dying by 5 h following exposure to 50 μm C2-ceramide (Fig. 1 A). Cell death is first detected 1–2 h after exposure (based on trypan blue exclusion; data not shown) but is not significant until 3 h (Fig. 1 A). C2-ceramide shows a dose-dependent toxicity, with 30% of the cells dying by 5 h in the presence of 10 μm C2-ceramide (Fig. 1 B). Over an 18-h period, this same concentration of ceramide kills more than 95% of the cells (data not shown). The biologically inactive ceramide analogue, C2-dihydroceramide, does not have toxic effects at the times or concentrations tested (Fig. 1). When viewed using phase contrast microscopy, cells treated with ethanol vehicle or C2-dihydroceramide maintain normal morphology, whereas cells treated with C2-ceramide are rounded and shrunken and often have membrane blebs (Fig. 2,A–C). These are characteristic morphological features of apoptosis; therefore, experiments were performed to determine if additional features of apoptosis were present in ceramide-treated HMN1 cells. Chromatin has a characteristic condensed and fragmented appearance following Hoechst 33342 staining of cells treated with C2-ceramide (Fig. 2 E), while chromatin in cells treated with C2-dihydroceramide has a normal homogenous appearance (Fig. 2 D). Consistent with the time course of ceramide-induced toxicity (Fig. 1 A), DNA laddering is not prominent until 3 h after treatment of cells with 50 μm C2-ceramide and is not present in cells treated with 50 μm C2-dihydroceramide (Fig. 2 F). Therefore, characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage, membrane blebs, DNA laddering, and chromatin condensation are present in cells treated with C2-ceramide, indicating that C2-ceramide induces apoptosis in HMN1 cells.Figure 2C2-ceramide induces apoptosis in HMN1 cells. A–C, phase contrast photomicrographs of HMN1 cells treated with ethanol vehicle for 5 h (A), 50 μm C2-dihydroceramide for 5 h (B), or 50 μm C2-ceramide for 5 h (C).

Bose R. Lin X. Yao B. Jarvis W. Grant S. Birrer M. Szabo E. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that ceramide may also decrease antiapoptotic signaling pathways has not been investigated. Among the known antiapoptotic pathways, the PI 3-kinase pathway has been shown to protect a variety of cells against apoptosis (32Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 33D'Mello S.R. Borodert K. Soltoff S.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies indicate that the survival-promoting effect of PI 3-kinase is primarily mediated through activation of one of its downstream targets, the serine/threonine kinase, Akt (24Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Vlciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 25Dudek H. Datta S. Franke T. Birnbaum M. Yao R.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility that C2 ceramide may interfere with Akt kinase activation. Endogenous Akt kinase was isolated from HMN1 cells treated with various agents, and its kinase activity was monitored using MBP as substrate. C2-ceramide (but not C2-dihydroceramide) decreases basal Akt kinase activity about 3-fold in serum-starved HMN1 cells (Fig. 3). In addition, C2-ceramide decreases insulin as well as serum-stimulated Akt kinase activity about 3-fold (Fig. 3). Consistent with these data showing a decrease in Akt kinase activity are additional experiments showing that ceramide inhibits the decreased mobility and upward shift of Akt kinase (representing phosphorylation of Akt) seen on SDS-polyacrylamide gels following stimulation with insulin (data not shown). These data indicate that C2-ceramide inhibits insulin- or serum-stimulated Akt kinase activation and therefore interferes with an important antiapoptotic signaling pathway, suggesting that inhibition of Akt kinase activity may be part of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the apoptotic effects of ceramide. To further address whether the inhibition of Akt kinase activity following C2-ceramide treatment may represent an important aspect of ceramide-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of increasing Akt kinase activity on ceramide-induced death of HMN1 cells. A constitutively active form of Akt containing an Src myristoylation signal sequence (29Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) was overexpressed in HMN1 cells followed by exposure of cells to C2-ceramide or C2-dihydroceramide. Overexpressing constitutively active Akt in HMN1 cells decreased ceramide-induced apoptosis by about 50% (Fig. 4), indicating that increased kinase activity is effective in blocking ceramide-induced apoptosis, and thus inhibition of Akt kinase activity may be important for the apoptotic effects of ceramide. To determine whether the protective role of constitutively active Akt against ceramide-induced apoptosis is limited to HMN1 cells or is a more general mechanism for other cell types as well, we examined whether constitutively active Akt kinase is also effective in inhibiting ceramide-induced apoptosis in COS-7 cells. Following exposure of COS-7 cells to C2-ceramide, an obvious protective effect is seen in cultures transfected with the constitutively active Akt compared with cultures transfected with the nonconstitutively active Akt. Whereas most control cells (data not shown) or cells transfected with the nonconstitutively active Akt (Fig. 5 A, b) are rounded, shrunken, or detached from the dish and floating in the presence of C2-ceramide, many cells transfected with constitutively active Akt are flattened and have a normal appearance in the presence of C2-ceramide (Fig. 5 A, d). In control groups, C2-dihydroceramide is not toxic, and cells maintain a normal appearance in both groups (Fig. 5 A,a and c). Quantitation of β-galactosidase-positive cells indicates that constitutively active Akt significantly protects COS-7 cells from ceramide-induced death (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, membrane targeting of Akt kinase results in kinase activation in the absence of growth factor stimulation, and C2-ceramide does not inhibit the activity of membrane-targeted Akt kinase (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Constitutively active Akt protects COS-7 cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis. A, phase contrast photomicrographs of COS-7 cells co-transfected with RSV β-galactosidase and either Akt containing an inactive myristoylation signal (pECE A2myr-Akt-HA; a and b) or constitutively active Akt containing a myristoylation signal (pECE myr-Akt-HA; c and d). Cells were treated with 50 μm C2-dihydroceramide (a andc) or 50 μm C2-ceramide (b and d) for 8 h. Note that C2-ceramide kills COS-7 cells transfected with Akt containing a mutant myristoylation site (round and shrunken β-galactosidase-positive cells in b), but a number of cells transfected with a constitutively active Akt have a normal appearance (β-galactosidase-positive cells in d).B, COS-7 cells were transfected with an RSV β-galactosidase vector (squares), RSV β-galactosidase vector plus pECE A2myr-Akt-HA vector (mutant myristoylation site;diamonds), or RSV β-galactosidase vector plus pECE myr-Akt-HA vector (consensus myristoylation site; circles) and treated with 50 μm C2-ceramide for the indicated time. Note that cells transfected with β-galactosidase or β-galactosidase plus pECE A2myr-Akt-HA die at the same rate as untransfected cells, while cells transfected with β-galactosidase plus pECE myr-Akt-HA increase in number relative to untra"

Here we report the crystal structures of the ζ isoform of 14-3-3 in complex with two peptide ligands: a Raf-derived phosphopeptide (pS-Raf-259, LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHMV) and an unphosphorylated peptide derived from phage display (R18, PHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP) that inhibits binding of exoenzyme S and Raf-1. The two peptides bind within a conserved amphipathic groove on the surface of 14-3-3 at overlapping but distinct sites. The phosphoserine of pS-Raf-259 engages a cluster of basic residues (Lys49, Arg56, Arg60, and Arg127), whereas R18 binds via the amphipathic sequence, WLDLE, with its two acidic groups coordinating the same basic cluster. 14-3-3 is dimeric, and its two peptide-binding grooves are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, 30 Å apart. The ability of each groove to bind different peptide motifs suggests how 14-3-3 can act in signal transduction by inducing either homodimer or heterodimer formation in its target proteins. 14-3-3 proteins bind a variety of molecules involved in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. 14-3-3 binds ligands such as Raf-1 kinase and Bad by recognizing the phosphorylated consensus motif, RSXpSXP, but must bind unphosphorylated ligands, such as glycoprotein Ib andPseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S, via a different motif.

A phosphopeptide comprising residues 251–265 of Raf-1, named pS-Raf-259 (LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHM), binds several isoforms of 14-3-3 (estimatedK d ≈ 120 nm for 14-3-3ζ), inhibits the association of 14-3-3 with Raf-1 in vitro and, when injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, inhibits Raf-dependent maturation (14Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar).Phosphoserine recognition cannot account for all 14-3-3-ligand interactions, however. A different recognition motif must exist for unphosphorylated ExoS, as well as for glycoprotein Ib, which when expressed in unphosphorylated form binds 14-3-3 (16Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, Wanget al. screened random peptide phage display libraries, 2B. Wang, Y.-C. Liu, T.

Ruoslahti, manuscript in preparation. and isolated a series of unphosphorylated peptides containing a consensus sequence, WLDL, which bind 14-3-3 with high affinity. One of these, termed “R18” (PHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP), binds 14-3-3 with aK d ≈ 80 nm, inhibits 14-3-3-Raf-1 complex formation, reduces Raf-1-dependent transcriptional activity in cells, and blocks the activation of ExoS by 14-3-3. Like pS-Raf-259, the R18 peptide binds to different 14-3-3 isoforms with equal affinities.In 1995, we reported the crystal structure of the ζ-isoform of 14-3-3 (17Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and Xiao et al. reported the structure of the highly homologous τ-isoform (18Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The molecule consists of a bundle of nine α-helices organized in an antiparallel fashion, with the four N-terminal α-helices participating in dimer formation. The dimeric molecule has a cup-like shape with a conserved inner surface and a variable outer surface. A striking feature of the inner surface is a groove roughly 25 Å long formed by the four parallel helices α3, α5, α7, and α9. This groove is amphipathic, with a cluster of basic and polar residues (from α3 and α5) on one side and a cluster of hydrophobic residues (from α7 and α9) on the other. Based on the crystal structure, we predicted that this amphipathic groove would form the principal binding site for 14-3-3 ligands, with the cluster of basic residues engaging the phosphoserine (17Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We have since shown that mutations affecting either the basic or hydrophobic face of the groove do indeed disrupt the ability of 14-3-3 to bind ligands (19Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,33Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).To demonstrate directly the phosphoserine recognition site on 14-3-3 and to determine the binding site for the unphosphorylated R18 peptide, we have solved crystal structures of 14-3-3ζ in complex with the pS-Raf-259 and R18 peptides at a resolution of ∼3.5 Å. At this relatively low resolution, the general course of the peptide backbone within the amphipathic groove is clear, as is the location of the phosphoserine phosphate group. However, the side chain density is ambiguous for many peptide side chains, such that we cannot clearly distinguish between the two possible directions of the peptide chain through the electron density. Our ability to describe detailed protein-peptide interactions is consequently limited. Nevertheless, we show unambiguously that both peptides bind in the amphipathic groove at overlapping but distinct sites, with significant implications for the mechanism of signal transduction by the 14-3-3 family. 14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved dimeric molecules associated with numerous biological activities in eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 1Aitken A.

A phosphopeptide comprising residues 251–265 of Raf-1, named pS-Raf-259 (LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHM), binds several isoforms of 14-3-3 (estimatedK d ≈ 120 nm for 14-3-3ζ), inhibits the association of 14-3-3 with Raf-1 in vitro and, when injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, inhibits Raf-dependent maturation (14Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Phosphoserine recognition cannot account for all 14-3-3-ligand interactions, however. A different recognition motif must exist for unphosphorylated ExoS, as well as for glycoprotein Ib, which when expressed in unphosphorylated form binds 14-3-3 (16Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol.

Ruoslahti, manuscript in preparation. and isolated a series of unphosphorylated peptides containing a consensus sequence, WLDL, which bind 14-3-3 with high affinity. One of these, termed “R18” (PHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP), binds 14-3-3 with aK d ≈ 80 nm, inhibits 14-3-3-Raf-1 complex formation, reduces Raf-1-dependent transcriptional activity in cells, and blocks the activation of ExoS by 14-3-3. Like pS-Raf-259, the R18 peptide binds to different 14-3-3 isoforms with equal affinities. In 1995, we reported the crystal structure of the ζ-isoform of 14-3-3 (17Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and Xiao et al. reported the structure of the highly homologous τ-isoform (18Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The molecule consists of a bundle of nine α-helices organized in an antiparallel fashion, with the four N-terminal α-helices participating in dimer formation. The dimeric molecule has a cup-like shape with a conserved inner surface and a variable outer surface. A striking feature of the inner surface is a groove roughly 25 Å long formed by the four parallel helices α3, α5, α7, and α9. This groove is amphipathic, with a cluster of basic and polar residues (from α3 and α5) on one side and a cluster of hydrophobic residues (from α7 and α9) on the other. Based on the crystal structure, we predicted that this amphipathic groove would form the principal binding site for 14-3-3 ligands, with the cluster of basic residues engaging the phosphoserine (17Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We have since shown that mutations affecting either the basic or hydrophobic face of the groove do indeed disrupt the ability of 14-3-3 to bind ligands (19Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,33Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To demonstrate directly the phosphoserine recognition site on 14-3-3 and to determine the binding site for the unphosphorylated R18 peptide, we have solved crystal structures of 14-3-3ζ in complex with the pS-Raf-259 and R18 peptides at a resolution of ∼3.5 Å. At this relatively low resolution, the general course of the peptide backbone within the amphipathic groove is clear, as is the location of the phosphoserine phosphate group. However, the side chain density is ambiguous for many peptide side chains, such that we cannot clearly distinguish between the two possible directions of the peptide chain through the electron density. Our ability to describe detailed protein-peptide interactions is consequently limited. Nevertheless, we show unambiguously that both peptides bind in the amphipathic groove at overlapping but distinct sites, with significant implications for the mechanism of signal transduction by the 14-3-3 family.

The pyridinyl imidazoles like SB202190 are specific inhibitors of p38α and p38β and have been widely used in investigation of the biological functions of p38. Here we show that SB202190 by itself was sufficient to induce cell death, with typical apoptotic features such as nucleus condensation and intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation. SB202190 stimulated the activity of CPP32-like caspases, and its apoptotic effect was completely blocked by the protease inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone and expression ofbcl-2. In addition, SB202190 was able to potentiate apoptosis induced by Fas(APO-1) ligation or UV irradiation. Expression of p38β attenuated the apoptotic effect of SB202190 and the cell death induced by Fas ligation and UV irradiation. In contrast, expression of p38α induced cell death mildly. These results indicate that SB202190 induces apoptosis through activation of CPP32-like caspases and suggest that distinct members of the p38 subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinase have different functions in apoptosis. p38, a subfamily of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, regulates gene expression in response to various extracellular stimuli.

Here we show that SB202190 was sufficient to induce apoptosis through activation of DEVD-sensitive caspases, and p38β inhibits apoptosis, whereas p38α induces apoptosis. T lymphocyte Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The Jurkat cells stably transfected with pSFFV-human bcl-2 (Jurkat/bcl-2) or the control plasmid pSFFV-neo (Jurkat/neo) (a gift from Dr. Stanley J.

Jurkat/neo or Jurkat/bcl-2 cells (106 cells) were treated with or without SB202190 (50 μm), PD098059 (50 μm) in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (zVAD)-fluoromethylketone for 24 h.

The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used for caspase assays. The caspase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of cell extracts, 20 μm fluoregenic peptide acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) as described (47Xiang J.

Fluorescent AMC product formation was measured at excitation 360 nm, emission 460 nm using a Cytofluor II fluorescent plate reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA).

After infection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium and treated with the specific p38 inhibitor SB202190, anti-Fas mAb (Ch11, Santa Cruz) (100 ng/ml), or UV irradiation (40 J/m2) for various periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. The expression of M2-p38α and M2-p38β was monitored by Western blot analysis using anti-M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak) as described (28Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C.

Briefly, Jurkat cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated with or without the specific p38 inhibitor SB202190 for 30 min prior to treatment with anti-Fas mAb (100 ng/ml) for 2 h or left alone as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were harvested in lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation. Endogenous MAPKAPK 2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-MAPKAPK 2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 3 h at 4 °C. The activity of the immune complex was assayed at 30 °C for 30 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer (28Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

The reactions were terminated with Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The phosphorylated proteins were quantitated by a PhosphorImager. It was shown that p38 was activated in Fas ligation-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells (40Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E.

Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), but the activation of p38 was not required for the induction of cell death (40Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 41Peter J. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

Therefore, p38 may not be involved in the apoptosis, or it may be a cellular stress response that is designed to protect cells from death. To test these possibilities, we first examined the effect of the specific p38 inhibitor SB202190 on p38 activity in Jurkat cells. Because the inhibition of p38 by SB202190 is in a reversible mannerin vivo that cannot be detected by in vitroimmune complex kinase assays of p38 (42Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K. Pazhanisamy S. Galullo V. Bemis G.W. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Su M.S. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 43Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), the inhibition by SB202190 was measured by the inhibition of MAPKAPK 2, which is a downstream kinase of p38 (19Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with SB202190 significantly inhibited both basal and anti-Fas antibody-induced MAPKAPK 2 activity in a dose-dependent manner as measured in immune complex kinase assays with GST-hsp27 as a substrate (Fig. 1). This result confirmed that SB202190 is a specific p38 inhibitor, in agreement with the earlier report (18Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). We next determined the effect of inhibition of p38 by SB202190 on cell death. Jurkat cells were serum-starved and then treated with SB202190 or left untreated for various times as indicated (Fig. 2). The cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. As early as 14 h after incubation with SB202190, the cell death already reached half the maximum rate (Fig. 2 A). The ability of SB202190 to induce cell death was shown in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by flow cytometry, using propidium iodide as an indicator (Fig. 2 B). In addition, SB202190 induced cell death in HeLa cells (Fig. 2,C and D). Another specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 also induced cell death (data not shown). The inactive derivative SB202474, however, did not induce cell death (Fig. 2, A andC). These results suggest that the effect of SB202190 may be related to its inhibition on p38. In contrast, the specific MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 did not induce cell death, even at a much higher concentration (100 μm). The cell death induced by SB202190 in Jurkat cells had typical apoptotic appearances, including nucleus condensation as measured by staining with H33258 (Fig. 3 A) and DNA fragmentation as measured by less than 2N DNA assays (Fig. 3 B). SB202190-induced cell death in HeLa cells also had typical apoptotic appearance such as DNA fragmentation as measured by less than 2N DNA assay (data not shown). This indicates that the cell death induced by SB202190 was because of apoptosis, rather than nonspecific cytotoxicity. Activation of CPP32-like caspases is essential for induction of apoptosis by various death signals in many types of cells including Jurkat cells (6Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). It is possible that SB202190 may induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells through activation of CPP32-like caspases. To test this possibility, we determined whether SB202190 was able to stimulate CPP32-like caspase activity. Jurkat cells were treated with SB202190 or PD098059 or left untreated. After 24 h, cells were harvested, and the activity of CPP32-like caspases in cell extracts was measured by cleavage of the fluorescent peptide DEVD-AMC, which is a specific substrate of CPP32-like caspases (47Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The cleavage of DEVD-AMC was significantly increased in cells treated with SB202190 but not in the control or cells treated with PD098059 (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the DEVD-AMC cleavage induced by SB202190 was completely blocked by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fluoromethylketone (Fig. 4 A). Expression of bcl-2, which is able to block activation of CPP32-like caspases in Jurkat and many other types of cells (57Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), also blocked SB202190-induced cleavage of DEVD-AMC (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, SB202190 may induce Jurkat cell death through activation of CPP32-like caspases. We then tested whether activation of CPP32-like caspases is essential for SB202190-induced apoptosis. Jurkat cells that were stably transfected with expression vectors encoding bcl-2 (Jurkat/bcl-2) or the empty neomycin gene (Jurkat/neo) were treated with SB202190 in the presence or absence of zVAD, as indicated (Fig. 4 B). SB202190 was able to induce cell death in control Jurkat/neo cells (Fig. 4 B), but it failed to do so in zVAD-treated Jurkat/neo cells and in Jurkat/Bcl-2 cells as measured by H33258 staining and by less than 2N DNA assays (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that activation of CPP32-like caspases was required for SB202190-induced apoptosis and that Bcl-2 acted at or upstream of CPP32-like caspases to inhibit the apoptosis. It was shown that Fas ligation-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells was mediated by activation of caspases including CPP32-like caspases (11Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar), and so was SB202190 (Fig. 4). It is possible that SB202190 may stimulate the same apoptotic pathway as the Fas pathway. To test this possibility, we determined whether SB202190 potentiates Fas ligation-induced apoptosis. Cells were treated with various amounts of anti-Fas mAb in the presence or absence of SB202190. The death of cells was analyzed at various periods of time by propidium iodide staining. In the absence of SB202190, anti-Fas mAb induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, as expected (Fig. 5, A, B, andC). After a 12-h incubation a small dose of anti-Fas mAb (10 ng/ml) caused about 30% cell death (Fig. 5 A). SB202190 augmented the effect of 10 ng/ml anti-Fas mAb, leading to about 70% cell death (Fig. 5 A). The augmentation by SB202190 was shown in a synergistic manner, because SB202190 by itself only caused 20% cell death at this time point (Fig. 5 A). SB202190 also augmented the apoptotic effect of 30 and 100 ng/ml anti-Fas mAb, although to lesser extent (Fig. 5, B and C). UV irradiation was able to stimulate apoptosis in HeLa cells, probably through the Fas pathway (12Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We then tested whether SB202190 potentiates UV irradiation-induced apoptosis. Indeed, SB202190 augmented the apoptotic effect of UV irradiation in HeLa cells in a synergistic manner (Fig. 5 D). These results suggest that SB202190 may utilize the same death pathway as did Fas ligand. SB202190 is a specific p38 inhibitor, and its apoptotic effect was only slightly blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (data not shown). Therefore, SB202190 may induce apoptosis, at least in part, through inhibition of p38 activity. To test this possibility, we determined the effect of overexpression of p38 on SB202190-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding p38α, p38β, or control green fluorescence protein. After 24 h, the cells were treated with SB202190 or left untreated as indicated (Fig. 6). Infection of p38β significantly attenuated SB202190-induced cell death (Fig. 6, A andB), whereas infection of p38α augmented the apoptotic effect of SB202190 (Fig. 6 B). In fact, expression of p38α by itself induced cell death mildly (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, SB202190 may induce cell death through its inhibition on p38β. We then tested whether expression of p38 was able to affect other forms of apoptosis. In HeLa cells, expression of p38β significantly attenuated cell death induced by anti-Fas mAb or UV irradiation (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, expression of p38α augmented the apoptotic effect of UV irradiation and anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, p38β may function as an suppressor of apoptosis, whereas p38α may act as a mediator of apoptosis. Inhibition of p38β by SB202190 could increase cell susceptibility to apoptotic signals. Our results indicate that the specific p38 inhibitor SB202190 is sufficient to induce cell death in Jurkat and HeLa cells. SB202190-induced cell death had typical apoptotic features including nucleus condensation and DNA fragmentation, suggesting that the cell death was because of apoptosis, rather than nonspecific cytotoxicity. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that SB202190-induced cell death was mediated by activation of CPP32-like caspases and was blocked by expression of bcl-2. Therefore, SB202190 may function as an apoptotic inducer. The mechanisms by which SB202190 induces activation of CPP32-like caspases have yet to be determined. We speculate that SB202190 may stimulate the activity of CPP32-like caspases through inhibition of p38β. Expression of p38β was able to attenuate the apoptotic effect of SB202190 (Fig. 6). In addition, expression of p38β suppressed the cell death induced by UV irradiation and anti-Fas mAb as well (Fig. 6 C), both of which are mediated by activation of caspases including CPP32-like caspases (11Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar, 12Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Further investigation should reveal whether p38β directly or indirectly down-regulates CPP32-like caspases. SB202190 is a specific inhibitor for both p38α and p38β (18Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the apoptotic effect of SB202190 was attenuated by p38β but augmented by p38α. This raises the question of how SB202190 could induce cell death if it inhibits two isoforms of p38 that have opposing effects on cell death. One possible explanation is that in resting cells the anti-apoptosis effect of p38β might be a dominant one in comparison with the pro-apoptotic effect of p38α. Inhibition by SB202190 may shift the balance between cell death and survival toward death. SB202190 may not be able to completely inhibit overexpressed p38, so that its apoptotic effect was attenuated by overexpressed p38β but augmented by overexpressed p38α, which by itself mildly induced cell death. We cannot exclude out the possibility that SB202190 may inhibit other unknown targets to fully execute its apoptotic effects. It was reported that in vitro, SB202190 was able to inhibit JNK2 activity at concentrations over 10 μm (31Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether SB202190 can do soin vivo. It will be of interest to identify other SB202190 target proteins, because they may be involved in cell survival as well. The role of p38 in apoptosis has been investigated extensively but remains contradictory. It was reported that p38 activation was required for apoptosis (33Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P.

However, it was found that MKK3 and MKK6, two upstream kinases of p38, were sufficient to induce apoptosis in a p38-independent manner (40Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 41Peter J. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

Our results indicate that the role played by the p38 subfamily of MAP kinase in apoptosis is more complex than previously thought. Distinct members of the p38 subfamily of MAP kinase appear to have different roles in apoptosis. Expression of p38β attenuated cell death induced by apoptotic signals like anti-Fas mAb and UV irradiation, suggesting that activation of p38β-like protein kinases during apoptosis may be part of the cellular survival response that is designed to protect cells from death. In contrast, expression of p38α by itself mildly induced cell death and augmented the apoptotic effects of anti-Fas mAb and UV irradiation, suggesting p38α-like protein kinases may be mediators of apoptosis. It is not clear how p38α and p38β possess different functions in apoptosis. One possibility is that these two p38 isoforms may have different downstream substrates that play different roles in apoptosis. Further studies are needed to delineate the p38 signaling pathway and determine the components that modulate the functions of individual p38 isoforms. We thank J. Han, S. J. Korsmeyer, S. Pelech, A. Yee, and A. S. Kiselyov for the different reagents that made this work possible and J. Han for helpful discussions."

These mice express endogenous levels of APP holoprotein and abundant human Aβ. Increased dietary cholesterol led to significant reductions in brain levels of secreted APP derivatives, including sAPPα, sAPPβ, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–42, while having little to no effect on cell-associated species, including full-length APP and the COOH-terminal APP processing derivatives. The changes in levels of sAPP and Aβ in brain all were negatively correlated with serum cholesterol levels and levels of serum and brain apoE. These results demonstrate that secreted APP processing derivatives and Aβ can be modulated in the brain of an animal by diet and provide evidence that cholesterol plays a role in the modulation of APP processing in vivo. APP gene-targeted mice lacking apoE, also have high serum cholesterol levels but do not show alterations in APP processing, suggesting that effects of cholesterol on APP processing require the presence of apoE.

Another fraction of APP is processed along an amyloidogenic pathway in which cleavage by a putative β-secretase at the NH2 terminus of the Aβ domain results in the formation of a secreted NH2-terminal fragment, sAPPβ (6Seubert P.

In order to elucidate mechanisms of APP processing and Aβ generationin vivo, an animal model was developed by gene targeting that converted the mouse Aβ sequence to human and incorporated the Swedish familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (12Reaume A.G.

These mice are well suited for investigating modulation of APP processing in vivo, because brain Aβ levels are nearly 10-fold above normal endogenous levels, thereby reducing the stringency for assays to detect Aβ, particularly for the less abundant but more amyloidogenic 42-residue form. Furthermore, proper developmental and tissue-specific expression of APP and Aβ is maintained in the gene-targeted mice (12Reaume A.G. Howland D.S. Trusko S.P. Savage M.J. Lang D.M. Greenberg B.D.

Here, we have examined the impact of dietary cholesterol and apoE on APP processing and Aβ levels using the APP gene-targeted mice. Cholesterol is an integral component of all eukaryotic cell membranes and is essential for normal cellular functions including caveolae formation (16Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W.

Cholesterol also dramatically affects physical properties of cell membranes such as increasing ordering and rigidity and decreasing permeability and lateral diffusion (19Yeagle P.L. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Alterations in membrane lipid and cholesterol content have been reported to modulate the activities of intrinsic membrane enzymes (20Oner O. Bekpinar S. Oz B. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol.

Cellular cholesterol content arises either through intracellular synthesis or by uptake of cholesterol through the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway (25Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4398) Google Scholar). These pathways are tightly regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), membrane-bound transcription factors whose proteolytic cleavage and subsequent translocation to the nucleus regulate transcription of multiple cholesterol homeostatic genes (26Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3044) Google Scholar).

Directly pertinent to APP metabolism, cholesterol has been recently linked to decreased release of secreted APP in cultured cells (50Bodovitz S. Klein W.L. J. Biol.

However, neither of these studies presented data concerning the effects of cholesterol on Aβ production. We demonstrate that increased dietary cholesterol lowers levels of secreted APP derivatives including sAPPα and sAPPβ in mouse brain. Additionally, cholesterol in the diet resulted in decreases in the levels of both major secreted Aβ forms, Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. The reported effects of cholesterol on APP processing derivatives in brain appeared to require the presence of apoE. APP gene-targeted mice (APPnNLh/nNLh), wild-type for apoE, containing a humanized Aβ domain and bearing the Swedish familial Alzheimer's disease KM to NL mutations have been described previously (12Reaume A.G. Howland D.S. Trusko S.P. Savage M.J. Lang D.M. Greenberg B.D. Siman R. Scott R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23380-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Homozygous APPnNLh/nNLh mice, 210–408 days in age, were maintained for 8 weeks on a basal diet (number 5755C Purina Test Diet), containing trace amounts (0.005%) of cholesterol and 10% fat or a high cholesterol diet (number 5801C Purina Test Diet) containing 10% fat and 5% cholesterol. APP gene-targeted mice were bred with apoE knockout (KO) mice to generate double homozygous mice (APPNLh/NLh, ApoE−/−). APPNLh/NLh, ApoE−/− (n = 4) and APP gene-targeted mice, wild-type for apoE, (APPNLh/NLh, ApoE+/+) (n = 4), each approximately 180 days old, fed a laboratory chow diet (Rodent 5001, Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO) containing 0.027% cholesterol and 4.5% fat, were used to compare the effect of the apoE genotype on APP processing fragments in brain. Mice had access to the pelleted diets and water ad libitum. All animals were sacrificed prior to analysis by CO2 asphyxiation. Brains were removed, washed in saline, and frozen at −70 °C prior to analysis. Trunk blood was collected at sacrifice from mice in a nonfasted state in order to avoid potential complicating effects of food deprivation on APP metabolism. Serum total cholesterol (TC) was measured using an enzymatic-colorimetric assay (number 352, Sigma). To measure tissue total cholesterol levels, liver, mouse half-brain, or dissected frontal cortices were homogenized in B buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Lipids and cholesterol were extracted with 10 volumes of a chloroform/methanol mix (2:1, v/v) as described previously (52Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dried samples were resuspended in 400 μl of 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol, and aliquots were mixed with 1 ml of a 2% Triton X-100/chloroform solution. Dried samples were resuspended in 0.5 ml of water, and total cholesterol was determined using the enzymatic-colorimetric assay.

All secondary antibodies (GAM-IgG and GAR-IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Bio-Rad or from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). One-half brain or dissected frontal cortex was homogenized in 3 ml of B buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Tris-soluble supernatant fractions were removed and assayed for total protein concentration by BCA assay (Pierce). Fifty μg of each extract was electrophoresed on 8% Tris-Glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. For detection of sAPPα, blots were incubated with 1:2000 Ab 6E10 followed by 1:2000 GAM-IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. For detection of Swedish sAPPβ, blots were incubated with 1:500 Ab 54 followed by 1:2000 GAR-IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Ab C4 was used at 1:2000 to detect actin in each brain extract for normalization. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used as the detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To detect mouse brain apoE, 50 μg of Tris-soluble extracts from half-brain or frontal cortex were electrophoresed on 10–20% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated with 1:2000 anti-apoE Ab followed by 1:2000 GAR-IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and ECL as the detection reagent. Tris-insoluble pellets following 100,000 × g centrifugation of brains extracted with B buffer were washed with an additional 3 ml of B buffer followed by sonication in 1 × radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.05 mm leupeptin, 0.02 mm pepstatin A).

Frozen mouse half-brains were Dounce homogenized at a ratio of 150 mg of tissue/ml of 70% (v/v) formic acid, homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatants were recovered.

Pinsker L.P. Mistretta S. Reaume A.G. Greenberg B.D. Siman R. Scott R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To simultaneously measure Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 from brain samples, a bicine-urea gel system of immunoprecipitated Aβ was used. Mouse half-brain was homogenized in 3 ml of 6 m guanidine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Human Aβ was immunoprecipitated with Ab 1153 as described previously (12Reaume A.G. Howland D.S.

Human Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (Bachem) size standards were included on the gels. Densitometry of immunoblot data was performed using the Docugel V Scanalytic system (CSP Inc., Billerica, MA). All results are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using student's t test analyses (StatView, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). Correlations shown are reported as Pearson product moment. Serum TC (Table I) was significantly elevated in APP gene-targeted mice fed high dietary cholesterol when compared with basal diet controls. The range of serum TC in the high cholesterol diet group was 247–1152 mg/dl. Conversely, animals maintained on basal diets had levels typically ranging from 44 to 145 mg/dl. Occasional outliers on the basal diet were observed (i.e. animal number 061; TC = 249 mg/dl). In animals fed high dietary cholesterol, liver size and weight were increased compared with those of mice fed the basal diet (Table I). Mean liver weight increased more than 2-fold in gene-targeted mice as a result of the high cholesterol diet. Liver-associated TC was dramatically increased more than 17-fold in mice fed the high cholesterol diet (Table I).Table IEffect of diet on cholesterol and ApoE levels in APP gene-targeted miceBasal dietCholesterol dietLiver weight (g)1.6 ± 0.1 (9)3.7 ± 0.1 (20)ap < 0.0001.Serum TC (mg/dl)109.9 ± 20.1 (9)332.5 ± 62.4 (20)bp < 0.05.Liver TC (mg/g)4.1 ± 0.3 (5)70.5 ± 5.8 (10)ap < 0.0001.Brain TC (mg/g)cValues from brain were determined from half-brain samples.6.1 ± 0.6 (5)7.7 ± 0.9 (10)Frontal cortex TC (mg/g)13.3 ± 0.3 (4)16.0 ± 0.7 (4)bp < 0.05.Serum ApoE (%)d%, percentage of basal diet mean.100.0 ± 10.5 (11)244.1 ± 20.9 (16)ap < 0.0001.Brain ApoE (%)d%, percentage of basal diet mean.100.0 ± 2.8 (7)112.9 ± 4.0 (13)bp < 0.05.Frontal cortex ApoE (%)d%, percentage of basal diet mean.100.0 ± 25.3 (4)237.6 ± 25.8 (3)bp < 0.05.Data are mean ± S.E.; n values are shown in parentheses.a p < 0.0001.b p < 0.05.c Values from brain were determined from half-brain samples.d %, percentage of basal diet mean.

Elevations in serum apoE in response to increases in dietary cholesterol have been shown to be the result of transcriptional up-regulation of the apoE gene (59Utermann G. Priun N. Steinmetz A. Clin.

Serum protein from gene-targeted mice fed either basal or high dietary cholesterol was immunoblotted using a mouse apoE-specific antibody. This antibody recognizes a 34-kDa polypeptide that is clearly absent in serum from APP gene-targeted mice that also harbor the apoE-KO (61Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N.

A 2.4-fold increase in mean serum apoE was observed in APP gene-targeted mice fed the high cholesterol diet (Fig. 1 A and Table I). A strong correlation between serum apoE and TC levels was found in these mice (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001). TC was extracted from half-brains of APP gene-targeted mice fed either basal or high cholesterol diets. A trend toward increased brain TC in mice fed the high cholesterol diet compared with the basal diet was evident (Table I), although these results did not reach statistical significance. However, extraction and measurement of TC from frontal cortices of APP gene-targeted mice fed high cholesterol, as compared with mice on basal diet, revealed a more robust and statistically significant increase in TC (Table I). Levels of apoE extracted from half-brains of APP gene-targeted mice fed either basal or high cholesterol diet were also compared. A small but statistically significant increase in the levels of brain apoE in mice fed high dietary cholesterol relative to basal diet controls was observed (Table I). Levels of brain apoE positively correlated with TC levels (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001) and with serum apoE levels (Fig. 1 B). A 2.4-fold increase in apoE levels was observed in the frontal cortex of APP gene-targeted mice fed the high cholesterol diet relative to those on the basal diet (Fig. 1 A and Table I). The differences in the magnitude of the increased TC and apoE when comparing half-brain versusfrontal cortex samples (see Table I) most likely reflected the lower amount of white matter present in the dissected frontal cortex. It is likely that white matter-associated lipid dilutes the magnitude of the measured increases in both TC and apoE observed from half-brain preparations. Also, increased serum cholesterol and apoE originating from brain blood would not be expected to significantly contribute to the measured changes of TC and apoE in brain tissue from mice on the high cholesterol diet, since blood comprises less than 2% of total brain wet weight.

The crystal structure of adenylyl cyclase and modeling studies suggest that specificity for ATP or GTP is dictated in part by a few amino acid residues, invariant in each family, that interact with the purine ring of the substrate. By exchanging these residues between guanylyl cyclase and adenylyl cyclase, we can completely change the nucleotide specificity of guanylyl cyclase and convert adenylyl cyclase into a nonselective purine nucleotide cyclase. The activities of these mutant enzymes remain fully responsive to their respective stimulators, sodium nitroprusside and Gsα. The specificity of nucleotide inhibitors of guanylyl and adenylyl cyclases that do not act competitively with respect to substrate are similarly altered, indicative of their action at the active sites of these enzymes.

Adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases synthesize the intracellular second messengers cAMP and cGMP, respectively, in response to a variety of regulatory signals. Mammalian adenylyl cyclases are intrinsic plasma membrane proteins that contain a duplicated module consisting of a hexahelical transmembrane region followed by a roughly 40-kDa cytosolic domain (1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Highly conserved and homologous sequences within the two cytosolic domains contribute to the active site of the enzyme (2Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have previously produced a soluble and catalytically active form of adenylyl cyclase that consists of the C1a domain from type V adenylyl cyclase and the C2 domain from the type II enzyme (3Sunahara R.K.

We have also solved the x-ray crystal structure of this soluble enzyme complexed with both activators and inhibitors (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Guanylyl cyclases exist as both soluble and membrane-bound species. Both types of the enzyme contain cytoplasmic domains similar to those of the adenylyl cyclases (6Garbers D.L. Koesling D. Schultz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases are homodimers, whereas the soluble enzymes contain α and β subunits, both of which are required for catalysis (7Harteneck C. Koesling D. Soling A. Schultz G. Bohme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Buechler W.A. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains a carboxyl-terminal domain that is homologous to the C1 and C2 domains of adenylyl cyclase; α most closely resembles C1 while β more closely resembles C2. Binding of nitric oxide (NO) to a prosthetic heme group (possibly located within the amino-terminal domain of β (9Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Bohme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)) causes marked activation of soluble guanylyl cyclases. Adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases show high specificity for their respective substrates; this is obviously essential for the coexistence and fidelity of signaling pathways, since virtually all cells contain both enzymes. The crystal structure of adenylyl cyclase with bound 2′d3′AMP reveals the amino acid residues that interact with the adenine ring of the inhibitor (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Although P-site inhibitors are not competitive with respect to substrate, substantial evidence indicates that these compounds do bind at the active site (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 10Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Lys-938 and Asp-1018, both within the C2 domain of adenylyl cyclase, are invariant residues that form hydrogen bonds with the N-1 and N-6 atoms of the adenine ring of 2′d3′AMP and are thus modeled to do so with ATP (see Fig. 1 A). Their equivalents in the guanylyl cyclase family, also invariant, are Glu and Cys, respectively, which could interact with the N-2 and O-6 atoms of a guanine ring (see Fig. 1, B and C). Modeling studies based on the crystal structure of the adenylyl cyclase IIC2 homodimer (11Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 12Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) also predict that an invariant Arg residue may be important for substrate recognition by guanylyl cyclase; its equivalent in adenylyl cyclase is Gln (see Fig. 1). We describe herein the effects of exchanging these three residues in various combinations between the two purine nucleotide cyclases. We used the soluble, recombinant VC1/IIC2 form of adenylyl cyclase described above and soluble, recombinant α1β1guanylyl cyclase from rat (13Nakane M. Arai K. Saheki S. Kuno T. Buechler W. Murad F.

Templates for adenylyl cyclase were pQE60-H6-VC1(364–591)Flag (3Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Cells were transfected with SuperFectTM reagent using the protocol of the supplier (Qiagen). To screen guanylyl cyclase mutants in intact cells, COS-7 cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected at 60% confluency with 1.5 μg each of plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant α1 and β1 subunits. After 40 h, cells were placed on ice and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and once with DMEM containing 50 mm NaHepes (pH 7.4) and 1 mm1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases). This medium (360 μl) was then added to each well, and plates were warmed for 5 min at 37 °C prior to exposure for 15 min to 40 μl of DMEM with or without 1 mm sodium nitroprusside. The incubation was terminated by addition of 40 μl of 33% perchloric acid, and the amount of cGMP or cAMP in the perchlorate extract was measured by radioimmunoassay (16Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Meth. Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To prepare COS-7 cell cytosol for assay of guanylyl cyclase activity, cells (100-mm dish) were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid encoding each wild-type or mutated subunit. After 40 h, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). The cytosolic fraction was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Wild-type and mutant VC1 and IIC2 fragments of adenylyl cyclase were synthesized inEscherichia coli, and the proteins were purified by metal chelate (Talon, CLONTECH or Ni-NTA, Qiagen) and ion exchange (MonoQ, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography (3Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Trypsinized GTPγS-Gsα was purified as described (17Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion of GTPγS-Gsα ensures inactivation of any GDP-Gsα in the preparation and thus reduces the possibility of GTP hydrolysis by this protein. The adenylyl cyclase activity of adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase proteins was measured for 10–15 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 μl as described (18Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless stated, the final concentrations of trypsinized GTPγS-Gsα, ATP, and sodium nitroprusside were 400 nm, 1 mm, and 100 μM, respectively. An ATP regeneration system was not utilized when purified proteins were assayed (wild-type and mutant adenylyl cyclase preparations). Guanylyl cyclase activity was determined as described (16Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Meth. Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A GTP regeneration system was not utilized for purified preparations of adenylyl cyclases. Assays were performed in a volume of 100 μl for 15 min at 30 °C. The concentration of GTP was 100 μM for wild-type guanylyl cyclases, 500 μM for mutant guanylyl cyclases, and 1 mm for adenylyl cyclases, unless otherwise stated. Determinations of K m and V maxwere performed with substrate concentrations ranging from 5 to 3000 μM. All assays were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated 2–4 times. Protein concentrations were determined as described (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). For purified adenylyl cyclases, 1 μg of protein was resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized with Coomassie Blue. Cytosolic fractions (20 μg) containing guanylyl cyclases were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Transferred proteins were probed with antibodies specific for the α1 (F563) or β1 (A794) subunits of guanylyl cyclase and detected by chemiluminescence. The model of ATP bound to VC1/IIC2 was based on the crystal structure of the Gsα·VC1·IIC2 complex containing bound 2′d3′AMP and pyrophosphate (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The purine bases of ATP and 2′d3′AMP were superimposed, and the β and γ phosphates of ATP were placed close to the phosphates of pyrophosphate. The α-phosphate and ribose of ATP was positioned such that the 3′-hydroxyl of ATP could displace pyrophosphate by in-line attack. The ribose is in the 3′-endo conformation. The structure was then subjected to harmonically restrained molecular dynamics with simulated annealing starting at 2500K (20Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 45: 585-593Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and conventional conjugate gradient refinement in crystallography and NMR systems 0.3 (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Chrystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The model of GTP bound to soluble guanylyl cyclase was created by manually replacing and optimally fitting the side chain residues in the crystal structure of the VC1·IIC2 complex with their equivalents in guanylyl cyclase using the program O, Version 6.1 (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). ATP from the model of adenylyl cyclase was changed to GTP, and the structure was refined as described above. The crystal structure of Gsα·VC1·IIC2 containing bound 2′d3′AMP suggests that the purine ring of ATP binds in a hydrophobic pocket containing three elements that confer specificity for adenine: Lys-938, Asp-1018, and the backbone carbonyl of residue 1019 (Fig. 1 A). The Nζ atom of Lys-938 interacts with the N-1 nitrogen of ATP and forms a salt bridge with Asp-1018. Both the acid side chain of Asp-1018 and the backbone carbonyl of residue 1019 form hydrogen bonds to the N-6 amino group of ATP. Lys-938 and Asp-1018 are invariant among all adenylyl cyclases, and alanine scanning mutagenesis of type I adenylyl cyclase (23Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) demonstrated that residues at positions equivalent to Lys-938 and Asp-1018 are crucial for enzyme activity, consistent with the roles proposed here. The alanine mutant corresponding to Asp-1018 had no detectable activity. The alanine mutant corresponding to Lys-938 displayed a 200-fold increase in the K i for inhibition by 2′d3′AMP and a 3-fold increase in theK m for ATP. The counterparts of Lys-938 and Asp-1018 in guanylyl cyclases are the invariant residues βE473 and βC541 (Fig. 1 C). Thus, mutation of Lys-938 and Asp-1018 in adenylyl cyclase to Glu and Cys, respectively, might alter the purine specificity of the enzyme; similarly, mutation of βE473 and βC541 in guanylyl cyclase to Lys and Asp, respectively, might enable the enzyme to synthesize cAMP. A model of the active site of guanylyl cyclase is shown in Fig. 1 B. Gln-503 in the C1 domain of adenylyl cyclase and αR592 in guanylyl cyclase are also invariant within their respective families. In the structure of Gsα·VC1·IIC2, Gln-503 forms van der Waals contacts across the heterodimer interface and with the side chain of Lys-938 (Fig. 1 A). However, in guanylyl cyclase, αR592 may also form a salt bridge to βE473 and thereby stabilize and properly orient the glutamic acid side chain (Fig. 1 B). αR592 was also implicated in GTP binding by modeling studies based on the structure of the IIC2 homodimer (11Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We have mutated residues αR592, βE473, and βC541 of guanylyl cyclase to their equivalents in adenylyl cyclase, singly and in combinations, to determine their contributions to substrate specificity. The three single mutants, the three double mutants, and the triple mutant were tested for their capacity to support cyclic nucleotide synthesis in vivo, and the best candidates were further characterized in cellular extracts in vitro. Likewise, Gln-503 in the C1 domain of type V adenylyl cyclase and residues Lys-938 and Asp-1018 of the C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase were mutated to their equivalents in guanylyl cyclase and characterized as purified proteins in a reconstituted system in vitro. Note that major differences in the specific activities between adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase proteins are due in large part to the fact that guanylyl cyclases were assayed in cytosolic extracts, whereas adenylyl cyclases were assayed as purified proteins. Guanylyl cyclase mutants were screened in transfected COS-7 cells to detect alterations in nucleotide specificity (Fig. 2; TableI). As expected, cells transfected with wild-type guanylyl cyclase (α-wt/β-wt) accumulated high concentrations of cGMP following exposure to sodium nitroprusside (Fig. 2 , top panel). Of the seven mutant combinations tested, only COS-7 cells transfected with the double mutant αR592Q/βC591D (α-Q/β-D) retained the capacity to accumulate substantial concentrations of cGMP.

Significant adenylyl cyclase activity was detected for only one of the single mutants, βC541D (α-wt/β-D) (Fig. 2, bottom panel). When double mutants were tested, cells expressing both βE473K/βC541D (α-wt/β-KD) and α-Q/β-D accumulated cAMP; α-Q/β-D thus appears to be a nonselective purine nucleotide cyclase. The greatest accumulation of cAMP was observed in cells bearing the triple mutant, αR592Q/βE473K/βC541D (α-Q/β-KD). Mutants α-Q/β-KD and α-wt/β-KD were further characterizedin vitro. Mutants α-wt/β-D and α-Q/β-D failed to demonstrate reproducible adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro,apparently because of instability of the β-D subunit (data not shown). The βC541D mutation introduces an acidic side chain next to the glutamic acid residue at position 473, which may destabilize the β subunit and the interface between α and β. α-Q and β-KD subunits were expressed in cytosolic fractions of COS-7 cells at levels comparable with those of the wild-type proteins (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with thein vivo screen, significant nitroprusside-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was observed in the cytosolic fractions for both α-Q/β-KD and α-wt/β-KD, but not native guanylyl cyclase (Fig. 3 B). The low adenylyl cyclase activity observed for α-wt/β-KD in vitro, compared with its apparent activityin vivo (Fig. 2, bottom panel), is due in part to its poor K m for ATP (see Fig. 4 B and Table I); a fraction of the protein may also be inactive. No significant synthesis of cGMP was detected in cytosolic fractions from cells transfected with the two mutant proteins. The EC50 for activation of α-Q/β-KD by nitroprusside was approximately 100 nm, indistinguishable from the value for the wild-type protein (Fig. 4 A). Thus, activation of the cyclase proceeds normally despite the change in substrate specificity. At maximally effective concentrations of nitroprusside, the triple mutant utilized ATP as a substrate with aK m of 400 μM and a V max of 1.8 nmol/min/mg. The double mutant α-wt/β-KD has aK m for ATP of 1.3 mm and aV max of 0.5 nmol/min/mg, whereas native guanylyl cyclase consumes GTP with a K m of 120 μM and a V max of 0.31 nmol/min/mg (Fig. 4 B, Table I). The ratioV max/K m indicates that wild-type guanylyl cyclase and the triple mutant have similar catalytic efficiencies with their respective substrates. Thus, the α-Q/β-KD triple mutant represents a complete change of nucleotide specificity from GTP to ATP with preservation of both sensitivity to nitroprusside and catalytic efficiency.Figure 4Kinetic analysis of guanylyl cyclase mutants. A, cyclic GMP (□) or cAMP (•) synthesis was measured in response to increasing concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for α-wt/β-wt (□) or α-Q/β-KD (•) guanylyl cyclases, respectively. Enzymatic activity was measured with 100 μM GTP (α-wt/β-wt) or 500 μM ATP (α-Q/β-KD).B, synthesis of cAMP by α-wt/β-KD (▵) and α-Q/β-KD (•) guanylyl cyclases was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. The batch of transfected cells used in this experiment was different from that shown in Fig. 3 B. This accounts for the difference in maximal activity observed. Synthesis of cGMP by native guanylyl cyclase is shown in the inset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The native IIC2 domain of adenylyl cyclase (C2-wt), the single mutants K938E (C2-E) and D1018C (C2-C), and the double mutant K938E/D1018C (C2-EC) were synthesized in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and mixed with either purified native VC1(C1-wt) or the mutant Q503R (C1-R) prior to assay. The yields of C2-E and C2-C were approximately 1 and 3% of the values achieved with native IIC2 (data not shown). Only complexes containing C1-wt or C1-R and C2-EC are capable of synthesizing significant amounts of cGMP (Fig. 5 B). The double mutant C1-wt/C2-EC yielded the highest ratio of guanylyl cyclase to adenylyl cyclase specific activity, but this was only 0.32 (Table I, Figs. 5 and 6). Adenylyl cyclase activity is reduced for some mutants (10-fold or more) but is not eliminated in any of them. The EC50 for Gsα-stimulated cGMP synthesis by C1-wt/C2-EC is approximately 200 nm (Fig. 6 A), the same as that for cyclic AMP synthesis by the wild-type protein (Fig. 6 A). At 400 nm effective concentrations of Gsα, C1-wt/C2-EC has aK m for GTP of 450 μM and aV max of 0.67 μmol/min/mg. With ATP as the substrate, the corresponding values are 630 μM and 2.1 μmol/min/mg, respectively (Table I). Although the K m for ATP for the double mutant is similar to that of wild-type enzyme,V max is reduced about 15-fold. Thus, C1-wt/C2-EC is a nonselective purine nucleotide cyclase with less catalytic efficiency for either GTP or ATP than that displayed by wild-type adenylyl cyclase with ATP.Figure 6Kinetic analysis of adenylyl cyclase mutants. A, adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase activities of C1-wt/C2-EC were assayed with various concentrations of GTPγS-Gsα in the presence of ATP or GTP, respectively. B, cAMP and cGMP synthesis by C1-wt/C2-EC were measured in the presence of 400 nm GTPγS-Gsα and various concentrations of ATP (50–3000 μM, ▪) or GTP (50–3000 μM, □), respectively. The activity of wild-type adenylyl cyclase is shown in theinset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The C1-R/C2-EC triple mutant of adenylyl cyclase mirrors the guanylyl cyclase mutant (α-R/β-KD) where nucleotide specificity was effectively switched. C1-R/C2-EC has significant guanylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 5 B) but retains most of the adenylyl cyclase activity characteristic of the wild-type protein. Either specificity for adenine in adenylyl cyclase is not entirely dictated by the targeted residues or the mutations somehow open the binding pocket, permitting purine nucleotides to bind nonselectively. 2′d3′AMP inhibits adenylyl cyclase with an EC50 of approximately 30 μM (Fig. 7 D). Inhibition is uncompetitive or noncompetitive with respect to ATP (depending on assay conditions), and P-site inhibitors act by binding to and stabilizing the complex of the enzyme with one of its products, pyrophosphate (10Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An intact adenine ring is required for effective inhibition. Kinetic analysis, binding studies (10Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of adenylyl cyclase complexed with 2′d3′AMP and pyrophosphate (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the inhibitor occupies the same purine binding pocket as does ATP. Nevertheless, some have hypothesized two binding sites for adenine nucleotides on adenylyl cyclase (24Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these hypotheses are fueled by the pseudo-symmetrical structure of the enzyme. If the triple mutant of guanylyl cyclase is indeed an enzyme with fully altered nucleotide specificity for substrate and if P-site inhibitors truly act at the active site, we expect a similar change of specificity for the inhibitors. Wild-type guanylyl cyclase is effectively inhibited by 2′d3′GMP; the adenylyl cyclase activity of the triple mutant of guanylyl cyclase is not (Fig. 7 A). Wild-type guanylyl cyclase is not inhibited by 2′d3′AMP; the adenylyl cyclase activity of the triple mutant of guanylyl cyclase is so inhibited (Fig. 7 B). Inhibition of this activity by 2′d3′AMP is not competitive with respect to ATP (Fig. 7 C). Thus, 2′d3′AMP is a P-site inhibitor of both wild-type adenylyl cyclase and a guanylyl cyclase mutated to acquire specificity for ATP as substrate. 2′d3′GMP is a P-site inhibitor of wild-type guanylyl cyclase but not of the mutant enzyme. Despite its ability to use ATP or GTP as substrate, Gsα-stimulated C1-wt/C2-EC is not strongly inhibited by either 2′d3′AMP (Fig. 7 D) or 2′d3′GMP (data not shown). This result is presumably explained by poor affinity of the mutant for 2′d3′AMP and its substantially reducedV max. Since P-site inhibitors bind to the enzyme-product complex, their apparent potency as inhibitors is dependent on the activity state of the enzyme. This result is also consistent with the phenotype of the K938A mutant of type I adenylyl cyclase, where the apparent affinity of P-site inhibitors was increased to a much greater extent than was the K m for ATP (23Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that P-site inhibitors have a greater reliance on Lys-938 for binding and inhibition (as measured byK i) than does ATP for binding and activity (as evaluated by its K m). Collectively, these data also further justify the now strong conclusion that P-site inhibitors bind at the active site of nucleotide cyclases and that adenylyl cyclase has but one binding site for adenine nucleotides. Although the guanylyl cyclases studied herein that harbor single mutations apparently demonstrate little capacity to synthesize cGMP in vivo (Fig. 2, top panel), it is difficult to assess the true importance of each residue for GTP binding. It is not known if properly folded protein was present in all cases. The mutant β-D subunit, which has two adjacent negatively charged residues (βE473 and βD541), is clearly unstable. In addition, the residues were replaced by their invariant homologs in the adenylyl cyclase family rather than by alanine, which would have minimized steric conflicts. Further complicating interpretation is the fact that we have created net uncompensated buried charge in the purine ring binding pocket in all of the mutant proteins except α-Q/β-KD. This probably destabilizes and/or disrupts the structure of the purine binding pocket (the extreme cases are αQ/β-D and α-wt/β-K). However, the data do suggest that αR592, βE473, and βC541 are all important for GTP binding and recognition. Our modeling predicts αR592 to be a second shell ligand for the guanine ring (Fig. 1 B), and its mutation to glutamine should not perturb the binding pocket grossly although it does leave uncompensated negative charge buried within the protein. However, α-Q/β-wt has no detectable adenylyl cyclase or guanylyl cyclase activity. This result is consistent with the model that αR592 stabilizes charge and orients βE473, which in turn interacts with the N-2 amino group of GTP. βE473 may be the most important residue for recognition of GTP since mutant guanylyl cyclases or adenylyl cyclases that lack glutamic acid at the position equivalent to β473 have no significant guanylyl cyclase activity. In addition, the only guanylyl cyclase mutant that retains guanylyl cyclase activity is α-Q/β-D. The βC541S mutant of soluble guanylyl cyclase has been characterized previously and has greatly reduced catalytic efficiency despite the conservative nature of the substitution (25Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, in the adenylyl cyclase mutants tested here, glutamate and cysteine must both be present to observe any guanylyl cyclase activity. The triple mutant α-Q/β-KD has significantly more adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro than does α-wt/β-KD even though Gln-503 in adenylyl cyclase is not predicted to play a major role in specificity for that enzyme. This discrepancy is most easily explained by the deleterious effect of an uncompensated positive charge in α-wt/β-KD and the close proximity of lysine at position β473 to arginine at position α592, which may render this particular mutant largely inactive. As noted above, the only adenylyl cyclase mutants that were able to synthesize significant amounts of cGMP are those that have a C2-EC subunit. More cGMP synthesis was observed when C2-EC was paired with C1-wt than with C1-R. In C1-wt/C2-EC, adenylyl cyclase activity has been reduced more than 10-fold, whereas the guanylyl cyclase activity has been elevated from essentially undetectable levels to one-third that of the mutant's adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 5 B). Because the triple mutant in guanylyl cyclase, α-Q/β-KD, displays a full change of nucleotide specificity, it is somewhat surprising that the analogous triple mutant of adenylyl cyclase does not. This result indicates that nucleotide specificity in adenylyl cyclase is dictated in part by elements other than the amino acid residues mutated in this study. Of the mutated residues, Asp-1018 appears to be the most important for specificity of ATP binding because the βC541D mutation alone in guanylyl cyclase is sufficient to permit cAMP synthesis, whereas the addition of the βE473K mutation does not significantly enhance this activity. There are two other factors that may allow adenylyl cyclase to bind adenine in preference to guanine. The first of these is the backbone carbonyl of residue 1019, which forms a hydrogen bond with the N-6 amino group of 2′d3′AMP (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) and presumably ATP (Fig. 1 A). This group cannot be altered readily. In the model of guanylyl cyclase (Fig. 1 B), slight rotations of this carbonyl and the guanine ring permit binding in the pocket without steric overlap between the carbonyl oxygen and the O-6 atom of guanine. There are several conservative changes in the hydrophobic core of guanylyl cyclase compared with adenylyl cyclase at and near position 1019 that may alter the conformation of the backbone in this region and allow the O-6 atom of guanine to bind, unimpeded by the backbone carbonyl. The second factor is pocket size. Guanine, with its extra N-2 substituent, is a bigger purine than adenine. There are two residues in adenylyl cyclase, Leu-438 in VC1 and Ile-940 in IIC2, that may preclude guanine from binding properly because of their potential steric overlap with the N-2 amino group of the ring. These residues are substituted by isoleucine and valine, respectively, in soluble guanylyl cyclase (Fig. 1 C). Hence, mutation of Leu-438 and Ile-940 to their equivalents in guanylyl cyclase might allow the bulkier purine ring of GTP to bind in a more optimal fashion, perhaps with its O-6 atom oriented away from the backbone carbonyl of 1019. Even so, the same backbone carbonyl could still serve as a hydrogen bond acceptor to ATP, and this mutant enzyme might still be a nonselective purine nucleotide cyclase. In summary, we demonstrate that nucleotide specificity in guanylyl cyclases is dictated by three invariant residues at positions equivalent to α592, β473, and β541. A cyclase that utilizes ATP and not GTP can be created by changing the identity of these residues to their equivalents in adenylyl cyclase. Similar maneuvers resulted in only partial conversion of adenylyl cyclase to a guanylyl cyclase because specificity appears to be additionally dictated by elements other than those that we manipulated by site-directed mutagenesis. In both adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase, the residues complementary to the exocyclic amines of the purine nucleotide substrate appear most crucial for alteration or abolition of specificity. P-site inhibitors, in contrast to ATP, appear to rely more on residues at positions equivalent to 938 and 1018 of adenylyl cyclase for binding and/or inhibition. This result is consistent with both prior mutagenesis (23Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the hypothesis that P-site inhibitors bind to a different conformational state of the enzyme than does the substrate ATP (10Dessauer C.W.

Stocco D.M. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), supported the notion that StAR import is obligatorily linked to the stimulation of steroidogenesis (2Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). However, we previously reported that NH2-terminal deletion mutants of StAR had steroidogenic activity equivalent to wild-type StAR, despite the fact that they could not enter into mitochondria (20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu H. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To shed light on the mechanism of StAR action and resolve apparent discrepancies in the models of how StAR works, we embarked upon experiments to produce biologically active recombinant StAR and study its activity on isolated mitochondria. We elected to produce human StAR proteins lacking the mitochondrial import sequence in bacteria, and to incorporate a 6-histidine-tagged N-62 StAR (His-tag StAR) to facilitate their purification. By using a construct from which the first 62-amino acid residues had been deleted (N-62), we could examine the action of StAR independent of the protein import process. Here we show that the His-tag StAR proteins have biological activity equal to wild-type StAR and that they act without being imported into mitochondria. We further demonstrate that purified His-tag recombinant protein acts directly on mitochondria to stimulate pregnenolone synthesis. To produce both NH2- and C-terminal His-tag StAR proteins lacking the first 62 amino acids, a cDNA encoding human StAR sequences from amino acid 63–285 was cloned into the pQE-30 (21Pollack S.E. Furth E.E. Kallen C.B. Arakane F. Kiriakidou M. Kozarsky K.F. Strauss J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 4243-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and pET24 vectors (see below), which place 6His-tags at the NH2 and C termini of the cDNA, respectively. His-tag sequences were subcloned into pSV-SPORT-1. The A218V mutation, which causes congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (4Nakae J. Tajima T. Sugawara T. Arakane F. Hanaki T. Hotsubo T. Igarashi N.

DNA sequences of all constructs were verified before use (20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu H. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were cultured to 50–80% confluence and transfected using 10 μg/ml LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg/ml of either an empty pSV-SPORT-1 plasmid, wild-type or His-tag StAR cDNAs in pSV-SPORT-1 and 1 μg/ml of a plasmid-directing expression of a fusion protein consisting of human P450sccadrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase (1Lin D.

Culture media were changed after 24 h, and some cultures received 5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. Media were collected 36 h later, and cells were scraped from the dishes in homogenization buffer consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA (20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu H. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Relative steroidogenic activity was determined by normalizing pregnenolone production in the absence of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone formation in the presence of the exogenous substrate, which reflects maximal cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity (3Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 355: 1870-1878Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar,20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu H. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M.

Experiments included triplicate cultures in each treatment group and were repeated on at least three separate occasions. COS-1 cells collected into homogenization buffer were sonicated for 5 s. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min and the supernatant was used for the Western blot analysis (20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu H. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with plasmid-directing expression of wild-type and C-His-tag StAR were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium without serum for 30 min and then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (20 μCi/ml) for 4 h. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (m-CCCP; 40 μm) or 1,10-phenanthroline (2 mm) were added to some cultures. After labeling, cells were collected into homogenization buffer and sonicated for 5 s. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were spun at 13,000 × g for an additional 20 min to isolate the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial-enriched subcellular fraction. In some cases the mitochondrial fraction was treated with proteinase K (15 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 90 min. After protein assay (Pierce), equal aliquots of protein from each fraction were pre-cleared with 30 μl of protein A-agarose in a total volume of 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF) for 30 min at 4 °C. After pelleting the protein A-agarose, supernatants were incubated with 10 μl anti-human StAR antibody and 30 μl protein A-agarose at 4 °C on a rocking platform overnight. Immunocomplexes were washed four times by resuspension in 500 μl of RIPA buffer and collected by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In some experiments protein bands corresponding to wild-type StAR preprotein, wild-type mature protein, and C-His-tag StAR were excised from the gels, and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. For pulse-chase experiments, the COS-1 cells transfected with plasmid-directing expression of wild-type and C-His-tag StAR were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium without serum for 30 min and then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml) for 20 min. After labeling, cells were changed into Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 4 mm methionine and 4 mm cysteine and were chased for the indicated times. Cells were scraped into 500 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer. Equal aliquots of protein from each cell extract were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. COS-1 cells grown on uncoated coverslips were transfected with expression plasmids for wild-type and His-tag StAR and processed for immunocytochemistry (21Pollack S.E. Furth E.E. Kallen C.B. Arakane F. Kiriakidou M. Kozarsky K.F. Strauss J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 4243-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation with 1.5% normal goat serum and then cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:500 dilution). Controls consisted of substitution of the primary antibody with preimmune serum used at a dilution equal to that of the primary antibody. COS-1 cells were fixed in 0.2m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in an increasing series of ethanol treatments, and embedded in LR Gold resin (Polysciences, Fort Washington, PA). Grids containing sections were incubated in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 10% normal goat serum) for 30 min at room temperature and were subsequently incubated in blocking buffer containing a 1:400 dilution of rabbit anti-StAR antiserum or preimmune rabbit serum overnight (∼16 h) at 4 °C. Following three washes in Tris-buffered saline, grids were incubated in blocking buffer containing 18 nm colloidal gold conjugated to a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:50. After three more washes in Tris-buffered saline, grids were fixed and counterstained with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 7% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. Specimens were observed and photographed using a Phillips 201 transmission electron microscope. Wild-type and mutant StAR proteins were synthesized using an SP6 TNT-coupled in vitrotranscription/translation kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol for 2 h at 30 °C. Import assays of radiolabeled protein were performed as described previously (23Schulke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 7314-7319Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Selected reactions were performed in the presence of valinomycin (5 μg/ml), an electrochemical uncoupler that blocks active import. Some mitochondria were treated with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml) in the absence or presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 following the import reaction. Trypsin was neutralized, using soybean trypsin inhibitor (5 mg/ml), and mitochondria were washed prior to sonication, followed by separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. cDNA-encoding StAR lacking the amino-terminal 62-amino acid residues was amplified from a StAR cDNA clone using the following primers 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGCTGGAAGAGACTCTC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCTGAAGCCAGGTGTCTCGAGCGGCCC-3′ and cloned into the pET-24 vector (Novagen) using XhoI and NdeI restriction sites, creating a C-His-tag StAR cDNA. The C-His-tag StAR A218V mutant was constructed using identical primers and mutant cDNA template. These constructs were expressed in BL-21(DE3) cells (Novagen) at 37 °C using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 4 h, bacterial cell pellets were sonicated in 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF. Bacterial lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min and incubated with nitrilotriacetic acid-chelate resin (Qiagen) for 30 min. The resin was washed with lysis buffer (minus PMSF) and then lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, until washes demonstratedA 280 < 0.01. His-tag StAR was eluted using 250 mm imidazole, dialyzed into a solution consisting of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and stored frozen in this buffer. Bovine corpora lutea were homogenized at 4 °C using a buffer consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Homogenates were spun at 600 ×g for 10 min, and supernatants were spun at 13,000 ×g for an additional 20 min to obtain the mitochondrial-enriched subcellular fraction. The pellets were washed with homogenization buffer and subjected to the centrifugation steps described above a second time. The final mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in a modified homogenization buffer that contained only 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and were used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Preliminary experiments established that freezing of the mitochondria did not impair StAR protein import and processing or steroidogenic activity. Isolated mitochondria were incubated at a concentration of 0.75–2.0 μg of protein/μl in 123 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, 250 ng/ml of the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor trilostane, 100 μm GTP, 10 mm isocitrate, 200 μm cholesterol, and the indicated concentrations of purified StAR protein. Incubations were conducted at 37 °C for the indicated times. As a control, purified StAR protein was heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. Incubations were terminated by flash freezing of samples. Pregnenolone was quantitated by radioimmunoassay (3Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 355: 1870-1878Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu H. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In some experiments, [3H]-cholesterol (0.005 μCi/μl) was included in the incubation reactions to assess the conversion of exogenous substrate into pregnenolone. Samples were then flash frozen and extracted with 1.5 ml petroleum ether. The organic phases were dried under nitrogen gas and resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and loaded onto silica gel G thin layer plates, which were developed in hexane/ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v). Pregnenolone bands detected with iodine vapor were collected, and radioactivity was quantitated using a scintillation counter (24Paavola L.G. Strauss III, J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Before producing recombinant protein for in vitro studies, we documented that the His-tag did not affect the activity of StAR in COS-1 cells transfected with an expression plasmid for the human cholesterol side-chain cleavage system (1Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 20Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu H.

Jefcoate C.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both the NH2- and the C-His-tag N-62 StAR proteins stimulated pregnenolone secretion by COS-1 cells to the same extent as wild-type StAR (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, the His-tag StAR proteins containing the A218V mutation, which inactivates full-length StAR, were devoid of steroidogenic activity. Expression of each of the His-tag StAR proteins was documented by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). Wild-type StAR preprotein and mature protein were identified in transfected COS-1 cells and only a single protein of 32 kDa was identified in COS-1 cells transfected with the His-tag StAR constructs. The apparent molecular mass of the His-tag StAR in the SDS-PAGE system (32 kDa) is greater than the calculated molecular mass of approximately 26 kDa, which may reflect posttranslational modification of the protein. The level of expression of the NH2-His-tag StAR A218V mutant was approximately one-third of that for the NH2-His-tag “wild-type” protein, probably reflecting relative instability of this mutant. At the light microscope level, wild-type StAR was located in vermiform organelles representing mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). The C-His-tag StAR protein was diffusely distributed in the cytosol of the transfected COS-1 cells without selective mitochondrial localization (Fig. 2 B). Cells transfected with empty plasmid did not stain for StAR (Fig. 2 C). Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that the C-His-tag StAR protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and excluded from mitochondria (Fig. 3 B), whereas wild-type StAR protein accumulated inside the mitochondria (Fig. 3 A). Preimmune serum demonstrated negligible staining (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Immunogold localization of StAR in transfected COS-1 cells. StAR was localized using a rabbit anti-StAR polyclonal antibody (A and B) or nonimmune rabbit serum (C) followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 18 nm colloidal gold. Wild-type StAR was localized to the inner mitochondrial membranes in transfected COS-1 cells (A). C-His-tag StAR was localized in the cytoplasm and not in the mitochondria of transfected COS-1 cells (B). Preimmune serum controls showed negligible nonspecific label in COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type StAR (C).Bar = 0.5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Wild-type StAR preprotein was imported into isolated yeast mitochondria and processed to the mature 30-kDa form, becoming insensitive to trypsin (Fig. 4 A). However, StAR protein was degraded by trypsin following Triton X-100 permeabilization of the mitochondria. Treatment with valinomycin, which uncouples the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient, blocked wild-type StAR import. Although some of the C-His-tag StAR protein was associated with mitochondria, it was completely sensitive to trypsin in the absence of detergent, indicating that C-His-tag StAR was not imported by the mitochondria (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained when bovine corpus luteum mitochondria were used in place of yeast mitochondria (data not shown). Transfected cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and cytosol and organelle-enriched fractions were separated by differential centrifugation. In some cases the organelle fractions were treated with proteinase K. StAR proteins were then immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Wild-type StAR was found in the organelle-rich fraction in a proteinase K-insensitive form (Fig. 5 A). The import and processing of the wild-type preprotein was inhibited bym-CCCP, which collapses the mitochondrial membrane proton gradient. m-CCCP-treated cells expressed a wild-type protein that was sensitive to proteinase K treatment (Fig. 5 B). The processing of the imported preprotein, but not import, was blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline. Treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline resulted in the accumulation of a 37-kDa preprotein that was proteinase K insensitive (Fig. 5 C). These observations are in agreement with earlier reports from the laboratories of Orme-Johnson and Stocco (2Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr.

Treatment of bovine cerebral endothelial cells (BCECs) with TNF-α for 16 h followed by cycloheximide (CHX) for 6 h resulted in an increase in ceramide accumulation, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Application of a cell permeable ceramide analogue C2 ceramide, but not the biologically inactive C2 dihydroceramide, also induced DNA laddering and BCEC death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. TNF-α/CHX-mediated ceramide production apparently is not a result of sphingomyelin hydrolysis because sphingomyelin content does not decrease in this death paradigm. In addition, an acidic sphingomyelinase inhibitor, desipramine, had no effect on TNF-α/CHX-induced cell death. However, addition of fumonisin B1, a selective ceramide synthase inhibitor, attenuated TNF-α/CHX-induced intracellular ceramide elevation and BCEC death. Together, these findings suggest that ceramide plays at least a partial role in this paradigm of BCEC death. Our results show, for the first time, that ceramide derived from de novosynthesis is an alternative mechanism to sphingomyelin hydrolysis in the BCEC death process initiated by TNF-α/CHX.

Stroke. 1997; 28: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). A major target of TNF-α action is cerebral endothelial cells, which, once activated by TNF-α, can trigger a series of inflammatory reactions ultimately leading to neuronal cell death (11Cruz R. Sarcich J.L. Tomasselli A.G. Manning A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A127Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Accordingly, exploration of the mechanisms by which TNF-α exerts neurodegenerative effects through cerebral endothelial cells has assumed increasing importance in the attempt to attenuate secondary brain injury. Binding of TNF-α to the TNF-α receptors on endothelial cells could initiate proliferative, differentiative, or apoptotic signaling pathway depending on the experimental conditions. The signaling cascades that couple TNF-α receptor activation to specific biological responses, particularly apoptosis, have been extensively studied and molecularly dissected in transformed cells (12Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, most untransformed mammalian cells are inherently resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α. A number of compelling results now reveal that this resistance can be reversed by the presence of a protein or RNA synthesis inhibitor (14Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M. Cell Immunol. 1989; 119: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp.

The death induced by TNF-α in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, showed typical morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis and is blocked by Bcl-2 and CrmA expression (16White E.

The sensitizing effect of CHX is believed to result from the inhibition of synthesis of certain general survival factor(s) and, thus, potentiates the killing activity of TNF-α (17Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8318-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide, a lipid second messenger, has recently emerged as an important mediator in transmitting the death signal following TNF-α receptor activation (19Hannun Y.A Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Ligation of TNF-α and TNF-α receptor activates a neutral membrane-associated sphingomyelinase as well as an acidic lysosome-localized sphingomyelinase, both liberate ceramide from sphingomyelin (20Wiegmann K Schutze S. Machiedt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only the activation of acidic sphingomyelinase was found to be death domain-dependent (21Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14617-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is believed that ceramide, which mediates TNF-α cytotoxic effects, is resulted from sphingomyelin hydrolysis by the acidic form of sphingomyelinase. Although ceramide generated in response to extracellular signals appears to be derived from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in most cases, it may also be produced from de novo synthesis via ceramide synthase (19Hannun Y.A Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). For instance, retinoic acid (22Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and daunorubicin have been shown to stimulate de novo ceramide synthesis (23Bose R. Verheij M. Haimvitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Cultured bovine cerebral endothelial cells (BCECs) provide an excellent model system for understanding TNF-α actions on the secondary injury processes. We report here that sequential TNF-α and CHX treatment induces a progressive elevation of intracellular ceramide level, which is followed by DNA fragmentation and cell death in BCECs. More importantly, ceramide in this BCEC death paradigm is derived fromde novo synthesis, but not the conventional pathway, namely the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. Our findings provide evidence for a crucial role of ceramide in the TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptotic process and indicate that de novo ceramide synthesis is a unique signaling mechanism in this cell death paradigm in BCECs involving TNF-α. All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, and all cell culture supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. unless specified. Bovine cerebral endothelial cells (BCECs) were prepared and characterized as described previously (24Hsu C.Y. Shaikh A. Yeh C.H. Dugan L.L. Lin T.S. Xu J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 823: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Shaikh A. Xu J. Wu Y. He L. Hsu C.Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine brains from freshly slaughtered adult animals were immediately placed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing appropriate antibiotics. Meninges and superficial blood vessels were removed, homogenized, and filtered, and the resulting microvessel fraction was then sequentially digested with collagenase B (4 mg/ml) for 2 h and collagenase/dispase (1 mg/ml) for 8 h followed by centrifugation in 40% Percoll solution. The band containing microvessels was collected and washed prior to plating onto collagen-coated dishes. BCECs migrating from vessels were pooled to form a culture of proliferating endothelial cells and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, heparin (0.5 mg/ml), and endothelial growth supplements (75 μg/ml). BCECs of passages 4–15, which were uniformly positive for factor VIII and vimentin (>95% endothelial cells) and exhibited the characteristic bradykinin receptors (26Xu J. Qu Z-X. Moore S.A. Hsu C.Y. Hogan E.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were grown to 70–80% confluence before experiments. BCECs were exposed to TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 16 h followed by CHX (10 μg/ml) for 6 h and then maintained for various periods (up to 24 h) or to the appropriate concentrations of C2 ceramide (10–100 μm) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 24 h before cytotoxic assessment. Cell death was measured at various time points after treatments by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (27Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (28Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and trypan blue exclusion. In addition, the levels of histone-associated DNA fragments released into cytoplasm after the induction of cell death was quantitatively determined by a Cell Death Detection kit according to the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). The assay utilizes mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones, and allows the specific determination of mono- and oligonucleosome levels in the cell lysate (25Shaikh A. Xu J. Wu Y. He L. Hsu C.Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death was further confirmed by Hoechst 3342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining and fluorescent microscopy. TUNEL staining of BCECs after treatments to induce cell death was performed using an ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kit (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (25Shaikh A. Xu J. Wu Y. He L. Hsu C.Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For detection of DNA ladders, BCECs were treated with TNF-α/CHX (16 h/6 h) or C2 ceramide (50 μm) for 24 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested and lysed by addition of cell lysis solution in the presence of RNase A, and then the high molecular weight chromosomes and proteins were removed by the precipitation solution according to the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). The extracted DNA samples (10 μg/lane) were electrophoresed in Tris acetate buffer (0.4 m Tris, 0.25m sodium acetate, 0.22 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) containing 0.4 μg/ml ethidium bromide on a 1.5% agarose gel. DNA was visualized through ultraviolet light and photographed (25Shaikh A. Xu J. Wu Y. He L. Hsu C.Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Determination and quantification of intracellular sphingomyelin/ceramide content were performed as described (29Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with some modifications. This method is comparable to the diacylglycerol kinase assay, and both give quantitatively similar data (29Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). BCECs (1 × 107 cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μCi of [3H]palmitate (1 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 16–24 h before treatment with TNF-α/CHX or vehicle. Labeled cells were collected and washed with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times to remove free isotope. For lipid extraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of methanol: H2O:6 n HCl (100:5:1, v/v) followed by adding 800 μl of chloroform and 240 μl of water. The mixture was then vortex-mixed and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min, and the upper, aqueous phase was discarded. The lipid fraction recovered from the lower phase was extracted again with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and dried under nitrogen. The final samples were resuspended in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (85:4.5:5:0.5, v/v) as a solvent system for resolving ceramide, and chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:30:8:4, v/v) for sphingomyelin. Standard lipids were separated from or in combination with the samples and visualized in iodine vapor. The radioactive spots corresponding to ceramide and sphingomyelin were scraped off and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Radioactivity recovered from the ceramide or sphingomyelin fraction was converted to picomoles of product by using the specific activity of the substrate palmitate. Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± S.E. based on at least three separate experiments. Difference among groups was statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. Comparison between two experimental groups was based on two-tailedt test. A p value less than 0.05 is considered significant. BCECs, like most untransformed cells in cultures, are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α. There was no signs of BCEC death up to 48 h after 20 ng/ml TNF-α exposure. CHX (10 μg/ml) alone also did not cause cell death. However, death of BCECs was noted with sequential exposure to TNF-α (20 ng/ml, 16 h) and CHX (10 μg/ml, 6 h). Cell death in these cultures was asynchronous and reached approximately 30% at 22 h following TNF-α/CHX treatment as measured by trypan blue exclusion, MTT assay, and release of intracellular LDH (Fig. 1). Dying cells developed progressive shrinkage and detached from the substratum. BCECs exposed to TNF-α/CHX treatment displayed the typical morphology characteristic of apoptosis, e.g. cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and chromosomal and internucleosomal DNA fragmentations (Fig. 2, A and B). The amount of histone/DNA complexes liberated into cytoplasm after TNF-α/CHX exposure was also elevated compared with that of cells treated by TNF-α or CHX alone (Fig. 2 C). It is noteworthy that signs of cell death (e.g. LDH release) induced by TNF-α/CHX were preceded by DNA fragmentation, which began as early as 1 h after CHX incubation and persisted to reach a maximum at 8 h (data not shown). These results are consistent with the notion that TNF-α/CHX treatment results in BCEC apoptosis.Figure 2TNF-α/CHX-induced morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis in BCECs. A, BCECs that had been treated with TNF-α (16 h, upper panel), CHX (6 h, middle panel), or TNF-α/CHX (16 h/6 h, lower panel) were washed, fixed, and stained with Hoechst 3342 (0.1 μg/ml) for 10 min and photographed under a fluorescent microscope. B, cultured BCECs were subjected to TNF-α (lane 1), CHX (lane 2), or TNF-α/CHX (lane 3) treatment as described above. DNA was isolated and resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. A 1-kilobase pair DNA ladder was electrophoresed as a marker (lane M).

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus measured the intracellular level of ceramide in BCECs after TNF-α/CHX treatment. As shown in Fig. 3 A, TNF-α/CHX treatment resulted in a 5–6-fold increase in intracellular ceramide level as measured by [3H]palmitate incorporation. In contrast, treatment with either TNF-α or CHX alone for the same period of time did not show significant change in ceramide content as compared with control cells. More importantly, the increase in cellular ceramide level in response to TNF-α/CHX treatment apparently did not result from sphingomyelinase activation. The sphingomyelin content did not decline significantly over a 6-h period following addition of CHX (Fig. 3 B). However, ceramide induction started within the first hour (∼2-fold), progressively increased and reached its peak at 3 h after CHX challenge (∼4-fold), after which both ceramide and sphingomyelin levels slightly declined. It appears that ceramide accumulation in BCECs following TNF-α/CHX stimulation was not associated with sphingomyelin hydrolysis. To test further if ceramide could serve as a mediator of TNF-α/CHX-induced BCEC death, we tested the effect of a cell-permeable ceramide analogue, namely C2ceramide. Incubation of C2 ceramide at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μm for 24 h caused BCEC death in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of approximately 50 μm (Fig. 4 A). At a concentration of 50 μm, C2 ceramide-induced cell death began at ∼6 h and proceeded progressively until 24 h after treatment when the maximal effect was achieved (Fig. 4 B). A biologically inactive ceramide analogue, dihydroceramide, was not cytotoxic to BCECs at concentrations up to 50 μm, demonstrating that the effect was C2-specific (Fig. 4 C). The characteristic changes in BCECs following C2 treatment were similar to those shown following TNF-α/CHX exposure and included positive TUNEL staining and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). Our results indicate that C2 ceramide, like TNF-α/CHX, has the potential to elicit apoptosis in BCECs, and raise the possibility that ceramide production may mediate cytotoxic effects of TNF-α/CHX in BCECs.Figure 5C2 ceramide induction of morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis in BCECs.

Ceramide synthase is the key enzyme in de novo ceramide biosynthesis (31Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and thus is a good candidate for studying its role in TNF-α/CHX-triggered BCEC death. We first studied the effect of a natural specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase, fumonisin B1. Fumonisin B1 is a fungal metabolite with substantial structural similarities to sphinganine and sphingosine (23Bose R. Verheij M. Haimvitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that fumonisin B1 is a potent and specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase with no obvious effects on other major enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism (32Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, preincubation of BCECs with increasing concentrations of fumonisin B1 (0.01–1 μm) for 2 h prior to TNF-α/CHX treatment displayed a dose-dependent attenuation of cell death. At 1 μm, fumonisin B1 also significantly reduced the intracellular ceramide level (Fig. 6 B). At concentrations higher than 10 μm, fumonisin B1 was toxic to BCECs. In contrast to fumonisin B1, an acidic sphingomyelinase inhibitor, desipramine, at same concentrations showed no protective effect against TNF-α/CHX action. These findings further support our previous results that ceramide accumulation in BCECs following TNF-α/CHX stimulation was not caused by sphingomyelinase activation. Instead, ceramide production by TNF-α/CHX treatment could be a result of de novo ceramide synthesis via up-regulation of ceramide synthase activity. Results from the present study provide evidence that ceramide contributes at least partially to TNF-α/CHX-induced BCEC death. Ceramide production preceded the onset of DNA fragmentation and cell death. The time courses of ceramide generation and BCEC death in response to TNF-α/CHX are consistent with the contention that ceramide is an early messenger for this process. The mechanism of ceramide accumulation following sequential TNF-α/CHX treatment does not appear to be secondary to the activation of sphingomyelinase pathways, which are usually responsive to TNF-α-, Fas-, and γ-irradiation-initiated apoptosis (33Kolesnick R.N. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Pushkareva M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 294-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In these paradigms, ceramide generation was concurrent with sphingomyelin hydrolysis by activated sphingomyelinases. In the TNF-α cascade, both the membrane-associated neutral and the acidic forms of sphingomyelinases are activated by TNF-α receptors through different cytoplasmic domains. Each domain was specifically coupled to selective pathways of TNF-α signaling: ceramide generated by the neutral sphingomyelinase activates phospholipase A2 and proline-directed protein kinases, whereas ceramide generated by the acidic form has been linked to the cytotoxic response (12Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 20Wiegmann K Schutze S. Machiedt T. Witte D. Kronke M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14617-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that TNF-α or CHX alone did not activate any ceramide cascade. TNF-α/CHX-induced BCEC death, however, may involve a distinct ceramide pathway, which apparently results from de novosynthesis via ceramide synthase. Lack of sphingomyelin degradation following TNF-α/CHX treatment indicates that sphingomyelinases are not activated in this BCEC death paradigm. Furthermore, acidic sphingomyelinase may not be involved in this apoptotic pathway because application of an acidic sphingomyelinase inhibitor failed to attenuate TNF-α/CHX-mediated cell death. There were a number of studies describing apoptosis in human and bovine endothelial cells mediated by TNF-α alone or TNF-α plus CHX (35Wang J.H. Redmond H.P. Watson R.W. Condron C. Bouchier-Hayes D. Shock. 1996; 6: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 37Slowik M.R. Wang M. Ardito T. Karsan A. Kashgarian M. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 1997; 3: 257-267Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species, Bcl-2, and caspases have been implicated in this process. However, the exact mechanisms of apoptosis in these paradigms have not been fully delineated. In addition, although ceramide is proposed to be an active messenger in the signaling pathway, a causal role for ceramide in TNF-α-mediated endothelial cell apoptosis has not been established. Our results suggest that ceramide could be an important mediator in BCEC death in response to TNF-α/CHX treatment. First, either TNF-α or CHX alone, which has no apparent cytotoxic effects on BCECs, could not induce ceramide production. Second, intracellular ceramide accumulation in response to TNF-α/CHX occurred at a very early stage. Third, exogenous application of a ceramide analogue (C2 ceramide) mimicked the TNF-α/CHX effect in inducing BCEC death. Finally, fumonisin B1, a specific ceramide synthase inhibitor, attenuated both ceramide accumulation and TNF-α/CHX-induced cell death. TNF-α in combination with a protein or RNA synthesis inhibitor, such as CHX, is a well established apoptotic paradigm in a number of cell types in vitro (14Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M. Cell Immunol. 1989; 119: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp.

The cytotoxic effect of TNF-α unmasked by CHX has led to the hypothesis that CHX blocks TNF-α-induced expression of survival factors. This hypothesis was supported by the following findings. The mRNA level of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenging enzyme, was increased in response to TNF-α treatment (38Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). TNF-α has recently been shown to induce expression of a novel Bcl-2-related protein called A1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (36Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, TNF-α treatment also enhanced the expression of a zinc finger protein A20, which functions as an anti-apoptotic factor in certain cell types (39Cooper J.T. Stroka D.M. Brostjan C. Palmetshofer A. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18068-18073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, TNF-α is a potent activator of NF-κB, a transcription factor with anti-apoptotic potential (40Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 41van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CHX at low concentrations has been shown to alter Bcl-2 expression related to its neuroprotective effect (42Furukawa K. Estus S. Fu W. Mark R.J. Mattson M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, this latter observation may not be applicable to our paradigm because the concentration of CHX we used is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher. In addition, we have found that the effect of cycloheximide and TNF-α is concentration-dependent, e.g. lower concentration of cycloheximide (1–5 μm) in combination with TNF-α also causes apoptosis, but at a slower rate and of lesser magnitude. 2J. Xu, C.-H. Yeh, S. Chen, L. He, S. L. Sensi, L. M. T. Canzoniero, D. W. Choi, and C. Y. Hsu, unpublished results. The combined effects of TNF-α and CHX may also exist in vivo in certain pathological states. Protein synthesis is inhibited for several hours following ischemia in vivo (43DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neumar R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. White B.C. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb.

So far, the mechanism underlying TNF-α/CHX regulation of ceramide synthase in BCECs is not clear. Nevertheless, BCECs may contain an unique ceramide synthesis cascade which can be activated by TNF-α/CHX to cause cell death. This novel mechanism of cell death has not been demonstrated in any cell of neural origin or any endothelial cell preparation. The only known example in which ceramide biosynthesis serves as a mechanism for generating death signal was daunorubicin-induced apoptosis in both human and murine leukemia cells (23Bose R. Verheij M. Haimvitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Our data here have unveiled, for the first time, a possible novel mechanism of TNF-α/CHX-induced BCEC death, which is mediated by ceramide but is independent of sphingomyelinase cascade. Further exploration of this unique cerebral endothelial cell death pathway involving ceramide synthase may broaden our insight into therapeutic interventions directed at the secondary inflammatory reaction following brain injury, which is associated with progressive endothelial injury (5Gianani R.

The majority of chloroplastic proteins are encoded within the nuclei of plant cells and are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. As a result, these proteins must be imported into the chloroplast post-translationally, usually via an unfolded, higher molecular weight precursor form containing a N-terminal transit peptide (1Chua N.H.

Once a precursor protein has entered the chloroplast stroma, the transit peptide is cleaved off by the stromal processing peptidase, and the protein is folded into its mature form (4Kouranov A.

Protein import into chloroplasts is mediated by a proteinaceous translocation apparatus that spans both the outer and inner envelope membranes of this organelle. Several components of the translocation apparatus have been identified, including the outer membrane components Toc86, 1The abbreviations used are: Toc, translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts; Tic, translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts; TLCK,Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; BAEE,Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SS, small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase.

The first component of the inner envelope membrane translocation apparatus to be cloned was Tic110. Using chemical cross-linking and coimmunoprecipitation techniques, two separate laboratories have found Tic110 in a complex with both a translocating precursor and components of the outer membrane translocation apparatus (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Tic110 is an integral protein of the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts, with either one or two putative, hydrophobic, transmembrane domains located near its N terminus (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The overall topology of Tic110 within the inner envelope membrane, however, remains a point of debate. Lübeck et al. (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported that Tic110 spans the membrane once and that its large (>90-kDa) hydrophilic domain is oriented toward the intermembrane space between the outer and inner envelope membranes. On the other hand, Kessler and Blobel (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) proposed that Tic110 spans the membrane twice and that its hydrophilic domain is contained within the chloroplast stroma. To date, no evidence has been presented that satisfactorily resolves this controversy. Knowing the topology of Tic110 will be important in assigning a putative function to this protein. For instance, if Tic110 is oriented toward the chloroplast intermembrane space, then it may function by interacting with the outer membrane translocation apparatus, promoting the formation of contact sites between the two envelope membranes (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, if Tic110 is instead exposed to the stromal compartment, then it is more likely that the protein acts by recruiting stromal proteins, for example molecular chaperones, to the protein import apparatus (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In previous studies, the topology of Tic110 was investigated by analyzing the protease sensitivity of the protein within intact chloroplasts, a technique that has been used for other chloroplastic membrane proteins and for membrane proteins of other organelles (7Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 11Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Etemadi A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 604: 347-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two of the most widely used proteases in such studies are thermolysin and trypsin. Thermolysin has been used to selectively degrade outer envelope membrane proteins exposed on the surface of chloroplasts, since this protease, at moderate concentrations, does not penetrate the outer membrane (19Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin, however, does penetrate the chloroplast outer envelope membrane, but it does not, at moderate concentrations, destroy the permeability barrier of the inner membrane (19Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Marshall J.S. DeRocher A.E. Keegstra K. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, trypsin is useful in defining the topology of inner envelope membrane proteins and in localizing soluble proteins to the intermembrane space of the chloroplast. In this paper, we report on the topology of Tic110, attempting to resolve the controversy that currently exists concerning the orientation of this protein within the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. When steps are taken to adequately quench proteases, Tic110 is degraded by neither trypsin nor thermolysin, indicating that the large hydrophilic domain of Tic110 is contained within the chloroplast stromal compartment. In addition, when trypsin is insufficiently quenched, Tic110 is degraded, but only after chloroplasts are broken open. Comparison of the protease sensitivity of Tic110 with those of proteins of established topology lends further support to the conclusion that Tic110 is indeed oriented toward the chloroplast stroma. Pea seeds (Pisum sativum var.little marvel) were supplied by the Olds Seed Company (Madison, WI). Percoll silica gel, trypsin (from bovine pancreas),Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK),1 soybean trypsin inhibitor, and Mg-ATP were obtained from Sigma. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and aprotinin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [35S]methionine was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Chloroplasts were isolated from 8–12-day-old pea seedlings over Percoll gradients as described previously (22Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd Ed. J1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). Final resuspension was in import buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 0.33 m sorbitol) at a concentration of 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml. Purified intact chloroplasts (50 μg of chlorophyll) were incubated with trypsin (6300 BAEE units/mg; 10–1000 μg of trypsin/mg of chlorophyll) in import buffer containing calcium chloride at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The final reaction volume for these digestions was 300 μl. After incubation with the protease for either 10 min or 60 min at room temperature, trypsin activity was quenched by adding either PMSF at a final concentration of 1 mm or by adding a mixture of protease inhibitors to a final concentration of 1 mm PMSF, 0.05 mg/ml TLCK, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Chloroplasts were incubated with the quenching reagents for 10 min on ice. After quenching, intact chloroplasts were reisolated over a 40% (v/v) Percoll cushion. The recovered chloroplasts were lysed hypotonically and fractionated into crude membrane and soluble fractions as described previously (22Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd Ed. J1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar), except that the lysis buffer contained either PMSF at a final concentration of 1 mm or a protease inhibitor mixture at final concentrations of 5 mm PMSF, 0.05 mg/ml TLCK, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with either Tic110 or Toc75 antibodies essentially as described by Tranel et al. (12Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Variations to this protocol are given in the figure legends. Precursor proteins were synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT® -coupled translation system from Promega. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate-translated35S-prToc75 (12Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), 35S-tp110–110N (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar),35S-tpSS-110N (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 35S-tpToc75-mSS (18Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), or35S-prSS (24Olsen L.J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was imported into purified chloroplasts (100 μg of chlorophyll) essentially as previously reported (22Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd Ed. J1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). After import, intact chloroplasts were reisolated over a 40% (v/v) Percoll cushion and resuspended in 600 μl of import buffer. Each import reaction was then split into four equal samples for further analysis. One sample from each import reaction was lysed hypotonically, as described previously (22Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd Ed. J1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar), without any further treatment. A second sample was incubated on ice for 30 min with 0.2 mg/ml thermolysin. Protease activity was quenched by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm. Intact chloroplasts were then reisolated over a 40% (v/v) Percoll cushion containing 5 mm EDTA and lysed hypotonically. The remaining two samples from each import reaction were incubated in the presence of trypsin (6000 BAEE units/mg) at a concentration of 500 μg of trypsin/mg of chlorophyll for 60 min at room temperature. Trypsin activity was quenched for 10 min on ice either with PMSF at a final concentration of 1 mm or with a mixture of protease inhibitors at final concentrations of 1 mm PMSF, 0.05 mg/ml TLCK, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Intact chloroplasts from the two trypsin treatments were then reisolated and lysed as described above. Lysed chloroplasts from all four treatments were fractionated into crude membrane and soluble fractions as described by Bruce et al. (22Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd Ed. J1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each fraction was determined by the Lowry protein assay (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or immunoblotting (12Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Inner envelope membranes were purified from intact chloroplasts essentially as described by Keegstra and Yousif (26Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), except that the purified inner membranes were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 4 mmMgCl2) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Purified inner envelope membranes (20 μg of protein) were incubated with trypsin (6000 BAEE units/mg; 1–10,000 ng of trypsin/mg of protein) in the presence of 0.1 mm calcium chloride for 10 min at room temperature. The final reaction volume for these digestions was 200 μl. Trypsin activity was quenched by the addition of a mixture of protease inhibitors at final concentrations of 1 mm PMSF, 0.05 mg/ml TLCK, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The quenched reactions were incubated for 10 min on ice. Inner envelope membranes were then recovered by centrifuging the samples at 250,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against either Tic110 or ClpC as described previously (12Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). All antibodies used in this investigation were polyclonal and raised in rabbits. Antiserum to Tic110 was generated as described by Akita et al. (15Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Antiserum against Toc75 was raised as discussed by Tranel et al. (12Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Antiserum to Toc34 (9Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) was a gift from D. Schnell. Affinity-purified anti-ClpC antibodies (27Shanklin J. DeWitt N.D. Flanagan J.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1713-1722PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift from J. Shanklin. It has been reported that certain proteases, most notably trypsin, are able to destroy the permeability barrier of the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts and thereby degrade outer membrane proteins, as well as inner envelope membrane proteins exposed to the intermembrane space, while leaving stromally exposed proteins undigested (19Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Marshall J.S. DeRocher A.E. Keegstra K. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consequently, this method can be used to selectively degrade inner envelope membrane proteins that are oriented toward the intermembrane space while leaving stromally exposed inner membrane proteins intact. Such selective proteolysis techniques have previously been utilized to analyze the location and topology of various chloroplast envelope membrane proteins, including Tic110 (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). During efforts to repeat and extend these previous studies, we observed that Tic110 was resistant to degradation when intact chloroplasts were incubated with a range of trypsin concentrations (data not shown), indicating that this protein was not exposed to the chloroplast intermembrane space. These results were in direct contrast with the trypsin sensitivity of Tic110 reported by Lübeck et al. (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, several differences in protocol existed between the two experiments, including the length of time used for trypsin digestion and the reagents used to quench trypsin activity. Consequently, we sought to determine whether these protocol differences could explain the contrasting results. Intact chloroplasts were incubated with trypsin for either 10 min (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3 and lanes 7–9) or for 60 min (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5and lanes 10 and 11), as described by Lübeck et al. (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After digestion for the specified period of time, trypsin activity was quenched either with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Fig. 1, lanes 1–5) or with 1 mm PMSF (Fig. 1, lanes 7–11), as reported by Lübeck et al. (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Degradation of Tic110 was not significantly affected by the duration of incubation with the protease (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5). On the other hand, the quench protocol had a dramatic effect on Tic110 digestion (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2–5 and lanes 8–11). Tic110 remained undigested when trypsin was quenched with the mixture of protease inhibitors but was completely degraded when 1 mm PMSF was used to quench trypsin activity. These observations indicated that 1 mmPMSF was insufficient to quench protease activity. This result was supported by the finding that when chloroplasts were incubated with 1 mm PMSF prior to trypsin addition, Tic110 was still completely degraded (Fig. 1, lane 12). Other differences (i.e. number of washes) between our protease digestion protocol and that of Lübeck et al. (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were also tested for their effects on Tic110 degradation. However, none affected the pattern of Tic110 digestion (data not shown). We concluded, therefore, that the difference in results could be completely explained by differences in the methods used to quench trypsin activity. We next sought to determine at what stage of the protease digestion protocol trypsin degraded Tic110 when 1 mm PMSF was used as the quenching reagent. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether Tic110 was degraded before chloroplast lysis, when the permeability barrier of the inner membrane was still intact, or after lysis, when the inner membrane had been ruptured. There were three stages during our protocol in which degradation of Tic110 by trypsin could occur: before chloroplasts were broken open (incubation of chloroplasts with trypsin, quenching of protease activity, and reisolation of intact chloroplasts), during chloroplast lysis, or during postlysis steps (membrane sedimentation and incubation of the membranes in SDS-PAGE sample buffer). To distinguish among these possibilities, we quenched trypsin-treated chloroplasts with the mixture of protease inhibitors before lysis, during lysis, and/or after lysis. During those steps when the protease inhibitor mixture was not added, 1 mm PMSF was added in its place. Fig. 2 shows the results from this experimental approach. When the quench mixture was added at all three stages or just during and after lysis, Tic110 was not significantly degraded (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Tic110 was completely digested only when the quenching mixture was added just during the postlysis stage (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), indicating that it was most likely degraded by active trypsin during chloroplast lysis. In addition, as long as the protease inhibitor mixture was added before and/or during chloroplast lysis, Tic110 was not digested by trypsin (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it appeared that unless trypsin was adequately quenched before or at the time of lysis, Tic110 was digested by the protease once chloroplasts were broken open. Recently, several investigators have utilized protease digestion techniques to analyze the location and topology of newly imported chloroplastic proteins (18Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We obtained these precursor constructs in order to determine whether the quenching protocol used had an effect on the results and to compare the protease sensitivity of constructs with known topology to that of Tic110 constructs. Intact chloroplasts were subjected to an import assay with one of five different precursor proteins: prToc75 (12Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); tp110–110N, a truncated version of prTic110 containing the putative transmembrane domain(s) and approximately one-fifth (<20 kDa) of the hydrophilic domain (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); tpSS-110N, a chimeric precursor containing the transit peptide of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (SS) attached to the truncated version of mature Tic110 (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); tpToc75-mSS, a chimeric precursor consisting of the transit peptide of Toc75 attached to the mature form of SS (18Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); and prSS (24Olsen L.J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After import, intact chloroplasts were reisolated and digested with either thermolysin or trypsin. Trypsin-treated chloroplasts were quenched with either the protease inhibitor mixture (trypsin I protocol) or 1 mmPMSF (trypsin II protocol). Following protease digestion, intact chloroplasts were reisolated, lysed, and separated into membrane and soluble protein fractions. The proteins from these fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography to detect the newly imported, radiolabeled proteins (Fig. 3 A) or immunoblotting to detect endogenous proteins (Fig. 3 B). The processed forms of prToc75 (mToc75 and iToc75), which were used as markers for the outer envelope membrane, were degraded by trypsin but not by thermolysin (Fig. 3 A, row 1). Because Toc75 is deeply embedded in the chloroplast outer envelope membrane, thermolysin could not access the protein. However, because trypsin is able to penetrate the outer membrane, it was able to completely digest Toc75 (as in Fig. 1). In contrast, because neither thermolysin nor trypsin can penetrate the inner envelope membrane, prSS, a stromal marker, was not digested by either protease (Fig. 3 A,row 5). It has previously been reported that when tpToc75-mSS is imported into chloroplasts, the processed product is exposed to the chloroplast intermembrane space in both soluble and membrane-bound forms (18Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, we utilized this construct as a marker for the intermembrane space. Accordingly, we found that both the soluble and membrane-bound products generated from tpToc75-mSS were degraded by trypsin but not by thermolysin (Fig. 3 A, row 4). If Tic110 was also exposed to the intermembrane space, we would have expected it to have a protease sensitivity similar to tpToc75-mSS. However, neither of the Tic110 constructs, tp110–110N and tpSS-110N, which were expected to have the same topology as Tic110 itself (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), were degraded by trypsin as long as protease activity was sufficiently quenched by the protease inhibitor mixture (Fig. 3 A, rows 2 and3, compare trypsin I and trypsin II protocols). We interpreted these results to indicate that these Tic110 constructs were not exposed to the intermembrane space. Since it has been previously demonstrated that these two constructs are inserted in the inner envelope membrane (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we concluded that they must be oriented toward the chloroplast stroma. We also examined the protease sensitivity of three endogenous proteins in these chloroplasts (Fig. 3 B). Tic110 was not significantly degraded by either thermolysin or trypsin as long as trypsin was adequately quenched (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). This is similar to the results obtained in our previous experiments and those seen for the imported Tic110 constructs. Toc75 was degraded by trypsin but not by thermolysin (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5–8), consistent with the results obtained for imported Toc75. On the other hand, Toc34 was degraded by both proteases (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9–12). These results are consistent with the fact that the cytosolic domain of Toc34 is exposed on the outer surface of chloroplasts (7Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 11Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The results presented above suggest that within intact chloroplasts, Tic110 is oriented toward the stromal compartment. In order to extend and confirm this conclusion, we analyzed the topology of Tic110 in a second system, isolated inner envelope membrane vesicles. Specifically, we compared the trypsin sensitivity of Tic110 to that of ClpC, a stromal hsp100 homologue. ClpC is primarily a soluble protein; however, it is known that a significant portion of the ClpC molecules in the chloroplast are associated with the stromal side of the inner envelope membrane (28Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,29Nielsen E.E. The Role of Stromal Molecular Chaperones in Chloroplastic Protein Translocation. Ph.D. dissertation. Michigan State University, 1997: 131-174Google Scholar). Therefore, if Tic110 is indeed exposed on the stromal face of the inner envelope membrane, it should display the same trypsin sensitivity as ClpC. This indeed was what we observed upon analysis of inner membrane vesicles (Fig. 4). Both Tic110 and ClpC were resistant to degradation at low protease concentrations and susceptible at higher levels of trypsin. In addition, both proteins began to be significantly degraded at the same trypsin concentration (Fig. 4, A, lane 5, and B, lane 5), indicating that Tic110 and ClpC were exposed on the same side of the vesicles. Consequently, we concluded that Tic110, like ClpC, was oriented toward the chloroplast stroma. To investigate the process of protein import into chloroplasts in detail, it will be necessary to study the translocation machineries of the outer and inner envelope membranes separately, as has been done for the mitochondrial protein import system (30Pfanner N. Craig E.A. Meijer M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 368-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mitochondria, like chloroplasts, are surrounded by an envelope composed of two separate membranes. Techniques have been developed to physically remove the mitochondrial outer envelope membrane so that inner envelope membrane proteins can be specifically analyzed (31Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts, mitochondria in which the outer membrane has been selectively ruptured and/or dissolved, can be generated either by subjecting intact mitochondria to osmotic shock treatment (31Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by treating them with digitonin (32Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These two methods have been used successfully to study the location and topology of mitochondrial inner envelope membrane proteins and the mechanism of mitochondrial protein import (for example, see Refs. 33Ohba M. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2117-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Hwang S.T. Wachter C. Schatz G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similar techniques to selectively remove the outer membrane of chloroplast envelopes are not yet available. In lieu of such approaches, investigations on chloroplast inner envelope membrane proteins have relied on the ability of certain proteases, specifically trypsin, to selectively destroy the permeability barrier of the outer membrane and degrade inner membrane proteins that are exposed to the intermembrane space while leaving stromally exposed proteins intact (19Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1990; 87: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This technique can thus be used to differentiate between an intermembrane space and a stromal localization for both soluble and membrane proteins (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K.

Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as we have done in this study. Two independent investigations have provided evidence indicating that Tic110 is a component of the chloroplast protein translocation apparatus localized in the inner envelope membrane (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, no function for Tic110 during protein translocation has been clearly established. Elucidating the topology of Tic110, about which the original reports disagreed (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), will be an important first step toward understanding the role of this protein in the import process. In this investigation, we have provided evidence indicating that the large (>90-kDa) hydrophilic domain of Tic110 was oriented toward the stromal compartment. Because the one or two predicted transmembrane domains of Tic110 are near the N terminus (within the first 10% of the mature protein), it is likely that the regions of Tic110 that are important for its function reside within the large hydrophilic domain, which we have localized. Previous investigations have proposed that Tic110 may be involved in mediating the interaction between outer and inner envelope membrane translocation components during protein import (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, our evidence does not support this view. The stromal orientation of the major portion of Tic110 would probably not allow this protein to interact with outer envelope membrane proteins. Instead, it is more likely that Tic110 interacts with stromal components of the translocation apparatus. For instance, Tic110 may be involved in the recruitment of molecular chaperones, including ClpC, to the site of protein import. This study has demonstrated that Tic110 is degraded by trypsin only when trypsin-treated chloroplasts are insufficiently quenched. Incomplete quenching of trypsin activity with PMSF is the most likely explanation for previous reports concluding, based on trypsin analysis, that Tic110 is degraded by the protease and thus is oriented toward the intermembrane space (14Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An investigation reported by Kessler and Blobel (13Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) on the topology of Tic110 also utilized trypsin digestion data to analyze this problem. These investigators, who found that trypsin does not degrade Tic110, quenched protease activity with a combination of inhibitors. Their results support our claim that when trypsin is adequately quenched, Tic110 remains largely undigested after protease treatment of intact chloroplasts and provide further evidence for the conclusion that the large hydrophilic domain of Tic110 is exposed to the chloroplast stroma rather than the intermembrane space. In the case where trypsin was insufficiently quenched, it is possible that active trypsin either bound to the chloroplast envelope membranes or was trapped in the intermembrane space and, consequently, was retained during reisolation of intact chloroplasts. Then, during or after chloroplast lysis, trypsin was able to gain access to proteins exposed on the stromal face of the inner envelope membrane and digest them. In this investigation, we analyzed the protease sensitivity of newly imported, radiolabeled SS, a stromally localized protein. This protein did not seem to be significantly degraded by trypsin, regardless of the method used to quench protease activity. To explain these observations, we propose that incompletely quenched trypsin is “trapped” inside envelope vesicles that form upon chloroplast lysis and is thus unable to significantly degrade soluble proteins, including SS. During separation of membrane and soluble proteins, the protease would be sedimented with the membrane vesicles away from soluble molecules, including any quenching reagents added during or after the lysis stage. When membrane proteins are subsequently solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, active trypsin can be released from the vesicles and degrade Tic110 and perhaps other membrane proteins as well. It is thus necessary to adequately quench trypsin either before or at the time of chloroplast lysis in order to prevent active protease from being released after chloroplasts have been ruptured (Fig. 2). It should be noted that in this investigation we did not completely repeat the results of Lübeck et al. (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). During the trypsin digestion of the newly imported, radiolabeled precursor constructs, we utilized a lower trypsin concentration (500 μg of trypsin/mg of chlorophyll versus 1000 μg of trypsin/mg of chlorophyll) and a different quenching protocol (protease inhibitor mixture or PMSF versus PMSF and trypsin inhibitor). The protocol we utilized during these import experiments was the same used in all of the other experiments presented in this report. Although we did not completely repeat the protocol of Lübeck et al. (23Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we do not believe this significantly affected our results or the conclusions we have drawn from them, since all other observations indicate that Tic110 does indeed face the chloroplast stroma. During the course of this investigation, we also attempted to specifically label proteins exposed to the intermembrane space with biotinylation reagents that supposedly could not permeate the inner envelope membrane. However, we observed that these reagents were able to enter the chloroplast stroma in small but significant quantities, and we were unable to develop reaction conditions to prevent labeling of stromal proteins. Thus, it appears that at the current time, trypsin digestion analysis is the most reliable method to analyze the topology of inner envelope membrane proteins. Our experiments have revealed that the protocol used to quench trypsin activity during such studies can have a major effect on the results of experiments and thus the conclusions drawn from these results (Fig. 1). Consequently, it is important that measures be taken to ensure that trypsin is adequately quenched whenever this protease is used as an analytical tool. When our quench mixture is added to intact chloroplasts prior to trypsin addition, Tic110 and Toc75 (an outer envelope membrane protein normally susceptible to trypsin action) are left largely intact (Fig. 1). Thus, we concluded that the protease inhibitor mixture used in this investigation was sufficient to quench trypsin activity. Such a mixture of inhibitors should be useful in studying the topology of membrane proteins or in any other investigations where analysis by trypsin digestion plays a pivotal role."

Following the set rule for the chemokine receptor nomenclature, we propose to designate GPR5 as XCR1 from XC chemokine receptor-1. The chemokines constitute a group of structurally related, mostly basic, heparin-binding chemotactic cytokines that recruit selective types of leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immunological responses (for review, see Refs. 1Baggiolini M.

Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 62: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The chemokines are grouped into two major subfamilies, CXC and CC, according to the motif based on the first two of the four conserved cysteine residues; one amino acid separates the two cysteine residues in the CXC chemokines, whereas the two cysteines are adjacent in the CC chemokines. Furthermore, chemokine-related molecules with C and CX3C motifs have been identified, potentially representing C and CX3C subfamilies. Most CXC chemokines are directed to neutrophils, whereas most CC chemokines primarily act on monocytes. Notably, some recently described CC chemokines are highly specific for lymphocytes and may be involved in homeostatic recirculation and homing of lymphocytes (3Yoshie O. Imai T. Nomiyama H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 62: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Previously, we described a novel basic secretory protein that shows significant homology to chemokines, particularly to CC chemokines, but retains only the 2nd and 4th of the four cysteine residues conserved in other chemokines (4Yoshida T. Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Yoshie O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We thus named this molecule as single C motif-1 (SCM-1) 1The abbreviations used are: SCM-1, single C motif-1; ATAC, activation-induced, T cell-derived and chemokine-related molecule; NK, natural killer; GPR5, G protein-coupled receptor 5; XCR, XC chemokine receptor; CXCR, CXC chemokine receptor; CCR, CC chemokine receptor; CX3CR, CX3C chemokine receptor; TARC, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine; LARC, liver and activation-regulated chemokine; SLC, secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine; ELC, EBI1-ligand chemokine; PARC, pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; IP-10, interferon γ-inducible protein 10.

As a first step to elucidate its biological role, we decided to identify its specific receptor. Here we demonstrate that an orphan receptor GPR5 (15Heiber M. Docherty J.M. Shah G. Nguyen T. Cheng R.

When expressed in murine L1.2 cells, GPR5 mediates efficient chemotactic responses and calcium mobilization by SCM-1α and SCM-1β. SCM-1α binds to GPR5 with a high affinity. Among various human tissues, GPR5 is strongly expressed in placenta and weakly in spleen and thymus. Following the set rule on the nomenclature of chemokine receptors (CXCR, CCR, and CX3CR for CXC, CC and CX3C chemokines, respectively), we propose to designate GPR5 as XCR1 from XC chemokine receptor-1. Recombinant SCM-1α and SCM-1β were produced by using a baculovirus expression system and purified to essential homogeneity as described previously (16Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M.

In brief, High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding SCM-1α and SCM-1β under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. After 2 days, recombinant SCM-1 proteins were purified from pooled culture supernatants by using cation-exchange chromatography on FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. SCM-1 proteins were eluted from the reverse-phase column as a single major peak. Fractions containing SCM-1 proteins were pooled and lyophilized. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA kit (Pierce). Endotoxin levels determined by theLimulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) were always <4 pg/μg of recombinant protein. Production and purification of recombinant TARC, LARC, SLC, ELC, and PARC were described previously (see Ref. 3Yoshie O. Imai T. Nomiyama H. J. Leukoc.

For stable expression of cloned receptors in L1.2 cells, 1 × 107 cells in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were transfected with 10 μg of linearized plasmids by electroporation at 260 V and 960 μF using Gene Pulsar (Bio-Rad). After selection with G418 (Sigma) at 600 μg/ml for 1–2 weeks, cells expressing transfected receptors at high levels were identified by limiting dilution culture and Northern blot analysis. Cell migration was assessed by using Transwell chambers with 3-μm pores (Costar) as described previously (22Nagira M. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Ridanpaa M. Takagi S. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cell suspension in 100 μl of assay medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) was placed in upper compartments (106cells/well), and 0.6 ml of assay medium without or with a chemokine was placed in lower compartments. After incubation at 37° C for 4 h in 5% CO2 atmosphere, cells migrated into lower chambers were counted on FACStar Plus (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). This was carried out as described previously (22Nagira M. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Ridanpaa M. Takagi S. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In brief, cells at 1 × 106/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were incubated with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37° C for 1 h in the dark. After washing, 2 ml of cell suspension at 2.5 × 106/ml was placed on a luminescence spectrometer (LS50B, Perkin-Elmer) with constant stirring. Emission fluorescence at 510 nm was measured upon excitation at 340 and 380 nm with a time resolution of 5 point/s. Data were presented by the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 340 nm divided by that of 380 nm (R 340/380). This was carried out as described previously (16Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In brief, purified recombinant SCM-1α was radiolabeled by using125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Japan) to a specific activity of 1.3 × 107cpm/μg. For saturable binding experiments, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-SCM-1α without or with 100-fold excess unlabeled SCM-1α in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 1 h at 15° C, cells were separated from unbound125I-SCM-1α by centrifugation through a mixture of dibutyl phtalate/olive oil (4:1) and counted in a gamma counter. All samples were determined in duplicate. The binding data were analyzed by the LIGAND program (23Munson P. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). This was carried out as described previously (22Nagira M. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Ridanpaa M. Takagi S. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Northern blot filters were purchased fromCLONTECH. The GPR5 probe of 1.2-kilobases in length was generated by polymerase chain reaction using GPR5-specific primers described above. Recombinant SCM-1α and SCM-1β were produced by insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and purified from pooled culture supernatants by cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1, SCM-1α was eluted from the reverse-phase column as a single major peak and migrated as a major 17-kDa band and a minor 15-kDa band on a gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Previously, natural ATAC (identical to SCM-1α) was shown to be highly O-glycosylated, giving rise to species ranging from 12 to 19 kDa (12Dorner B. Muller S. Entschladen F. Schroder J.M. Franke P. Kraft R. Friedl P. Clark-Lewis I. Kroczek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8817-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, these two forms of recombinant SCM-1α were most probably because of difference in the level of glycosylation. Amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that the mature recombinant SCM-1α started at Val-22. The signal peptide cleavage site was thus exactly as estimated (4Yoshida T. Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Yoshie O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and was also identical to the one used by natural ATAC (12Dorner B. Muller S. Entschladen F.

SCM-1β was also purified through the same procedure (data not shown). We examined the ability of recombinant SCM-1α and SCM-1β to induce migration in murine L1.2 cells stably expressing the following chemokine receptors and orphan receptors: CC chemokine receptors CCR1 to CCR7 (see Refs. 1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar, 2Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yoshie O. Imai T. Nomiyama H. J.

Yoshie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), GPR5 (15Heiber M. Docherty J.M. Shah G. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Heng H.H.Q. Marchese A. Tsui L.-C. Shi X. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), GPR-9–6 (GenBank™ accession number U45982), and Burkitt's lymphoma receptor-1 (24Dobner T. Wolf I. Emrich T. Lipp M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Both SCM-1 proteins were found to induce efficient migration in L1.2 cells expressing GPR5 but not in those expressing any other of the 11 receptors listed above (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, SCM-1α and SCM-1β attracted L1.2 cells expressing GPR5 with typical bimodal dose-response curves. SCM-1α showed a maximal level of migration at 100 ng/ml, whereas SCM-1β induced maximal migration broadly from 100 to 1000 ng/ml. Although the cause for such differences is not known at present, both proteins gave an EC50 of about 50 ng/ml. A checkerboard-type analysis revealed that the migration of GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells toward SCM-1α was mostly chemotactic (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the migratory response of GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells toward SCM-1α was completely suppressed by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (Fig. 2 C), indicating coupling of GPR5 with a Gαi class of G-proteins in murine L1.2 cells. Aside from SCM-1α and SCM-1β, 15 other recombinant chemokines tested so far (TARC, LARC, PARC, ELC, SLC, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, RANTES, eotaxin, I-309, interleukin-8 and IP-10) were unable to induce chemotaxis in GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells (data not shown). Thus, GPR5 is a highly specific functional receptor for SCM-1α and SCM-1β. We next examined calcium mobilization in GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells by SCM-1α and SCM-1β. As shown in Fig. 3 A, SCM-1α induced vigorous calcium mobilization in GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells with a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, SCM-1α and SCM-1β efficiently desensitized each other (Fig. 3 B). We next examined specific binding of SCM-1α to GPR5. As shown in Fig. 4 A, 125I-labeled SCM-1α bound to GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells with a saturable manner. The Scatchard analysis revealed a K d of 10 nm and 1.1 × 104 sites/cells (Fig. 4 B). We examined expression of GPR5 mRNA in various human tissues by Northern blot hybridization. As shown in Fig. 5, a message of about 5-kilobases was detected at low levels in spleen and thymus. Strikingly, however, placenta expressed GPR5 mRNA at high levels. A very low level of expression of GPR5 mRNA was also detected in peripheral blood leukocytes after a long exposure (not shown). Even though SCM-1/lymphotactin/ATAC is a member of the chemokine superfamily, it retains only the 2nd and 4th of the four cysteine residues conserved in other chemokines and has a C-terminal sequence much longer than those of other chemokines (4Yoshida T. Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Yoshie O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A.

Cocks B.G. Bacon K.B. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, there are two highly homologous genes, SCYC1 and SCYC2, which encode SCM-1α and SCM-1β, respectively, with only two amino acid substitutions at positions 7 and 8 in mature proteins: Asp-Lys in SCM-1α and His-Arg in SCM-1β (5Yoshida T. Imai T. Takagi S. Nishimura M. Ishikawa I. Yaoi T. Yoshie O. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These two genes are likely to have originated from a very recent gene duplication event because, besides their highly homologous sequences including the 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions, the mouse has apparently only one gene (5Yoshida T. Imai T. Takagi S. Nishimura M. Ishikawa I. Yaoi T. Yoshie O. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In human tissues, SCM-1 mRNA was found to be expressed in spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes (4Yoshida T. Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Yoshie O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similar tissue expression pattern was also described for human lymphotactin (8Kennedy J. Kelner G.S. Kleyensteuber S.

At cell levels, it has been shown to be produced mainly by activated CD8+ T cells, NK cells, γδ-type T cells, and mast cells (6Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A.

Nevertheless, we and others (7Mueller S. Dorner B. Korthaeuer U. Mages H.W. D'Apuzzo M. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Dorner B. Muller S. Entschladen F. Schroder J.M. Franke P. Kraft R. Friedl P. Clark-Lewis I. Kroczek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8817-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have experienced difficulties in getting such results. These discrepancies may be because of differences in recombinant proteins and/or experimental conditions. Or else the main activity of SCM-1 proteins may be different from induction of chemotaxis. To elucidate the biological function of SCM-1 rationally, identification of its receptor would be of great help. Here we have demonstrated that an orphan receptor GPR5 (15Heiber M. Docherty J.M. Shah G. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Heng H.H.Q. Marchese A. Tsui L.-C. Shi X. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) is a high-affinity functional receptor for SCM-1 proteins. Upon stimulation with either SCM-1α or SCM-1β, GPR5 efficiently mediates induction of chemotaxis and calcium mobilization in transfected murine L1.2 cells through coupling with a Gαi type of G proteins (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, at least in transfected murine L1.2 cells, GPR5 behaves as a typical chemokine receptor. GPR5 shares 20–40% sequence identity with other chemokine receptors (15Heiber M. Docherty J.M. Shah G. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Heng H.H.Q. Marchese A. Tsui L.-C. Shi X. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phylogenic depiction of the evolutional relatedness of the various chemokine receptors shows GPR5 to be on a branch containing human CC chemokine receptors (not shown). Its gene is also mapped to chromosome 3p21.3-p21.1 and thus close to other CC chemokine receptor genes clustered at 3p21 (15Heiber M. Docherty J.M. Shah G. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Heng H.H.Q. Marchese A. Tsui L.-C. Shi X. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with the close phylogenic relationship of SCM-1 to CC chemokines (4Yoshida T. Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Yoshie O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), its receptor GPR5 is also closely related to other CC chemokine receptors. Among human tissues, GPR5 is strongly expressed in placenta and weakly in spleen and thymus (Fig. 5). Expression of GPR5 in spleen and thymus correlates with that of SCM-1 in these tissues. However, it is striking that GPR5 is expressed at high levels in placenta and only at very low levels in peripheral blood leukocytes. Thus, circulating lymphocytes and/or NK cells may express GPR5 at very low levels or may contain a minor population expressing GPR5 at high levels. It remains to be seen which types of cells express GPR5 in peripheral blood and whether GPR5 is inducible by conditions such as antigenic stimulation or interleukin-2 treatment. Furthermore, because SCM-1 is constitutively produced at high levels by γδ-type T cells that are mostly tissue-dwelling lymphocytes (13Boismenu R. Feng L. Xia Y.Y. Chang J.C.C. Havran W.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 985-992PubMed Google Scholar), cells expressing GPR5 in tissues such as placenta, spleen, and thymus may also be tissue-associated types of lymphocytes or even other types of cells. Identification of cells expressing GPR5 in these tissues are now under way. In conclusion, identification of a highly specific receptor for SCM-1/lymphotactin/ATAC now enables us to investigate its biological function on a rational basis. Targeted disruption of genes for SCM-1 and GPR5 will be of great help for elucidation of their physiological roles and pathological significance. According to the set rule of the chemokine receptor nomenclature, we propose to designate GPR5 as XCR1 from XC chemokine receptor-1. We are grateful to Dr. Yorio Hinuma and Dr. Masakazu Hatanaka for constant support and encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W1986636337,"MCAM/MUC18 is a cell-surface glycoprotein of 113 kDa, originally identified as a melanoma antigen, whose expression is associated with tumor progression and the development of metastatic potential. We have previously shown that enforced expression of MCAM/MUC18 in primary cutaneous melanoma led to increased tumor growth and metastatic potential in nude mice. The mechanism for up-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 during melanoma progression is unknown. Here we show that up-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 expression in highly metastatic cells correlates with loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. The MCAM/MUC18 promoter contains four binding sites for AP-2, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay gels demonstrated that the AP-2 protein bound directly to the MCAM/MUC18 promoter. Transfection of AP-2 into highly metastatic A375SM melanoma cells (AP-2-negative and MCAM/MUC18-positive) inhibited MCAM/MUC18 promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in AP-2-transfected but not in control cells. In addition, re-expression of AP-2 in A375SM cells inhibited their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice. These results indicate that the expression of MCAM/MUC18 is regulated by AP-2 and that enforced AP-2 expression suppresses tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of human melanoma cells, possibly by down-regulating MCAM/MUC18 gene expression. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as c-KIT, E-cadherin, MMP-2, and p21WAF-1, we propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.

The ability of tumor cells to detach from the primary site and produce metastases in a distant organ is due to the survival and growth of a unique subpopulation of cells with metastatic properties (1Fidler I.J. Kripke M.L. Science. 1977; 197: 893-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 2Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6130-6138PubMed Google Scholar). One tumor cell property that is essential for metastasis is the expression of cell adhesion molecules, which mediate cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix interactions. The cell-surface adhesion molecule MCAM 1The abbreviations used are: MCAM, melanoma cell adhesion molecule; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay; ds, double-stranded; rh, recombinant human. /MUC18 is strongly expressed by advanced primary and metastatic melanomas but is weaker and less frequent in nevus cells (3Lehmann J.M. Holzmann B. Breitbart E.W. Schmiegelow P. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 841-845PubMed Google Scholar, 4Holzmann B. Brocker E.B. Lehmann J.M. Rutter D.J. Sorg C. Reithmuller G. Johnson J.P. J. P. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Approximately 70% of melanoma metastases express this molecule, and among primary tumors, expression increases with increasing vertical thickness, an important predictor of metastatic disease (5Breslow A. Ann. Surg. 1970; 172: 902-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 6Sober A.J. Ruiter Welvaart Ferron Cutaneous Melanoma and Precursor Lesions. Nijhoff, Boston1984: 126-142Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, we have demonstrated that expression of MCAM/MUC18 by human melanoma cell lines correlates with their ability to grow and to produce metastases in nude mice (7Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that MCAM/MUC18 may play a pivotal role in the development of malignant melanoma. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the production of tumorigenic variants from a non-tumorigenic melanoma cell line is accompanied by MCAM/MUC18 up-regulation (8Bani M.R. Rak J. Adachi D. Wiltshire R. Trent J.M. Kerbel R.S. Ben-David Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3075-3086PubMed Google Scholar) and by our recent observation that enforced MCAM expression in primary cutaneous melanoma leads to increased tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (9Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells displayed increased homotypic adhesion, increased attachment to human endothelial cells, decreased ability to adhere to laminin, and increased invasiveness through Matrigel-coated filters due to up-regulation in the expression of MMP-2 (9Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar). The above changes in the function attributed to the expression of MCAM may underlie the contribution of MCAM/MUC18 to the malignant phenotype. MCAM/MUC18 is a member of the immunoglobin superfamily (10Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 9891-9895Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar) that shares homology with gicerin (33% amino and identity), a molecule mediating intercellular adhesion in the developing nervous system (11Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.H. Naomasa M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It contains five immunoglobin-like domains, and its cytoplasmic domain contains several protein kinase recognition motifs, suggesting the involvement of MCAM/MUC18 in cell signaling (12Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbacher U. Reithmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). MCAM/MUC18 can mediate homotypic interaction either through the MCAM antigen (9Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shih I.M. Elder D.E. Speicher D. Johnson J.P. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2514-2520PubMed Google Scholar) or via heterophilic ligand (14Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Jansen B. Markhof E. Int. J.

The mechanisms for up-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 gene expression during melanoma progression are unknown. We have previously reported that overexpression of MCAM/MUC18 in highly metastatic melanoma cells is not due to amplification or to rearrangement of the gene (7Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The promoter of MCAM/MUC18 has been cloned and sequenced (12Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbacher U. Reithmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is a G + C-rich promoter lacking the conventional TATA and CAAT boxes, but strikingly, it contains four putative AP-2-binding elements (12Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbacher U. Reithmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These observations coupled with our previous finding that the vast majority of highly metastatic human melanoma cells do not produce the AP-2 transcription factor (16Bar-Eli M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that MCAM/MUC18 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, and in particular AP-2 regulates MCAM/MUC18 expression in human melanoma cells. AP-2, a 52-kDa protein, was first purified from HeLa cells. Partial peptide sequences led to the isolation of the cDNA from a HeLa cell library (17Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and the gene was mapped to a region on the short arm of chromosome 6 near the HLA locus (18Gaynor R.B. Muchardt C. Xia Y.R. Klisak I. Mohandas T. Sparkes R.S. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1991; 10: 1100-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The AP-2 protein binds to a consensus palindromic core recognition element with the sequence 5′-GCCNNNGGC-3′ (17Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Functional AP-2-binding sites have been identified in the enhancer regions of viral genes such as simian virus 40 (SV40) (20Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (21Nyborg J.K. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8230-8236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cellular genes such as those for murine major histocompatibility complex (H-2Kb), human metallothionein-IIa (huMTIIa), human proenkephalin, human keratin K14, c-ERB-2, plasminogen activator type I (PAI-1), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (22Haslinger A.

The DNA-binding domain is located within the C-terminal half of the 52-kDa protein and consists of two putative amphipatic α-helices separated by an 82-amino acid intervening span that is both necessary and sufficient for homodimer formation (29Williams T. Tjian R. Science. 1991; 251: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). An alternatively spliced AP-2 protein, AP-2B, that differs in its C terminus and acts as dominant-negative to AP-2 has been recently cloned (30Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Yim S.O. Glackshuber R. van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). AP-2 activity is regulated through a number of signal transduction pathways. Phorbol esters and signals that enhance cAMP levels induce AP-2 activity independently of protein synthesis, whereas retinoic acid treatment of teratocarcinoma cell lines result in a transient induction of AP-2 mRNA levels on a transcriptional level (30Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Yim S.O. Glackshuber R. van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Lüscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). AP-2 is involved in mediating programmed gene expression both during embryonic morphogenesis and adult cell differentiation. By usingin situ hybridization, a restricted spatial and temporal expression pattern has been observed during murine embryogenesis. In particular, regulated AP-2 expression was observed in neural crest-derived cell lineages (from which melanocytes are derived) and in facial and limb bud mesenchyme (19Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Two recent reports of AP-2-null mutant mice have demonstrated that AP-2 is important for development of the cranial region and for midline fusions. The AP-2-null mice died at birth (32Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 33Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D. McMahon A.P. Flavell R.A. Williams T. Nature. 1996; 381: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide the first evidence that (i) there is a direct correlation between expression of the AP-2 transcription factor and expression of MCAM/MUC18 in human melanoma cells; (ii) transfection of highly metastatic cells (MCAM-positive and AP-2-negative) with theAP-2 gene resulted in a decrease in endogenous MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression; and (iii) transfection of AP-2 into highly metastatic melanoma cells inhibited their tumor growth and metastatic potential in nude mice, possibly through down-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 expression. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes involved in the progression of human melanoma such as c-KIT, E-cadherin, MMP-2, and p21WAF-1, our results support the hypothesis that loss of AP-2 expression is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma. The A375-P human melanoma cell line was established in culture from a lymph node metastasis of a melanoma patient (34Kozlowski J.M. Hart I.R. Fidler I.J. Hanna N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1984; 72: 913-917PubMed Google Scholar). The highly metastatic derivative A375SM line was established from pooled lung metastases produced by the A375-P cells injected intravenously into nude mice (35Li L. Price J.E. Fan D. Zhang R.D. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The SB-2 cell line was isolated from a primary cutaneous lesion and was a gift of Dr. B. Giovanella (St. Joseph's Hospital Cancer Center, Research Laboratory, Houston, TX). In nude mice, SB-2 cells are poorly tumorigenic and nonmetastatic (7Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar, 36Singh R.K. Gutman M. Reich R. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3669-3674PubMed Google Scholar). The SB-3 cell line was established from a skin metastasis in the same patient 1 year later. SB-3 cells have low metastatic potential in nude mice (7Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The melanoma cell lines were maintained in culture as adherent monolayers in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids,l-glutamine, 2-fold vitamin solution, and penicillin-streptomycin (Flow Laboratories, Rockville, MD) and incubated in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Male athymic nude mice (BALB/c background) were obtained from the Animal Production Area of the NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center (Frederick, MD). The mice were housed in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 8 weeks of age. Animals were maintained in facilities approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and in accordance with current regulations and standards of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Institutes of Health. Their use in these experiments was approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. By using the Lipofectin protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.), we transfected the basic CAT expression vector with minimal thymidine kinase promoter sequences (pCAT-basic), positive control plasmid with SV40 promoter and enhancer (pCAT-control, Promega, Madison, WI), or CAT plasmid driven by the MCAM/MUC18 promoter into SB-2, SB-3, and A375SM cells. One copy of the human MCAM/MUC18 promoter region spanning nucleotides −642 to +26 (12Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbacher U. Reithmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was ligated upstream of the basic CAT expression vector. The MCAM/MUC18 promoter segment was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using primers encompassing both ends of this domain and “sticky ends” ofHindIII and XbaI, respectively, as described previously for the p53 promoter (37Hudson J.M. Frade R. Bar-Eli M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The AP-2 expression plasmids pSG5-AP-2, pSG5-Neo-AP-2, and their control vectors pSG5 and PSG5-Neo were described previously (38Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainksy M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We transfected 3.0 × 106 cells with 2.5 μg of the reporter CAT construct, increasing concentrations of the AP-2 expression vector pSG5-AP-2, and 2.5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid. The β-galactosidase expression vector is controlled by the viral thymidine kinase promoter (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After 48 h, extracts were prepared from all plates, normalized for β-galactosidase activity, and assayed for CAT activity (39Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) as we described previously (40Xie S. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Each assay was repeated at least three times; there was less than 10% variation among individual transfections. The results of the CAT assay were quantified by densitometry (Personal Densitometer, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The AP-2-binding site-luciferase reporter (3XAP-2-Luciferase) was generated by digesting the 3XAP2 CAT-reporter plasmid (30Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Yim S.O.

Tainksy M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) withSacI/HindIII and subcloning the AP-2-binding sequences upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. TheRenilla luciferase reporter gene, which is driven by the β-actin promoter (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), was also used. 2 × 105 melanoma cells were transfected by using the Lipofectin reagent. At 10 h following transfection, the medium was changed to serum-containing complete medium, and the cells were further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to the MCAM/MUC18promoter region of −642 to +26 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product was fractionated on electrophoresed agarose gel and isolated by using the Geneclean Kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). Human recombinant AP-2 protein was purchased from Promega. Anti-AP-2 and anti-CREB antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA) were used in the supershift analyses. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites of CTF/NF1 and Oct1 were purchased from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). AP-2 oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (41Dignam J. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 13: 3415-3423Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent. The extracts were brought to 2 mg/ml, and gel retardation assays were performed using the Stratagene Gelshift kit. Binding reactions were initiated by incubating 5 μl of nuclear extract with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at room temperature. γ-32P-End-labeled double-stranded (ds) DNA was then added (0.1–0.5 ng, 1–4 × 104 cpm), and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. Nonlabeled competitor oligonucleotides, when used, were added at the same time as the labeled oligomers. Approximately 0.7 fmol of end-labeled dsDNA oligonucleotide was allowed to react with 0.525 μg of nuclear protein extract as determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins were allowed to incubate with DNA for 15 min prior to a 20-min room temperature incubation with antibodies. Complexes were resolved on a (29:1) polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 21 °C, 45 m boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) and run at 150 V for 2.0 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Melanoma cells (1.5–2.5 × 107) were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes in 10 ml of complete medium and incubated overnight. The cells were scraped off and washed in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 m EDTA. The cell pellet was lysed in 0.25–0.5 ml of lysis buffer. The soluble protein in the lysates was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the lysates was determined, and the samples were then diluted to 1 mg/ml in the lysis buffer. After boiling, 20 μg of the samples were loaded onto and separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was washed in a blocking buffer and incubated in a 1:5000 dilution of the first antibody (anti-MCAM monoclonal antibody BA3, 18.3 (10Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 9891-9895Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar), or anti-AP-2 followed by treatment with a 1:3000 dilution of the second antibody (anti-mouse immunoglobulin, horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment from donkey). The probed proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative analysis of MCAM expression on cell surfaces was performed using fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cells were scraped from tissue culture plates using a rubber policeman and incubated with anti-MCAM monoclonal antibody 18.4 (BA4; Ref. 10Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 9891-9895Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar) or NMS (control) for 30 min at 4 °C. After repeated washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min. After additional washing, the cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and examined using cytofluorometry. mRNA was extracted from 106–107 cultured cells using the FastTrackTM KIT (Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA). For Northern blot analysis, 2.5 μg of purified mRNA was separated on 1% denaturing formaldehyde/agarose gels, electrotransferred at 0.6 A to GeneScreen nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products), and UV cross-linked with 120,000 μJ/cm2 using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridizations were performed as described previously (42Luca M. Xie S. Gutman M. Huang S. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1399-1402PubMed Google Scholar), and filters were washed three times with 30 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2, sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.1% w/v at 60 °C). The DNA probes used in these analyses were a 1.9-kilobase pair AP-2 cDNA fragment digested with EcoRI from the pNAP2 plasmid (38Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainksy M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and a 1.3-kilobase pair PstI cDNA fragment corresponding to rat glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (43Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyh M. Sabrouty S.E. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Each DNA fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, recovered using Geneclean (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA), and radiolabeled by the random primer technique using [α-32P]deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. 5 × 106 A375SM cells were transfected using 15 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μg of pSG5-Neo-AP-2 expression vector or control pSG5-Neo vector. Transfections were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 10 h following transfection, the medium was changed to serum-containing complete medium, and the cells were then further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were selected after 48 h with standard medium containing G418 500 μg/ml. Fourteen days later, neo-resistant colonies were isolated by trypsinization and established in culture. To prepare tumor cells for inoculation, cells in exponential growth phase were harvested by brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin, 0.2% EDTA solution (w/v). The flask was sharply tapped to dislodge the cells, and supplemented medium was added. The cell suspension was pipetted to produce a single-cell suspension. The cells were washed and resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+- free HBSS to the desired cell concentration. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and only single-cell suspensions of more than 90% viability were used. Subcutaneous tumors were produced by injecting 1 × 106 tumor cells in 0.2 ml of HBSS over the right scapular region. Growth of subcutaneous tumors was monitored by examination of the mice every day and weekly measurement of tumors with calipers. The mice were killed 49 days after injection, and tumors were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. For experimental lung metastasis, 1 × 106 tumor cells in 0.2 ml of HBSS were injected into the lateral tail vein of nude mice. The mice were killed after 60 days, and the lungs were removed, washed in water, and fixed with Bouin's solution for 24 h to facilitate counting of tumor nodules as we described previously (44Radinsky R. Fidler I.J. Price J.E. Esumi N. Tsan R. Petty C.M. Bucana C.D. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1977-1983PubMed Google Scholar). The number of surface tumor nodules was counted under a dissecting microscope. Sections of the lungs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to confirm that the nodules were melanoma and to identify micrometastasis. The significance of the in vitroresults was determined by the Student's t test (two-tailed); the significance of the in vivo metastasis results was determined by the Mann-Whitney test. The cell-surface adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 is associated with tumor progression and the development of metastasis in human melanoma. Indeed, the majority of advanced and metastatic tumors strongly express the MCAM/MUC18 antigen, whereas its expression on thin tumors (<0.75 mm), which have only a low probability of metastasizing, and on benign nevi is weaker and less frequent (3Lehmann J.M. Holzmann B. Breitbart E.W. Schmiegelow P. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 841-845PubMed Google Scholar, 4Holzmann B. Brocker E.B. Lehmann J.M. Rutter D.J. Sorg C. Reithmuller G. Johnson J.P. J. P. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of MCAM/MUC18 by human melanoma cell lines correlates with their ability to grow and produce metastases in nude mice (7Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that transfection of MCAM-negative primary cutaneous melanoma with MCAM cDNA led to increased tumor growth and metastatic potential in nude mice (9Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that MCAM plays a pivotal role in the progression of human melanoma. The mechanism(s) for MCAMup-regulation in metastatic melanoma cells have, however, remained unknown. In an effort to determine the molecular basis forMCAM up-regulation in metastatic cells, we found thatMCAM overexpression is not due to gene amplification or rearrangement (7Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanom"

The overproduction, purification, and characterization of ThiFS and the identification of two of the early steps in the biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamin are described here. ThiS isolated from E. coli thiI+ is post-translationally modified by converting the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine into a thiocarboxylate. ThethiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of the thiocarboxylate because ThiS isolated from athiI− strain does not contain this modification. ThiF catalyzes the adenylation by ATP of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ThiS. This reaction is likely to be involved in the activation of ThiS for sulfur transfer from cysteine or from a cysteine-derived sulfur donor.

This pathway involves the separate synthesis of the thiazole (5-methyl-4-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole phosphate) and the pyrimidine (4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate) moieties, which are then coupled to give thiamin phosphate. The pyrimidine is derived from 5aminoimidazole ribotide (4Himmeldirk K. Sayer B.G. Spenser I.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3581-3589Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Estramareix B. David S.

A five gene operon (thiCEFGH) involved in thiamin biosynthesis has been cloned and characterized (GenBank™ accession number U00006; Ref. 15Vander Horn P.B. Backstrom A.D. Stewart V. Begley T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thiC gene complements pyrimidine (4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine) requiring mutants, thethiFGH genes complement thiazole-requiring mutants, andthiE codes for thiamin phosphate synthase (16Backstrom A.D. McMordie R.A.S. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2351-2352Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An additional gene (thiI) required for thiazole biosynthesis inSalmonella typhimurium has recently been identified (17Webb E. Claas K. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4399-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene maps at 9.5 min on the E. coli chromosome and complements a nuvCmutation. 2C. Kinsland and T. P.

Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This suggests that ThiI may play a role in the sulfur transfer chemistry involved in the thiazole biosynthesis. When the gene product, originally assigned as ThiG, was purified from an overexpression strain, mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing both demonstrated that the protein consisted of two subunits. One of the subunits, which we will call ThiS, has a mass of 7310.74 Da. The second subunit, which will retain the ThiG name, has a mass of 26896.5 Da. 4Kelleher, N. L., Taylor, S.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ThiS was missed in the original reading frame assignment because of errors in both published sequences (15Vander Horn P.B. Backstrom A.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and also because of the difficulty of detecting ThiS, which stains poorly with Coomassie Blue and migrates at the dye front during normal SDS-PAGE 5The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ESI/FTMS, electrospray ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; SWIFT, stored wave form inverse Fourier transform; SORI, sustained off-resonance irradiation; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ThiS-COAMP, C-terminal carboxy adenylated ThiS. 5The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ESI/FTMS, electrospray ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; SWIFT, stored wave form inverse Fourier transform; SORI, sustained off-resonance irradiation; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ThiS-COAMP, C-terminal carboxy adenylated ThiS. analysis. The carboxyl terminus of ThiS has the -Gly-Gly sequence found at the carboxyl terminus of human erythrocyte ubiquitin (GenBank™ accession number 1070588). This sequence similarity was striking because ThiF shows significant sequence similarity to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (GenBank™ accession number 731039) including the ATP-binding site. This suggested that ThiF might catalyze the adenylation of ThiS and that ThiS-COAMP might react with cysteine (or a cysteine-derived sulfur donor) to give ThiS-COSH (Fig. 3). In addition, the dual role of ThiI in thiazole and in 4-thiouridine biosynthesis suggested that ThiI might play a role in this sulfur transfer reaction. In this paper, we describe experiments to test these hypotheses. LB broth was purchased in dehydrated form from Life Technologies, Inc. Tryptose blood agar base was purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI). Ampicillin and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were from Jersey Lab and Glove Supply (Livingston, NJ). Tris, DTT, EDTA, (NH4)2SO4, and ATP were from Sigma. Sodium chloride was from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA). Acetic acid and MeOH were from Aldrich. Acrylamide/Bis (37.5:1) was purchased from Bio-Rad. Dialysis membrane was from Spectrum (Houston, TX). All buffers were prepared from distilled, deionized water and were filtered through Millipore type HA 0.45-μm filters before use. Wizard™ PCR preps were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). BL21(DE3) and the λDE3 Lysogenization kit were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Protein purifications were performed on a Waters 650 chromatography instrument (Milford, MA). Gel filtration column (Superdex 75) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reverse-phase mass spectrometric preparations were on Michrom BioResources (Auburn, CA) reverse-phase peptide traps. Protein concentration was assayed using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent from Pierce. Concentrations were calibrated against a standard curve generated using bovine serum albumin. SDS-PAGE gels were prepared and run using standard methods (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphate assays were conducted using the Enz-Chek pyrophosphate assay kit from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Mass values reported correspond to the most abundant isotopic peak (the difference in 1.0034 Da units from the monoisotopic peak is given in italics following the value). All spectra were calibrated externally using bovine ubiquitin as standard (8564.64 −5). AnuvC E. coli B strain was supplied by Hans Bremer (Dept. of Molecular Cell Biology, University of Texas, Dallas, TX). This strain is equivalent to the original nuvC strain, RYH101, described by Ryalset al. (19Ryals J. Hsu R.Y. Lipsett M.N. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pVJS728, which was able to complement this nuvC mutant, was isolated from an E. coliK-12 HindIII library in pHG165 (23Stewart G.S.A.B. Lubinsky-Mink S. Jackson C.G. Cassel A. Kuhn J. Plasmid. 1986; 15: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). ThethiI456::Km (E. coli K-12) mutation was constructed by inserting a kanamycin cassette into the PstI site of pVJS728. This was back crossed to the E. colichromosome by recombination in the sbcBC strain VJS2889 (24Stewart V. Parales Jr., J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1589-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic crosses were performed via bacteriophage P1kc-mediated transduction (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar). The VJS2890 strain was tested for growth with 5-methyl-4-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole and screened for UV sensitivity (nuvC+ phenotype). VJS2890 was grown in thiamin-limiting defined medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) and then plated as a lawn on defined medium. 1 μl of 100 μm 5-methyl-4-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole was spotted on the plate, and growth around or between the 5-methyl-4-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole spots was determined after overnight incubation at 37 °C. UV sensitivity was determined as described previously by Ryals et al. (19Ryals J. Hsu R.Y. Lipsett M.N. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-specific integration of the λDE3 prophage into the chromosome of the ThiI mutant, VJS2890, was accomplished using the λDE3 lysogenization kit (Novagen). The basal and induced expression levels of T7 RNA polymerase in a representative set of 12 lysogens were tested following the protocol provided with the kit. The lysogen (VJS2890(DE3)) that showed the lowest level of basal expression and a high level of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced expression of T7 RNA polymerase was chosen for use as an overexpression strain. The 3 base pairs immediately upstream of the ThiF start codon on plasmid pVJS716 (15Vander Horn P.B. Backstrom A.D. Stewart V. Begley T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were mutated to insert an NdeI site (CATATG) using PCR. The 5′ primer was 5′-CT GGA AAT TGC AGG AGT TGC ATA TG ATG ACC GTG ACT TTA-3′ and the 3′ primer was 5′-CCA GAT AGC CAC TGG CGG-3′. The desired 1.8-kilobase pair fragment was purified using Wizard™ PCR preps (Promega) and the NdeI/SalI fragment cloned into the corresponding sites on pET-22b (Novagen) to yield plasmid pG201. TheMscI/SalI fragment (549 base pairs) was exchanged with the corresponding DNA from pVJS720 (15Vander Horn P.B. Backstrom A.D. Stewart V. Begley T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A representative plasmid was named pCAC111. The remaining PCR-derived DNA (520 base pairs) was sequenced, and no mutations were observed. Plasmid pCAC111 was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and transformants were selected on tryptose blood agar plates containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml). A single colony of E. coli containing pCAC111 was grown at 37 °C for 12 h in 3 ml of LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml); 1 ml of this starter culture was diluted into 1 liter of the same medium and grown to an A 595 of approximately 0.6. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm, and growth was continued at 37 °C for 12 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g, 30 min) and stored at −70 °C. A frozen cell pellet from 1 liter of cell culture was thawed and resuspended in 25 ml of loading buffer (50 mm Tris, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), treated with lysozyme (5 mg, 40 min, 4 °C), sonicated at 4 °C for 4 min, and centrifuged (27,000 × g, 15 min). The resulting cell free lysate was taken to 20% (NH4)2SO4 saturation at 4 °C by slow addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 and gentle stirring over 45 min. This mixture was centrifuged (27,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatant was taken to 50% (NH4)2SO4 saturation at 4 °C by slow addition of solid (NH4)2SO4with gentle stirring over 45 min. This mixture was centrifuged as before, and the resulting pellet was stored at −70 °C. The 20–50% (NH4)2SO4 pellet was thawed, resuspended in 10 ml of loading buffer, and dialyzed (12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off) for 12 h at 4 °C against 4 liters of loading buffer to exchange out (NH4)2SO4 from the solution. This was then passed through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a Protein-Pak DEAE HR 8-μm 1000 Å column (20 × 100 mm) (Waters). The ThiF/ThiS protein mixture was purified by gradient elution (flow rate was 4 ml/min). The column with bound protein was washed with loading buffer for 10 min and then taken from 0% elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 1m NaCl, pH 7.5) to 30% elution buffer over 70 min. Under these conditions, ThiF and ThiS eluted together at 15% elution buffer, suggesting that ThiS is bound to ThiF. The ThiFS-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, concentrated, exchanged into gel filtration buffer (50 mm Tris, 2 mmDTT, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl) using a YM10 Amicon ultrafiltration membrane, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min, ThiF and ThiS again eluted together after 1.5 h. The ThiFS-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into 50 mm Tris, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5, using a YM10 Amicon ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore). The protein solution was diluted by adding glycerol to 10% and frozen at a final concentration of 16 mg/ml until use. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purification is shown in Fig. 4 A. The purification of ThiFS fromE. coli VJS2890(DE3) (thiI−) was identical to the purification of ThiFS from E. coliBL21(DE3) (thiI+). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purification is shown in Fig. 4 B. Pyrophosphate was assayed using the Enz-Chek pyrophosphate assay kit (27Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The assay volume was 1 ml. The reaction buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5. 75 μl of ThiFS isolated from BL21(DE3) (thiI+) (approximate concentration 16 mg/ml; the molar ratio of ThiF to ThiS was not determined) was added to initiate the reaction. ATP was added to a concentration of 2.5 mm. Assays were run for 1 min. Reaction buffer (50 μl, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5) was added to ThiFS (25 μl of a 16 mg/ml solution) isolated from E. coli VJS2890(DE3) (thiI−) incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then acidified to pH 3 by addition of glacial acetic acid (2 μl). The assay mixture was diluted with water (100 μl) and loaded onto a reverse-phase peptide trap (Michrom BioResources, Inc.). The trap was washed with 1 ml of 98% H2O/1% MeOH/1% acetic acid, and the protein was eluted with 150 μl of 80% methanol/20% acetic acid (the first 50 μl was discarded). 2 μl of this eluent was loaded into a borosilicate glass capillary (1.5 mm inner diameter) pulled to a 2-μm tip at one end (28Wilm M. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (869) Google Scholar). A platinum wire inserted into the distal end of the glass capillary made contact with the solution and a voltage of 0.7–1.4 kV on the wire determined the flow rate (≈25–75 nl/min). Droplets formed by ESI were sampled by the heated metal capillary (≈110 °C) of a 6T Fourier transform mass spectrometer described previously (29Beu S.C. Senko M.W. Quinn J.P. Wampler F.M.I. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30McLafferty F.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 379-386Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, ions are guided through five stages of differential pumping by a skimmer and three quadrupole ion guides into the magnet bore held at 10−9 torr. Ions of interest were isolated in the trapped ion cell by the stored wave form inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) technique (31Marshall A.G. Wang T.C.L. Ricca T.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 7893-7897Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and collisionally activated by sustained off-resonance irradiation (SORI) (32Gauthier J.W. Trautman T.R. Jacobsen D.B. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1991; 246: 211-225Crossref Scopus (648) Google Scholar) in the presence of ≈10−6 torr N2. ThiFS (25 μl, 16 mg/ml), isolated from E. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) was thawed and acidified to pH 3 by the addition of glacial acetic acid (2 μl). The mixture was diluted with water (100 μl) and loaded onto a reverse-phase peptide trap (Michrom BioResources, Inc.). The trap was washed with 1 ml of 98% H2O/1% MeOH/1% acetic acid, and the protein was eluted with 150 μl of 80% methanol/20% acetic acid (the first 50 μl was discarded). 2 μl of this eluent was loaded into a borosilicate glass capillary and electrosprayed as described above. ThiFS isolated fromE. coli VJS2890(DE3) (thiI−) was analyzed in an identical manner. ThiFS (25 μl, 16 mg/ml) isolated from E. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) was thawed, and iodoacetic acid was added (25 μl of a 10 mm solution in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5). This mixture was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C and then acidified to pH 3 by addition of glacial acetic acid (2 μl). The mixture was diluted with water (100 μl) and loaded onto a reverse-phase peptide trap (Michrom BioResources, Inc.). The trap was washed with 1 ml of 98% H2O/1% MeOH/1% acetic acid, and the protein was eluted with 150 μl of 80% methanol/20% acetic acid (the first 50 μl was discarded). 2 μl of this eluent was loaded into a borosilicate glass capillary and electrosprayed as described above. The purification of ThiFS is summarized in Fig. 4. Both of the ThiFS overexpression strains provided high levels of soluble protein. The average yield of purified (>90%) ThiFS was 5 mg/liter of cell culture. ThiF and ThiS copurify through several steps, demonstrating that ThiF and ThiS form a stable complex. ThiS stains poorly with Coomassie Blue and is not visible on the gel. The mass spectra discussed below clearly demonstrate its presence in all ThiFS samples examined. ThiFS catalyzed the formation of pyrophosphate from ATP (Fig. 5). This reaction required Mg2+ as a cofactor. Pyrophosphate production reached a plateau, presumably because of the complete consumption of ThiS, after the formation of approximately 23 nmol pyrophosphate. If the ratio of ThiF:ThiS was 1:1, 35 nmol of pyrophosphate would be expected. This suggests that the ThiF:ThiS stoichiometry is 1:0.66, and that during purification 34% of ThiS dissociates from the ThiF. It was not possible to determine whether ThiF on its own would catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP because overexpression of ThiF in the absence of ThiS gave only inclusion bodies. The overexpression of ThiS using the pET-16B vector was also unsuccessful. The ESI/FTMS of ATP-treated ThiFS isolated from E. coli VJS2890(DE3) (thiI−) is shown in Fig. 6. In addition to showing ions that can be assigned to [ThiS]5+ (m/z = 1463.15), the spectrum shows ions at m/z = 1528.97 that can be assigned to [ThiS-COAMP]5+. ESI/FTMS on ThiFS isolated from E. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) demonstrated that the predominant ThiS ion had an additional mass of 16 Da compared with ThiS isolated from E. coli VJS2890(DE3) (thiI−) (Fig. 7,A and B, respectively). This is consistent with the replacement of one oxygen with sulfur on the protein. The ratio of ThiS to ThiS+16 in the (thiI+) sample was approximately 1:9. SWIFT isolation and SORI activation of the [ThiS+16]6+ ions gave 10 fragment ions; two of these had masses of 7235.64 and 7178.69 and were assigned as b65 and b64 ions (fragments that contain the NH2terminus of the protein) (33Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). These represent the loss of 91 Da (COOH-terminal glycine + 16 Da) and 148 Da (COOH-terminal glycine + 16 Da + internal glycine), respectively, from the COOH terminus of the ThiS+16 adduct and strongly suggested that the COOH-terminal glycine carboxylate of ThiS has been converted to a thiocarboxylate in the (thiI+) strain (Fig. 8).Figure 8ESI/FTMS sequencing of the ThiS+16 adduct. A, fragment ions resulting from SWIFT isolation and SORI activation of [ThiS+16]6+ from ThiFS/BL21(DE3) (thiI+). B, COOH-terminal structure of ThiS+16 protein showing cleavage sites of b64 and b65 ions. The COOH-terminal amino acid fragments leave as neutrals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm this, ThiFS from E. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) was alkylated with iodoacetic acid. Analysis of the reaction mixture by ESI/FTMS demonstrated the formation of a new species with mass of 7384.70−4, corresponding to [ThiS+16-H+CH2COOH] (Fig. 9 A). SWIFT isolation of the 6+ charge state of the sodium adduct at m = 7406.7 (formed in a separate sample ionization), followed by SORI activation gave a series of 5+ fragments (Fig. 9 B). All of these fragments were assigned either as b ions or y ions (fragments that contain the COOH terminus of the protein) (33Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). All of the observed b ions through b63 had a mass identical to that predicted from the unmodified ThiS sequence, and the y62, y63, and y64 ions (sodium adducts) all contained the modified amino acid. This localized the site of modification to the carboxyl-terminal Ala64, Gly65, and Gly66 residues (Fig. 9 C). Because the only functional group in these three residues is the Gly66 carboxylate, ThiS isolated from E. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) must contain a thiocarboxylate at the COOH terminus. The sequence similarity between ThiF/ThiS and the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1/ubiquitin suggested that ThiF might catalyze the adenylation of ThiS and that ThiS might be the sulfur carrier in thiamin biosynthesis. In addition, the dual role of ThiI in both thiazole biosynthesis and in sulfur transfer in 4-thiouridine biosynthesis in tRNA suggested that ThiI may play a role in the sulfur transfer to ThiS. The high level overexpression of soluble ThiFS fromE. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) and fromE. coli VJS2890(DE3) (thiI−) and the partial purification of these proteins (>90%) has made it possible to test these hypotheses (Fig. 3). When ThiFS isolated from E. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) was incubated with ATP, a rapid initial burst of pyrophosphate formation was observed (Fig. 5). The reaction then stops presumably because of the complete conversion of ThiS to ThiS-COAMP. It was possible to directly detect this species using ESI/FTMS (Fig. 6). This demonstrates that ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS on an oxygen nucleophile. Analysis of ThiFS isolated from E. coli BL21(DE3) (thiI+) by ESI/FTMS demonstrated the presence of a ThiS+16 adduct as the major form of isolated ThiS (Fig. 7 A). This could be because of methionine oxidation during isolation or to the replacement of an oxygen by sulfur. Partial sequencing of ThiS+16 (Fig. 8) and the product resulting from alkylation of ThiS+16 by iodoacetate (Fig. 9 A) unambiguously identified the +16 adduct as an oxygen to sulfur replacement and uniquely localized the site of modification to the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue. MS analysis of ThiS isolated from E. coli VJS2890(DE3) (thiI−) demonstrated that the ThiS-COSH was not formed in this strain (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that ThiI plays an essential role in the conversion of ThiS-COAMP to ThiS-COSH. The detection of ThiS-COSH was surprising. None of the previous mechanistic proposals for the formation of the thiazole moiety of thiamin predicted the existence of such an intermediate (1Begley T.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1996; 13: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanistic enzymology of the sulfur transfer chemistry involved in the biosynthesis of thiamin, molybdopterin, biotin, and lipoic acid is still poorly understood. The immediate sulfur source for the formation of biotin and lipoic acid is unknown, and the mechanism of the sulfur insertion chemistry is not yet clear (34Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 35Sanyal I. Gibson K.J. Flint D.H. Arch. Biochem.

Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfur transfer chemistry involved in thiamin and molybdopterin biosynthesis is likely to be similar. A three-enzyme system (MoeB, MoaD, and MoaE) for the sulfur transfer to precursor Z in molybdopterin biosynthesis has been reconstituted (39Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ThiF and MoeB (GenBank™ accession number 127233) show high sequence similarity, and both MoaD (GenBank™ accession number 2507065) and ThiS contain the carboxyl-terminal GG residues and bind sulfur as a thiocarboxylate (20Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the identification of the immediate sulfur donor in thiamin biosynthesis and the development of an overexpression strain yielding milligram quantities of ThiS-COSH, 6Kinsland, C., Taylor, S. V., Kelleher, N. L., McLafferty, F. W., and Begley, T. P. (1998) Protein Sci., in press. it should now be possible to reconstitute the biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety. Efforts along these lines are in progress."
https://openalex.org/W2019757555,"The vitamin D receptor (VDR) forms a heterodimeric complex with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to vitamin D-responsive promoter elements to regulate the transcription of specific genes or gene networks. The precise mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the VDR·RXR heterodimer is not well understood, but it may involve interactions of VDR·RXR with transcriptional coactivator or corepressor proteins. Here, a yeast two-hybrid strategy was used to isolate proteins that selectively interacted with VDR and other nuclear receptors. One cDNA clone designated NCoA-62, encoded a 62,000-Da protein that is highly related to BX42, a Drosophila melanogaster nuclear protein involved in ecdysone-stimulated gene expression. Yeast two-hybrid studies andin vitro protein-protein interaction assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins demonstrated that NCoA-62 formed a direct protein-protein contact with the ligand binding domain of VDR. Coexpression of NCoA-62 in a vitamin D-responsive transient gene expression system augmented 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-activated transcription, but it had little or no effect on basal transcription or gal4-VP16-activated transcription. NCoA-62 also interacted with retinoid receptors, and its expression enhanced retinoic acid-, estrogen-, and glucocorticoid-mediated gene expression. These data indicate that NCoA-62 may be classified into an emerging set of transcriptional coactivator proteins that function to facilitate vitamin D- and other nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional pathways. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) forms a heterodimeric complex with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to vitamin D-responsive promoter elements to regulate the transcription of specific genes or gene networks. The precise mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the VDR·RXR heterodimer is not well understood, but it may involve interactions of VDR·RXR with transcriptional coactivator or corepressor proteins. Here, a yeast two-hybrid strategy was used to isolate proteins that selectively interacted with VDR and other nuclear receptors. One cDNA clone designated NCoA-62, encoded a 62,000-Da protein that is highly related to BX42, a Drosophila melanogaster nuclear protein involved in ecdysone-stimulated gene expression. Yeast two-hybrid studies andin vitro protein-protein interaction assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins demonstrated that NCoA-62 formed a direct protein-protein contact with the ligand binding domain of VDR. Coexpression of NCoA-62 in a vitamin D-responsive transient gene expression system augmented 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-activated transcription, but it had little or no effect on basal transcription or gal4-VP16-activated transcription. NCoA-62 also interacted with retinoid receptors, and its expression enhanced retinoic acid-, estrogen-, and glucocorticoid-mediated gene expression. These data indicate that NCoA-62 may be classified into an emerging set of transcriptional coactivator proteins that function to facilitate vitamin D- and other nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional pathways.

VDR is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors for steroid hormones, and it acts as a ligand-induced transcription factor that binds to specific DNA response elements in the promoter region of vitamin D-responsive genes (1MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Haussler M.R. Semin. Nephrol. 1994; 14: 101-118PubMed Google Scholar, 2Darwish H. DeLuca H.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 89-116PubMed Google Scholar, 3Haussler M.R.

Vitamin D response elements (VDREs) consist of either exact or imperfect direct repeats of the hexonucleotide sequence, GGGTGA, generally separated by a three-nucleotide spacer. High affinity binding of VDR to VDREs requires an additional nuclear factor that is most likely retinoid X receptor (RXR), the nuclear receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid (4Liao J. Ozono K. Sone T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, VDR and RXR heterodimerize to form a complex that binds with high affinity to VDREs, and it is the VDR·RXR heterodimer that may be the functional transcription factor in vitamin D-mediated gene expression. The mechanism that links the heterodimeric receptor complex bound at the DNA response element to the transcriptional complex is not well understood, but it is presumed to involve protein-protein interactions between the heterodimer and other transcriptional coactivator proteins. Recently, a number of putative coactivator and corepressor proteins have been described for several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (7Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). A general property of these transcriptional cofactors is their ability to selectively interact with liganded nuclear receptors and modulate their transcriptional activity. Putative coactivators include steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) (8Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar), receptor-interacting protein 140 (9Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G.

Although the precise mechanism is unclear, these coactivators are proposed to function as bridging proteins that link the receptor complex to RNA-polymerase II and the basal transcription machinery. Alternatively, the CBP and SRC-1 coactivators possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and also interact with histone acetyltransferases, suggesting that they function by altering chromatin structure within hormone-responsive promoters to affect the transcriptional response (16Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 17Jenster G. Spencer T.E.

In the present study, we report the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a 62,000-Da protein that interacts with VDR and several other nuclear receptors. This VDR-interactive protein exhibited striking homology to a Drosophila melanogaster nuclear protein that is implicated in ecdysone-mediated transcription (20Wieland C. Mann S. von Besser H. Saumweber H. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Importantly, expression of this cDNA in mammalian cells strongly augmented vitamin D-, retinoic acid-, estrogen-, and glucocorticoid-activated transcription, but it had little or no effect on basal or gal4-VP16-activated transcription. Based on its interaction with nuclear receptors and its ability to selectively augment nuclear receptor-mediated transcription, this novel protein was designated NCoA-62 (for nuclear receptor coactivator; 62,000 Da). All plasmid constructs used the pAS1 and pGAD-GH yeast expression vectors (21Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 22Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A HeLa cell cDNA library (in pGAD-GH) was cotransformed with pAS1-VDR-(93–427) into the Hf7c strain of yeast as described previously (23MacDonald P.N. Sherman D.R. Dowd D.R. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. DeLisle R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4748-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated onto media deficient in leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 25 mm 3amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase expression using a colony lift filter assay (21Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA obtained from HeLa cells, and a gene-specific primer (GSP1; ATCTTGAACCTTGGAGGC), which is complementary to nucleotides 657–668 in NCoA-62. After first strand cDNA synthesis, the original mRNA template was destroyed with RNase H. Unincorporated dNTPs, GSP1, and proteins were separated from the cDNA using a GlassMAX spin cartridge. An anchor sequence was then added to the 3′-end of the cDNA using TdT and dCTP. PCR amplification was accomplished using Taq DNA polymerase, an anchor primer, and a nested gene-specific primer (GSP2; GGAACCAGGTCAGTGTAT), which is located approximately 360 base pairs into the cDNA. Following amplification, the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product was cloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen, CA). An insert was excised from pCR II with EcoRI andMscI restriction endonucleases. The EcoRI site was from the pCR II vector, and the Msc I site was from the 3′-end of the NCoA-62 PCR product. This fragment was then subcloned into pSG5 (Stratagene, CA) together with NCoA-62 cDNA from theMscI site to the end of the clone in order to generate the full-length NCoA-62 expression vector. The ligand binding domain of human VDR from leucine 116 to serine 427 was inserted into the pGEX-KT expression vector (24Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). GST-VDR was then expressed in the DH5α strain of E. coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (25Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled NCoA-62 was generated using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). GST or GST-VDR was bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and equilibrated with 1× GBB (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors: 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Equivalent volumes of [35S]methionine-labeled, NCoA-62 proteins were incubated with the immobilized GST fusion proteins in 100 μl of 1× GBB for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml with 1× GBB and with 1 ml 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Human NCoA-62 cDNA was subcloned into the pVL-1392 polyhedrin transfer plasmid containing a polyhistidine tag and a protein kinase A consensus site at the N terminus. Recombinant baculovirus was isolated and plaque-purified by standard methods (26Summers M. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vector and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agriculture Experimental Station and Texas A & M University, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). A 50-ml culture of Sf-9 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) was infected for 48 h with the NCoA-62-expressing recombinant baculovirus (multiplicity of infection = 3). Whole cell extracts were prepared, and recombinant NCoA-62 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Whole cell extracts and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified, baculovirus expressed proteins from Sf9 cells or bacterial expressed GST fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a Protran BA-S 85 nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Denaturation and renaturation of the protein blot was performed as described (27Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The renatured blot was incubated in HB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% nonfat dried milk and then in HB buffer containing 1% milk, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and a 32P-labeled VDR probe. The VDR probe was prepared by combining purified, baculovirus-expressed His6 protein kinase A-tagged VDR (300 pmol), 12.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 50 units of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Sigma) in HMK buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at room temperature. The 32P-labeled VDR probe was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and incubated with the membrane at approximately 500,000 cpm/ml in buffer H (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with buffer H, the protein blot was subjected to autoradiography for 3 h at room temperature. The vitamin D-responsive (VDRE)4-TK-GH growth hormone reporter plasmid contains four copies of the rat osteocalcin VDRE upstream of the viral thymidine kinase promoter. The pSG5hVDR expression plasmid was described previously (29Hsieh J.-C. Jurutka P.W. Galligan M.A. Terpening C.M. Haussler C.A. Samuels D.S. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Haussler M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9315-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Full-length NCoA-62 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pSG5 (Stratagene). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped, heat-inactivated serum prior to transfection. COS-7 cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedures as described previously (6MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Carrier DNA (pTZ18u) was added to bring the total DNA content to 10 μg/plate. Following a 16-h incubation, the precipitate was removed with two washes of phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were replenished with fresh media containing 10% charcoal-stripped, heat-inactivated serum. The cells were treated with ligand or vehicle for 24 h, and the amount of secreted growth hormone was determined with an immunoassay kit (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The indicated plasmid pairs were transformed into Hf7c yeast, plated on media lacking leucine and tryptophan, and incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. Triplicate colonies were harvested and cultured overnight in liquid media deficient in leucine and tryptophan. Cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (23MacDonald P.N. Sherman D.R. Dowd D.R. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. DeLisle R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4748-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A multiple tissue Northern blot was obtained from CLONTECHLaboratories. Each lane of the blot contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA purified from several human tissues. Total RNA isolated from rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) and from primary rat osteoblasts obtained from newborn calvaria (30Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N.C. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was subjected to Northern analysis as well. A cDNA probe for NCoA-62 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP in a random primer reaction with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The blots were hybridized with the labeled probe in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH Laboratories) and were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Autoradiographs were scanned, and the images were quantitated using ImageQuant version 3.0 software from Molecular Dynamics. We used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify cDNA clones that code for proteins that interact with the vitamin D receptor (23MacDonald P.N. Sherman D.R. Dowd D.R. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. DeLisle R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4748-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The pAS1-VDR-(93–427) plasmid was used to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library that was constructed in the pGAD-GH plasmid, and positive clones were selected by growth on histidine-deficient media and for the expression of β-galactosidase activity. Specificity controls included testing each clone against pAS1-RAR, pAS1-RXR, pAS1-p53, pAS1-Gα, pAS1-VP16, and pAS1. The growth properties of one clone, designated NCoA-62, are illustrated in Fig. 1. As evidenced by growth on histidine-deficient media in the two-hybrid system, NCoA-62 interacted with the VDR hybrid protein (area 1), the RAR hybrid protein (area 3), and the RXR hybrid protein (area 5). In contrast, no interaction was detected with unrelated bait vectors including the pAS1 parent vector (area 2), AS1-p53 (area 4), or with AS1- Gα (area 6). The NCoA-62 cDNA insert was sequenced and was found to be highly similar to BX42, a nuclear protein from D. melanogaster that is involved in ecdysone-stimulated gene expression (Fig. 2) (20Wieland C. Mann S. von Besser H. Saumweber H. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Other related proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans andSchizosaccharomyces pombe are also illustrated in Fig. 2. The NCoA-62 cDNA insert was 2113 bp. However, based on the BX42 sequence, the original NCoA-62 clone did not contain an obvious initiator methionine with a strong consensus Kozak sequence (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar). Therefore, a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used with mRNA isolated from HeLa cells, and a single product was obtained that contained an additional 30 bp of 5′ sequence, 27 of which constituted a short untranslated region followed by an in frame ATG with a perfect Kozak sequence (data not shown). Thus, the full-length NCoA-62 cDNA is 2146-bp consisting of a noncoding leader sequence of 27 bp, a 1611-bp open reading frame, and 508 bp of 3′-noncoding sequence. The size of this cDNA is consistent with Northern blot analysis of mRNA from HeLa cells, which indicated a single 2.2-kilobase pair transcript for NCoA-62 (data not shown). The tissue distribution of the NCoA-62 transcript was determined by Northern blot analysis using mRNA obtained from eight different human tissues (Fig. 3 A). NCoA-62 exhibited a wide expression pattern, being present in all of the various tissues examined. The NCoA-62 mRNA transcript was also observed in a Northern blot analysis of mRNA obtained from an osteoblast-like cell line, ROS 17/2.8, and in primary osteoblasts obtained from newborn rat calvaria (Fig. 3 B). In rat osteoblasts, the NCoA-62 transcript was a single 2.4-kilobase pair transcript that was not regulated by vitamin D treatment over a 24-h time course (Fig. 3 B). In osteoblasts obtained from newborn calvaria (Fig. 3 B, right panel), osteocalcin transcripts were up-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3in the differentiated and mineralizing osteoblasts as described previously (30Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N.C. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), but there was not an apparent effect on NCoA-62 transcript levels. This broad pattern of expression of NCoA-62 transcripts may reflect the wide tissue distribution observed for the VDR or, since NCoA-62 interacts with other nuclear receptors and may function in those transcriptional pathways as well, the wide expression pattern of NCoA-62 may simply reflect its role in other nuclear receptor pathways.Figure 3Tissue distribution of NCoA-62 mRNA. A, NCoA-62 transcripts in various human tissues. A blot containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from eight different human tissues was obtained fromCLONTECH and was hybridized with a32P-labeled NCoA-62 cDNA probe. Lanes 1–8 contain RNA from pancreas (lane 1), kidney (lane 2), skeletal muscle (lane 3), liver (lane 4), lung (lane 5), placenta (lane 6), brain (lane 7), and heart (lane 8). The blot was stripped of radioactivity and hybridized to a 32P-labeled human β-actin probe using similar conditions. Densitometric analysis revealed that the NCoA-62:actin ratios were 8.4, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.2, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 for pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, lung, placenta, brain, and heart, respectively. B, NCoA-62 transcripts in rat osteosarcoma cells and in normal osteoblasts. Cells were treated in culture with 10−8m1,25-(OH)2D3 for the indicated times (left) or for 24 h (right). A blot containing total RNA (10 μg/lane) isolated from ROS 17/2.8 cells (left) or from primary rat osteoblasts obtained from newborn calvaria in the proliferation (P), differentiation (D), and mineralization (M) stages (right) was hybridized with a 32P-labeled NCoA-62 cDNA probe. The blots were stripped and reprobed with [32P]actin cDNA (left) or32P-labeled osteocalcin cDNA. The various transcripts are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The NCoA-62 cDNA was expressed as a histidine-tagged protein in a baculovirus expression system, and the expressed protein was purified (Fig. 4). The apparentM r by SDS-PAGE analysis was 66,000 (Fig. 4), while the predicted NCoA-62 translation product is 537 amino acids long with a calculated M r of 61,500. Taking into account the additional residues in the His-protein kinase A tag, there is agreement between the apparent M r by SDS-PAGE and the predicted M r of NCoA-62 based on the primary sequence. Moreover, the estimated molecular mass of the untagged NCoA-62 protein produced by in vitrotranscription/translation was approximately 62,000 daltons as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis (see Fig. 6).Figure 6In vitrointeraction of NCoA-62 with VDR. A, far Western analysis. Soluble extracts obtained from uninfected (lane 4), WT-infected (lane 3), and NCoA-62-infected Sf9 cells (lane 2), and 2 μg of purified NCoA-62 protein (lane 1) were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Following a denaturation/renaturation cycle, the blot was probed with 32P-labeled VDR and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, GST pull-down analysis. Increasing amounts of in vitrotranscribed and translated 35S-labeled NCoA-62 (5, 10, or 20 μl) were incubated with either 5 μg of GST (lanes 2–4) or with 5 μg of GST-VDR (lanes 5–7). Protein-protein complexes were washed, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The input lanes represent 10% of the protein in the binding assay. C, 35S-labeled RXR (lanes 3–5) or 35S-labeled NCoA-62 (lanes 6–8) were incubated with either 5 μg of GST (lanes 3and 6) or with 5 μg of GST-VDR in the absence (lanes 5 and 8) or presence (lanes 4 and7) of 10−8m1,25-(OH)2D3. Protein-protein complexes were analyzed as described for B. D, increasing amounts of 35S-labeled NCoA-62, NCoA-62 (R438STOP), or NCoA-62 (R488STOP) were incubated with either GST (lanes 2, 7, and 12, respectively) or with GST-VDR (lanes 3–5, 8–10, and13–15). Protein-protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the regions of VDR that are important for interaction with NCoA-62, several amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of pAS1-VDR were examined in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 5 A). Nuclear receptors are characterized by an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which targets the receptor to specific DNA response elements and a large COOH-terminal domain that binds the hydrophobic ligand. At the extreme COOH-terminal end of the ligand binding domain of these receptors is a conserved motif, designated AF-2, which is crucial for the transactivation function of many nuclear receptors. Indeed, several of the putative coactivators described thus far bind to nuclear receptors, in part, through this AF-2 domain (8Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W.

Comparison of the pAS1-VDR-(3–427) full-length construct and the pAS1-VDR-(116–427) construct clearly demonstrated that the NH2-terminal DNA binding domain of VDR is not required for VDR-NCoA-62 interactions. Furthermore, removal of the AF-2 motif located at the extreme C terminus of VDR (residues 403–427) was not detrimental to the interaction. However, removal of additional residues between 386 and 402 eliminated VDR interaction with NCoA-62. Furthermore, this COOH-terminal domain alone was sufficient to observe modest interaction with NCoA-62. For example, the pAS1-VDR-(373–427) construct, which contains only 55 amino acids from the extreme C terminus of VDR, was capable of interacting with the NCoA-62-GAD fusion in the two-hybrid system. These data strongly suggest a role for the COOH-terminal domain between amino acid residues 373 and 403 of VDR in contacting NCoA-62. A second potential interaction surface may reside between Leu116 and Ser166, since deletion of this domain also ablates VDR·NCoA-62 complex formation. However, this deletion also disrupts ligand binding, RXR interaction, and transcription factor IIB interaction as well as interaction between VDR and a number of other clones isolated in our screen. 2T. A. Baudino, D. M. Kraichely, S. C. Jefcoat, Jr., and P. N. MacDonald, unpublished data. Thus, it is also likely that this deletion alters the proper folding of the remaining ligand binding domain. Similar deletion studies of NCoA-62 are presented in Fig. 5 B. The first 220 amino acids of the N terminus of NCoA-62 appeared to be dispensable for VDR interaction, since NCoA-62-(87–536) and NCoA-62-(220–536) interacted with VDR in a manner similar to full-length NCoA-62. In fact, increased β-galactosidase activity was observed in yeast expressing these mutants compared with wild-type NCoA-62. It is possible that this amino-terminal domain"
https://openalex.org/W2067330753,"We have identified a novel nucleolar protein, Nop5p, that is essential for growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Monoclonal antibodies B47 and 37C12 recognize Nop5p, which has a predicted size of 57 kDa and possesses a KKXrepeat motif at its carboxyl terminus. Truncations that removed the KKX motif were functional and localized to the nucleolus, but conferred slow growth at 37 °C. Nop5p shows significant sequence homology with yeast Sik1p/Nop56p, and putative homologues in archaebacteria, plants, and human. Depletion of Nop5p in aGAL-NOP5 strain lengthened the doubling time about 5-fold, and selectively reduced steady-state levels of 40 S ribosomal subunits and 18 S rRNA relative to levels of free 60 S subunits and 25 S rRNA. Northern blotting and primer extension analyses showed that Nop5p depletion impairs processing of 35 S pre-rRNA at the A0 and A2 cleavage sites. Nop5p is associated with the small nucleolar RNAs U3, snR13, U14, and U18. Depletion of Nop5p caused the nucleolar protein Nop1p (yeast fibrillarin) to be localized to the nucleus and cytosol. Also, 37C12 co-immunoprecipitated Nop1p. These results suggest that Nop5p functions with Nop1p in the execution of early pre-rRNA processing steps that lead to formation of 18 S rRNA.

Most of the steps of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells take place in the nucleolus. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single long 35 S pre-rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase I and processed to 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs through a series of co- and post-transcriptional steps. Ribosomal proteins imported from the cytoplasm are assembled with pre-rRNAs to form the small 40 S subunit and the large 60 S subunit. The 5 S rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III from a separate transcription unit and is incorporated into the large subunit along with the 5.8 S and 25 S rRNAs, while 18 S rRNA is incorporated into the small subunit. During transcription and processing of pre-rRNA, a number of nucleotides are modified, primarily by the addition of 2′-O-methyl groups or by the formation of pseudouridine residues. The processing and modification of pre-rRNAs require non-ribosomal nucleolar proteins, many of which are associated with small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) 1The abbreviations used are: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; ETS, externally transcribed spacer; ITS, internally transcribed spacer; mAb, monoclonal antibody; snoRNP, small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase(s); 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; IP, immunoprecipitation; IF, immunofluorescence. 1The abbreviations used are: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; ETS, externally transcribed spacer; ITS, internally transcribed spacer; mAb, monoclonal antibody; snoRNP, small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase(s); 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; IP, immunoprecipitation; IF, immunofluorescence. in the form of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1Tollervey D.

The earliest processing events are those involved in the removal of the promoter proximal 5′-externally transcribed spacer (5′-ETS). Cleavage occurs at two sites within the 5′-ETS: at A0, in the middle region of the 5′-ETS; and at A1, which results in the formation of the 5′-end of the mature 18 S rRNA (reviewed in Ref. 3Venema J. Tollervey D. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1629-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Formation of 18 S requires processing to form its 3′-end, which involves processing at site A2 in the first internally transcribed spacer (ITS1) followed by processing at site D, which yields the 3′-end (see Fig. 9). In yeast, many gene products are required for, or participate in, cleavage at sites A0, A1, and A2, attesting to the complex nature of this process. The yeast RNase III encoded by RNT1 is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage at the A0 site, and can function in vitro in the absence of other factors (4Abou Elela S. Igel H. Ares M.

These depletion experiments give rise to a similar phenotype: accumulation of 35 S pre-rRNA and reduction of 18 S rRNA levels. However, different underlying mechanisms are responsible for the reduction in 18 S rRNA levels. For example, the C/D box snoRNAs U3 and U14 are required for processing and 2′-O-methylation, and are associated with Nop1p (15Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The H box/ACA snoRNA, snR30, is required for conversion of uridine to pseudouridine and is associated with Gar1p, which has been shown to be involved in pseudouridine formation (16Bousquet-Antonelli C.

Nop1p is an essential and conserved nucleolar protein that is part of the U3 snRNP complex, which is required for early processing steps (9Schimmang T. Tollervey D. Kern H. Frank R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4015-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar,14Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Carmo F.M. Hurt E.C.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The U3 snoRNP complex and the Nop1p homologue fibrillarin have been investigated in a number of different organisms (reviewed in Refs. 22Sollner-Webb B. Tycowski K.T. Steitz J.A. Zimmermann R.A. Dahlberg A.E. Ribosomal RNA: Structure, Evolution, Processing, and Function in Protein Synthesis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 469-490Google Scholar and 23Eichler D.C. Craig N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 49: 197-239Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nop1p is associated with multiple snoRNAs, indicating that it associates with more than one snoRNP complex and is not unique to the U3 snoRNP (9Schimmang T. Tollervey D. Kern H. Frank R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4015-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 14Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Carmo F.M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that Nop1p is multifunctional and participates in different aspects of ribosome biogenesis, including pre-rRNA modification, processing, and ribosome subunit assembly (15Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the essential nucleolar protein Mpp10p is required for processing at sites A0, A1, and A2, and is predominantly associated with U3, indicating that it is a specific U3 snoRNP component (24Dunbar D.A. Wormsley S. Agentis T.M. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5803-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The only other known protein in yeast that is specific for the U3 snoRNP is Sof1p, which plays an essential role in pre-18 S rRNA processing as well (10Jansen R. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2549-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, although the U3 snoRNP is one of the best understood snoRNPs, knowledge of its composition and function remains incomplete. To better understand the function of snoRNPs involved in early pre-rRNA processing steps and 18 S rRNA synthesis, it is necessary to identify and functionally characterize novel snoRNP components, especially those that interact with Nop1p and/or U3. Monoclonal antibodies generated against nucleolar antigens have been useful in this regard, and have allowed us to identify novel nucleolar proteins in yeast. The studies reported herein center on a gene we termNOP5. Our studies show that Nop5p is essential for cell growth, is required for synthesis of the small 40 S subunit, and is involved in processing of pre-18 S rRNA. Genetic depletion of Nop5p impairs cleavage at sites A0 and A2. Nop5p has been conserved during evolution. We present evidence that Nop5p is associated with certain snoRNAs, including U3, and with Nop1p, suggesting that Nop5p functions together with Nop1p in snoRNP complexes required for 18 S rRNA synthesis. TheS. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. Growth of yeast, yeast transformation, sporulation, microdissection, tetrad analysis, and plasmid shuffling, were done according to standard procedures as described previously (25,26Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S. Wu P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For genetic depletion of Nop5p, YPW48 was grown in liquid medium to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.25–0.5), washed with sterile water, and transferred to fresh medium. Rich media (YPD or YPGal) or synthetic media (SD or SGal) plus supplements were prepared according to standard methods (25). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for plasmid preparation (27Sambrook J.

Cloned polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced in their entirety by the DNA Sequencing core facility at the University of Florida. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 37C12 was generated against a nucleolus-enriched fraction (28Dove J.E. Brockenbrough J.S. Aris J.P. Berrios M. Nuclear Structure and Function. 53.

Secondary Cy3-conjugated antimouse antibody or Cy2-conjugated antirabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were diluted 1/200. A yeast cDNA expression library in λgt11 prepared from mid-log yeast (CLONTECH) was screened using standard techniques (25, 27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Positive plaques were purified, and the insert DNA analyzed by direct polymerase chain reaction amplification of λ-phage suspensions using primers flanking the EcoRI site. Eight positives fell into two classes containing overlapping inserts based on insert size and DNA sequence analysis. E. coli strain Y1089 was lysogenized with a λ-isolate from one class, and protein expression was induced and samples prepared for SDS-PAGE as described (28Dove J.E. Brockenbrough J.S. Aris J.P. Berrios M. Nuclear Structure and Function. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 33-46Google Scholar). To replace NOP5 with TRP1, plasmid pPW84 was constructed such that ∼90% of NOP5 between theNsiI and EcoRI sites was replaced with aPstI-EcoRI fragment from pJJ280 (32Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A 1.6-kbBamHI-XhoI nop5::TRP1disruption fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ to form pPW85, and was used to transform YSB25. Trp+ transformants were selected and subjected to Southern analysis. YPW42 and YPW43 are two independent nop5::TRP1 disruption isolates. YPW42 and YPW43 were transformed with plasmid pPW80 (NOP5), and were subjected to tetrad analysis. Thirteen Trp+ and Ura+ spores were isolated and patched onto 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) containing medium and found to be inviable, indicating they require pPW80 to survive. Southern analysis confirmed the presence of the nop5::TRP1disruption and complementing plasmid (data not shown). One of these, YPW45, was used to create YPW48 by exchanging pPW83 for pPW80. Proteins were separated on 10.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and RNAs were separated on 1.0–1.2% glyoxal agarose RNA gels as described previously (26Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S. Wu P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell.

Immunoblots were probed with mAbs B47 or D77 diluted 1/10,000 and detected by ECL according to the manufacturer (Amersham). Equal loading of protein samples was determined by India ink staining of the immunoblot. RNAs were transferred to Hybond nylon membrane according to the manufacturer (Amersham), and probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides or probes against NOP5 or ACT1 mRNA, followed by autoradiography.

Southern blotting was done as described (26Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S. Wu P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) software package was used for quantitative comparison of relative band intensities on films. Ribosomal subunits, monosomes and polysomes from W303–1a and YPW48 grown in YPD at 30 °C were analyzed according to Hong et al. (26Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S. Wu P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Labeling with [methyl-3H]methionine or [3H]uracil was done with cells collected after 0, 4, 8, and 12 h of growth in dextrose-containing media as described previously (26Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S. Wu P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Primer extension was done using as template equivalent amounts of total RNA extracted from W303–1a or YPW48 grown in YPGal and transferred to YPD for 0, 2, 4, 12, or 24 h. The oligonucleotides used are: 12 (see above); 14, TCCAGTTACGAAAATTCTTG; 15, AGCGACTCTCTCCACCG. In this method, the primer that is extended is not radioactively labeled, but rather, [35S]dATP is incorporated into the extension products during a labeling step prior to the extension step (26Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S. Wu P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Yeast were labeled with 0.25 mCi of [35S]methionine per 5 OD600 units of cells as described (33Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and used to prepare a crude nuclear-enriched pellet fraction. A nuclear-enriched fraction was used for these studies because previous experiments indicated that monoclonal antibodies against nuclear antigens (i.e. mAb A66 against Nop1p and mAb 3F2 against Nab2p) immunoprecipitated the predicted protein band with nuclear extracts, but not with whole cell extracts prepared under comparable conditions. 3V. Lamian and J. P. Aris, unpublished results. Labeled yeast cells were washed, pretreated, and digested as described (28Dove J.E. Brockenbrough J.S. Aris J.P. Berrios M. Nuclear Structure and Function. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 33-46Google Scholar) for 30 min with 10 μg of Zymolyase 100T and 10 μl of Glusulase per 5 OD600 units. Spheroplasts were washed with 1.1m sorbitol and lysed with 20% Ficoll 400, 20 mm KPi, pH 6.5, essentially as described (28Dove J.E. Brockenbrough J.S. Aris J.P. Berrios M. Nuclear Structure and Function. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 33-46Google Scholar). The lysate was subjected to low speed centrifugation in an SW50.1 rotor for 6 min at 10,000 rpm at 2 °C, after which the supernatant was loaded onto a precooled 1-ml cushion consisting of 30% Ficoll 400, 20 mm KPi, pH 6.5. Centrifugation in an SW50.1 rotor for 20 min at 22,000 rpm (58,165 × g) at 2 °C yielded a pellet enriched in nuclei. The load zone and cushion volumes were completely removed, and the pellet was quick frozen and stored at −80 °C. The frozen nuclear pellet was thawed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and bath sonicated 3 × 20 s, with intermittent chilling on ice. Preabsorbtion was done with rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Fc-specific, Jackson ImmunoResearch) bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), followed by two pre-clearing centrifugations of 5 min each in a microcentrifuge. Monoclonal antibodies bound to rabbit anti-mouse antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with yeast proteins for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The immunoprecipitates were washed 5 × 2 min at ∼25 °C with IP buffer plus Nonidet P-40, followed by one wash in IP buffer alone. Immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All buffers after the digestion step contained protease inhibitor mixtures (28Dove J.E. Brockenbrough J.S. Aris J.P. Berrios M. Nuclear Structure and Function. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 33-46Google Scholar). For re-immunoprecipitation, two immunoprecipitations were pooled, solubilized with 2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, for 10 min at 85 °C, and treated with 40 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 h on ice. After dilution with 9 volumes of IP buffer plus 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture, the sample was microcentrifuged at top speed for 5 min. The supernatant was used for a second round of IP conducted essentially the same as the first round. For RNA immunoprecipitations, nuclei isolated from BJ2168 using 2 Ficoll step gradients (28Dove J.E. Brockenbrough J.S. Aris J.P. Berrios M. Nuclear Structure and Function. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 33-46Google Scholar) were diluted in 20 mmKPi, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgCl2 (PM buffer), centrifuged, and the pellet resuspended in RNA IP buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixtures, 8 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (Life Technologies, Inc.). To dissolve vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, the buffer was heated to ∼50 °C and tip sonicated for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was dissolved in RNA IP buffer, and tip sonicated 3 × 20 s, with intermittent chilling on ice. The lysate was precleared with rabbit antimouse protein A-Sepharose that had been washed with RNA IP buffer, and immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above using RNA IP buffer. The immunoprecipitate was treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 25 μg of proteinase K in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS containing 10 μg of glycogen, followed by extraction with phenol, phenol:CHCl3, and CHCl3, and precipitation and washing with ethanol. RNAs were 3′-end labeled with RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) using a standard method (34England T.E. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nature. 1978; 275: 560-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), purified, and electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The “total” labeling sample mixture consisted of a portion of the supernatant fraction from the control IP treated, extracted, precipitated, and labeled as described above. Monoclonal antibodies raised against nucleolar antigens were evaluated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Monoclonal antibody 37C12 produced a bright and specific intranuclear IF pattern that substantially overlapped the distribution of the nucleolar protein Nop2p (Fig. 1, A-D). The mAb B47 also gave an IF staining pattern that coincided with the distribution of Nop2p (Fig. 1, E-H). The IF pattern in both cases was offset from the distribution of chromatin in many cells, depending on the orientation of the nucleus, which resulted in the appearance of a crescent shape that is characteristic of the nucleolus in yeast (Fig. 1, arrows). Thus, 37C12 and B47 recognized nucleolar antigens in yeast. To identify the antigen(s) recognized by 37C12, immunoprecipitations were done with 35S-labeled nuclear extracts. 37C12 immunoprecipitated two proteins of approximately 67 and 38 kDa, which were not observed in the absence of primary antibody (Fig. 2). 37C12 immunoprecipitates washed with IP buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 2 m urea, or 0.2% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40 also contained the 67-kDa protein, but with lower relative amounts of the 38-kDa band (data not shown). This suggested that 37C12 recognized a 67-kDa protein in the nuclear fraction. Considering that Nop1p is known to migrate on SDS gels at 38 kDa (30Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that this protein was Nop1p. The immunoprecipitate obtained with 37C12 was solubilized with SDS, diluted with non-ionic detergent, and re-immunoprecipitated with mAb A66, which is specific for Nop1p (30Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A66 quantitatively immunoprecipitated the 38-kDa protein, proving that it is Nop1p (Fig. 2). Monoclonal 37C12 did not immunoblot yeast nuclear protein extracts, despite the use of protocols to renature proteins prior to transfer or after transfer. 4S. Chen and J. P. Aris, unpublished results. On the other hand, B47 was not very effective in protein immunoprecipitation experiments, but produced a specific signal on immunoblots (see Figs. 5 B and 14 B).Figure 14Nop5p depletion affects the localization of the nucleolar protein Nop1p.

Free βγ activates downstream targets, but its action is terminated by association with GDP-liganded α subunits. Because α can inhibit activation of many effectors by βγ, it is likely that the α subunit binding surfaces on βγ overlap the surfaces necessary for effector activation. To test this hypothesis, we mutated residues on β shown to contact α in the recently published crystal structures of the αβγ heterotrimer (Wall, M. A., Coleman, D. E., Lee, E., Iniguez-Lluhi, J. A., Posner, B. A., Gilman, A. G., and Sprang, S. R. (1995) Cell83, 1047–1058; Lambright, D. G., Sondek, J., Bohm, A., Skiba, N. P., Hamm, H. E., and Sigler, P. B. (1996) Nature379, 311–319.). The α subunit binds to the flat, top surface of the toroidal β subunit and also extends a helix along the side of the β subunit at blade 1. We mutated four residues on the top surface of β (Hβ1[L117A], Hβ1[D228R], Hβ1[D246S], and Hβ1[W332A]) and two residues on the side of β that contacts α (Hβ1[N88A/K89A]). Each of the mutant proteins was able to form βγ dimers, but they differed in their ability to bind α and to activate phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2), PLCβ3, and adenylyl cyclase II. Mutation of residues along the side of the torus at blade 1 diminish affinity for α but do not prevent activation of any of the effectors. Mutations on the α binding surface differentially affected PLCβ2, PLCβ3, and adenylyl cyclase II. Residues that affect PLCβ and adenylyl cyclase II activity are found on opposite sides of the central tunnel, suggesting that PLC and adenylyl cyclase, like the α subunit, make many contacts on the top surface. None of the mutations affected the ability of βγ to inhibit adenylyl cyclase I. We conclude that α, PLCβ2, PLCβ3, and adenylyl cyclase II share an interaction on the top surface of β. The importance of individual residues is different for α binding and for effector activation and differs even between closely related isoforms of the same effector.

The importance of individual residues is different for α binding and for effector activation and differs even between closely related isoforms of the same effector. Heterotrimeric G proteins composed of α and βγ subunits forward signals from transmembrane receptors to intracellular effector enzymes and ion channels. Activation of the G protein through the receptor causes dissociation of α from βγ. Each of the subunits is then able to regulate downstream targets. All known effectors are regulated only by the dissociated α or βγ subunits and not by the αβγ heterotrimer. When GTP bound to α is cleaved to GDP, the subunits reassociate. Reassociation with βγ is not obligatory for deactivation of α because the conformational change in α that accompanies hydrolysis of GTP to GDP contributes to the termination of α signaling (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). There are at least two potential explanations for the universal finding that formation of the αβγ heterotrimer turns off any signal transmitted through βγ. First, there may be a major conformational change in βγ induced by binding to α. Second, all effectors may share a part of the α binding site on βγ, so that the inhibition of effector activation by α would be primarily steric. The recent publication of the crystal structure of the αβγ heterotrimer (2Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) suggests that the latter explanation is correct. The structure seems to be quite rigid, and no major conformational differences were seen between the βγ subunit in a αβγ heterotrimer versus the free β subunit. These observations suggest that a place to look for effector contact sites is on a surface of βγ that interacts with α. The β subunit consists of a symmetrical seven-bladed propeller structure with four kinds of surfaces: the flat surface at the narrow end that we call the “top,” the flat surface at the wide end (the “bottom”), the outer surface of the torus, and the surface that lines the tunnel through the middle of the molecule (Fig. 1). The α subunit contacts β in two of these regions. The first α/β interface is between the amino-terminal helix of α and the first blade of the β propeller. The amino terminus of α has long been known to be important for the formation of heterotrimers (5Fung B.K.-K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Winslow J.W. Van Amsterdam J.K.R. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the crystal structure beautifully reveals why this is so. The major points of contact along this interface include residue Lys89 that contacts residues Leu15 and Leu19 on α (2Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 3Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The second interface between α and βγ is made up of residues on the top surface of the β torus. These residues that contact α are located in turns between the short β strands that make up the blades of the propeller. In order to test the hypothesis that residues in the β subunit that are important for interaction with α may overlap with residues important for activation of effectors, we have analyzed the consequences of mutating residues on the surface of β that interacts with the switch II region of α and residues on the sides of blade 1 of β that contact the amino terminus of the α subunit. The positions of the mutated residues are shown in Fig. 1. We compared the ability of the mutants to activate two isoforms of phospholipase Cβ and to regulate two isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. The function of βγ subunits containing these mutations were analyzed in three different expression systems: in vitro translation, transient expression in COS-7 cells, and in vitroreconstitution with proteins purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. None of the mutations interfered with the ability of β subunits to form βγ dimers. As expected, some, but not all, mutations affected the ability of mutant βγ dimers to interact with α. Most importantly, the results show that the α contact surface on the flat, narrow end of the propeller is important for effector activation. Moreover, the mutations did not have equal consequences for the effectors tested, nor even between closely related subtypes of the same effector. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was done with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol using 6–7 μg of LipofectAMINE/ml of culture medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 h or overnight. The medium containing LipofectAMINE was removed, and cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% fetal bovine serum. Site-directed mutagenesis was done in the pAlter vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA of the β1subunit was cloned into pAlter vector as described (8Thomas T.C. Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10295-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Garcia-Higuera I. Thomas T.C. Yi F. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

To facilitate the transfer of mutants among different vectors, a silent mutation corresponding to amino acids 144 and 145 was introduced into β1 to create a uniqueKpnI site.

An annealed double-stranded DNA encoding the first methionine and six histidines was synthesized and ligated between this newHindIII site and the EcoRI site from the pAlter vector. The amino acid sequence added to the amino-terminally His-tagged β1 subunit is MSHHHHHHGSLLQ. For expression in COS-7 cells, the EcoRV-KpnI fragment of Hβ1 was transferred to the pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) β1 vector using the blunted HindIII and theKpnI sites. The H6β1 in pAlter was used as a template for the creation of the mutated subunit N88A/K89A (AACAAG/GCCGCG); L117A (CTG/GCG); D228R (GAG/AGA); D246S (GAC/AGC); and W322A (TGG/GCG). The mutation of H6β1 was confirmed by double-stranded sequencing. The mutated part of the β1subunit was transferred into pCDNA3 containing H6β1, using the HindIII and KpnI sites, orKpnI and BamHI as appropriate. PLCβ3 (obtained from S. G. Rhee) was transferred to the pCDNA3 vector between the EcoRV and XhoI sites. The EcoRV site was abolished. PLCβ2 was used in the pMT2 vector as obtained from M. Simon. The construction of HAγ2 (γ2 tagged at the amino terminus with hemagglutinin epitope) was described in Ref. 10Mende U. Schmidt C.J. Yi F. Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells (1.5–3 × 105/well) in six-well plates were transfected with 1.8 μg of DNA and 10 μg of LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) per well. Forty to 48 h after transfection, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-deficient RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min and then labeled with 100 μCi/ml Trans[35S]-Label (ICN) for 3 h. Labeled cells were lysed at 4 °C in 0.7 ml of HMSDET buffer. All further steps were at 4 °C. The lysates were incubated with 10–15 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose for 20–30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated 1 h or overnight with 0.5–2 μl of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Babco) against the hemagglutinin epitope on the γ2 subunit and then incubated with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% v/v) for 30 min and centrifuged for 30 s. The pellets were washed twice with HMSDET and once with phosphate-buffered saline and then buffer for ADP-ribosylation (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTT). ADP-ribosylation was carried out in a 40-μl volume containing 1 mm ATP, 1 mm NADP, 10 μm NAD, 100 μm GTP, 7.5 mm thymidine, 60 mmTris, pH 7.6, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mmEDTA, 6 mm DTT, 0.5 μCi [32P]NAD, and 0.25 μg of activated pertussis toxin. The reaction proceeded at 37 °C for 30 min. The final products were analyzed by 11% SDS-PAGE. For exposure of the 32P signal without a contribution from35S, a piece of black film was placed between the gel and the film to be exposed.

COS-7 cells (0.5–1.5 × 105/well) in 12-well plates were transfected with PLCβ2 (pMT2 vector) or PLCβ3 (pcDNA3) and wild-type β1, histidine-tagged β1(Hβ1), or histidine-tagged β1 mutants. A mixture of 0.8–0.9 μg of DNA and 3.5 μg of LipofectAMINE in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the cells. The day after transfection, cells were incubated with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol in inositol-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4% fetal bovine serum. Fifteen min later, LiCl2 (final concentration, 10 μm) was added to each well, and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cells were extracted twice with 0.5 ml of 20 mm formic acid. The extracts were combined, neutralized to pH 7.5 with 30 mm ammonium hydroxide, and loaded on 0.5 ml AG1-X8 anion exchange columns. Prior to use, the columns were washed with 2 ml of 1 m NaOH and 2 ml of 1 m formic acid and equilibrated with water to neutrality. The columns were washed with 10 bed volumes of water and 10 bed volumes of 5 mmborax and 60 mm sodium formate. The inositol phosphates were eluted with 10 bed volumes of 1 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid. A 2-ml aliquot of the eluates was counted in a scintillation counter. All subunits were transcribed and translated using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Typically, 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine were used in a 50-μl reaction. In all cases, transcription was directed by the T7 promoter. Synthesis of the desired product was routinely verified by running 5 μl of the translation mixture in a small 11 or 13% polyacrylamide gel (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography with overnight exposure. Independently translated β and γ subunits were mixed together and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min to allow dimer formation. Because γ translation was usually more efficient, 10–15 μl of γ translation mixture was typically added to 50 μl of β translation mixture. Fifty μl of the βγ mixture was passed over an 8 ml AcA 34 column (Sepracor) equilibrated with HMSE plus 0.05% Lubrol PX at 4 °C in order to remove DTT and to separate the βγ dimers from undimerized β. The fractions containing βγ were concentrated 5–10-fold using a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon).

After 40 min at 4 °C, DTT (20 mm) and/or Laemmli sample buffer containing 15% β-mercaptoethanol was added, and the samples were boiled and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 9% polyacrylamide gels (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Dried gels were soaked in Enhance and then used for autoradiography. The radioactive bands could be visualized after 2–7 days of exposure at −70 °C. Sf9 cells were cultured in suspension in IPL-41 medium containing 1% Pluronic F68, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 27 °C with constant shaking (125 rpm). To generate recombinant β1 mutant viruses, the mutated β1 cDNAs (K89A, L117A, D228R, D246S, and W332A) were subcloned into pVL 1392 transfer vector, and the resulting plasmids were cotransfected into Sf9 cells with BacPac6 viral DNA linearized with Bsu361 (CLONTECH) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two viruses, one with and one without His6 tag, were generated for [L117A], [D228R], or [W332A], and the one that gave higher protein expression was used for subsequent studies. The β1[D228R] and β1[D246S] mutants were used with a hexahistidine (His6) tag at the amino terminus; the other mutants were used without a tag. Recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and amplified as described (15Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Mannual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, 1987Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding β1, γ2, and His-6-γ2 have been described previously (16Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D.

Sf9 cells (1 liter; 1.5 × 106cells/ml) were coinfected with amplified recombinant baculoviruses encoding β1 (K89A, L117A, and W332A) and His6-γ2 or His6-β1(D246S and D228R) and γ2. Cells were harvested after 48–66 h, and membranes were prepared as described (17Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Sodium cholate was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was stirred on ice for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 40 min. The supernatant was diluted 3-fold with Buffer A (20 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% polyoxethylene 10-lauryl ether) and loaded onto a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column (0.5 ml) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 5 ml of Buffer A containing 400 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole and 5 ml of Buffer B (20 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.3% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 10 mm imidazole). Recombinant βγ was eluted with 2 ml of Buffer B containing 1% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside and 150 mm imidazole. The eluate was concentrated and exchanged into 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside with a Centricon-30 (Amicon). Because of low expression, the eluate from the Ni-NTA column containing β1 (W332A) was further purified over Mono Q 5/5 by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 1% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside with a gradient (0–400 mm) of NaCl. The peak fractions were combined and processed as above. The capacity to support ADP-ribosylation of αi1by pertussis toxin was performed as described (18Casey P.J. Pang I.-H. Gilman A.G.

Sternweis (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Protein was measured as described in Ref. 20Schaffner W. Weisman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar. Phospholipase C activity was measured using sonicated micelles containing 50 μm phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, 500 μm phosphatidylethanolamine, and inositol-[2-3H] phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (NEN Life Science Products) (2,500 cpm/assay) in a solution containing 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.42 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 42 mm NaCl, 47 mm KCl, 4 μm GDP, 0.125 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, and 0.375% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside with 0.1 nmPLC-β2 and the indicated amount of βγ. The mixture (60 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 8 min, and the amount of IP3 generated was quantitated as described (21Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure adenylyl cyclase activity, purified βγ mutants were reconstituted with 10 μg of membranes from Sf9 cells expressing type I or type II adenylyl cyclase for 3 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 20 μl. Assays were then performed as described (22Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 7 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 50 μl containing 4 mm MgCl2 and 0.2% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. The presence of the hexahistidine tag at the amino terminus of either β1 or γ2 did not affect any of the enzymatic assays (data not shown). To evaluate the relationship between surfaces of β that bind α and that activate PLCβ, we mutated four residues on the flat, top surface of β and two residues on the side of blade 1 (see Fig. 1). The mutations were introduced into the background of rat β1 tagged at the amino terminus with six additional histidine residues. Addition of the hexahistidine tag was extremely important for assays in COS-7 cells because the size difference between Hβ1 and wild-type β1 allowed us to discriminate transfected, mutated β subunits from endogenous β subunits. We could detect no differences in these assays between the hexahistidine β1(Hβ1) and wild-type β1 (see below). Before we could assess the ability of mutated β subunits to activate PLC, it was essential to establish that they could form dimers. We expected that some, but not all, mutations would also affect the ability of βγ to form heterotrimers with α. To evaluate these two issues, transfected COS-7 cells were labeled with Trans[35S]-Label and Hβ1 or the mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated through cotransfected HAγ2 (10Mende U. Schmidt C.J. Yi F. Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15892-15898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because we immunoprecipitated through one subunit (HAγ2) but measure the other, this assay measured only the amount of βγ dimers that accumulate, and not the total synthesis of β. When HAγ2 is transfected, it dimerizes with both wild-type endogenous β and transfected Hβ1subunits. Therefore, both types of β subunits were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HAγ2 antibody, but the two can be readily distinguished by their mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). We also used immunoprecipitation to measure the ability of mutant Hβ1γ2 dimers to associate with transfected αi2. Cotransfection of αi2 had no reproducible effect on the amount of βγ dimer formed. Because antibody to HAγ2 precipitates both endogenous and transfected βγ, it was essential to be able to subtract the amount of αi2 coprecipitating with a dimer containing endogenous β and HAγ2 from the amount coprecipitating with a dimer of transfected Hβ1 mutants and HAγ2. The amount of α coprecipitated with endogenous β was determined from the lysates of cells transfected with HAγ2, αi2, and vector but no additional β. From the relative density of the α and the β bands (taking into account the number of methionine and cysteine residues), we calculated that 0.6–0.8 mol of α were precipitated per mol of endogenous β. 2In principle, it would be possible to immunoprecipitate α through HA-tagged β assembled with untagged γ2. However, one would then immunoprecipitate both dimerized and undimerized βγ, so the results would be very difficult to interpret. To determine whether the αi2 immunoprecipitating with Hβ1HAγ2 dimers was associating correctly, we measured the ability of coimmunoprecipitated α to be [32P]ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. Although only the α subunit is ADP-ribosylated, the substrate for the toxin is the αβγ heterotrimer (14Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternate lanes in the top panel of Fig. 2 show 35S label only or 35S + 32P. The bottom panel shows 32P only. These experiments are quantitated and summarized in Fig. 2 B and Table I. The results show that mutation Hβ1[W332A] has little effect on the ability of βγ to interact with α, but each of the other mutations diminishes coimmunoprecipitation of α through βγ. For each mutant, the results were the same whether we measured the amount of α by 35S or by ADP-ribosylation. This correlation suggests that there are no dramatic differences in the ability of mutant βγ to support ADP-ribosylation of α once a complex has formed.Table IEffect of mutations in Hβ1 on coimmunoprecipitation of αi2 and activation of PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 in COS-7 cellsMutation% of Hβ1aThe values given were the mean ± S.D. for at least three independent experiments for each mutant.Immunoprecipitation of αi2bThe amount of αi2 immunoprecipitated was quantitated by densitometry of the 35S autoradiogram for three separate experiments.

Open table in a new tab Another way to assess the interaction of mutant βγ dimers with α is chemically to cross-link mutant βγ dimers to α using the cysteine-specific reagent, BMH. We have previously shown that this reagent specifically cross-links cysteine 215 of αoeither to cysteine 204 or cysteine 271 of β, giving two cross-linked products (8Thomas T.C. Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10295-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Garcia-Higuera I. Thomas T.C. Yi F. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the wild-type βγ, the two cross-linked products are formed approximately equally (Fig. 3). From the crystal structure, we know that the distance between the residues on αo and on β is very close to that of the fully extended cross-linking reagent. The ability of the reagent to reach to one or the other of the cysteines on β depends on a correct orientation of α with respect to β. The βγ formed from one of the mutants on the top surface of β (Hβ1[D246S]) gave the same two cross-linked products as wild-type in the same ratio. In βγ containing each of three other mutants, the ratio of cross-linked products was different. The upper band produced by cross-linking α Cys215 to β Cys204 was decreased in βγ dimers containing Hβ1[W332A] and Hβ1[L117A]. In Hβ1[D228R], the lower band (produced by cross-linking α Cys215 to β Cys271) was missing. Mutating the two residues that contact the amino-terminal α helix of α (Hβ1[N88A/K89A]) greatly diminished the affinity of βγ for α. Indeed, βγ containing this mutation produced barely detectable cross-linked products, although both bands were faintly visible. The cross-linking reaction is an irreversible reaction and is therefore"

This protein has all the features of a Class II secreted inhibitory cystatin but contains lysine residues in the normally hydrophobic binding regions. As determined by cDNA library Southern blots, this cystatin is expressed selectively in hematopoietic cells, although fine details of the distribution among these cell types differ between the human and mouse mRNAs. In addition, we have determined the genomic organization of mouse leukocystatin, and we found that in contrast to most cystatins, the leukocystatin gene contains three introns. The recombinant proteins corresponding to these cystatins were expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase or FLAG™ fusions, and studies showed that they inhibited papain and cathepsin L but with affinities lower than other cystatins. The unique features of leukocystatin suggests that this cystatin plays a role in immune regulation through inhibition of a unique target in the hematopoietic system.

The unique features of leukocystatin suggests that this cystatin plays a role in immune regulation through inhibition of a unique target in the hematopoietic system. Cysteine proteases play many very important roles in the immune system. For instance, the de-ubiquinating enzymes are cysteine proteases, whereas lysosomal proteases are involved in antigen presentation both through the degradation of proteins to antigenic peptides and by processing the invariant chain of class II major histocompatibility complexes (1Riese R.J. Wolf P.R. Bromme D. Natkin L.R. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, the overexpression of these proteases can be detrimental to cells, as can their release into the extracellular space. Therefore, their activities in these cells are controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including the presence of macromolecular protease inhibitors.The cystatins make up a class of very tight, reversible, competitive inhibitors of the papain family of cysteine proteases. Cystatins have been divided into four classes based upon their sequences and properties. Class I, also called the stefins, are a group of intracellular proteins of approximately 100 residues that contain no disulfide bonds. Class II cystatins are secreted inhibitors of about 120 amino acids containing two disulfide bonds. Class III cystatins, known as the kininogens, contain three domains, each of which resembles Class II cystatins; two of these domains possess inhibitory activity. Finally, Class IV cystatins constitute a poorly understood group of glycoproteins with two nonfunctional cystatin domains. The amino acid sequences and genomic structures within each family are highly conserved. Cystatins are expressed throughout the body in a tissue-specific manner. Mutations in some cystatins or alterations in the balance of these with their cognate cysteine proteases have been implicated in several diseases (2Calkins C.C. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar, 3Henskens Y.M. Veerman E.C. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 71-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies, involving changes of peptide sequence, have shown that three regions of the cystatin, which form a “wedge” that can associate with the active-site cleft, are all required for tight binding to the protease. These studies have been confirmed by the crystal structure of the cystatin B-papain complex (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and supported by other structural studies showing that chicken egg white cystatin, a Class II cystatin, has the same fold as the Class I cystatin B (5Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 6Dieckmann T. Mitschang L. Hofmann M. Kos J. Turk V. Auerswald E.A. Jaenicke R. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In this paper, we describe the characterization of a new Class II cystatin, leukocystatin, specifically expressed by hematopoietic cells. The unique features of the amino acid sequence suggest that the as yet unidentified target protease is not one of the commonly studied lysosomal cysteine proteases, although leukocystatin is an active inhibitor of these cathepsins. In addition, the unusual genomic structure of the mouse protein and the amino acid sequences of both the human and mouse inhibitors suggest that they are quite divergent from other Class II cystatins.DISCUSSIONWe have discovered a novel hematopoietic cell-specific Class II cystatin from an EST analysis of human dendritic cells. This protein, which we have called leukocystatin, has all the features of a Class II cystatin, but it has some notable characteristics. For example, leukocystatin contains lysine residues at two positions that are strictly hydrophobic (residue 35) and small, noncharged (residue 84) amino acids in all other characterized cystatins. Position 35 is thought to bind to the P3 site of the target protease (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 5Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), so it is possible that this lysine substitution results in an especially high affinity for a cysteine protease with this preferred specificity. Because residues 81–85 in other cystatins usually form nonspecific hydrophobic interactions with the cognate protease (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), it is likely that the contacts formed by this region may also differ from those observed previously. Supporting this, computer modeling has shown that Lys84 would interfere with binding of leukocystatin to papain in this region (see below).Leukocystatin contains a total of eight cysteines: the four that are conserved with other Class II cystatins, and four unique cysteines, two of which are in the leader region (Fig. 3). Conserved cysteine residues in the N-terminal portion are not seen in any other mature Class II cystatin molecule, although they do occur sporadically in other cystatin leader sequences. Two cysteine residues, in positions different from leukocystatin, also appear in the N-terminal region of each inhibitory kininogen domain, and a polymorphism in the cystatin D sequence introduces a cysteine in this area (18Freije J.P. Balbin M. Abrahamson M. Velasco G. Dalboge H. Grubb A. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15737-15744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Balbin M. Hall A. Grubb A. Mason R.W. Lopez-Otin C. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23156-23162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the two additional leukocystatin cysteines in the putative mature protein form an intrachain disulfide and provide added stability. This, however, is not supported by the evidence. Participation of Cys63 in an intrachain disulfide could only occur if the leukocystatin structure is markedly different from chicken egg white cystatin or if the N terminus folds back because the structure of chicken egg white cystatin shows the amino acid corresponding to Cys63 at the end of an α-helix, 34 Å from the N terminus. This places it far from the other leukocystatin cysteines. Furthermore, nonreduced gels indicate that the long form, which contains Cys26, can dimerize (Fig. 8), whereas no evidence of dimerization exists for the short form, which contains Cys63 but not Cys26. Because only monomer is seen in reducing gels, this interaction is apparently mediated by an interchain disulfide, formed by Cys26 from two different molecules. This may be similar to the case of stefin B, a Class I cystatin, which has a cysteine at position 3 that is thought to mediate dimerization (24Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar).The mouse leukocystatin gene contains four exons (Fig. 4), unlike most other members of the Class II cystatins, which have three (25Saitoh E. Isemura S. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Soyacystatin is the only known molecule containing one cystatin domain and having a gene encoding four exons. The additional exon in that case, however, lies in a unique C-terminal extension (26Misaka T. Kuroda M. Iwabuchi K. Abe K. Arai S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because the amino acids encoded by the first two exons of leukocystatin are very different from other Class II cystatins, it is clear that the evolution of this region is very different from other family members. The C-terminal genomic organization, however, is similar to the other Class II cystatins, with the intron/exon boundaries being conserved. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of leukocystatin is not similar to Class I cystatins: the Class I genomic organization is different, with the first intron lying at a position between the first and second leukocystatin introns and with the second lying between the second and third leukocystatin introns (27Pennacchio L.A. Myers R.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Sato N. Ishidoh K. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Gene. 1992; 114: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Several forms of leukocystatin were produced in E. coli and were active cysteine protease inhibitors. Although some of these products require refolding, the FLAG-tagged material was soluble, similar to other Class II members expressed in E. coli, including those used for comparison in Table II (16Auerswald E.A. Genenger G. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. Engh R.A. Fritz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Hall A. Hakansson K. Mason R.W. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5115-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although the Class I cystatin A requires refolding following overexpression inE. coli, this was shown to have no adverse effect on activity (21Shibuya K. Kaji H. Itoh T. Ohyama Y. Tsujikami A. Tate S. Takeda A. Kumagai I. Hirao I. Miura K. Inagaki F. Samejima T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12185-12192Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Shibuya K. Kaji H. Ohyama Y. Tate S. Kainosho M. Inagaki F. Samejima T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We further controlled for any effects that refolding may have on activity by examining denatured/renatured chicken egg white cystatin and found no difference in activity following this step.We determined the apparent K i values of leukocystatin with papain and cathepsin L. These are compared in TableII with published values for other Class II cystatins.K i values in the literature vary for the same cystatin-protease pair, probably due to the differing lengths of the N termini in various cystatin preparations; these residues are easily proteolyzed during isolation of native cystatins. In general, the affinity of cystatins for cathepsin B is much weaker than the binding to cathepsin L or papain, a trend that holds for the leukocystatins as well. In fact, no inhibition of cathepsin B was detected, although a reasonable apparent K i was found for chicken egg white cystatin. One possible explanation for the weaker association of leukocystatin to all examined proteases is the presence of lysine residues at positions 35 and 84, which replaces amino acids that are uncharged in every other known cystatin. Both residues are also known to be intimately involved in the binding process of these inhibitors to cysteine proteases (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and N-terminal truncation or substitution at either of these sites can lead to dramatic decreases in the ability of these cystatins to inhibit cysteine protease activity. For instance, some substitutions in the Gln81-Gly85 loop have been shown to be detrimental to binding, although position 84 was not itself modified in these studies (16Auerswald E.A. Genenger G. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. Engh R.A. Fritz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Modeling of a lysine at position 84, based upon the known complexed structure of stefin B to papain (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), indicated that this substitution would cause serious steric interactions at this interface in addition to penalties resulting from desolvation and burying the positive charge of the lysine side chain (data not shown). Furthermore, it has been shown that the residues preceding the conserved glycine 37 are important for binding because removal of these can reduce binding drastically (29Machleidt W. Thiele U. Laber B. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Esterl A. Wiegand G. Kos J. Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Lindahl P. Abrahamson M. Bjork I.

Biochem J. 1994; 299: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), in some cases largely due to slower association rates. For the leukocystatins, we have observed that the time to reach equilibrium is rather slow, taking several minutes. In our case, this may indicate a necessary conformational change in the protease and/or leukocystatin for binding to occur. Furthermore, Hall et al. (17Hall A. Hakansson K. Mason R.W. Grubb A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5115-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) postulate that the residue at position 35 may be a primary determinant of protease specificity because these N-terminal residues associate with the protease binding sites (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 5Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Lindahl et al. (32Lindahl P. Ripoll D. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4384-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that an arginine substitution in cystatin C at the position equivalent to Pro36 can have a large impact on binding to cathepsin B or to papain and may even cause displacement of the N terminus from the protease (32Lindahl P. Ripoll D. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4384-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although that position is probably more critical to tight binding to the cognate protease than the residue at 35, it demonstrates that changes in the amino acids at these positions can greatly affect the ability of cystatins to inhibit cysteine proteases. It is therefore likely that the native binding partner of leukocystatin is unlike that of the examined proteases. It is possible that the target is some as yet unidentified lysosomal protease, or even a protease from a different family. For instance, the ubiquitin-hydrolase UCH-L3 has recently been shown by x-ray crystallography to have a papain-like fold, being particularly similar to cathepsin B in the active-site cleft (33Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and so may very well be inhibited by cystatins, although no evidence of this is yet in the literature. Particularly intriguing is the fact that this isozyme is primarily found in hematopoietic cells (34Wilkinson K.D. Lee K.M. Deshpande S. Duerksen-Hughes P. Boss J.M. Pohl J. Science. 1989; 246: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 35Wilkinson K.D. Deshpande S. Larsen C.N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and is specific for the RGG sequence of ubiquitin. Furthermore, a domain of kininogen has shown inhibitory activity against calpains (36Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and legumain is inhibited by chicken egg white cystatin (37Chen J.-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), demonstrating that other families of cysteine proteases can be inhibited by these sorts of structures.In support of a unique target for the leukocystatins, we found little difference in the binding abilities of long and short forms of cystatin with papain in the presence of 5 mm DTT. Based upon the results of experiments with chicken cystatin, in which N-terminally truncated forms were found to not be as efficient inhibitors as the full-length molecules (29Machleidt W. Thiele U.

Biochem J. 1992; 281: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Bjork I. Pol E. Raub-Segall E. Abrahamson M. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. Biochem J. 1994; 299: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we would expect to see dramatic differences in the abilities of these variants to inhibit this enzyme. One possible explanation is that the 8-amino acid N-terminal extension of the longer form impedes binding, although extensions have been shown to have little effect for other cystatins (38Hakansson K. Huh C. Grubb A. Karlsson S. Abrahamson M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 114: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the absence of an effect of the FLAG tag supports the idea that N-terminal extensions do not influence leukocystatin binding. The unique lysine at position 35 may, however, interfere with complex formation. There is also some evidence that the long forms dimerize, and this may interfere with binding. Under the assay conditions, however, a large proportion is likely to be monomeric, as evidenced by the titration shown in Fig. 8. That the interchain cysteine primarily mediates this dimerization is evidenced by the fact that activity increases for the long form with increasing DTT concentrations. If we were to assume that the dimeric form did not bind at all to the studied cysteine proteases (and that all of the inhibition resulted from the monomeric form) this would only result in changing the apparent K i by a factor of less than 2 (in favor of tighter binding), because the effective concentration would be changed by this amount.Although there was no effect on papain inhibition, there was a 10-fold increase in binding affinity to cathepsin L with the long form, showing that at least for this particular case, the N terminus contributes to binding. This supports the idea that the various portions of cystatins are differentially involved in association to individual proteases, even though the three-dimensional structures of these proteases are very similar. We would expect the native binding partner of leukocystatin to fully take advantage of the unique features in these sites.Leukocystatin was shown by cDNA library Southern blots to be expressed selectively in hematopoietic cells. Examination of a wide variety of immune cell types suggests that the highest levels are expressed in T-cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Clearly, a search for a specific target protease should focus on the effector functions of these immune cell types. Currently, we are developing other tagged versions of leukocystatin, additional antibody reagents, and a mouse gene knockout to probe in depth the biological role of this novel Class II cystatin.In conclusion, we have characterized a new Class II cystatin, termed leukocystatin, which has a novel sequence, including unique lysine residues at two important protease binding sites, and a distinct distribution in hematopoietic cells. Cysteine proteases play many very important roles in the immune system. For instance, the de-ubiquinating enzymes are cysteine proteases, whereas lysosomal proteases are involved in antigen presentation both through the degradation of proteins to antigenic peptides and by processing the invariant chain of class II major histocompatibility complexes (1Riese R.J. Wolf P.R. Bromme D. Natkin L.R. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, the overexpression of these proteases can be detrimental to cells, as can their release into the extracellular space. Therefore, their activities in these cells are controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including the presence of macromolecular protease inhibitors. The cystatins make up a class of very tight, reversible, competitive inhibitors of the papain family of cysteine proteases. Cystatins have been divided into four classes based upon their sequences and properties. Class I, also called the stefins, are a group of intracellular proteins of approximately 100 residues that contain no disulfide bonds. Class II cystatins are secreted inhibitors of about 120 amino acids containing two disulfide bonds. Class III cystatins, known as the kininogens, contain three domains, each of which resembles Class II cystatins; two of these domains possess inhibitory activity. Finally, Class IV cystatins constitute a poorly understood group of glycoproteins with two nonfunctional cystatin domains. The amino acid sequences and genomic structures within each family are highly conserved. Cystatins are expressed throughout the body in a tissue-specific manner. Mutations in some cystatins or alterations in the balance of these with their cognate cysteine proteases have been implicated in several diseases (2Calkins C.C. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar, 3Henskens Y.M. Veerman E.C. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 71-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies, involving changes of peptide sequence, have shown that three regions of the cystatin, which form a “wedge” that can associate with the active-site cleft, are all required for tight binding to the protease. These studies have been confirmed by the crystal structure of the cystatin B-papain complex (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and supported by other structural studies showing that chicken egg white cystatin, a Class II cystatin, has the same fold as the Class I cystatin B (5Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 6Dieckmann T. Mitschang L. Hofmann M. Kos J. Turk V. Auerswald E.A. Jaenicke R. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the characterization of a new Class II cystatin, leukocystatin, specifically expressed by hematopoietic cells. The unique features of the amino acid sequence suggest that the as yet unidentified target protease is not one of the commonly studied lysosomal cysteine proteases, although leukocystatin is an active inhibitor of these cathepsins. In addition, the unusual genomic structure of the mouse protein and the amino acid sequences of both the human and mouse inhibitors suggest that they are quite divergent from other Class II cystatins. DISCUSSIONWe have discovered a novel hematopoietic cell-specific Class II cystatin from an EST analysis of human dendritic cells. This protein, which we have called leukocystatin, has all the features of a Class II cystatin, but it has some notable characteristics. For example, leukocystatin contains lysine residues at two positions that are strictly hydrophobic (residue 35) and small, noncharged (residue 84) amino acids in all other characterized cystatins. Position 35 is thought to bind to the P3 site of the target protease (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 5Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J. Kos J. Turk V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), so it is possible that this lysine substitution results in an especially high affinity for a cysteine protease with this preferred specificity. Because residues 81–85 in other cystatins usually form nonspecific hydrophobic interactions with the cognate protease (4Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), it is likely that the contacts formed by this region may also differ from those observed previously. Supporting this, computer modeling has shown that Lys84 would interfere with binding of leukocystatin to papain in this region (see below).Leukocystatin contains a total of eight cysteines: the four that are conserved with other Class II cystatins, and four unique cysteines, two of which are in the leader region (Fig. 3). Conserved cysteine residues in the N-terminal portion are not seen in any other mature Class II cystatin molecule, although they do occur sporadically in other cystatin leader sequences. Two cysteine residues, in positions different from leukocystatin, also appear in the N-terminal region of each inhibitory kininogen domain, and a polymorphism in the cystatin D sequence introduces a cysteine in this area (18Freije J.P. Balbin M. Abrahamson M. Velasco G. Dalboge H. Grubb A. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15737-15744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Balbin M. Hall A. Grubb A. Mason R.W. Lopez-Otin C. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23156-23162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the two additional leukocystatin cysteines in the putative mature protein form an intrachain disulfide and provide added stability. This, however, is not supported by the evidence. Participation of Cys63 in an intrachain disulfide could only occur if the leukocystatin structure is markedly different from chicken egg white cystatin or if the N terminus folds back because the structure of chicken egg white cystatin shows the amino acid corresponding to Cys63 at the end of an α-helix, 34 Å from the N terminus. This places it far from the other leukocystatin cysteines. Furthermore, nonreduced gels indicate that the long form, which contains Cys26, can dimerize (Fig. 8), whereas no evidence of dimerization exists for the short form, which contains Cys63 but not Cys26. Because only monomer is seen in reducing gels, this interaction is apparently mediated by an interchain disulfide, formed by Cys26 from two different molecules. This may be similar to the case of stefin B, a Class I cystatin, which has a cysteine at position 3 that is thought to mediate dimerization (24Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar).The mouse leukocystatin gene contains four exons (Fig. 4), unlike most other members of the Class II cystatins, which have three (25Saitoh E. Isemura S. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Soyacystatin is the only known molecule containing one cystatin domain and having a gene encoding four exons. The additional exon in that case, however, lies in a unique C-terminal extension (26Misaka T. Kuroda M. Iwabuchi K. Abe K. Arai S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because the amino acids encoded by the first two exons of leukocystatin are very different from other Class II cystatins, it is clear that the evolution of this region is very different from other family members. The C-terminal genomic organization, however, is similar to the other Class II cystatins, with the intron/exon boundaries being conserved. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of leukocystatin is not similar to Class I cystatins: the Class I genomic organization is different, with the first intron lying at a position between the first and second leukocystatin introns and with the second lying between the second and third leukocystatin in"

The crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ reveals a conserved amphipathic groove that may mediate the association of 14-3-3 with diverse ligands. Consistently, mutations on the charged surface of the groove (Lys-49, Arg-56, and Arg-60) decrease the binding of 14-3-3ζ to the ligands tested (Zhang, L., Wang, H., Liu, D., Liddington, R., and Fu, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 13717–13724). Here we report that mutations that altered the hydrophobic property of the groove, V176D, L216D, L220D, and L227D, disrupted the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with Raf-1 kinase. The reduced binding of the 14-3-3ζ mutants to Raf-1 was apparently not because of gross structural changes in the mutants as judged by their ability to form dimers, by partial proteolysis profiles, and by circular dichroism analysis. These hydrophobic residues appeared to be required for the binding of 14-3-3ζ to distinct activation states of Raf-1 because mutations V176D, L216D, L220D, and L227D reduced the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with Raf-1 from both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated and unstimulated Jurkat T cells. These same mutations also disrupted the association of 14-3-3ζ with other regulatory molecules such as Cbl and c-Bcr, suggesting that the hydrophobic surface of the amphipathic groove represents part of a binding site shared by a number of 14-3-3-associated proteins. The conservation of the hydrophobic residues Val-176, Leu-216, Leu-220, and Leu-227 among known 14-3-3 family members implies their general importance in ligand binding. 14-3-3 proteins bind to a diverse group of regulatory molecules such as Raf-1, Cbl, and c-Bcr that are involved in signal transduction pathways.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar and 2Reuther G.W. Pendergast A.M. Vitam. Horm. 1996; 52: 149-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar for review). They were originally identified as abundant brain proteins (3Moore B.W. Perez V.J. Carlson F.D. Physiological and Biochemical Aspects of Nervous Integration. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1967: 343-359Google Scholar) and later found to be widespread in mammalian tissues and present in all eukaryotic organisms examined. Diverse biological activities have been attributed to this family of proteins including cell cycle control, activation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, and stimulation of mitochondrial import. A striking feature of 14-3-3 proteins is their ability to bind a wide range of cell regulatory proteins. Many of the 14-3-3-associated proteins are proto-oncogene or oncogene products that are known to participate in various signal transduction pathways leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, or transformation (Ref. 2Reuther G.W.

Proteins that interact with 14-3-3 are not restricted to proto-oncogene and oncogene products because proteins such as the glucocorticoid receptor (15Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J.

Like the interaction of phosphotyrosine motifs with SH2 domain-containing proteins, such a phosphoserine motif may provide a general mechanism for 14-3-3 protein-target interactions. In support of this notion, mutations of Raf-1 at Ser-259 of the RSXpSXP motif disrupt the Raf-1-4-3-3 interaction (21Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Two consensus 14-3-3-binding motifs have been identified in Raf-1 (23Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar), one of which is localized in the N-terminal regulatory domain with Ser-259 as the phosphorylation site and the other of which located in the C-terminal kinase domain involving Ser-621. Recently, Raf-CRD, the Cys-rich domain within the regulatory fragment of Raf-1, has also been found to bind directly to 14-3-3ζ (25Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20990-20993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, how 14-3-3 binding contributes to Raf-1 activation remains unclear. It has been postulated that 14-3-3 may have dual functions (27Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 may function to stabilize the inactive Raf-1 conformation possibly through its binding to the phosphorylated Ser-259 and Raf-CRD sites. Consistently, mutations in Ser-259 and Raf-CRD that impair Raf-1–14-3-3 interaction enhance Raf-1 activity (21Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20990-20993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). During Raf-1 activation, 14-3-3 may also stabilize an active conformation of Raf-1 through its binding to the phosphorylated Ser-621 site. Other postulated mechanisms of 14-3-3-Raf-1 interactions include 14-3-3-induced oligomerization of Raf-1 (28Marshall C.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and protection of Raf-1 from phosphatase-mediated inactivation (29Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is possible that the regulated interaction of 14-3-3 with distinct recognition sites on Raf-1 modulates the activation status of the Raf-1 kinase. To understand how 14-3-3 proteins interact with diverse ligands and ultimately to determine the biological function of 14-3-3 protein-target interactions, we have solved the three-dimensional crystal structure of the ζ-isoform of 14-3-3 (30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and carried out mutational analysis to identify structural elements that are required for ligand binding (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3ζ structure is solved as a dimer with a bundle of nine antiparallel α-helices in each monomer. When viewed along the mean helix axis, α-helices 3–9 form a palisade generating a groove. Interestingly, residues lining the inside of the groove are conserved among members of the 14-3-3 protein family. Within this conserved groove of the 14-3-3ζ monomer are several charged residues on one side and hydrophobic residues on the other (30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) forming an amphipathic structure. This amphipathic property appears conserved in the τ-isoform of the 14-3-3 protein as revealed by its crystal structure (32Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). It is possible that this conserved amphipathic groove allows the binding of 14-3-3 to diverse ligands. Consistent with this model, charge reversal mutations on one side of the groove, K49E, R56E, and R60E, greatly or partially decrease the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with Raf-1 kinase (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this panel of mutations exhibits similar effects on the functional interaction of 14-3-3ζ with ExoS, a 14-3-3-dependent-ADP-ribosyltransferase, suggesting that these two associated proteins share a common structural determinant involving these charged residues. To test whether residues in the hydrophobic side of the groove are involved in ligand binding, we have now individually replaced these residues with a negatively charged Asp, generating 14-3-3ζ with the point mutations, L172D, V176D, L216D, L220D, and L227D. We report here that L172D, V176D, and L220D drastically disrupted the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with Raf-1 kinase and that L216D and L227D showed moderate effects. These hydrophobic residues appear to be required for the binding of 14-3-3ζ to the recognition sites of Raf-1 under both activated and resting status. Importantly, the same mutations disrupted the association of 14-3-3ζ with two other regulatory proteins, Cbl and c-Bcr, suggesting that the hydrophobic residues of the groove may be part of a binding site shared by multiple target proteins. Escherichia coli strains were grown routinely at 37 °C in LB liquid medium or agar plates (15 g/liter). Strain XL1-Blue was used for propagation of plasmids in subcloning, strain MutS was used for propagating mutagenized plasmids in site-directed mutagenesis, and strain BL21(DE3) was used for protein expression. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were grown at 30 °C in synthetic medium supplemented with relevant amino acids and 2% glucose or galactose as a carbon source (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Strain EGY48 (MAT a trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLexAop6-LEU2) was used as the host strain in a yeast two-hybrid assay (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). pHAF625 (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) carrying the 14-3-3ζ gene was used as a template for mutagenesis. The 14-3-3ζ DNA fragments carrying various mutations were subcloned into pJG4-5 and pEG202 vectors (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) using the EcoRI-XhoI sites for assay in a yeast two-hybrid system. For the purpose of protein expression in E. coli, the 14-3-3ζ gene and its mutant derivatives were subcloned from pHAF625 into the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using theNdeI-EcoRI sites. Human Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to a density of about 1 × 106 cells/ml essentially as described (24Liu Y.C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Prior to PMA treatment, cells were collected by centrifugation (600 × g, 5 min), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum, and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h for starvation. Starved cells were collected and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without serum to a density of 2 × 107cells/ml. After equilibration at 37 °C for 5 min, cells were activated with PMA in Me2SO (50 ng/ml final) for 15 min. Stimulation was terminated by adding an equal volume of ice cold 2× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 4 mmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin), and cells were lysed for 10 min on ice. The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min) at 4 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis of 14-3-3ζ gene was achieved with the unique site elimination method (35Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) using double-stranded plasmid as a starting template. Two oligonucleotide primers were used: a mutagenic primer containing the desired mutation (see below) and a selection primer containing a mutation that eliminated the unique SspI site and introduced an EcoRV site (underlined) in the mutagenesis template pHAF625 (selection primer: 5′-AAATGCTTCAATGATATCGAAAAAGGAAG-3′). The incorporation of the mutagenic primers was screened by restriction enzyme digestion and verified by sequencing the entire 14-3-3ζ gene. The mutagenic primers used are listed below (mutations generated are underlined and the restriction sites introduced for screening purpose are in lowercase): 1) 5′-GACTGGGgctagcCGATAACTTCTCTG-3′ (Leu-172 to Asp,NheI site introduced), 2) 5′-CTTCTCTGACTTCTATTATGagatctTGAACTC-3′ (Val-176 to Asp, BglII site introduced), 3) 5′-AAAGACagtactGATATAATGCAGTTA-3′ (Leu-216 to Asp,ScaI site introduced), 4) 5′-CTAATAATGCAGGATCTtcgcgaTAACTTG-3′ (Leu-220 to Asp,NruI site introduced), and 5) 5′-GATAACTTGACAGACTGgacgtcGGATACC-3′ (Leu-227 to Asp,AatII site introduced). A modified version of the yeast two-hybrid system (36Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), the interaction trap (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), was used for studying 14-3-3ζ-Raf-1 interactions in vivo. S. cerevisiae strain EGY48 was used as a host strain for all interaction assays. Both pSH18-34 and pJK103 were used as reporters (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). pSH18-34 contains a GAL1-lacZ gene under control of eight high affinity ColE1 LexA operators, whereas pJK103 reporter has two ColE1 LexA operators. pEG202 derivatives were constructed to encode LexA-Raf-1 (full length), LexA-Raf (amino acids 1–320), LexA-Raf (amino acids 321–648), LexA-14-3-3ζ WT, and LexA-14-3-3ζ mutant fusion proteins (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). pJG4-5 derivatives were generated to encode B42-14-3-3ζ WT and mutant fusion proteins. For the protein-protein interaction analysis, EGY48 harboring a lacZ reporter was co-transformed with the pEG202 and pJG4-5 derivative plasmids by the lithium acetate method (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by complementation of auxotrophies byURA3, HIS3, orTRP1 markers on plates of synthetic medium supplemented with 2% glucose. For the X-gal plate assay, yeast transformants were patched onto synthetic medium plates containing 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and 20 μg/ml X-gal (Gold Biotechnology, Inc., St. Louis, MO) to induce and detect the expression of the lacZ reporter gene. The color development from positive or negative interactions on X-gal plates was recorded after 24 h of incubation at 30 °C. For the quantitative liquid assay, yeast transformants were first grown in selective medium with 2% glucose as carbon source to A 600 ∼ 1.0 and then transferred to induction medium with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose as carbon source essentially as described (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For β-galactosidase activity quantification, chlorophenyl-red-β-d-galactopyranoside was used as a chromogenic substrate. β-Galactosidase activities were calculated as described previously (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Three independent colonies were used for each activity determination. 14-3-3ζ WT and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression of hexahistidine-tagged 14-3-3ζ proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (26Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Crude extracts were prepared by sonication on ice followed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatants were used as the source of hexahistidine-tagged 14-3-3ζ proteins and directly used for the solid phase binding assays as described below. For the purpose of protein purification, the crude extracts were subjected to Ni2+-chelating chromatography. 14-3-3ζ proteins were purified essentially as described (26Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie blue dye-based Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For monitoring the dimeric status of 14-3-3ζ proteins, 1 μg of each purified WT or mutant 14-3-3ζ protein was applied through a 25-μl injection loop to a Superdex 75 column (HR 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.3, 130 mm NaCl). The chromatography was performed on a column connected to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution positions of dimeric and monomeric 14-3-3ζ proteins were determined by using a panel of nondenatured protein molecular weight standards (Sigma) and confirmed by the elution position of denatured, monomeric 14-3-3ζ. Ni2+-chelated Sepharose 6B beads (Novagen) were incubated with E. colicrude extracts containing hexahistidine-tagged 14-3-3ζ proteins to generate beads coated with 14-3-3ζ for the subsequent binding assays. Two types of binding assays were employed. One used a radiolabeled binding partner generated by the TnT in vitrotranscription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The other used total cell lysates from cultured Jurkat T cells. For the first assay, 14-3-3ζ coated beads (∼5 μg of protein each) were incubated with 5 μl of TnT reaction mix containing [35S]methionine-labeled Raf-1. The 14-3-3ζ·Raf-1 complex was washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The protein complexes formed in the binding assay were eluted from beads by boiling (3 min) in 10 μl of SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). The presence of the radiolabeled Raf-1 protein in the 14-3-3ζ complex was visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For the Jurkat T cell lysate binding assay, 200 μl each of the Jurkat T cell lysates (from 2 × 106cells) was incubated individually with WT or mutant 14-3-3ζ-coated beads that contained about 5 μg of 14-3-3ζ protein. Suspensions were incubated at 4 °C with mild rotation for 1 h and washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. The beads were boiled for 3 min in 10 μl of SDS sample buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins that were complexed with 14-3-3ζ were visualized with corresponding antibodies using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2.5 μg of each of the purified 14-3-3ζ WT and mutant proteins was incubated with 0.5 unit of chymotrypsin or Pronase in a total volume of 10 μl at 37 °C. After digestion, the products were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) followed by silver staining (Bio-Rad). The digestion patterns of mutant proteins were compared with that of the WT. The far-UV CD spectra of 14-3-3ζ WT and mutant proteins were recorded on a Jasco-600 Spectropolarimeter as described (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ], degree·cm2·dmol−1) calculated from the equation: [θ]=([θ]obs ×MRW)/(10 × L × C), where [θ]obs is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, MRW is the mean residue molecular weight (114 for 14-3-3ζ), L is the optical path length in cm (0.1 cm), and C is the final protein concentration in mg/ml. Data were collected from 250 to 200 nm wavelength at 0.2-nm intervals. The protein concentration was set at 0.4 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, and the final far-UV CD spectra were averaged over four independent scans. SDS-PAGE and the enzyme-linked immunoblotting procedures were performed essentially as described (31Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody from mouse (HA.11; BAbCO, Berkerly, CA) was used to detect 14-3-3ζ proteins fused with an influenza virus HA epitope in the pJG4-5 vectors in the yeast two-hybrid system. Raf-1, Cbl, and c-Bcr were detected by polyclonal anti-Raf-1, anti-Cbl (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Bcr antibodies (generously provided by Dr. Ann Marie Pendergast). Corresponding secondary antibodies were used against each primary antibody: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham) for anti-HA antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for anti-Raf-1, anti-Cbl, and anti-Bcr antibodies. Cross-reacting materials were visualized using ECL. In the three-dimensional crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ, residues from helices 3, 5, 7, and 9 define a conserved amphipathic groove (30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). On one side of the groove, residues such as Lys-49, Arg-56, and Arg-60 form a charged surface with their exposed si"

We and others are searching for genes induced in neurons by depolarization to identify candidate genes whose expression may mediate neuronal plasticity.

Most recently, differential display was used to identify synaptotagmin X, a gene induced in degenerating brain following kainic acid seizures (12Babity J.M. Armstrong J.N. Plumier J.-C.L. Currie R.W.

Many of these genes are induced not only by depolarization but also by other stimuli such as nerve growth factor (NGF) (10Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W. Barnes C.A. Nathans D.

The products of genes induced by both types of stimuli presumably function not only during periods of neuronal plasticity or seizure activity but also during neuronal growth and development. Our goal is to identify genes that are induced in neurons by depolarization and not by neurotrophins and/or other growth factors. We suggest that the products of such genes may have roles specific to neuronal plasticity and/or seizure activity but not to growth and development. To perform this task, we have utilized representational difference analysis (RDA) (13Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M.

For these reasons, we chose PC12 cells to identify genes induced specifically by depolarization. RDA is a rapid, sensitive method for identifying differences between two populations of DNA. RDA was originally developed to identify DNA sequences unique to one of two genomic populations (13Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). The RDA procedure was subsequently modified for comparing cDNA populations (14Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and detecting differentially expressed sequences (14Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 15Braun B.S. Frieden R. Lessnick S.L. May W.A. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell.

Prigent S.A. Schipper A. Feramisco J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have recently described the use of RDA to isolate genes preferentially induced in PC12 cells by the neurotrophin NGFversus the mitogen EGF (27Vician L. Basconcillo R. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this report we again applied RDA to cDNAs from PC12 cells and isolated a number of cDNA fragments that identify messages induced by depolarization but not by NGF or EGF. We describe in detail the identification and characterization of KID-1, a proteinkinase induced by depolarization, in PC12 cells and in brain. KID-1 expression is low in unstimulated PC12 cells and is rapidly induced by membrane depolarization. The cDNA sequence of KID-1 predicts a serine/threonine protein kinase with strong homology to the proto-oncogene PIM-1. When expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein, KID-1 is able to catalyze both histone phosphorylation and autophosphorylation.KID-1 is an IEG; its expression is induced PC12 cells in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor.KID-1 is not induced by NGF or EGF. In brain,KID-1 expression is induced after generalized seizures and is limited to specific areas of the hippocampus and temporal lobe. PC12 cells, obtained from B. Howard (UCLA), were cultured in RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum in T75 flasks. The cells were passaged, at a 1:4 to 1:5 ratio, by trituration when they reached 75–80% confluence. Experiments were performed in cells at 50–60% confluence. KCl (55 mm), forskolin (50 mm), NGF (50 ng/ml), or EGF (10 ng/ml) was added to the cultures for the times indicated in the text or the figures. Growth factors were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Forskolin was purchased from Sigma. For each experiment, paired flasks were treated with KCl, forskolin, NGF, EGF, or no ligand (control) for 0.75, 1.5, 2, or 4 h. For the synthesis of cDNA to be analyzed by RDA, RNAs from all eight flasks treated with each ligand and from three separate experiments (a total of 24 flasks) were pooled. For subsequent experiments, RNAs from the paired flasks treated with each ligand at each time point were pooled. RNAs from control flasks at all time points were pooled. To determine whether a message is the product of a primary response gene, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added, either alone or along with the specific ligand, for 1.5 h. After ligand treatment, medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed by adding 1.2 ml of cold lysis buffer (5 m guanidinium thiocyanate/10 mm EDTA/50 mm Tris, pH 7.5/8% 2-mercaptoethanol) directly to the flask, and total RNA was isolated by precipitation with lithium chloride (28Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The final concentration of RNA was determined using a GeneQuant RNA/DNA calculator with a 10-μl cuvette (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2 μg each of the KCl and forskolin poly(A)+ RNA pools were pooled to make “tester” cDNA. Similarly, 2 μg each of the NGF and EGF poly(A)+ RNA pools were pooled to make “driver” cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the pooled poly(A)+ RNAs, using a SuperScript Choice cDNA Synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), with a combination of 1.0 μg of oligo (dT)12–18 and 100 ng of random hexamers. To evaluate the induction of known genes, Northern blots prepared with 50 ng of tester, driver, and control poly(A)+ RNA were probed with: arc (provided by P. Worley, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), NGFI-B (provided by J. Milbrandt, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), secretogranin I (provided by P. Danielson, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), synaptotagmin IV, and TIS21. Blots were also probed with rat GAPDH (provided by R. Bravo, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Princeton, NJ) to normalize RNA loading. Hybridization signals were quantitated with an Ambis Radio-Imager (Scanalytics, Billerica, MA). Based on the relative intensities of the signals from the specific probes to that from GAPDH, and our decision to dope the driver with a 10-fold excess, 1.2, 12.7, and 5.5 ng of NGFI-B, secretogranin I, and synaptotagmin IV cDNAs, respectively, were added to 1.5 μg of driver cDNA prior to the preparation of driver amplicons. RDA was performed as described previously (27Vician L. Basconcillo R. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: Tfl polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 5 units, was used in all PCR reactions. PCR products were purified using a PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). Three rounds of RDA reactions were performed. Tester:driver hybridization ratios were 1:100 for the first round, 1:1000 for the second round, and 1:50,000 for the third round. Hybridizations were maintained for approximately 60 h. The difference product of the third round of RDA demonstrated a small number of distinct bands on agarose gel. Gel plugs were taken from each of these bands, using the small end of a Pasteur pipette, and the DNA was eluted in 25–50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight. The DNAs were amplified using 5 units of Taq polymerase in a 100-μl PCR reaction, cloned into pCRII using a TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and used to transform DH11-S Escherichia coli. Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual colonies from among the transformation reactions using a QIAprep Spin Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen). The cloned fragments were used to prepare a dot blot, which was probed with the third round RDA difference product. Fragments that yielded strong hybridization signals were used as probe on Northern blots to confirm their preferential induction. Northern analysis was carried out as described previously (11Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The progress of RDA was analyzed by separating 100 ng of the difference products on 0.5% agarose/1.5% NuSieve (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) gels and staining with ethidium bromide. Southern analysis was performed by standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed by the core facility of the Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Los Angeles, on an Applied Biosystems instrument. The DNA sequences obtained were compared with the current version of the nonredundant, updated GenBank™ and EMBL data base using BlastN (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed using MacVector and AssemblyLign (Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT) and MegAlign (DNAStar, Madison, WI) software. The full-length cDNA clone was obtained by screening a PC12 cDNA library constructed in λZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in our laboratory. Plaque lifts were probed with the cloned fragment by standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones were converted into plasmid using Exassist helper phage (Stratagene). By performing PCR with the full-length KID-1 cDNA as template, and the oligonucleotides 5′-GGATCCATGCTGCTGTCCAAGTTCGGCTCCCTGG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCACAAGCTCTCACTGCTGGAAGTGGTACTGG-3′ as primers, the KID-1 open reading frame was modified to create a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ XhoI site. The PCR product was cloned into pCRII using a TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced during PCR. The KID-1/pCRII plasmid was digested with BamHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) andXhoI (New England Biolabs), and the 1000-bp fragment containing the modified KID-1 open reading frame was isolated from an agarose gel. This fragment was ligated into the BamHI andXhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This insertion created an “in-frame” fusion of the KID-1 open reading frame cDNA with the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside-inducible GST gene. The JM109 strain of E. coli was transformed with the GST-KID-1 plasmid using standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). As a control, anE. coli strain containing a protein-arginineN-methyltransferase (GST-PRMT1) plasmid (31Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) was processed in parallel with the GST-KID-1 strain. Overnight cultures of the transformed bacteria were diluted 1:5 in 2× YT (16 g of bacto-tryptone, 10 g of bacto-yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl/liter of H2O) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 3 h with shaking at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by adding 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside, and growth was continued for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μm3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 10 μml-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(4-guanidino)-butane (Sigma), and 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), and lysed by sonication. The proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, except that all steps were performed at 4 °C. The proteins were eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose beads with 30 mm glutathione and frozen at −20 °C. Aliquots of the purified fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For Western analysis, the proteins were transferred from acrylamide to nitrocellulose using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 16 V for 40 min. The filter was treated by standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The primary antibody, anti-GST (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used at 1:1000 dilution, and the secondary antibody, anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (Biosource, Camarillo, CA) was used at 1:4000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The in vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (32Hoover D. Friedmann M. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14018-14023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions containing 10 μl of protein, 19 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0/150 mmNaCl/10 mm MgCl2/2 mmMnCl2) and 10 μg of histone Hl (Sigma) were set up on ice. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 6 μl of 6× SDS protein loading buffer. The samples were heated to 98 °C for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to film at room temperature. RNAs from tissues were prepared by a modification of the AGPC protocol (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Immediately upon removal from the animal, tissues were weighed, placed in 10 volumes of cold denaturing solution (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate/25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7/0.5% sarcosyl/0.1 m2-mercaptoethanol), and homogenized using an electric tissue homogenizer. Next, 0.1 volume of 2 m sodium acetate, pH 4, 1 volume of acid phenol, and 0.2 volume of chloroform-iso-amyl alcohol mixture (24:1) were added to the homogenate. After mixing and centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, and the extraction was repeated. The aqueous phase was mixed with 1 volume of isopropanol and placed at −20 °C overnight to precipitate RNA. The RNA was pelleted, washed with 80% ethanol, and resuspended in 400 μl of RNA solubilization buffer (0.1% SDS/1 mm EDTA/10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The solution was frozen, thawed, and extracted twice with equilibrated phenol and twice with chloroform. The aqueous phase was mixed with 40 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and extracted once with chloroform-iso-amyl alcohol mixture. This aqueous phase was mixed with 1 ml of ethanol and placed at −80 °C to precipitate RNA. Finally, the RNA was pelleted, washed with 80% ethanol, and resuspended in TE, pH 8.0, at concentrations appropriate for Northern analysis. Wistar rats (270 to 300 g) were housed with free access to rat chow and water for at least 24 h before the experiment. KA treatment was carried out as described previously (34Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were injected with KA (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and kept in isolated cages under surveillance to classify the seizure class. Animals not developing seizures above class III (35Racine R.J. Electroencephalograph. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1972; 32: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5705) Google Scholar) by 30 min after injection were discarded. Animals were sacrificed at 0 (control), 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after injection. ECS treatment was delivered through two platinum electrodes implanted in the scalp 1 cm apart. A single stimulus was delivered with a S48 Stimulator (Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) set at 110 V, 150 pulses/s, 0.5 ms in duration, at a train rate of 0.75 trains/s, and a train duration of 250 ms. Each animal developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 12–15 s and recovered in 40–50 s. Control animals had electrodes implanted but did not receive ECS. ECS-treated animals were sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after seizure. KA- and ECS-treated rats were killed by decapitation. The hippocampus and cortex were dissected, and RNA was isolated as described previously (36Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two separate experiments were performed with three animals in each condition analyzed. Kainic acid treatment, preparation of brain sections, and in situ hybridization were carried out as described previously (11Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 37Tocco G. Bi X. Vician L. Lim I.K. Herschman H. Baudry M. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with kainic acid (12 mg/kg) subcutaneously and sacrificed at 1, 4, and 8 h after the initiation of seizure activity. Control animals did not receive any handling. For statistical analysis, four animals were prepared for each treatment group and for control. Following hybridization, the sections were washed for 20 min in 4× SSC, followed by 2× SSC for a few hours. The high stringency wash was performed at 55 °C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC. The antisense (5′-GGAGCAGCGTTCAAAAAGGCACTCAAAGCAAAGGAAACAG-3′) and the sense (5′-GCCTGGCGGCGTGGACCACCTCCCAGTGAAGATCCTACAG-3′) oligonucleotides were selected from nucleotides 227–266 of the KID-1cDNA sequence. To prepare the starting mRNA populations to be used to identify cDNAs for messages induced by depolarization, but not by growth factors, we employed four populations of PC12 cells: cells treated individually with KCl (55 mm), forskolin (50 mm), NGF (50 ng/ml), or EGF (10 ng/ml). We used forskolin-treated cells as well as KCl-treated cells to prepare our tester mRNA populations (13Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), from which we planned to clone cDNAs for genes preferentially induced by depolarization, because many genes strongly induced by depolarization in brain are also strongly induced by forskolin in PC12 cells (11Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Thompson M.E. Zimmer W.E. Wear L.B.

Neuroscience. 1994; 59: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because we had no prior knowledge of the kinetics of induction of differentially expressed messages, different time points were pooled for each inducer to prepare RNAs for the tester and driver populations to be used for RDA (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). One of the advantages of the RDA procedure is that the driver population, which in this case was derived from mRNA prepared from NGF- and EGF-treated cells, can be artificially enriched or “doped” with cDNAs for genes known to be more strongly expressed in the tester population. Fragments of genes known to be preferentially expressed in the tester population can be eliminated in the RDA procedure as a consequence of this doping. As a result, restriction fragments from other preferentially induced messages in the tester population can be selected during the amplification steps. Preliminary experiments, using Northern blots to evaluate the induction of several genes in PC12 cells by the four inducers (KCl, forskolin, NGF, and EGF), confirmed that secretogranin I (38Thompson M.E.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 23Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) were indeed preferentially induced by KCl and forskolin. Moreover, the approximate levels of these messages in the pooled tester mRNA populations could be estimated from these Northern blots. The driver cDNA, prepared from NGF- and EGF-treated cells, was doped with an approximately 10-fold excess of the cDNAs for each of these rat genes prior to preparation of the driver amplicons. Tester amplicons, derived from the cDNA prepared from the pooled KCl- and forskolin-treated cells, and driver amplicons, derived from the doped cDNA prepared from the pooled NGF- and EGF-treated cells, were used to carry out RDA reactions using procedures we described previously (27Vician L. Basconcillo R. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with modifications (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). After three rounds of RDA reactions, the initial tester cDNA population becomes greatly simplified (Fig. 1 A). Ethidium bromide staining of the initial tester and driver cDNAs demonstrates a homogenous distribution of DNA throughout the range of 0.4–0.8 kilobases, without distinct bands. In contrast, staining of the third round RDA difference product demonstrates a small number of distinct bands with a faint background of diffuse signal. Thus, by the third round of RDA reactions, a small number of DNA fragments have become a large proportion of the total DNA population. One clone from the 718-bp band (Fig. 1 A) demonstrated a pattern of preferential induction in a Northern analysis of tester versus driver poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 1 B). The 5′ sequence of this fragment shares strong sequence similarity with a portion of theXenopus laevis PIM-1 cDNA (40Palaty C.K. Kalmar G. Tai G. Oh S. Amankawa L. Affolter M. Aebersold"
https://openalex.org/W1985828707,"Since heparin potentiates activated factor XI (FXIa) inhibition by protease nexin-2 by providing a template to which both proteins bind (Zhang, Y., Scandura, J. M., Van Nostrand, W. E., and Walsh, P. N. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 26139–26144), we examined binding of factor XI (FXI) and FXIa to heparin. FXIa binds to heparin (K d∼0.7 × 10−9m) >150-fold more tightly than FXI (K d ∼1.1 × 10−7m). To localize the heparin-binding site on FXI, rationally designed conformationally constrained synthetic peptides were used to compete with 125I-FXI binding to heparin. A peptide derived from the Apple 3 (A3) domain of FXI (Asn235–Arg266) inhibited FXI binding to heparin (K d ∼3.4 × 10−6m), whereas peptides from the A1 domain (Phe56–Ser86), A2 domain (Ala134–Ala176), and A4 domain (Ala317–Gly350) had no such effect. The recombinant A3 domain (rA3, Ala181–Val271) inhibited FXI binding to heparin (K i ∼1.4 × 10−7m) indicating that all the information necessary for FXI binding to heparin is contained entirely within the A3 domain. The A3 domain also contains a platelet-binding site (Asn235–Arg266), consisting of three surface-exposed loop structures, Pro229–Gln233, Thr741–Leu246, and Thr249–Phe260 (Baglia, F. A., Jameson, B. A., and Walsh, P. N. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 6734–6740). Only peptide Thr249–Phe260 (which contains a heparin binding consensus sequence, RIKKSKA) inhibits FXI binding to heparin (K i = 2.1 × 10−7m), whereas peptides Pro229–Gln233 and Thr241– Leu246 had no effect. Fine mapping of the heparin-binding site using prekallikrein analogue amino acid substitutions of the synthetic peptide Thr249–Phe260 and alanine scanning of the recombinant A3 indicated that the amino acids Lys252 and Lys253 are important for heparin binding. Thus, the sequence Thr249–Phe260 which contains most of the binding energy for FXI interaction with platelets also mediates the binding of FXI to heparin. Since heparin potentiates activated factor XI (FXIa) inhibition by protease nexin-2 by providing a template to which both proteins bind (Zhang, Y., Scandura, J. M., Van Nostrand, W. E., and Walsh, P.

Only peptide Thr249–Phe260 (which contains a heparin binding consensus sequence, RIKKSKA) inhibits FXI binding to heparin (K i = 2.1 × 10−7m), whereas peptides Pro229–Gln233 and Thr241– Leu246 had no effect. Fine mapping of the heparin-binding site using prekallikrein analogue amino acid substitutions of the synthetic peptide Thr249–Phe260 and alanine scanning of the recombinant A3 indicated that the amino acids Lys252 and Lys253 are important for heparin binding. Thus, the sequence Thr249–Phe260 which contains most of the binding energy for FXI interaction with platelets also mediates the binding of FXI to heparin.

A. 1976; 73: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The active enzyme, activated factor XI (FXIa), is a trypsin-like serine protease that is generated when FXI is cleaved by FXIIa (3Griffin J.H. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), thrombin, or FXIa (4Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol.

Invest. 1977; 60: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Upon activation, FXIa is capable of converting FIX into its active form, FIXa (2Thompson R.E. Mandle Jr., R. Kaplan A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Bouma B.N. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6432-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FIXa, in the presence of FVIII and platelets, can activate FX (7Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rawala-Sheikh R. Ahmad S.S. Ashby B. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2606-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), resulting in the generation of thrombin and, subsequently, a fibrin clot. The structure of FXI is unique among the plasma coagulation enzymes (9Fujikawa K. Chung D.W. Hendrickson L.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,10McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), since it exists as a homodimer consisting of two subunits each of which contains 607 amino acids. During proteolytic activation, each of these subunits is cleaved to generate a heavy chain of 369 amino acids and a light chain or catalytic domain of 238 amino acids. The heavy chain of FXI provides binding surfaces for several blood coagulation proteins and is organized into four tandem repeat Apple domains designated A1, A2, A3, and A4 (9Fujikawa K. Chung D.W. Hendrickson L.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each of these four domains contains 90 to 91 amino acids, the sequences of which are 23–34% identical. The A1 domain provides a binding site for HMWK (11Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4247-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a protein that promotes the activation of FXI by FXIIa (12Kurachi K. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1330-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both the A2 domain (13Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24190-24197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the A3 domain (14Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the binding of FXIa to its substrate, FIX. The A4 domain contains Cys321 that is responsible for the dimerization of FXI (15Meijers J.C. Kanters D.H. Vlooswijk R.A. van Erp H.E. Hessing M. Bouma B.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4231-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,16Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, the A4 domain binds to FXIIa (10McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Examination of the cellular site of FXI activation by FXIIa has resulted in evidence that platelets promote the proteolytic activation of FXI by FXIIa (17Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1981; 57: 106-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that FXI, in the presence of zinc ions, calcium ions, and HMWK, binds to activated platelets in a specific, reversible, and saturable manner with a dissociation constant (K d) of ∼10 nm (18Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory showed that a synthetic peptide (Asn235-Arg266) from the A3 domain inhibited125I-FXI binding to platelets (inhibition constant (K i) = 10 nm) in the presence of HMWK, ZnCl2, and CaCl2 (19Ho D.H. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Blood. 1996; 88 (abstr.): 283aCrossref Google Scholar, 20Baglia F.A. Seaman F.S. Walsh P.N. Blood. 1995; 85: 2078-2083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, these studies indicate that the A3 domain mediates FXI binding to platelets. A second possible site of FXI activation is the endothelial cell surface. Berrettini et al. (21Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that FXI binds to endothelial cells in the presence of HMWK, CaCl2, and ZnCl2 with a K d(app) ∼4.5 nm, whereas FXIa binds with higher affinity (K d(app) ∼1.5 nm). The binding of FXI to the endothelial cell surface may be of functional significance in localizing coagulation to the site of vascular injury since activation of FXI can occur on the endothelial cell surface (21Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where proteoglycans such as heparan sulfate are known to be present. Both Naito and Fujikawa (4Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7353-7358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gailani and Broze (5Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) showed that, in the presence of an appropriate surface such dextran sulfate or sulfatides, FXI can be activated by thrombin or autoactivated by FXIa. In the presence of heparin, FXI can be activated by thrombin or by FXIa (5Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Another important function of heparin is to promote the inhibition of FXIa by protease nexin II (PN-2) by increasing the association rate of FXIa binding to PN-2 (22Zhang Y. Scandura J.M. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26139-26144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This increased association rate results in a decrease in the K i from 300 pm, in the absence of heparin, to 30 pm in the presence of heparin (22Zhang Y. Scandura J.M. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26139-26144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The effect of heparin and glycosaminoglycans on the binding of FXI to cell surfaces and other proteins is, therefore, an important area of study. The primary structure of FXI was examined for amino acid sequences that could bind heparin. This sequence analysis was based on work by Cardinet al. (23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which showed that, for several proteins, there is a consensus sequence for glycosaminoglycan recognition, BXBBXBX, where B represents a basic residue and X is a hydrophilic residue. Three possible heparin-binding sites were identified in FXI: -R250IKKSKA256- within the A3 domain, -Y509RKLRDK515-, and -Q528KRYRGHKI536- in the catalytic domain. The present study was undertaken to examine the interaction of FXI with heparin and to begin a detailed mapping of the putative heparin-binding site that mediates this interaction. Human FXI and XIa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Unfractionated heparin,p-nitrophenyl phosphate, HEPES, fluorescein mono-p-guanidinobenzoate HCl, and sodiumm-periodate were purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody, 5F4, was prepared in our laboratory (13Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24190-24197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA.). 1,9-Dimethyl-Methylene Blue was purchased from Aldrich. The chromogenic substrate for measurement of FXIa, pyro-EPR-p-nitroanilide (S2366), was obtained from Chromogenix (M148 Indal, Sweden). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA markers, Pfu polymerase, ligase, and nucleotide triphosphates were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Amine-coated plates were purchased from Corning Costar (Cambridge, MA). Streptavidin-coated plates were obtained from Pierce. Biotin-XX-hydrazide was purchased from Calbiochem. Purified FXI was radiolabeled by a minor modification of the IODO-GEN method (24Sinha D. Seaman F.S. Koshy A. Knight L.C. Walsh P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 5 × 106 cpm/μg. The radiolabeled protein retained >98% of its biological activity. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, CA) by a modification of the procedure described by Kent and Clark-Lewis (25Kent S.B.H. Clark-Lewis I. Alitalo K. Partanen P. Vakeri A. Synthetic Peptides in Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 29-58Google Scholar). The sequences of the synthetic peptides utilized in this study are given in TableI. All the peptides utilized in this work were rationally designed, conformationally constrained synthetic peptides based upon a previously published molecular model for the A3 domain of FXI (26Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6734-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Each peptide was separately modeled using energy minimization calculations (26Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6734-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that confirmed that the modeled peptides assumed a conformation similar to that of the A3 domain.Table ISynthetic peptides derived from the known sequence of the factor XI heavy chain and the tandem repeat of which they are a partDomainResidues FTCVLKDSVTETLPRV-NRTAAISGYSFKQCSA1Phe56–Ser86 ATRQFPSLEHR-NICLLKHTQTGTPTRITKLDKVVSGFSLKSCAA2Ala134–Ala176 NLCLLKTSESGLPSTRIKKSKALSGFSLQSCRA3Asn235–Arg266 CAQASANEGK-GKAYLKLSSNGSPTKILHGRGGISGCA4Ala317–Gly350 CaDesignates a residue where cysteine was substituted for an amino acid in the native factor XI sequence.TRIKKSKALSGFCaDesignates a residue where cysteine was substituted for an amino acid in the native factor XI sequence.A3Thr249–Phe260(c)bDesignates a peptide in which cysteine replaced one or more amino acid(s) in the normal factor XI sequence.

Open table in a new tab A previously published method (27Walsh P.N. Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 65-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was used to refold peptides containing cysteine residues. Alternatively, peptides were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide as described previously (27Walsh P.N. Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 65-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Sinha D. Koshy A. Seaman F.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10714-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HPLC system employed was from Waters (Waters 600 Gradient Module, model 740 Data Module, model 46K Universal Injector, and Lambda-Max model 481 Detector, Milford, MA). Reverse-phase chromatography was performed using a Waters C8 μBondapak column, whereas gel filtration was carried out using a Waters Protein-Pak 60 column as described previously (27Walsh P.N. Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 65-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

All peptides utilized in this study were examined by HPLC (both reverse phase and gel filtration) and all demonstrated a single homogeneous peak (data not shown). When the refolded peptides were examined by HPLC (both reverse phase and gel filtration), single peaks with identical retention times to the original mixtures were observed, demonstrating the presence of a single homogeneous mixture of refolded peptides. The results were the same after reduction and alkylation of these same peptides. All reduced and alkylated or refolded peptides were examined for free SH groups using the Ellman reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)). It was determined (31Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) that there was less than 0.02 mol of free SH per mol of peptide, which further verifies that these refolded peptides were homogeneous preparations consisting of intramolecular disulfide-bonded peptide. Primers corresponding to the A3 domain were used in the polymerase chain reaction with FXI cDNA (a 2.1-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment containing the complete FXI cDNA coding sequence, a gift from Drs. Dominic W. Chung, Kazuo Fujikawa, and Earl W. Davie of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Washington, Seattle) to create a 303-base pair insert that is identical to the A3 domain and the mutant A3 domains of FXI. Primers were prepared by Life Technologies, Inc. The upstream primer (U) contains a BamHI restriction site and a cleavage site for FXa (IEGR). Its sequence is as follows: 5′GCGGATCC(ATCGAGGGTAGA)GCTTGTATTAGGGACATTTTCCCT. The downstream (D) primer contains a HindIII restriction site and its sequence is as follows: 5′GCAAGCTTTACACTGGGATGCTGTGCCTGCA. The mutagenic primers are as follows: 1) R250-A, 5′TTGCCCAGTACAGCCATTAAAAAGAGC; 2) K252-A, 5′AGTACACGCATTGCAAAGAGCAAAGCT; 3) K253-A, 5′ACACGCATTAAAGCGAGCAAAGCTCTT; 4) K255-A, 5′ATTAAAAAGAGCGCAGCTCTTTCTGGT. For polymerase chain reaction amplification of the wild type and mutant A3 domains, the procedures were based on a technique developed by Picard et al. (32Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The insert was cut with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes using the procedures from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) (supplied with the enzymes). The insert was ligated to the QIAexpress pQE-9 Vector, and transformations were carried out using competent K12-derived Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4). Expression from the pQE-9 vector was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Isolation of the rA3 was carried out using a nickle-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin that binds the 6-His tag on the expressed protein. The E. coli containing the A3 or mutant A3 inserts (as verified through DNA sequence analysis) were inoculated in 20 ml of LBKA media (10 mg/ml Bacto-tryptone, 5 mg/ml Bacto-yeast extract, 5 mg/ml NaCl, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 25 μg/ml kanamycin) overnight at 37 °C with shaking (225 rpm). To express the rA3, 20 ml of the overnight culture was inoculated in 1 liter of LBKA and grown at 37 °C with shaking, until theA 600 reached 0.6–0.7. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min. To lyse the E. coli, the pellet was suspended in 6m Gdn-HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01m Tris, pH 8.0 (2 g wet weight per 10 ml of buffer), and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the cellular debris. The supernatant was mixed with 50% Ni-NTA slurry (1 ml of Ni-NTA/4 ml of lysate) and stirred at room temperature for 45 min. The lysate/resin mixture was loaded onto a 5-ml polypropylene column (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and washed with 50 ml of buffer A (8 m urea, 0.1 sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris), pH 8.0, and again with buffer A containing 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The column was further washed with 50 ml of buffer A, pH 7.5, and 50 ml of buffer A, pH 6.5. The rA3 was eluted with 25 ml of buffer A at pH 5.5, and protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (ε = 6400m−1 at 280 nm absorption). Typically, for a 1-liter preparation, 20–25 mg of rA3 was isolated. The pH was adjusted to 8.8, and the protein was concentrated with Centriprep 10 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) at 2600 × g to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. To increase the solubility of rA3 and to aid in the folding process, the rA3 was sulfonated (33Thannhauser T.W. Konishi Y. Scheraga H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 34Bailey J.L. Cole D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1733-1739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by adding 200× molar excess of Na2SO3, 50× molar excess of cysteine and EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. To decrease the urea concentration and remove Na2SO3, cysteine, and EDTA, the rA3 was dialyzed against 100× its volume in 4 m urea, 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.8, using Slide-A Lyzer 10K dialysis cassette (Pierce) for 1 h. The dialysis (1 h) was repeated five times with the same buffer but with different concentrations of urea (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 m urea). To stabilize the rA3, 10 μm α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) was added into the solution containing the rA3 and stirred at 4 °C overnight (data from our laboratory have shown that α-CD can prevent rA3 aggregation, data not shown). To remove the 6-His tag, 30 μg of bovine FXa was added to each aliquot (2 mg/ml) of rA3 and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h or overnight. FXa was separated from the rA3 using Centriprep-30 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) at 2600 rpm with the rA3 filtered through the membrane (filtrate) and FXa retained on the membrane. To separate the cleaved from the uncleaved rA3, the filtrate was mixed with 50% Ni-NTA slurry (1 ml of Ni-NTA/4 ml of filtrate) and stirred at room temperature for 45 min. The filtrate/resin mixture was loaded onto a 5-ml polypropylene column (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and the flow-through (which contained the cleaved A3) was collected. The column was washed again with 25 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.8, and the flow-through was also collected. The rA3 protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (ε = 6400 m−1 at 280 nm absorption). The concentration of the cleaved rA3 was adjusted to 0.05 mg/ml with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.8, containing final concentrations of 10 mm DTT and 10 μm α-CD. The cleaved rA3 was stirred at 4 °C for 48 h to promote intra-disulfide bonding. Before use, the rA3 was applied to a Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) spin column to remove the α-CD and concentrated with Centricon 3 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) to the desired experimental concentrations. The rA3 was examined by HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry (analysis conducted by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). Data indicated a single peak demonstrating the presence of a single homogeneous species of protein with the molecular weight of 10,519 which is consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the rA3 which is 10,423. Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) was used to determine free SH groups (31Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), which indicated less than 0.02 mol of free SH per mol of rA3. Assays were performed in 96 removable well amine-coated plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Wells were incubated with 200 μl of heparin (2 mg/ml) (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, or with 10 mm Tris in water, pH 7.4 (blank plate), overnight at 37 °C. Wells were washed three times with 0.2 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.2 ml of 1% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, to block all nonspecific binding sites. The amount of heparin bound was determined according to the method of Klompmakers and Hendriks (35Klompmakers A.A. Hendriks T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The amount of heparin bound in the amine-coated plate was determined to be 3–5 μg per well, whereas no heparin was detected in the blank plate. In each experiment, the amount of heparin bound per well and the amount of125I-labeled FXI bound per well were determined. The amount of 125I-FXI bound per heparin-containing well was a linear function of the amount of heparin bound per well (r = 0.99, p < 0.01).

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a critical regulator of inflammation and virus replication. Here we report that a class of serine protease inhibitors with NF-κB-inhibitory activity are potent HSP inducers via activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) in human cells. 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin, the most effective compound, rapidly induces HSF1 DNA binding activity and phosphorylation, leading to transcription and translation of heat shock genes for a period of several hours. HSF1 activation is independent of de novo protein synthesis and is correlated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner with NF-κB inhibition. Cysteine protease inhibitors E64 and calpain inhibitor II, which do not block NF-κB activation, do not induce HSF DNA binding activity. HSP induction by 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin is associated with antiviral activity during rhabdovirus infection. These results identify a new class of HSP inducers and indicate a link between the regulatory pathways of HSF and NF-κB, suggesting novel strategies to simultaneously switch on cytoprotective genes and down-regulate inflammatory and viral genes.

The heat shock response is a finely regulated and highly conserved mechanism to protect cells against different types of injury, including extreme temperatures, oxidative stress, and virus infection (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 2). In mammalian cells, triggering of the heat shock response requires activation and nuclear translocation of a transregulatory protein, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF), 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; DCIC, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; TPCK,N-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; BTEE, N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine-ethylester; APNE,N-acetyl-dl-phenylalanine-β-naphthylester; E64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MDP, Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; DCIC, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; TPCK,N-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; BTEE, N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine-ethylester; APNE,N-acetyl-dl-phenylalanine-β-naphthylester; E64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MDP, Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. which converts from a monomeric non-DNA binding form to an oligomeric form that binds to specific promoter elements (HSEs) located upstream of heat shock (hs) genes and is phosphorylated by an as yet unknown kinase (2, 3Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Several HSFs (HSF1–HSF4) were described in vertebrate cells (3Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for signal transduction, which leads to HSF activation and phosphorylation, have not been completely elucidated. Whereas HSP induction was at first interpreted as a signal for detection of physiological stress, it is now well-documented that HSPs are utilized by the cells in the repair process following different types of injury to prevent damage resulting from the accumulation and aggregation of non-native proteins (2). Moreover, HSPs with chaperone function are expressed during normal growth conditions and are induced by biologically active molecules, including several arachidonic acid metabolites (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We reported that cyclooxygenase cyclopentenone metabolites, such as prostaglandins of the A and J type induce the synthesis of the 70-kDa HSP (hsp70) via cycloheximide-dependent activation of HSF1 (5Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and we have shown that induction of hsp70 is associated with a cytoprotective effect of prostaglandins during hyperthermia and virus infection in mammalian cells (6Amici C. Palamara A.T. Santoro M.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During these studies, we came across the interesting observation that prostaglandins, which function as signal for HSF induction, are also potent inhibitors of the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in human cells (8Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-κB is a critical regulator of the immediate early pathogen response and activation of the immune system and is involved in many pathological events, including progression of AIDS (9Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 10Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). In most cells, NF-κB exists in an inactive cytoplasmic complex, the predominant form of which is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 (Rel A) subunits bound to inhibitory proteins of the IκB family, usually IκBα, and is activated in response to primary (e.g. viruses, bacteria, and UV) or secondary (e.g. inflammatory cytokines) pathogenic stimuli (11Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar). Stimulation triggers rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, resulting in NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA at specific κB-sites, rapidly inducing a variety of genes encoding signaling proteins. Target genes include several inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, cytokine receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and viral genes (11Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar), making NF-κB an attractive therapeutic target for novel anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective drugs. We have shown that cyclopentenone prostaglandins inhibit NF-κB activation by preventing IκBα phosphorylation and degradation and that this effect is tightly associated with HSF activation in human cells, suggesting that NF-κB inhibitors might affect HSF activation (8Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We now report that five distinct serine protease inhibitors with chymotrypsin-like specificity, which effectively inhibit NF-κB by interfering with IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (12Henkel T.

Blood. 1995; 86: 2248-2256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are potent inducers of the heat shock response in human cells. Human Jurkat T cells, K562 erythroleukemic cells, HeLa cells, and monkey kidney epithelial MA104 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Jurkat, K562, and MA104 cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa cells) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCIC),N-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine-ethylester (BTEE),N-acetyl-dl-phenylalanine-β-naphthylester (APNE), and trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane (E64) were obtained from Sigma; α-N-acetyl-leu-leu-methioninal (calpain inhibitor II) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. TPCK was dissolved in ethanol; TLCK was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate; DCIC, BTEE, APNE, E64, and calpain inhibitor II were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Cells (106/ml) were stimulated with 25 ng/ml TPA or 10 ng/ml TNFα in the presence of protease inhibitors or the respective control diluent. In dose-response experiments, the control received the maximal concentration of control diluent (0.1%) that in no case affected HSF or NF-κB activation. Unless otherwise specified, cells were treated with protease inhibitors in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum starting 1 h before TPA or TNFα addition. TPA and TNFα were kept in the culture medium for the duration of the experiment. Stimulation was stopped by cooling on ice and immediate centrifugation of cells in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Confluent MA104 monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Indiana serotype (Orsay) (14Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32192-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), 1 plaque-forming unit/cell. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, virus inocula were removed, and monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and different concentrations of DCIC. Control media contained the same concentration of Me2SO diluent, which was shown not to affect cell or virus metabolism. For VSV titration, medium was collected 12 h postinfection, and after removing cell debris by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min, titers were determined by cytopathic effect 50% assay on confluent monolayers of MA104 cells in 96-well tissue culture dishes (six dilutions for each sample, eight wells for each dilution) as described previously (14Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32192-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The dilution that gives 50% cytopathic effect was determined by the interpolating procedure described in Reed and Muench (15Rodriguez-Boulan E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared after lysis in a high-salt extraction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.35 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2% aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin (8Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts (15 μg of protein) were incubated with a 32P-labeled κB DNA probe (16Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a HSE probe (17Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), followed by analysis of DNA binding activities by EMSA. Binding reactions were performed as described (17Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specificity of protein-DNA complexes was verified by immunoreactivity with polyclonal antibodies specific for p65 (Rel A) or for HSF-1, for NF-κB and HSF respectively. Quantitative evaluation of NF-κB-κB element and HSF-HSE complex formation was determined by Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (MDP) analysis. To determine the specificity of HSF1-DNA binding complexes, whole cell extracts from Jurkat cells untreated or treated with 10 μm DCIC for 1 h were preincubated with different dilutions of anti-HSF1 or anti-HSF2 polyclonal antibodies (kindly provided by R. Morimoto, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) for 15 min before electromobility supershift assay (14Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32192-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For electromobility supershift assay of HSF-HSE binding activity in the presence of monoclonal antibodies to phosphoaminoacids, whole cell extracts (10 μg) from Jurkat cells treated with 10 μm DCIC for 1 h or stressed at 42 °C for 20 min were incubated with monoclonal antibodies to phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (clones PSR-45, PTR-8, and PT-66, respectively; Sigma) for 20 min at 21 °C prior to addition of radiolabeled HSE. In vitro run-on transcription reactions were performed in isolated Jurkat nuclei as described (18Banerji S.S. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2437-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled RNA was hybridized with nitrocellulose filters containing plasmids for the following human genes: hsp90 (pUCH5801) (19Elia G.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16111-16118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as a control. Following hybridization, filters were visualized by autoradiography, and the radioactivity was quantitated by MDP analysis. Jurkat or MA104 cells were labeled with l-[35S]-methionine (10 μCi/2 × 105 cells, 1-h pulses) at different times after DCIC addition (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS) containing protease inhibitors. After cell lysis, the radioactivity incorporated into TCA-insoluble material was determined, and an aliquot of samples containing the same amount of radioactivity was separated by SDS-PAGE in a vertical slab gel apparatus (3% stacking gel, 10% resolving gel), and processed for autoradiography and densitometric analysis (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein (50 μg/sample) from Jurkat or MA104 whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and filters were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HSF1 or monoclonal anti-hsp70 antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by decoration with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (8Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E., and P values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Human Jurkat T cells were treated with different concentrations of the serine protease inhibitors DCIC, TPCK, and TLCK. After 1 h, cells were stimulated with the NF-κB inducer TPA in the presence of the inhibitors. One hour after stimulation, whole cell extracts were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine NF-κB and HSF activation. The levels of NF-κB and HSF DNA binding activity were quantitated by MDP analysis. TPA stimulated NF-κB activation, whereas it did not induce HSF. As expected, the serine protease inhibitors prevented the induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity in response to TPA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). DCIC was found to be the most effective compound (NF-κB IC90 = 5.5 μm), followed by TPCK (IC90 = 20 μm) and TLCK (IC90 = 75 μm). Surprisingly, the serine protease inhibitors tested were found to be potent inducers of HSF activation in Jurkat cells. HSF activation was dose-dependent and generally correlated with the NF-κB inhibitory activity of these compounds (Fig. 1). Treatment with two other serine protease inhibitors, BTEE and APNE, also prevented NF-κB activation in TPA-treated Jurkat cells, although at higher concentrations as compared with the compounds described above (APNE, NF-κB IC90 = 300 μm; BTEE, NF-κB IC90 = 400 μm). Both APNE and BTEE were also found to activate HSF at concentrations that inhibited NF-κB (data not shown). In a parallel experiment, Jurkat cells treated with different concentrations of DCIC, TPCK, TLCK, APNE, or BTEE for 1 h were stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml). One hour after stimulation, whole cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA, and the levels of NF-κB and HSF DNA binding activity were quantitated by MDP analysis. Also in this case, inhibition of NF-κB was associated with activation of HSF in cells treated with DCIC, TPCK, and TLCK (Fig. 2), as well as with BTEE and APNE (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of serine protease inhibitors on HSF and NF-κB activation in TNFα-stimulated Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells exposed to different concentrations of DCIC (○, •), TLCK (▵, ▴), TPCK (□, ▪), or control diluent for 1 h were stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml). After 1 h, whole cell extracts from control or TNFα-treated cells were incubated with a32P-labeled HSE probe (top panel) or κB DNA probe (bottom panel), followed by analysis of DNA binding activities by EMSA. Section of fluorograms from native gels are shown (A). Position of HSF, CHBA, and NS (top panel) are indicated as in Fig. 1. Position of NF-κB-DNA complex (NF-κB) and nonspecific binding (ns) are indicated (bottom panel). The levels of NF-κB (•, ▴, ▪) and HSF (○, ▵, □) DNA binding activity was quantitated by MDP analysis and expressed in arbitrary units as fold induction of NF-κB and HSF levels in untreated unstimulated control cells (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether the activation of HSF was temporally correlated with the kinetics of NF-κB inhibition by serine protease inhibitors, Jurkat cells were treated with 10 μm DCIC for 1 h and then stimulated with TPA. The protease inhibitor and TPA were kept in the culture medium for the length of the experiment. At different time intervals after TPA stimulation, whole cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA to determine NF-κB and HSF activation. Under these conditions, TPA alone had no effect on HSF, whereas DCIC was found to activate HSF for a period of several hours (Fig. 3, top panels). In the absence of DCIC, NF-κB was activated 15–30 min after TPA stimulation, and high levels of NF-κB-κB complexes (approximately a 5-fold increase over control) were still detected 24 h after exposure to TPA. As expected, DCIC-treatment inhibited NF-κB activation for at least 6 h after TPA stimulation; however, after 24 h of continuous stimulation in the presence of the protease inhibitor, DCIC had lost its NF-κB-inhibitory activity, and a 3-fold increase in the level of NF-κB-κB complexes was detected (Fig. 3, bottom panels). Interestingly, at this time, DCIC was no longer able to keep HSF in the activated DNA binding state (Fig. 3, top panels). In a different experiment, Jurkat cells were treated with 10 μm DCIC for different lengths of time (1–24 h) prior to TPA stimulation. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA 30 min after TPA addition. The levels of NF-κB and HSF DNA binding activity were quantitated by MDP analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment with DCIC for a period of 6–9 h inhibited NF-κB, whereas HSF was activated. Interestingly, if cells were stimulated with TPA after a 24-h continuous DCIC treatment, when HSF was no longer activated, DCIC failed to inhibit NF-κB induction (Fig. 4, bottom panels), suggesting that the activation of HSF could be interfering with one of the signals involved in NF-κB activation. Consistent with this suggestion, treatment of Jurkat cells with different concentrations of cysteine protease inhibitor E64 and calpain inhibitor II, which were reported not to block NF-κB activation (24Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar), did not induce HSF DNA binding activity in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5).Figure 4Activation of HSF by DCIC is associated with NF-κB inhibition. Jurkat cells were treated with 10 μm DCIC for 1, 3, 6, 9, or 24 h and then stimulated with TPA. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA 30 min after TPA addition.

In vertebrate cells, the heat shock transcriptional response is under the control of a family of heat shock factors, which are negatively regulated. In human cells, HSF type 1 (HSF1) and HSF type 2 (HSF2), even though they share common functional regions, are regulated differently, and whereas HSF2 is activated in differentiation or early development, HSF1 is activated under stress conditions (3Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). We have characterized the type of HSF activated by DCIC. As for heat shock (21Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 22Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), HSF type 1 is the primary component of DCIC-induced HSE binding activity, as determined by electromobility supershift assay after preincubation of whole cell extracts with polyclonal anti-HSF1 or anti-HSF2 antibodies (Fig. 6 A). Heat shock-induced HSF1 activation is known to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis in the case of a mild (42 °C) heat treatment, whereas HSF activation after severe (45 °C) heat shock is independent of cellular protein synthesis (23Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether HSF1 activation by DCIC was dependent on de novo protein synthesis, Jurkat cells were either treated with 10 μm DCIC or were stressed at 45 °C for 20 min, in the presence or in the absence of 100 μm cycloheximide. One hour after DCIC treatment or 20 min after heat shock, whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA. As shown in Fig. 6 B, DCIC-induced HSF1 activation was found to be independent of de novo protein synthesis, because it was not affected by cycloheximide. In order for HSF1 to be transcriptionally active, apart from HSF1 trimerization, nuclear translocation, and binding to heat shock elements, inducible HSF1 phosphorylation appears to be required (22Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Heat shock induces HSF1 phosphorylation (21Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This modification results in the altered mobility of HSF1 on SDS-PAGE (19Elia G. De Marco A. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16111-16118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effect of DCIC as compared with heat shock on HSF1 phosphorylation. Whole cell extracts from Jurkat cells treated with 10 μmDCIC for 1 h or stressed at 45 °C for 20 min were processed by Western blot analysis using anti-HSF1 antibodies. A unique band of HSF1 of approximately 78 kDa was detected in unstressed Jurkat cells (Fig. 6 C). As previously shown in different cell lines (21Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), heat shock caused a significant increase (approximately 12 kDa) in HSF1 molecular size. A similar increase in molecular size was detected in DCIC-treated cells. As previously reported for heat shock (19Elia G. De Marco A. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16111-16118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the increase in HSF1 molecular mass in DCIC-treated cells was due to HSF1 phosphorylation, as shown by Western blot analysis of HSF1 after calf intestinal phosphatase digestion in the presence or the absence of the phosphatase inhibitor NaH2PO4 (data not shown). The fact that anti-phosphoserine monoclonal antibodies caused a change in mobility of the HSF1-HSE complex, whereas anti-threonine and anti-tyrosine antibodies did not, suggests that, similarly to heat shock (22Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), DCIC induced serine and not threonine or tyrosine phosphorylation. 2A. Rossi and G. Santoro, unpublished observation. Finally, HSF1 activation by DCIC is not specific for Jurkat cells; it is detected in HeLa and K562 human cells, as well as in MA104 monkey cells, and is obtained at concentrations that do not inhibit nucleic acid or protein synthesis (data not shown). We have investigated the kinetics of HSF1 activation and phosphorylation by DCIC in the absence of TPA and have determined the rate of hsp mRNA transcription. Whole cell extracts prepared at different times after treatment with 10 μm DCIC were subjected to EMSA, and the levels of HSF1 DNA binding activity in DCIC-treated cells were quantitated by MDP analysis. Induction of HSF1 DNA binding activity by DCIC was detected within 10 min after treatment (data not shown); maximal levels of HSF/HSE complexes were detected between 1 and 6 h and decreased thereafter to go below the control level 24 h after treatment (Fig. 7,A and D). HSF1 was also phosphorylated up to 9 h after DCIC addition (Fig. 7 A, bottom panel). Similar to what has been observed during prolonged heat shock (21Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), the decrease in HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is correlated with the attenuation of HSF1 DNA binding activity and a decrease inhs gene transcription (Fig. 7). In the same experiment, nuclear run-on analysis showed that DCIC induced the transcription of several hs genes and of the glucose-regulatedgrp78/BiP gene, with the hsp70 gene being transcribed at the highest rate (Fig. 7, B–E). Hsp70 mRNA transcription was detected within 1 h of DCIC addition, and transcription rates were maximal by 3–6 h and declined thereafter. High levels of hsp70 mRNA were also detected by Northern blot analysis up to 9 h after DCIC treatment (Fig. 7, C andF). DCIC-induced hsp70 mRNA was efficiently translatedin vivo, and hsp70 protein synthesis, determined by [35S]-methionine incorporation followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography, was sustained for at least 9 h after treatment (data not shown). HSPs have been shown to have cytoprotective activity in a variety of human diseases, including ischemia, inflammation, and infectionin vitro and in vivo (2). In cardiac tissues, HSPs were shown to play a pivotal role in restoring normal cardiac function after injury, possibly by removal of denatured cardiac proteins and re-establishment of normal cardiac protein synthesis (25Mestril R. Chi S. Sayen R. O'Reilly K. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar,26Marber M.S. Walker J.M. Latchman D.S. Yellon D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). HSPs were also shown to protect mammalian cells by tumor necrosis factors α- and β-mediated cytotoxicity (27Iäättelä M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), as well as to suppress astroglial-inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression (28Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Aquino D.A. Li G.C. Xu H. Reis D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17724-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and to prevent lethality in a rodent model of adult respiratory distress syndrome (29Villar J. Edelson J.D. Post M. Brendan J. Mullen M. Slutsky A.S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Elevated intracellular hsp70 levels after treatment with a variety of HSP inducers, including antiviral prostaglandins, sodium arsenite, azetidine, 2-cyclopenten-1-one, and heat shock itself, were also associated with cytoprotection and inhibition of viral protein synthesis during infection with negative-strand RNA viruses (reviewed in Refs. 7Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and 30Santoro M.G. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-Inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhäuser, Basel1996: 337-357Crossref Google Scholar). To investigate whether HSP induction by DCIC was biologically relevant and could result in a cytoprotective effect during viral infection, epithelial monkey kidney MA104 cells were infected with VSV, and immediately after the 1-h adsorption period, cells were treated with DCIC at concentrations that induced hsp70 synthesis. VSV titers were determined 12 h postinfection by cytopathic effect 50% assay. As shown in Fig. 8 A, DCIC was found to inhibit the production of VSV infectious particles in a dose-dependent manner. To determine the effect of DCIC on hsp70 induction and virus protein synthesis, uninfected or VSV-infected MA104 cells were treated with different concentrations of DCIC or with control diluent as described above and labeled with [35S]methionine (8 μCi/2 × 105 cells, 1-h pulse starting 5 h after infection). Equal amounts of protein were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and processed for autoradiography. Viral proteins L, G, N, NS, and M were detected in untreated VSV-infected cells at this time (Fig. 8 B, lane 6). As previously shown for other hsp70 inducers (7Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32192-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Amici C. Giorgi C. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6890-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DCIC treatment selectively inhibited the synthesis of viral proteins L, G, N, NS, and M at concentrations of 30 and 50 μm (Fig. 8 B, lanes 9 and 10, respectively). This effect was associated with hsp70 induction by DCIC (Fig. 8 B, arrows). Inhibition of virus replication was reversible, decreasing 24 h after DCIC addition in concomitance with decreased hsp70 transcription and translation (data not shown). The cytoprotective role of HSPs in several human diseases makes HSP inducers an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. We have now identified serine protease inhibitors as a new class of HSP inducers, acting via HSF1 stimulation. The mechanism by which these molecules activate HSF1 remains to be elucidated. DCIC inhibits serine protease by covalently binding to the catalytic serine and/or histidine residue (32Vijayalakshmi J. Meyer E.F. Kam C. Powers J.C. Biochem. 1991; 30: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TPCK and TLCK are hydrophobic low molecular weight molecules, which penetrate the cell membrane and act intracellularly by reacting irreversibly with the histidine residue in the active center of proteases, with a high affinity for chymotrypsin and chymotrypsin-like enzymes (33Schoellmann G. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1962; 2: 252-259Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, an involvement of serine proteases in HSF activation has never been described. HSF1 itself is not a labile protein (21Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), and short-lived regulators of HSF are not known. Both TLCK and TPCK can covalently modify -SH groups of proteins, altering protein conformation and mobility (34Fisher R.J. Koizumi S. Kondoh A. Mariano J.M. Mavrothalassitis G. Bhat N.K. Papas T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17957-17965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DCIC has also been shown to directly modify and inhibit the activity of nonproteolytic proteins (35Rusbridge N.M. Beynon R.I. FEBS J. 1990; 268: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Finco T. Beg A. Baldwin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because protein modification is a well-recognized signal for HSF activation (3Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), it could be argued that these molecules act by provoking protein alterations either directly or by inhibiting protease function. In particular, inhibition of chymotrypsin-like proteases could cause a rise in the levels of hydrophobic peptides, which would be expected to be powerful inducers of the heat shock response (37Lu W. Apostol I. Qasim M.A. Warne N. Wynn R. Zhang W.L. Anderson S. Chiang Y.W. Ogin E. Rothberg I. Ryan K. Laskowski Jr., M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 441-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The accumulation of abnormal proteins and/or the inhibition of the degradation of a key regulatory factor were hypothesized to be responsible for increased hsp and ER chaperone mRNA levels in canine kidney cells treated with a variety of proteasome inhibitors, including the peptide aldehyde MG132 (38Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We have recently found that MG132 is also a potent activator of HSF1 in Jurkat cells.2However, it should be pointed out that other protease inhibitors, including cysteine protease inhibitors and calpain inhibitors, did not activate HSF1. The possibility that HSF1 activation by DCIC could be triggered by blocking the function of a specific serine protease or could be the result of direct binding of DCIC to selected target proteins, including HSF1 itself, cannot be ruled out. Serine protease inhibitors have been widely used as a tool to investigate the role of NF-κB in inflammation and virus infection (13Higuchi M. Singh S. Chan H. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 2248-2256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kim H. Lee H., S. Chang K.T. Ko T.H. Baek K.J. Kwon N.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4741-4748PubMed Google Scholar, 40Conant K. Ma M. Nath A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that these and future studies have to be evaluated in a new context, in which the effect of the activation of the heat shock response by these molecules is considered. Also, the finding that NF-κB inhibition by serine protease inhibitors, as well as by several other HSF inducers (8Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), is strictly associated with HSF1 activation suggests a link between the regulatory pathways of these two important transcription factors. Unlike other protease inhibitors, the serine protease inhibitors that we examined block not only the proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα but also its phosphorylation (36Finco T. Beg A. Baldwin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 41DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas they induce HSF1 phosphorylation, suggesting the possibility of a controlling mechanism involving kinase modulation. Triggering of HSF1 activation could render cells unresponsive to stimulation of NF-κB. This hypothesis is very attractive, considering the opposite roles of HSF and NF-κB in cytoprotection and cell injury, respectively, as in the case of inflammation (27Iäättelä M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 28Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Aquino D.A. Li G.C. Xu H. Reis D.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar), and suggests novel therapeutic strategies relying upon simultaneous switching on of cytoprotective genes and down-regulation of inflammatory and viral genes.

https://openalex.org/W2063336360,"The two neurotensin receptor subtypes known to date, NTR1 and NTR2, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors with seven putative transmembrane domains (TM). SR 48692, a nonpeptide neurotensin antagonist, is selective for the NTR1. In the present study we attempted, through mutagenesis and computer-assisted modeling, to identify residues in the rat NTR1 that are involved in antagonist binding and to provide a tentative molecular model of the SR 48692 binding site. The seven putative TMs of the NTR1 were defined by sequence comparison and alignment of bovine rhodopsin and G-protein-coupled receptors. Thirty-five amino acid residues within or flanking the TMs were mutated to alanine. Additional mutations were performed for basic residues. The wild type and mutant receptors were expressed in COS M6 cells and tested for their ability to bind125I-NT and [3H]SR 48692. A tridimensional model of the SR 48692 binding site was constructed using frog rhodopsin as a template. SR 48692 was docked into the receptor, taking into account the mutagenesis data for orienting the antagonist. The model shows that the antagonist binding pocket lies near the extracellular side of the transmembrane helices within the first two helical turns. The data identify one residue in TM 4, three in TM 6, and four in TM 7 that are involved in SR 48692 binding. Two of these residues, Arg327 in TM 6 and Tyr351 in TM 7, play a key role in antagonist/receptor interactions. The former appears to form an ionic link with the carboxylic group of SR 48692, as further supported by structure-activity studies using SR 48692 analogs. The data also show that the agonist and antagonist binding sites in the rNTR1 are different and help formulate hypotheses as to the structural basis for the selectivity of SR 48692 toward the NTR1 and NTR2.

Many neuropeptide receptors belong to the family of GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane domain; NT, neurotensin; NTR1, neurotensin receptor 1; NTR2, neurotensin receptor 2; r, rat; m, mouse; h, human; IP, inositol phosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane domain; NT, neurotensin; NTR1, neurotensin receptor 1; NTR2, neurotensin receptor 2; r, rat; m, mouse; h, human; IP, inositol phosphate.with seven putative transmembrane domains (TMs). The past decade has witnessed the discovery of a number of nonpeptide antagonist ligands of GPCRs for neuropeptides such as cholecystokinin, tachykinins, or angiotensin (1Woodruff G.N. Hughes J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 469-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Watling K.J. Krause J.E. Trends Pharmacol.

Toxicol. 1992; 32: 135-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Most often, these compounds are selective for a given neuropeptide receptor subtype and, unlike peptides, cross the blood-brain barrier. As such, they have proven extremely useful for exploring the central and peripheral physiopathological functions associated with the receptor they antagonize. It seems to be a general feature that peptide agonist and nonpeptide antagonist bind to distinct epitopes of GPCRs. Site-directed mutagenesis of GPCRs, like vasopressin, tachykinins, or angiotensin receptors, has allowed for the determination of several conserved or specific residues that are involved in agonist and/or antagonist binding (4Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.-N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol.

In some studies, mutagenesis data were complemented by computer-assisted modeling to construct tridimensional models of ligand-receptor complexes (7Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 7-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This approach has led to the proposal of spatial models for the binding sites of a number of GPCRs that interact with small nonpeptide ligands (4Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.-N. Elands J.

Multiplication of such tridimensional models of GPCRs, depicting the binding site for nonpeptide antagonists, would define a general binding epitope for these small nonpeptide ligands. This approach will be of great interest for the design of new selective high affinity molecules. The neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) exerts central actions that include hypothermia (10Bissette G.

The NTR1 has high affinity for NT, whereas the NTR2 has lower affinity for the peptide and is selectively recognized by levocabastine, an anti-histamine H1 receptor antagonist (14Tanaka K. Masu M.

In the present study we attempted, through mutagenesis and computer-assisted modeling, to identify residues in the NTR1 that are involved in antagonist binding and to provide a tentative molecular model of the SR 48692 binding site. Because of the hydrophobic and aromatic nature of SR 48692 (Fig. 1), we initially chose to mutate hydrophobic and aromatic residues present in or close to the putative TMs of the NTR1 (Fig. 2). The wild type and mutant receptors were expressed in COS M6 cells and tested for their ability to bind125I-NT and [3H]SR 48692. A first tridimensional model of the SR 48692 binding site in the NTR1 was constructed using bacteriorhodopsin as a template (23Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). SR 48692 was docked into the receptor, taking into account the mutagenesis data for orienting the antagonist in the transmembrane region. This initial model pointed to a number of hydrophilic residues (Met, Thr, His, Gln, Lys, and Arg) that might also interact with SR 48692 (Fig. 2), thus leading us to construct and test a second series of mutant receptors.Figure 2Alignments of the sequences in the seven transmembrane domains of rNTR1, hNTR1, rNTR2, mNTR2, and bovine rhodopsin (bR).

Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). Recently, structural data on the arrangement of the transmembrane helices of rhodopsin, the prototype GPCR, has become available (24Unger V.M.U. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,25Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 213: 899-929Google Scholar). Therefore, the representation of the SR 48692-NTR1 complex reported here was achieved by using rhodopsin instead of bacteriorhodopsin as a template for modeling the NTR1 and by positioning SR 48692 into the core of the seven helices so as to fit the mutagenesis data. Our model identifies a number of residues in TMs 6 and 7 that are involved in SR 48692 binding. Two of these residues, Arg327 in TM 6 and Tyr351 in TM 7, play a key role in antagonist/receptor interactions. The data also show that the agonist and antagonist binding sites in the rNTR1 are different. Finally, they help formulate hypotheses as to the structural basis for the selectivity of SR 48692 toward the NTR1 and NTR2. Neurotensin was from Neosystem and SR 48692, SR 48527, and SR 49711 (Fig. 1) from Sanofi Recherche. Monoiodo-[125I-Tyr3]neurotensin (125I-NT) was prepared as described in Ref. 26Bidard J.N. de Nadai F. Rovere C. Moinier D. Laur J. Martinez J. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Biochem.

The rNTR1HindIII-NotI fragment, 1.45 kilobase pairs corresponding to the total reading frame plus the 5′-noncoding end, was used as a template for oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (27Botto J.M.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurogentec. Correct sequences of the mutant receptors cDNA were verified by ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit following the manufacturer's protocol. TheHindIII-NotI fragments were then subcloned into pcDNA3 eucaryotic vector (Invitrogen). Restriction and modification enzymes were from Eurogentec. COS M6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Dutcher) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). For transient transfection, 100-mm cell culture dishes seeded with 106 cells the day before were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (200 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min with 1 μg of recombinant pcDNA3 plasmid in the presence of DEAE-dextran (0.5 mg/ml) at room temperature. After 3 h in culture medium supplemented with 100 μm chloroquine, cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and cultured for 48–72 h. Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, collected in ice-cold 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. After homogenization by repeated passages through a syringe needle and centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 × g, cell membranes were resuspended in 500 μl/dish of 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. Membrane protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. 24 h after transfection with the wild type rNTR1 or the R327M receptor, cells were trypsinized and grown for 18 h in 12-well plates in culture medium in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [3H]myo-inositol (ICN). After two washes with Earle buffer (25 mm Hepes, 25 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of 20 mm LiCl in Earle buffer, with or without increasing concentrations of antagonists. Then, NT was added at the indicated concentrations in 10 μl of Earle buffer for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by 750 μl of ice-cold 10 mm HCOOH. After 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and neutralized by 3 ml of 5 mmNH4OH. Total [3H]inositol phosphates (IP) were separated from free [3H]inositol on Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) chromatography by eluting successively with 5 ml of water and 4 ml of 40 mm and 1 m ammonium formate buffer, pH 5.5. The radioactivity contained in the 1 m fraction was counted after addition of 5 ml of EcoLume (ICN). Binding experiments for the two radioligands were carried out with 1–100 μg of cell membrane proteins in a final volume of 250 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.8 mm1,10-phenantroline, for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold buffer and filtration on cellulose acetate filter (0.2 μm, Sartorius) followed by two washes of the tube and filter with 2 ml of the same buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand. For saturation experiments, concentrations of radioligand ranging from 0.01 to 2 nm for 125I-NT or from 0.1 to 10 nm for [3H]SR 48692 were tested. For competitive inhibition experiments, increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands were incubated with 0.05 nm125I-NT. Saturation and competition data were analyzed by the LIGAND program (28Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). B max values derived from saturation binding data with either radioligand did not vary by more than 50% for a given receptor between different transfection experiments. However, they ranged from 0.1 to 10 pmol/mg protein for125I-NT binding and from 1 to 30 pmol/mg protein for [3H]SR 48692 binding among the wild type and mutant receptors. For a given receptor, the B max value for the antagonist was two to five times higher than that for the agonist. This is due to the fact that, in the concentration range used,125I-NT labels only those binding sites that are in a high affinity conformation, as described previously (22Labbé-Jullié C. Botto J.M. Mas M.V. Chabry J. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Gully D. Maffrand J.P. Kitabgi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1050-1056PubMed Google Scholar). The rNTR1 sequence was aligned by means of the “Viseur” software 2F. Campagne, J. M. Bernassau, and B. Maigret; http://www.ictn.u-nancy.fr/viseur/viseur.html. with those of the hNTR1, the rNTR2, and mNTR2, other GPCRs, and bovine rhodopsin (25Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 213: 899-929Google Scholar) to define by sequence comparison the regions in the rNTR1 that would most likely correspond to the seven putative TMs thought to exist in all such receptors. These domains are shown in Fig. 2. A three-dimensional model of the TMs of the rNTR1 was built using the Sybyl program by substituting each rhodopsin residue side chain by the corresponding one in the rNTR1 sequence. Then, a global minimization was effected by the Powel method with a dielectric constant value of 4 and with fixed Kollman charges and essential hydrogen atoms, while freezing the helical backbone. Sixteen aromatic and 6 hydrophobic residues located within TMs 1–7 or near the junction between the TMs and the extracellular domains of the rNTR1 were mutated into Ala (Fig. 2 and TableI). The wild type and mutant receptors were expressed in COS M6 cells, and saturation experiments with either125I-NT or [3H]SR 48692 were performed with membranes prepared from each transfectant. K d values for both ligands are shown in Table I. Mutations of the rNTR1 in TMs 1, 3, 4, and 5 did not affect the affinity of either ligand. In contrast, mutations Y324A and F331A in TM 6, and Y351A and Y359A in TM 7, yielded receptors that showed no measurable [3H]SR 48692 binding. In addition, the F358A mutation in TM 7 produced a 3-fold decrease in antagonist affinity. These mutations either did not affect the affinity of NT (Y324A, F358A, and Y359A) or resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity (F331A, Y351A) (Table I). Interestingly, the Y347A mutation in TM 7 led to an apparent loss of agonist binding without change in antagonist affinity (Table I).Table IKd and Ki values for neurotensin and SR 48692 binding to wild type and mutated rNTR1TMMutationK d,K iaK i values in nm were derived from competition binding experiments with unlabeled NT and SR 48692 as the competitors and 125I-NT as the labeled ligand.

Open table in a new tab COS M6 cells were transfected with wild type and mutated rNTR1s and used for binding assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” K d values in nm were derived from Scatchard analysis of saturation binding experiments employing either 125I-NT or [3H]SR 48692 as labeled ligand. To determine the decrease in antagonist binding affinity for those mutant receptors that did not measurably bind [3H]SR 48692, competition experiments with unlabeled SR 48692 and NT were performed using 125I-NT as the labeled ligand (Fig. 3). K i values were thus derived for both competitors and are shown in Table I. The Y351A mutant, the Y324A and F331A mutants, and the Y359A mutant exhibited 200-fold, 20-fold, and 5-fold increases in K i values for SR 48692, respectively, as compared with the wild type rNTR1. The data also confirmed the decreased antagonist affinity of the F358A mutant and the decreased agonist affinity of the F331A and Y351A mutants observed in saturation experiments. An initial model of the rNTR1 was constructed using bacteriorhodopsin as a template. SR 48692 was docked into the model, taking into account the above mutagenesis data. Visual inspection of the SR 48692-rNTR1 complex predicted that a number of hydrophilic residues might interact with the antagonist. In particular, it suggested that the carboxylic function of the antagonist might form an ionic link with either one of four basic residues in the rNTR1, i.e. Arg143 in TM 3, Lys235near TM 5, Arg327 and Arg328 in TM 6. The model also predicted that Met204 and/or Met208 in TM 4 might interact with the adamantane moiety of SR 48692 and that one or several threonine, histidine, or glutamine residues (Thr68in TM 1, Thr156 in TM 3, Gln239 and Thr242 in TM 5, His325 in TM6, and His348 and Thr354 in TM 7) might stabilize the receptor-antagonist interaction. To assess the above predictions, additional mutant receptors were constructed and tested in binding and pharmacological experiments. The M204A mutation did not significantly affect the binding affinity of either SR 48692 or NT (Table II). In contrast, the M208A mutant exhibited a 10-fold increase inK i for the antagonist and a 6-fold increase inK i and K d for NT, as compared with the wild type rNTR1 (Table II). The T354A mutant showed a 5–6-fold decrease in SR 48692 affinity and no change in NT affinity. The T68A, T156A, Q236A, T242A, H325A, and H348A mutants bound SR 48692 and NT with the same affinity as the wild type rNTR1.Table IIKd and Ki values for neurotensin and SR 48692 binding to wild type and mutated rNTR1TMMutationK d,K iaK i values in nm were derived from competition binding experiments with unlabeled NT and SR 48692 as the competitors and 125I-NT as the labeled ligand.

https://openalex.org/W2120689448,"Brief ethanol exposure inhibits L-type, voltage-gated calcium channels in neural cells, whereas chronic exposure increases the number of functional channels. In PC12 cells, this adaptive response is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), but the PKC isozyme responsible is unknown. Since chronic ethanol exposure increases expression of PKCδ and PKCe, we investigated the role these isozymes play in up-regulation of L-type channels by ethanol. Incubation with the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X or expression of a PKCδ fragment that inhibits phorbol ester-induced PKCδ translocation largely prevented ethanol-induced increases in dihydropyridine binding and K+-stimulated 45Ca2+uptake. A corresponding PKCe fragment had no effect on this response. These findings indicate that PKCδ mediates up-regulation of L-type channels by ethanol. Remaining responses to ethanol in cells expressing the PKCδ fragment were not inhibited by GF 109203X, indicating that PKCδ-independent mechanisms also contribute. PKCδ overexpression increased binding sites for dihydropyridine and L-channel antagonists, but did not increase K+-stimulated45Ca2+ uptake, possibly because of homeostatic responses that maintain base-line levels of channel function. Since L-type channels modulate drinking behavior and contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability during alcohol withdrawal, these findings suggest an important role for PKCδ in alcohol consumption and dependence."

Thus, coexpression of α and β subunits in vivo could be a way of regulating maxi-K channel activity. Whereas maxi-K channels present in different smooth muscle tissues (e.g. aorta (2Giangiacomo K.M.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) appear to be composed of both α and β subunits, the composition of these channels in other tissues remains to be determined. For example, there is evidence in brain that α subunits are expressed in the absence of the β subunit that is present in smooth muscle (11Chang C.-P. Dworetzky S.I. Wang J. Goldstein M.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Tseng-Crank J. Godinot N. Johansen T.E. Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Mertz R. Foster C.D. Olesen S.-P. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl.

However, brain maxi-K channels may possess a unique β subunit as indicated from cross-linking experiments employing rat brain membranes and the selective maxi-K channel blocker, monoiodotyrosine-iberiotoxin-D19Y/Y36F (125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F; Ref. 13Koch R.O.A.

The identity and functional characteristics of this putative novel β subunit must still be determined. How the smooth muscle β subunit alters the overall conformation of α in such a way that transitions to the channel open state are more favored is unknown. Recently, the extracellular N terminus ofhSlo together with the first transmembrane domain, S0, have been postulated to contribute to the functional interaction between α and β (14Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14922-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This notion is derived from experiments in which functional coupling of α and β was assessed with a series of chimeric proteins containing domains ofhSlo and the Drosophila homologue ofhSlo, dSlo, that does not couple functionally to β. It is not known, however, whether the β subunit anddSlo do in fact associate; it is only clear that such an association does not yield functional consequences. Experiments monitoring binding of monoiodotyrosine-charybdotoxin (125I-ChTX) to membranes derived from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with either α or α + β subunits of the maxi-K channel indicate that the β subunit enhances ligand affinity by ∼50-fold under low ionic strength conditions due to effects on both toxin association and dissociation kinetics (15Hanner M. Schmalhofer W.A. Munujos P. Knaus H.-G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These data, together with results derived from cross-linking experiments, which place Lys69 of β at a maximal distance of 11 Å from Lys32 of ChTX when toxin is bound in the vestibule of α, indicate that some residue(s) of the large extracellular loop of β are in close proximity to the vestibule of the channel's pore (16Munujos P. Knaus H.-G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10771-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,17Knaus H.-G. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23336-23341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues could either participate in the formation of the ChTX receptor or alter the conformation of α allosterically so as to cause an increase in the affinity for ChTX. In the present study, we performed Ala scanning mutagenesis of residues in the extracellular loop of β to identify those that contribute to high affinity binding of 125I-ChTX, after coexpression with the α subunit. Our results indicate that the four Cys residues in the loop form disulfide bridges, which should lead to a more restricted conformation of β, and that four residues, Leu90, Tyr91, Thr93, and Glu94, are crucial for high affinity binding of 125I-ChTX. Based on the effects of these mutations on kinetics of ligand association and dissociation, it is suggested that these residues are important for conferring an appropriate conformational change in α that provides the large increase in ChTX binding affinity. A preliminary report of these findings has appeared in abstract form (18Hanner M. Schmalhofer W.A. Vianna-Jorge R. Kamassah A. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A112Google Scholar).

For saturation experiments, membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-ChTX at room temperature until equilibrium was achieved (e.g. 3–4 h). The kinetics of ligand dissociation were determined by addition of 10 nmChTX to receptor-bound 125I-ChTX and incubating at room temperature for different periods of time. Separation of bound from free ligand was achieved using filtration protocols as described (19Vazquez J. Feigenbaum P. Katz G. King V.F. Reuben J.P. Roy-Contancin L. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J.

The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was homogenized again. Combined supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. Aliquots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C. TsA-201 membranes were biotinylated by incubation with 0.2 mm3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin, at room temperature for 5 min. 3-(N-Maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin was added from a fresh 50 mm stock solution prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide.

Soluble α·β complexes (600–1000 ml) were diluted 3-fold by addition of chilled water and incubated with an anti-β(118–132) antibody column that had been equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, for 12 h at 4 °C. Afterward, the column was extensively washed with equilibration buffer, and bound material was eluted stepwise by addition of 0.2 mglycine/HCl, pH 2.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, neutralized by addition of NaOH and subjected to Western blot analysis using either affinity-purified anti-α (913–926) or anti-β(118–132), as described previously (15Hanner M. Schmalhofer W.A. Munujos P. Knaus H.-G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Data from saturation experiments were analyzed according to the equation B =B max/[1 + (K d/L)nH], whereB max is the maximum number of receptors,K d is the dissociation constant, nH is the pseudo-Hill coefficient, and L is the free ligand concentration. The dissociation rate constant (k −1) was determined directly from the first order plot of ligand dissociation versus time. The bovine maxi-K channel β subunit contains five Cys residues, all of which are conserved among various species such as rat, dog, and human. Four of these Cys residues are located in the large extracellular loop of the protein that connects the two transmembrane domains, whereas the fifth residue resides near the intracellular surface at the beginning of the first transmembrane domain. To determine whether any of these residues plays a role in the process by which the β subunit influences 125I-ChTX binding activity, individual Cys residues were substituted with Ala, and the effects of these mutations on 125I-ChTX binding were analyzed after coexpression with the α subunit. These studies were performed under two experimental conditions: (a) using saturation binding protocols where measurements were made at equilibrium and (b) by monitoring the time course of125I-ChTX dissociation. Fig. 1 A shows the results of saturation experiments in which the ratio of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) of mutantversus K d of wild type is plotted against the corresponding Cys residue changed for each mutation. In Fig. 1 B, a plot of the ratio of the dissociation rate constant (k −1) of mutant versus wild type is also presented as a function of the Cys residue mutated. In these plots, a ratio of 1 indicates that the behavior of the mutant is identical to wild type, whereas a ratio >1 reflects decreased binding at equilibrium or an increase in the rate of dissociation as a result of the amino acid substitution. When the behavior of the Cys18 → Ala substitution is considered, it is clear that this mutation has no effect on the ability of the β subunit to modulate 125I-ChTX binding. However, the results are markedly different when mutations at the other Cys residues are investigated. Thus, substitution of individual Cys residues, Cys53, Cys76, Cys103, or Cys135, leads to dramatic changes in the properties of the125I-ChTX binding reaction; both K d andk −1 are altered in these mutants. Since the effect of these mutations on the K d value is larger than on k −1, it is predicted that the rate constant of association (k +1) is also decreased in these mutations. Multiple substitution of Cys residues produce similar effects on 125I-ChTX binding as those observed with single amino acid changes (Fig. 1, A and B). The large effects observed with the four Cys mutations in this β subunit could be explained if these residues are forming pairs of disulfide bridges that are important for maintaining the protein's tertiary structure. In this case, the conformation of the loop would be largely restricted, and altering such conformation might diminish the contribution of the β subunit to stimulating 125I-ChTX binding. To determine whether or not extracellular Cys residues of the maxi-K channel β subunit are forming disulfide bridges, we subjected membranes derived from TsA-201 cells that had been transiently transfected with both α and β subunits to reaction with the sulfhydryl reagent, N-biotin-maleimide. Subsequently, the β subunit was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized using a streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. To facilitate these studies, we employed in the control the substitution Cys18 → Ala, since this mutation has no effect on 125I-ChTX binding and eliminates a potential sulfhydryl reactive center in the protein. Fig. 2 shows the results of these experiments. The β subunit Cys18 → Ala mutant did not display any significant reaction under these detection conditions (lane 2), although the presence of the protein could be detected in parallel Western blot experiments employing an antibody against the β subunit (data not shown). Likewise, the β subunit in which all Cys residues have been mutated did not give a reaction (lane 3). In marked contrast, all β subunit constructs in which one of the extracellular Cys residues had been changed to Ala gave a strong signal upon reaction with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (lanes 4–7). These results strongly suggest that extracellular Cys residues in the β subunit form disulfide linkages, because there is no reaction of the native protein with the sulfhydryl reagent. When a single Cys residue other than Cys18 is mutated, a free sulfhydryl group becomes available that can now react with N-biotin-maleimide. Attempts, however, to define the pairing of disulfide bridges in the β subunit by performing the same experiments with combinations of double Cys mutants gave inconsistent results. Apparently, large conformational changes are induced under these conditions which may lead to the formation of mismatched disulfide bridges. To determine which residue(s) of the β subunit participate in the large increase in 125I-ChTX binding affinity that is observed after coexpression with the pore forming subunit, we first focused on anionic residues that are present in the extracellular loop of the protein. We reasoned that since ChTX is a highly positively charged molecule, some or all of the effects of the β subunit on toxin binding might be due to interaction between positively charged residues in the toxin with negatively charged residues in the β subunit. There are 16 anionic residues in the extracellular loop of the bovine β subunit. Of these 16 residues, only five are not conserved in the rat and human homologues. All 16 residues of the bovine β subunit were mutated individually, or in combination, to Ala and the consequences of these mutations were analyzed with respect to 125I-ChTX binding after their coexpression with the α subunit. Results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 3. Neutralization of the charge on most residues, whether done individually or as combinations, has no effect on 125I-ChTX dissociation kinetics. Similar results were obtained by monitoring125I-ChTX binding under equilibrium conditions (data not shown). However, Glu94 → Ala produces marked changes in toxin binding. This alteration is observed regardless of whether Glu94 is neutralized by itself or if it is neutralized along with other negatively charged residues. In the later case, the effects noted on toxin binding were no different from those observed with the single Glu94 → Ala mutation. It is worth mentioning that Glu94 is a conserved residue among different species. Interestingly, Asp95, which is also a conserved residue and which lies next to Glu94, does not appear to significantly influence toxin binding. Ala scanning mutagenesis of negatively charged residues in the extracellular loop of the β subunit demonstrated that only Glu94 appears to be important for modulating 125I-ChTX binding. Since these mutagenesis studies cover residues spanning almost the entire extracellular region of β, we next concentrated our attention on those residues surrounding Glu94 that are located between Cys76 and Cys103. As before, the effects of mutations of these residues were analyzed on 125I-ChTX binding after coexpression of each modified β subunit with the pore forming subunit of the channel; the results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 4. Most of these Ala substitutions produced no effect on either equilibrium binding (Fig. 4 A) or toxin dissociation kinetics (Fig. 4 B). There are, however, three additional residues that when mutated caused large changes in 125I-ChTX binding affinity. In addition to Glu94, which has been reported above, mutations at Leu90, Tyr91, and Thr93 caused pronounced effects on the ability of the β subunit to increase125I-ChTX binding. The major effect is observed for Leu90, whose alteration results in a destabilization of toxin binding by about 1.75 Kcal/mol when equilibrium binding is assessed. All of these mutations are also expected to cause changes in association kinetics, since the effects observed onK d are larger than those found onk −1 values. It is interesting to note that mutation of His92, located between the four critical residues, is itself without effect. Moreover, the four critical residues are all conserved between different species. An important question arises as to whether the effects produced by these mutations are caused by lack of association of α and β subunits into a functional complex or are the consequence of changing the binding properties conferred by a particular residue. Preliminary evidence, which favors the idea that α and mutant β subunits are indeed associated together, and that the observed effects are due to specific changes in binding affinity caused by these amino acid substitutions, comes from the analysis of 125I-ChTX dissociation kinetics. Fig. 4 C shows results from such experiments in which wild type α, or α and β, are compared with mutations containing Leu90, Tyr91, and Thr93 substitutions. It is apparent that in all cases the data can be fit to first order reactions; this is consistent with the existence of a single class of toxin binding sites for all α/mutant β pairs examined. All relevant mutations significantly enhance toxin dissociation kinetics, but the rates of dissociation"

Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The activities of Cdks are regulated through a number of mechanisms, including phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue by Cdk-activating kinase (CAK, cyclin H/Cdk 7) (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). In addition, individual Cdks are temporally activated by their cognate cyclins, whose expression is induced in certain situations (3Sherr C.J.

The well characterized cyclins are classified into four types, cyclin D, E, A, and B, which are required in the G1, G1/S, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, respectively. Another mechanism of regulation has emerged with the discovery of the Cdk inhibitors (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, CKIs) (4Nasmyth K. Hunt T. Nature. 1993; 366: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Two distinct families of CKIs have been described in mammalian cells. The Cip/Kip family includes the structurally related proteins, p21, p27, and p57, all of which inhibit a variety of Cdk activities (6Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

CKIs of this family share significant homology in their N-terminal region, suggesting that they inhibit cyclin/Cdk activity in a similar manner. The INK4 family, including p15, p16, p18, and p19, is not structurally related to the p21 family, but shares characteristic 4-fold ankyrin repeats and specifically inhibits cyclin D/Cdk4 and cyclin D/Cdk6 kinases (14Serrano M.

Recent reports revealed that several regions within CKI molecules of the Cip/Kip family, including a cyclin binding site(s), a Cdk binding region, and a 310 helix, are involved in the inhibition of cyclin/Cdk activities. On the basis of the crystal structure of cyclin A/Cdk2/p27, the 310 helix region has been proposed to insert itself within the catalytic cleft of Cdk2, mimicking ATP (19Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pattern A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Although this region is well conserved among CKI molecules of the Cip/Kip family, the actual contribution of the 310 helix region to Cdk inhibition remains to be determined. To address this important question, we generated mutants in the 310 helix region of CKIs of the Cip/Kip family and tested their abilities to inhibit cyclin/Cdk activities. Using these mutants, we demonstrate here that the 310 helix is specifically utilized by p57, but not by p21 or p27, for the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2, and is crucial for its growth suppressing function in vivo. Baculoviruses expressing cyclins A, D1, and E were kindly provided by Dr. D. Morgan. pGEX-wild-type p57 was generated by PCR with a 5′ primer (GGA-TCC-CCT-CGA-GGG-GAT-CCC-CCC-GCC-ATG-GAA-CGC-TTG-GCC-TCC) and a 3′ primer (GGA-TCC-GAA-TTC-CTA-TCA-TCT-CAG-ACG-TTT-GCG) using pRcCMV-mouse p57 (courtesy of Dr. S. Elledge) as a template. p57 mutants Δ18–23 and W50G were generated by PCR with the common 5′ (pGEX5′) and 3′ (pGEX3′) primers described in our previous report (20Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and a set of inner primers as follows: CGT-AGC-AGC-CCC-CGG-GGC-GGG-CCT-GTA-GAC-CAC-GAG and TAC-AGG-CCC-GCC-CCG-GGG-GCT-GCT-ACG-CGC-TAT-CAC (for Δ18–23) and CAG-AAC-CGC-GGG-GAC-TTC-AAC-TTC and GTT-GAA-GTC-CCC-GCG-GTT-CTG (for W50G). C-terminally truncated mutants of p57 (Δ75–335, Δ85–335, Δ105–335, and Δ165–335) were also generated by PCR with the pGEX 5′ primer and specific 3′ primers: GAA-TTC-CTC-GAG-CTA-AGCGTA-ATC-TGG-AAC-ATC-GTA-TGG-GTA-CTC-GCT-GTC-CAC-CTC-CAT-CC (for Δ75–335), GTC-GAA-TTC-CTA-AGC-GTA-ATC-TGGAAC-ATC-GTA-TGG-GTA-CAC-CGT-CTC-GCG-GTA-GAA-GGC (for Δ85–335), GTC-GAA-TTC-CTA-AGC-GTA-ATC-TGG-AAC-ATC-GTA-TGG-GTA-GAC-AGC-CAC-GGC-CAC-CGG-GGG (for Δ105–335), and GTC-GAA-TTC-CTA-AGC-GTA-ATC-TGG-AAC-ATC-GTA-TGG-GTA-GGA-GGT-CGC-GAC-CAG-GGT-CAC-CTC (for Δ165–335), respectively. The construction of a C-terminally truncated p21 mutant (Δ72–164) was described in our previous report (20Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). pGEX-p27 wild type was generated by PCR with a 5′ primer (GGA-TCC-CCT-CGA-GGG-GAT-CCC-CCC-GCC-ATG-TCA-AAC-GTG-CGA-GTG) and a 3′ primer (AGG-ACA-GTG-GGA-GTG-GCA-CCT-TCC) using pcDNA3-hp27 as a template, which was derived from pCS2+hp27 (kindly provided by Drs. J. Roberts and M. Ohtsubo) (21Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). 5′ primers for pGEX-p27 and pGEX-p57 were designed to insert between the GST domain and p27 or p57, the same seven-amino acid linker as that used previously for the construction of GST-p21 (20Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This linker increased the ability of CKIs of the GST-Cip/Kip family to inhibit cyclin/Cdk activities. A C-terminally truncated p27 (Δ83–198) was generated by PCR with the common 5′ primer and a 3′ primer: GAA-TTC-CTC-GAG-CTA-AGC-GTA-ATC-TGG-AAC-ATC-GTA-TGG-GTA-GCC-CTT-CTC-CAC-CTC-TTG-CC. A eukaryotic expression construct (pcDNA3-p57) was generated by removing a HindIII/XbaI fragment from pRcCMV-p57 and ligating the fragment into the pcDNA3 vector. pcDNA3-p57HA was generated by PCR using pcDNA3-p57 as a template with a 5′ primer (INV5′) (AAT-GGG-CGG-TAG-GCG-TGT-ACG-GTG) and a 3′ primer (GAA-TTCCTC-GAG-CTA-AGC-GTA-ATC-TGG-AAC-ATC-GTA-TGG-GTA-TCT-CAG-ACG-TTT-GCG-CGG). pcDNA3-p57 mutants were generated using the same set of inner primers described above and the INV5′ primer and a 3′ (INV3′) primer (AGG-ACA-GTG-GGA-GTG-GCACCT-TCC). Overnight cultures ofEscherichia coli transformed with plasmids encoding the GST fusion proteins were diluted 10-fold with fresh medium and were further cultured for 2 h at 37 °C. Recombinant proteins were then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in NETN150 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors: 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Recombinant proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and were washed with NETN100 (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then with 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Purified proteins were eluted in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) and were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Purified proteins were quantitated by densitometric analysis of the bands after SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf9) cells infected with recombinant baculovirus vectors encoding cyclin or Cdk for 48 h were harvested in EBC buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and mixtures of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF, 10 μmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3Vo4). 5 μl of lysates were diluted with 0.3 ml of EBC buffer and were mixed with 0.1 μg of GST or GST-fused p57 proteins. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the complexes were adsorbed to glutathione beads and were washed three times with EBC buffer. Bound proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Sf9 cell lysates containing cyclin/Cdk complexes were mixed with purified, soluble GST or GST-p57 fusion proteins in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Kinase activity was determined at 30 °C for 10–30 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 μm PMSF, 10 μm ATP, and 185 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Either 0.2 μg of soluble GST-pRb or 1 μg of histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as a substrate. The reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography and quantitated using a Fuji imaging analyzer BAS-1500. For the measurement of kinase activity of active cyclin A/Cdk2/p57 complexes, 1 μl of cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes expressed in Sf9 was mixed with increasing amounts of GST-p57 fusion proteins in IP kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μm PMSF, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3 VO4, and 10 μm β-glycerophosphate) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant cyclin A/Cdk2/p57 complexes were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed three times with IP kinase buffer. Beads were then used for the kinase assay as described above. MDAH041 cells (1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were cotransfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3 CD8 and 10 μg of pcDNA3 vector-expressing wild-type p57HA or its mutants, using the calcium precipitation method. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 25 μg/10-cm dish by adding the pcDNA3 empty vector. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells were immunostained with anti-CD8 antibody, counterstained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the DNA content of CD8+(transfected) and CD8− (not transfected) cells using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur (Becton-Dickinson). MDAH041 cells were cotransfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase and 10 μg of pcDNA3 vectors expressing wild-type p57HA or its mutants. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells were lysed in EBC buffer, and β-galactosidase activities in the lysates were determined to normalize the transfection efficiency. The lysates that possessed equivalent β-galactosidase activity were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the exogenously expressed p57HA proteins were detected by anti-HA antibody at 1:1000 (12CA5, Boehringer Mannheim) and enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For measurement of Cdk2-bound p57 proteins, the lysates normalized for β-galactosidase activity were incubated with anti-Cdk2 antibody and precipitated by protein A-Sepharose beads. The precipitated complexes were washed four times in EBC buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Cdk2-bound p57HA proteins were detected using anti-HA antibody. It has recently been reported that CKIs of the Cip/Kip family have contiguous cyclin- and Cdk-binding domains in their N-terminal regions (19Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pattern A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 20Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In the case of p21, the sites responsible for cyclin and Cdk binding are within the regions of amino acids 17–24 (CB1)/146–164 (CB2), and 49–71 (KB), respectively (23Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although CB1 and KB appear to be well conserved among members of the Cip/Kip family (Fig. 1), it remains to be determined whether p57 binds cyclins or Cdks in the same manner as does p21. To address this question, we introduced a deletion or a mutation in either one of the two domains and examined their binding properties. As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type p57 effectively bound all cyclins tested in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Δ18–23 was completely defective in cyclin binding even at the highest amount. In terms of Cdk binding, wild-type p57 bound to Cdk2, but not to Cdk4, in a dose-dependent manner. Substitution of glycine for tryptophan at amino acid 50 in the p57 molecule completely abolished Cdk2 binding, while W50G retained the ability to bind all cyclins (Fig. 2). These results indicate that domains critical for cyclin and Cdk binding are well conserved between p21 and p57. Although two sites, CB1 and CB2, have been reported to be involved in p21 binding to cyclins, our data suggest that in case of p57, the N-terminal site, which corresponds to the CB1 motif of p21, plays a major role in cyclin binding. To clarify the role of the cyclin and/or Cdk binding domains of p57 in the inhibition of cyclin/Cdk activities, we generated GST-fused wild-type p57 and its mutants defective in either cyclin (Δ18–23) or Cdk (W50G) binding, and tested their abilities to inhibit various cyclin/Cdk activities. As shown in Fig. 3, wild-type p57 effectively inhibited cyclin A/Cdk2, cyclin E/Cdk2, and cyclin D1/Cdk4, whereas both Δ18–23 and W50G were defective in kinase inhibitory activities. Thus, both cyclin and Cdk binding domains of p57 seem to be required for the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2, cyclin E/Cdk2, and cyclin D1/Cdk4 activities. We next asked whether cyclin and Cdk binding domains of p57 are sufficient for the inhibition of cyclin/Cdk activities. To address this question, we generated C-terminally truncated mutants of p57 (Δ75–335; p57N) as well as mutants of p21 (Δ72–164; p21N) and p27 (Δ83–198; p27N), and tested their abilities to inhibit cyclin/Cdk activities. All of the C-terminally truncated mutants were as effective as the respective wild-type molecules in inhibiting cyclin D1/Cdk4 (Fig. 4) and cyclin D1/Cdk6 (data not shown). Interestingly, whereas both p21N and p27N inhibited cyclin A/Cdk2 activity to the same extent as wild-type p21 and p27, respectively, p57N completely and specifically lost the ability to inhibit cyclin A/Cdk2 (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with cyclin E/Cdk2 (data not shown). Based on the collective findings, it is suggested that although cyclin and Cdk binding domains are sufficient for the inhibition of Cdk2 and Cdk4 by p21 and p27, these two domains are necessary but not sufficient in themselves for the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2 or cyclin E/Cdk2 by p57, raising the possibility that an additional region(s) may be required. In an attempt to identify the region(s) within the p57 molecule that is required for the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2, we generated p57 mutants serially truncated from the C terminus, and tested their abilities to inhibit cyclin A/Cdk2 activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, Δ85–335 inhibited cyclin A/Cdk2 activity to the same extent as wild-type p57, whereas Δ75–335 (p57N) did not, suggesting that the region between amino acids 75 and 84 is important for the inhibitory function. Recently, elucidation of the crystal structure of the cyclin A/Cdk2/p27 complex has suggested that the 310 helix of p27 (amino acids 85–90) binds to the N-terminal lobe of Cdk2 and is inserted deep within the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP (19Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pattern A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that this insertion may represent an alternative mechanism by which CKIs of the Cip/Kip family inhibit cyclin/Cdk activities. To delineate the functional role of the 310 helix region of p57, we introduced mutations that were assumed to disrupt the ATP-like structure, and tested the mutant molecules for their kinase inhibitory activities. As shown in Fig. 5 B, a mutant of p57 (F79A/Y80A), but not corresponding mutants of p21 or p27, showed a complete loss in the ability to inhibit cyclin A/Cdk2. Similar data were obtained with cyclin E/Cdk2 (data not shown). Thus, the 310 helix region of p57 seems indispensable for the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2. To rule out the possibility that the complete loss of the F79A/Y80A mutant in the ability to inhibit cyclin A or E/Cdk2 activities was due to a defective binding to the kinase complexes, we determined the binding constants to cyclin A or E/Cdk2 complexes. Increasing amounts of GST-fused p57 wild-type and mutant proteins were incubated with cyclin A or E/Cdk2 expressed in insect cells, and the complexes were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. After separation on SDS-PAGE, p57-bound cyclin A or E were detected by Western blotting using anti-cyclin A or E antibodies. As shown in TableI, the K d values of p57N and F79A/Y80A, with mutations within the 310 helix region were only slightly higher (18.6 and 17.9 nm for cyclin A/Cdk2, and 9.9 and 10.3 nm for cyclin E/Cdk2, respectively) than that of wild-type p57 (6.0 nm for cyclin A/Cdk2 and 3.5 nm for cyclin E/Cdk2). Thus it is unlikely that the minor difference in the binding affinity accounts for the complete loss in the ability to inhibit cyclin A or E/Cdk2.Table IBinding constants of derivatives of p57 to cyclin A or E/Cdk2 complexesp57 proteinK dCyclin A/Cdk2Cyclin E/Cdk2nmWild-type6.03.5Δ18–2353.320.8W50G51.515.2p57N (1–74)18.69.9F79A/Y80A17.910.3Increasing amounts of GST-fused wild-type p57 and mutant proteins were incubated with cyclin A or E/Cdk2 complexes expressed in Sf9 cells.

Open table in a new tab Increasing amounts of GST-fused wild-type p57 and mutant proteins were incubated with cyclin A or E/Cdk2 complexes expressed in Sf9 cells.

It has been reported that p21 can be a component of catalytically active kinase complexes, suggesting that it may have other roles than its function as a CKI. To determine whether p57 also forms kinase-active complexes with cyclin/Cdk, we examined the mode of interaction between wild-type p57 or its mutants and cyclin/Cdk complexes. GST-fused wild-type p57 and various mutants were mixed with cyclin A/Cdk2 expressed in Sf9 cells, and the resultant ternary complexes were precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads so that each individual complex contained at least one molecule of p57. As shown in Fig. 6 (upper panel), wild-type p57 formed kinase active complexes with cyclin A/Cdk2 at lower concentrations (3.3 and 10 nm), but kinase activity decreased as more p57 was added, despite the fact that the amount of cyclin A/Cdk2 associated with GST-p57 increased in a dose-dependent fashion (data not shown). These results suggest that not only p21 but also p57 can form kinase-active complexes with cyclin A/Cdk2. Interestingly, all p57 mutants examined (Δ75–335, Δ18–23, W50G, and F79A/Y80A) stimulated the formation of kinase active complexes in a dose-dependent manner and displayed much stronger histone H1 kinase activities than the wild-type molecule at any given concentration (Fig. 6, upper panel). As the same amounts of Cdk2 were still detected in the complexes after routine kinase assay (data not shown), it is unlikely that active cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes may dissociate from mutant GST-p57 proteins during the period of kinase assay. When the specific activities of these complexes were determined based on the kinase activities and the amounts of associated Cdk2, all p57 mutants formed fully active complexes with cyclin A/Cdk2 without any inhibition (Fig. 6,lower panel), indicating that all of the three (cyclin binding, Cdk binding, and 310 helix) regions are indispensable for the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2 activity. To determine whether the 310 helix region of p57 is important for biological function in vivo, we analyzed growth inhibitory activities of wild-type p57 and its mutants. MDAH041 cells were cotransfected with a marker vector, pcDNA3-CD8, and either pcDNA3-wild-type p57 or its mutants (Δ18–23, W50G, or F79A/Y80A). 48 h after the transfection, cells were simultaneously analyzed for CD8 expression, as a marker for transfected cells, and DNA content by two-color flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 7 A, cells transfected with the CD8 expression vector alone showed a DNA content distribution typical of asynchronously growing cells, whether CD8+ (transfected) or CD8− (untransfected), suggesting that the transfection procedure per se had no effect on cell growth. It is also worth noting that in all transfections, CD8− cells had a distribution pattern identical with that of the control cells (Fig. 7 A,upper panel), which allowed us to examine the specific effects of transfected genes on cell cycle regulation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, cells expressing wild-type p57 showed an increased proportion in the G1 phase (79.3% in wild-type/CD8+ versus 51.2% in wild-type/CD8− cells). Δ18–23 and W50G, which lack an inhibitory capacity toward all the cyclin/Cdk combinations (Fig. 3), were defective in arresting cells at the G1 phase. Interestingly, cells expressing the p57 mutant with substitutions in the 310 helix region (F79A/Y80A) completely lost the ability to cause G1 arrest (Fig. 7 A). The expression levels of these mutants were comparable to that of wild-type p57 (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that the decreased ability of certain mutants to inhibit DNA synthesis was not due to changes in their expression levels or in the stability of the proteins. This notion was further supported by the results showing that, when overexpressed, all of the p57 mutants bound to Cdk2 complexes to the same extent as the wild-type protein in vivo (Fig. 7 C). Taken together with the fact that F79A/Y80A retained kinase inhibitory activity toward cyclin D1/Cdk4 and cyclin D1/Cdk6 (data not shown), it is plausible that the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2 activities is crucial for the growth-suppressing function of p57. We have demonstrated in the present study that the interaction of the 310 helix region with Cdk2 forms the basis of a molecular mechanism by which p57, but not p21 or p27, inhibits the kinase activity. From the crystal structure of cyclin A/Cdk2/p27, it has been inferred that the binding of p27 to cyclin and Cdk causes significant conformational changes in the Cdk2 molecule, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity (19Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pattern A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Structural analysis also revealed that the 310 helix region of p27 is inserted within the catalytic cleft of Cdk2, mimicking ATP (19Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pattern A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P.

Although the presence of a conserved 310 helix region among CKIs of the Cip/Kip family raises the possibility that all members of this family inhibit cyclin/Cdk activity in the same manner, our results indicate that the 310 helix motif is specifically utilized by p57, and not by p21 or p27, in selectively inhibiting Cdk2 activity. Extensive structure and function studies on the p21 molecule have suggested that both cyclin and Cdk binding is not only necessary but sufficient for the inhibition of cyclin/Cdk activities (20Nakanishi M.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been proposed that p21 contains two copies of the cyclin-binding motifs, CB1 (amino acids 17–24) and CB2 (amino acids 146–164) (23Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept are our findings that deletion mutants of p21, Δ17–22 and Δ146–164, which lack either one of the two cyclin binding regions, still retained the ability to interact with cyclins A and E, whereas a double mutant (Δ17–22/Δ146–164) completely lost the ability to bind cyclin A, E, or D1. 2Y. Hashimoto, K. Kohri, Y. Kaneko, H. Morisaki, T. Kato, K. Ikeda, and M. Nakanishi, unpublished results. In contrast, deletion mutants of p27 (Δ28–33) and p57 (Δ18–23) failed to interact with cyclins (Fig. 2 and data not shown), suggesting that p27 and p57 contain only one cyclin binding domain. Although the functional domain for Cdk binding seems well conserved among CKIs of the Cip/Kip family, only p27, and not p21 or p57, effectively bound Cdk4 (Fig. 2),2 suggesting that minor differences may exist between members of this family in terms of their binding affinity for specific Cdks. It has been reported that both cyclin and Cdk binding activities of p21 are indispensable for the inhibition of a wide variety of cyclin/Cdk complexes (22Lin J. Reichner C. Wu X. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and the present results indicate that this is also the case with p57 (Fig. 3). While the N-terminal fragments of p21 and p27 (p21N and p27N) containing cyclin and Cdk binding domains were sufficient for the inhibition of all cyclin/Cdk complexes tested, p57N specifically lost the ability to inhibit cyclin A/Cdk2 (Fig. 4) and cyclin E/Cdk2 (data not shown). Moreover, additional 10 amino acids (residues 75–84) encompassing the 310 helix region were required for the effective inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2 (Fig. 5 A) as well as cyclin E/Cdk2 (data not shown). To further substantiate these findings, we tested the effect of mutations within the 310 helix region of p57 (F79A/Y80A) on cyclin A/Cdk2 inhibitory activity. It has been suggested, on the basis of crystal structural analysis of cyclin A/Cdk2/p27, that the position of the tyrosine side chain (corresponding to Tyr-80 of p57) in the catalytic cleft, and its points of contact with Cdk2 are similar to those of the purine base of ATP in the binary complex (19Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pattern A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Although mutations within 310 helix regions of p21 (L76A/Y77A) and p27 (F87A/Y88A/Y89A) did not affect the inhibitory activity toward cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2, the F79A/Y80A mutant of p57 completely lost the ability to inhibit these kinase activities (Fig. 5 B). The minor difference between the F79A/Y80A mutant and wild-type p57 protein in the binding affinity to cyclin A or E/Cdk2 complexes (Table I) does not account for the complete loss of the kinase inhibitory function. Taken together, these results indicate that the 310 helix motif is specifically utilized by p57, and not by p21 and p27, in inhibiting cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2. Another interesting aspect of CKIs of the Cip/Kip family is their ability to form active complexes with cyclin/Cdk (26Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 27Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P.M. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated the interaction of p57 at lower concentrations with catalytically active cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes, but also found that the kinase activity was quenched as more wild-type p57 was added (Fig. 6). These results are consistent with the reported bimodal association of p21 with cyclin/Cdk complexes (26Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 27Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P.M. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p57 mutants, Δ18–23, W50G, and F79A/Y80A, formed kinase-active complexes with cyclin A/Cdk2 without any evidence of inhibition, even at higher amounts (Fig. 6). Thus, multiple cyclin A/Cdk2-interacting modules within the p57 molecule seem to be required to fully inhibit the kinase activity. An important question arises as to whether the inhibitory activity directed toward Cdk2 through the 310 helix motif plays any significant role in the growth-suppressing function of p57 in vivo. The F79A/Y80A mutant, which is specifically impaired with respect to Cdk2 inhibitory function, provides a good tool for addressing this point. Transfection experiments revealed that not only Δ18–23 and W50G, which lack inhibitory activity toward both Cdk4 and Cdk2, but also the F79A/Y80A mutant failed to cause G1arrest (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, the corresponding mutations within the 310 helix regions of p21 (L76A/Y77A) and p27 (F87A/Y88A/Y89A) did not affect the cell cycle distribution whatsoever (data not shown). These results indicate that the Cdk2-inhibiting activity of p57 is essential for its growth-suppressing functionin vivo. Taken together with the recent report suggesting that, in Mv1Lu cells, p27 acts as a cyclin A/Cdk2 inhibitor and not as a cyclin D-Cdk4/6 inhibitor (29Blain S.W. Montalvo E. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25863-25872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that cyclin A and cyclin E/Cdk2 are molecular targets of the cell cycle regulatory activity of both p27 and p57 in vivo. In conclusion, we have provided biochemical evidence that the 310 helix region of p57 is specifically required for the inhibition of cyclin A and E/Cdk2, but not cyclin D/Cdk4, and is crucial for its growth-suppressing function. Specific and functional interactions between the 310 helix region and cyclin A and E/Cdk2 complexes may form the basis of a molecular mechanism by which p57 selectively regulates these kinase activities. Since this inhibition via the 310 helix motif appears to be specific for p57 and not for other members of the Cip/Kip family, p21 and p27 may utilize an as yet unidentified mechanism that differentially regulates Cdk2 and Cdk4 functions.

The guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A) receptor is known to require both atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and an adenine nucleotide for maximal cyclase activation. When membranes from NIH 3T3 cells stably overexpressing GC-A were incubated with ATP, AMPPNP, or ATPγS, only ATPγS dramatically potentiated ANP-dependent cyclase activity. When the membranes were incubated with ATPγS and then washed, GC-A now became sensitive to ANP/AMPPNP stimulation, suggestive that thiophosphorylation had sensitized GC-A to ligand and adenine nucleotide binding. Consistent with this hypo- thesis, the ATPγS effects were both time- and concentration-dependent. Protein phosphatase stability of thiophosphorylation (ATPγS) relative to phosphorylation (ATP) appeared to explain the differential effects of the two nucleotides since microcystin, β-glycerol phosphate, or okadaic acid coincident with ATP or ATPγS effectively sensitized GC-A to ligand stimulation over prolonged periods of time in either case. GC-A was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ32P]ATP, and the magnitude of the phosphorylation was increased by the addition of microcystin. Thus, the phosphorylation of GC-A correlates with the acquisition of ligand sensitivity. The establishment of an in vitro system to sensitize GC-A demonstrates that adenine nucleotides have a daul function in the regulation of GC-A through both phosphorylation of and binding to regulatory sites.

Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Major effects of ANP include the induction of natriuresis and diuresis in the kidney, the inhibition of adrenal gland aldosterone synthesis, and the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (1Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The two major binding proteins for ANP, the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NP-CR) and a guanylyl cyclase-linked receptor (GC-A), are found in the above target tissues as well as in many other regions of the body (1Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although NP-CR, a 65-kDa disulfide-linked dimer, has been suggested to function as a signaling molecule in addition to its role as a clearance receptor (2Anand-Srivastava M.B. Srivastava A.K. Cantin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4931-4934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GC-A appears to mediate a majority, if not all, of the known physiological effects of ANP. Mice lacking genes for either ANP or GC-A display an elevated form of blood pressure that has been suggested as salt-resistant (3John S.W.M. Veress A.T. Honrath U. Chong C.K. Peng L. Smithies O.

Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6215-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Guanylyl cyclases, which catalyze the formation of cGMP, are divided into two classes: one is the family of soluble heterodimeric enzymes that are receptors for NO and possibly CO (8Snyder S.H. Science. 1992; 257: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), and the other is the family of transmembrane receptor-linked enzymes, for which GC-A is a prototypical member (9Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In mammals, 7 transmembrane forms of guanylyl cyclase (GC-A-G) are known to exist (10Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas more than 25 putative guanylyl cyclases have been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (15Yu S. Avery L. Baude E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3384-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These transmembrane proteins share several conserved features, including an amino-terminal extracellular domain separated by a single transmembrane segment from intracellular protein kinase-like and cyclase catalytic domains (10Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GC-A appears to exist as a higher ordered oligomer in the absence of ligand (16Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that ANP binding induces a conformational change, perhaps resulting in relief of protein kinase homology domain inhibition of the cyclase catalytic domain (18Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). ANP binding to GC-A causes dramatic increases in intracellular cGMP levels, and the resultant homologous desensitization has been tightly correlated with GC-A dephosphorylation. Serine and threonine represent the phosphorylated amino acids in the basal state (19Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agents that activate protein kinase-C, such as certain pressor hormones and phorbol esters, also have been shown to desensitize GC-A (20Nambi P. Whitman M. Gessner G. Aiyar N. Crooke S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8492-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Smith J.B. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C147-C150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jaiswal R.K.

This heterologous desensitization also correlates with GC-A dephosphorylation (25Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tryptic phosphopeptide maps of GC-A appear different, dependent on whether desensitization is homologous or heterologous. ANP results in maps indistinguishable from untreated cells, although dephosphorylation occurs, while phorbol esters result in the disappearance of one major tryptic phosphopeptide (25Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ANP, therefore, may cause complete dephosphorylation of a population of GC-A while phorbol esters result in selective dephosphorylation (25Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly, ANP activates a protein phosphatase or induces a GC-A conformation conducive to dephosphorylation by a constitutively active protein phosphatase, whereas phorbol esters activate a protein phosphatase that selectively dephosphorylates due to the absence of ligand. Alternatively, the homologous or heterologous desensitization could result from selective effects on protein kinases. Although a modest ligand-dependent stimulation of purified GC-A occurs showing that other factors are not absolutely required (26Wong S.K.-F. Ma C.-P. Foster D.C. Chen A. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30818-30822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), initial attempts to stimulate the enzyme in broken cell preparations were not successful. Subsequent studies demonstrated an absolute requirement of adenine nucleotides for facilitation of ANP signaling (27Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Chinkers M. Singh S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Acta. 1990; 1052: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since AMPPNP is resistant to hydrolysis by ATPases and protein kinases, but supports some ligand-dependent stimulation of GC-A, it has been suggested that binding of adenine nucleotides is sufficient to generate ligand-dependent stimulation (27Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Chinkers M. Singh S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Acta. 1990; 1052: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The ATP binding site has not yet been identified, but since deletion of or point mutations within the protein kinase homology domain disrupt ANP/ATP-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity, this domain may reflect the adenine nucleotide binding region (18Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 30Koller K.J. de Sauvage F.J. Lowe D.G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,31Koller K.J. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5997-6003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that adenine nucleotides play multiple roles in the activation of GC-A and for the first time demonstrate in vitro sensitization of GC-A to ligand. In a preparation of crude membranes, ATPγS, which can serve as a substrate for protein kinases for thiophosphorylation of proteins, sensitizes GC-A to stimulation with ANP and adenine nucleotides. After ATPγS treatment, even a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, AMPPNP, now facilitates stimulation of GC-A by ANP. However, the activity of the enzyme rapidly declines, presumably recapitulating desensitization. Consistent with dephosphorylation of a site-regulating desensitization, not only does the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin block ligand-induced inactivation while potentiating ANP/ATPγS stimulation, but structurally different phosphatase inhibitors enhance ANP/adenine nucleotide signaling. Furthermore, phosphorylation of GC-A is observed under sensitization conditions, and phosphorylation is increased when microcystin is included in the reaction mixture. Rat ANP was from Peninsula Laboratories. Microcystin-LR and okadaic acid were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cyclosporin A was from Calbiochem. ATPγS and AMPPNP were from Boehringer Mannheim or Sigma, and ATP was from Sigma. NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing GC-A were prepared as described (25Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3GC-A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml biologically active G418. Particulate fractions were prepared by washing confluent 10- or 15-cm plates with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraping cells in 0.75–1 ml of homogenization buffer (HB) (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells from multiple plates were homogenized by sonication and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in HB by passing through a 22-gauge needle ten times, and the membranes were then aliquoted, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) using BSA as a standard and typically ranged between 1.5–2 mg of protein/ml. Membranes were diluted to 1 mg/ml in HB prior to guanylyl cyclase assays. Assays were performed in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.25 mm IBMX, 0.1% BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, 1 mm adenine nucleotide unless otherwise indicated, 1 μm ANP, 0.5 μCi [α32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products, 3000 Ci/mmol), and membranes in a total volume of 100 μl for the indicated times. Phosphatase inhibitors also were included at the indicated concentrations. 3 mm MnCl2 and 0.1% Triton X-100 were included to determine maximal guanylyl cyclase activity. Assays were initiated by the addition of 20 μl (usually 20 μg of membrane protein) of membranes to the above mixture that had been pre-warmed at 37 °C for 20 s and terminated by the addition of zinc acetate/sodium carbonate. [α32P]cGMP was determined as described previously (32Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and was produced in a linear manner as a function of protein concentration. Membranes were incubated at 37 °C with the indicated variables in an assay buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.25 mm IBMX, 0.1% BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, and the indicated concentration of different adenine nucleotide. Reactions were terminated by addition of ice-cold HB (described above) containing 0.2 μm microcystin and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed with HB/microcystin and resuspended in HB with a 22-gauge needle. Membranes were used immediately for guanylyl cyclase assays as described above. The experiment in Fig. 2 contained 0.5 μCi [α32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products, 3000 Ci/mmol) in the initial incubation, and the membranes were not washed before the addition of ligand(s). Membranes were also washed with HB or HB containing 1 m NaCl to determine the effect of washing membranes on either the ability of ATPγS to sensitize GC-A, or microcystin to potentiate ANP/adenine nucleotide-dependent activity. Membranes were washed twice with HB or HB with 1m NaCl and subsequently washed with HB and resuspended in HB by passing through a 22-gauge needle. When the ATPγS effect was examined, membranes were again washed after the incubation with ATPγS reaction mixture that included 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, and 1 mm ATPγS. Differently washed membranes were then subjected to the guanylyl cyclase assay as described. Membranes were incubated with 1 mm ATP and 1 μm okadaic acid for 15 min at 37 °C followed by washing as described above. Membranes were then incubated at 37 °C for increasing times after which they were placed on ice. Some membranes were subsequently incubated with ATPγS reaction mixture that included 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATPγS for 15 min at 37 °C followed by washing as described. Membranes were then subjected to the guanylyl cyclase assay as described. Membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in an assay buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.25 mm IBMX, 0.1% BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, 10 μm ATP, and 200 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in the presence or absence of 0.2 μm microcystin. Reactions were terminated by the addition of immunoprecipitation buffer (HB buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 μmokadaic acid, 80 μm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 10 mm EDTA). After rocking at 4 °C for 60 min, the detergent extract was cleared by centrifugation at 436,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The extract was pre-cleared by initially incubating with a nonspecific antibody (Z660) raised against the carboxyl terminus of GC-C, the heat stable enterotoxin receptor, and protein A-agarose (Pierce). This antibody does not cross-react with GC-A. An antibody (A034) raised against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of GC-A was added to the cleared extract at a dilution of 1:200 and incubated at 4 °C for 60–120 min. Protein A-agarose was also included in this incubation to precipitate immune complexes. Immune complexes were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 1% sodium deoxycholate, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore), and GC-A visualized after autoradiography. 32P was quantitated using the ImageQuant software on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Polyvinylidene fluoride membranes to which immunoprecipitated GC-A had been blotted were blocked for 15 min at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20). Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated for 60 min at room temperature in 1:2500 dilution of antibody (A034) raised against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of GC-A. Membranes were washed and incubated with a 1:30,000 dilution of a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST. After washing the membrane with TBST, protein bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Various groups have demonstrated that adenine nucleotides are required in addition to ANP for maximal GC-A activity; it has been suggested that adenine nucleotide binding and not phosphoryl transfer is the regulatory event since a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP, also facilitates slight ANP stimulation (27Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Chinkers M. Singh S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Acta. 1990; 1052: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The adenine nucleotide binding site has been suggested to be within the protein kinase homology domain of GC-A, but direct measurements of adenine nucleotide binding have not been reported. Although the current model of adenine nucleotide regulation of GC-A suggests that binding to a regulatory site is sufficient for transmission of ANP binding to activation of guanylyl cyclase, a positive correlation exists between the phosphorylation state of GC-A and its sensitivity to ligand (19Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resensitization of GC-A in a broken cell preparation has not been achieved, and it therefore has remained unclear whether phosphorylation merely correlates with the sensitization/desensitization of the receptor or whether it is a primary regulatory event. Crude membranes were obtained from cells stably expressing GC-A and different adenine nucleotides were tested for their ability to stimulate the cyclase in the presence of ANP. The effects of the adenine nucleotides were different, in that ATPγS was markedly more effective that ATP while AMPPNP was almost ineffective in yielding an ANP sensitive receptor (Fig. 1). These results suggested multiple adenine nucleotide requirements for ANP-dependent activation of GC-A, possibly as a substrate for transphosphorylation as well as for binding to a regulatory site. Therefore, membranes were incubated with adenine nucleotides at concentrations that would not themselves yield an ANP-dependent activation of GC-A, and then ANP alone or ANP plus high concentrations of AMPPNP were added to determine whether such a prior incubation would sensitize the receptor. Low concentrations of ATPγS markedly sensitized GC-A to subsequent ANP/AMPPNP stimulation (Fig. 2). AMPPNP at millimolar concentrations in the absence of the first ATPγS incubation failed to significantly stimulate cyclase activity in the presence or absence of ANP. ATP also failed to yield an ANP/AMPPNP sensitive enzyme, but given that thiophosphorylated proteins are known as particularly poor substrates for protein phosphatases (33Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the sensitization of GC-A by prior incubation with low concentrations of ATPγS but not ATP could be explained by the stability of thiophosphorylation. If a relatively stable thiophosphorylation explained the acquisition of a sensitive cyclase, then incubation with ATPγS followed by washing of the membrane preparation should now yield an ANP/AMPPNP-sensitive cyclase. Membranes were initially incubated with ATPγS, no adenine nucleotide, or AMPPNP and then washed, and the resulting membranes were assayed for ANP/AMPPNP-stimulated cyclase activity (Fig. 3 A). Clearly, ATPγS but not AMPPNP sensitized GC-A to subsequent ANP/AMPPNP stimulation, consistent with thiophosphorylation of a regulatory site. When membranes were isolated and subsequently washed with buffers containing 1m NaCl, the ability of ATPγS to sensitize GC-A was retained, suggestive that the proteins required for sensitization are tightly associated with the membrane (Fig. 3 B). When membranes were incubated with 1 mmATPγS for increasing periods of time and washed, the resulting membranes displayed a time-dependent increase in ANP/AMPPNP-sensitive cyclase activity (Fig. 4 A). The membranes incubated without ATPγS lost the slight ANP/AMPPNP responsiveness as a function of time. This was not due to a decreased capacity of the catalytic domain to synthesize cGMP since Mn2+/Triton X-100 activity (a treatment thought to maximally activate the cyclase independent of ligand) remained relatively constant throughout the incubation (Fig. 4 A). The loss in ANP/AMPPNP responsiveness could be explained if a small amount of residual phosphoamino acid at the putative regulatory site was lost during the incubation. Increasing the concentration of ATPγS in the initial incubation also increased ANP/AMPPNP-stimulated cyclase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). The activation by ATPγS was maximal at approximately 500 μm, and the apparent EC50 was about 50 μm. The difference in concentration dependence for ATPγS in the first incubation and adenine nucleotide/ANP in the second incubation, which is similar to the previously reported concentration-dependence for adenine nucleotides (data not shown) (28Chinkers M. Singh S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4088-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by itself suggests different mechanisms of action, but it remained possible that ATPγS became bound to a regulatory site in the first incubation as opposed to serving as a substrate for thiophosphorylation. Thus, AMPPNP was added during the first incubation to determine whether or not it would compete with ATPγS. In fact, AMPPNP effectively blocked ATPγS sensitization of the subsequently washed membranes (Fig. 5). A simple interpretation of these results is that AMPPNP effectively competes with ATPγS to prevent thiophosphorylation. Given that phosphorylation by ATP or thiophosphorylation by ATPγS could explain the acquired sensitivity to ligand, microcystin, a potent Ser/Thr protein phosphatase inhibitor, was tested for its ability to potentiate signaling and/or block desensitization of the ATP- or ATPγS-sensitized receptor. Again, when AMPPNP was the lone adenine nucleotide added, minimal stimulation of GC-A occurred. The presence of microcystin yielded an initially ANP/AMPPNP-sensitive enzyme, but the activity rapidly declined to near zero. As previously shown, ATP was not particularly effective as an activator, but the addition of microcystin now yielded a markedly ATP-sensitive enzyme. Microcystin also potentiated the response to ATPγS (Fig. 6 A). The putative protein phosphatase targeted by microcystin is likely associated tightly with the membrane given that microcystin potentiated an ANP/ATP stimulation of GC-A even after membranes were washed with buffers containing 1m NaCl (Fig. 6 B). Although the effect of microcystin and ATPγS on ANP-stimulated GC-A activity was consistent with inhibition of dephosphorylation of a regulatory site, it remained possible that microcystin acted in another manner. Thus, membranes were incubated with ANP and different adenine nucleotides in the presence of structurally different phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 7). The general phosphatase inhibitor, β-glycerol phosphate, as well as the relatively selective PP1 and PP2A inhibitors, microcystin and okadaic acid, all potentiated GC-A signaling when AMPPNP and ATP were included in the incubation while microcystin and okadaic acid even potentiated the effect of ATPγS. In contrast, cyclosporin A, which inhibits calcineurin when complexed with cyclophilin, had no effect on ANP/adenine nucleotide-stimulated cyclase activity. Phosphorylation is a reversible means by which to regulate numerous physiological processes. The data presented thus far are consistent with a model that phosphorylation of GC-A regulatory sites modulates its sensitivity to stimulation with ANP/adenine nucleotide. Therefore, the reversibility of sensitization was examined. Membranes initially incubated with ATP and okadaic acid acquired the ability to be stimulated with ANP and AMPPNP. This sensitization, however, declined as a function of incubation time at 37 °C after the ATP and okadaic acid had been removed by washing the membranes (Fig. 8). Importantly, the membranes retained an ability to resensitize the now desensitized form of GC-A as demonstrated by the acquisition of ANP/adenine nucleotide sensitivity after a subsequent incubation of membranes with ATPγS. Sensitization by ATPγS was not notably reversible, consistent with the stability of thiophosphorylation relative to phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, the sensitivity of GC-A to ANP is modulated in vitro by apparently altering the phosphorylation state of unidentified regulatory phosphorylation sites. Previous reports demonstrated that dephosphorylation of GC-A correlated with its loss of sensitivity to ANP (19Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a phosphorylation-induced sensitization of GC-A has not been accomplished. Given that conditions to sensitize GC-A have now been established here (Fig. 3) and phosphorylation of a regulatory site appears to represent a mechanism of sensitization, we examined phosphorylation of GC-A under sensitizing conditions. Phosphorylation of GC-A was observed, and clearly the GC-A-associated 32P was increased when microcystin was included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 9, A and B). The increase in 32P was not due to an increased amount of GC-A in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 9 A). Sensitization of GC-A by ATP and microcystin correlated well with GC-A phosphorylation (Fig. 9 C), and thus for the first time, phosphorylation of GC-A is shown to correlate with GC-A sensitivity to stimulation by ANP/adenine nucleotides. This is the first successful sensitization/desensitization of GC-A, a prototype of the other guanylyl cyclase receptors, in a broken cell preparation. Multiple roles for adenine nucleotides in regulation of the receptor are now clearly established based on this work. Phosphorylation of one or more regulatory sites as well as adenine nucleotide binding are required to generate a ligand-sensitive cyclase (Fig. 10). Although it is possible that phosphorylation of other sites participates in different aspects of GC-A regulation, such as ANP-independent activity, phosphorylation of these regulatory sites does not itself appear to alter the nonliganded activity of the receptor. The model now raises a number of important questions. The first is the site(s) of phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate that phosphorylation or thiophosphorylation generates an ANP/AMPPNP-sensitive receptor, however, they do not identify the localization of the regulatory sites. These could be within the cyclase itself or they could reside on associated proteins. We have not established that adenine nucleotide binding is to the cyclase although the presence of the protein kinase homology domain is strongly suggestive that it represents the site of binding. Relatively high (millimolar) concentrations of ATP or AMPPNP are required to facilitate ANP signaling, and thus it remains possible that ATP or AMPPNP mimic the actions of a much more potent nucleotide regulator. The ability to obtain sensitized GC-A in vitro now allows searches for more potent regulators. Importantly, the ability to sensitize GC-A with ATPγS and prevent desensitization with phosphatase inhibitors is retained even after washing membranes with buffers with high salt concentrations, demonstrating that the components required for sensitization and desensitization of GC-A likely reside in the membrane itself (Fig. 3 B and Fig. 6 B). The model also predicts several potential means by which to alter GC-A signaling. Other signaling systems could impinge on the sensitizing protein kinase or the putative desensitizing phosphatase, and given the dual role of adenine nucleotides in activation of GC-A, fluctuations in intracellular levels of ATP or of another regulatory nucleotide could also regulate its activity.

https://openalex.org/W2033798459,"Previous studies suggest that estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells acquire resistance to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) because of reduced expression levels of TGF-β receptor type II (RII). We now report that treatment of ER+ breast cancer cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2′-dC) leads to accumulation of RII transcript and protein in three different cell lines. RII induction restored TGF-β response in MCF-7L breast cancer cells as indicated by the enhanced activity of a TGF-β responsive promoter-reporter construct (p3TP-Lux). A transiently transfected RII promoter-reporter element (RII-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) showed an increase in activity in the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells compared with untreated cells, suggesting the activation of a transactivator of RII transcription. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the enhanced binding of proteins from 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L nuclear extracts to radiolabeled Sp1 oligonucleotides was demonstrated. An RII promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct containing a mutation in the Sp1 site was not expressed in the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells, further demonstrating that induction of Sp1 activity by 5-aza-2′-dC in the MCF-7L cells was critical to RII expression. Northern analysis indicated that 5-aza-2′-dC treatment did not affect the Sp1 transcript levels. Western blot analysis revealed an increase of Sp1 protein in the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells, but there was no change in the c-Jun levels. Studies after cyclohexamide treatment suggested an increase in the Sp1 protein stability from the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L extracts compared with untreated control extracts. These results indicate that the transcriptional repression of RII in the ER+ breast cancer cells is caused by suboptimal activity of Sp1, whereas treatment with 5-aza-2′-dC stabilizes the protein thus increasing steady-state Sp1 levels and thereby leads to enhanced RII transcription and subsequent restoration of TGF-β sensitivity.

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2′-dC) are the agents used most frequently to reverse methylation and reconstitute the expression of these genes (22Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2463-2467PubMed Google Scholar). To delineate the mechanism of RII repression in the MCF-7L and other ER+ breast cancer cells, we have carried out studies using 5-aza-2′-dC and now provide evidence that RII expression is low or undetectable because of suboptimal activity of Sp1 transcripton factor. Treatment with 5-aza-2′-dC leads to increased Sp1 steady-state levels as a result of increased protein stability and, consequently, concomitant induction of RII expression. RII expression resulted in restoration of TGF-β sensitivity. These results shed light on a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells escape negative regulatory effects of TGF-β leading to uncontrolled growth and hence tumor formation and progression. All of the breast cancer cell lines used were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The BT20 strain in our laboratory has a constitutively active mutated estrogen receptor, hence we refer to it as ER+. Cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), amino acids, antibiotics, pyruvate, and vitamins (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experiments in which 5-aza-2′-dC was used, cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/10-cm culture dish (day 0). 5-Aza-2′-dC (Sigma) was added to the growth medium (1 or 2 μg/ml as indicated) in two 24-h pulses on days 2 and 5. Cells were used on day 7 for RNA determinations, transfections, or isolation of nuclear extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Sp1 Western immunoblots. Total RNA from the breast cancer cells was extracted by guanidine thiocyanate homogenization and ultracentrifugation through a cesium gradient as described previously (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). RI, RII, and actin riboprobes were described previously (15Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V.

RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (24Wu S.-P. Sun L.-Z. Willson J.K.V. Humphrey L. Kerbel R. Brattain M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, radioactive riboprobes were allowed to hybridize overnight with the RI and RII mRNA in 40 μg of total RNA. After RNase A and T1 treatment, the protected double-stranded RNA fragments were analyzed by urea-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Actin was used to normalize sample loading. Simian TGF-β1 was purified as described (25Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and iodinated by the chloramine-T method (26Ruff E. Rizzano A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104/well in a six-well plate (day 0). Wherever indicated, 1 or 2 μg of 5-aza-2′-dC was added in two 24-h pulses on days 2 and 5, and receptor binding studies were carried out on day 7 using 200 pm125I-TGF-β as described previously (27Segarini P.R. Roberts A.B. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14655-14662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cells were solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were separated by 4–10% gradient SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and exposed for autoradiography. The TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter-luciferase reporter construct (p3TP-Lux) was used to determine TGF-β sensitivity as described previously (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The p21 promoter in which the TGF-β-responsive element was deleted (p21/WAF1/CIP1/smaIΔ) was used as a control (28Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). 5-Aza-2′-dC-treated and untreated MCF-7L cells were transiently transfected with 30 μg of p3TP-Lux and 5 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid by electroporation with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 250 mV and 960 microfarads. The electroporated cells were plated into six-well tissue culture plates. Cells were grown for 24 h and then treated with 5 or 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. Cells were harvested in 200 μl of lysis buffer (luciferase assay system, Promega) 48 h after transfection. In the first 10 s after the addition of substrate, luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Berthold lumat LB 9501) and was expressed as relative units after normalization to β-galactosidase activity. RII and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) promoter-CAT constructs were described previously (29Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol.

The RII construct (−274/+50) containing the core promoter with two Sp1 sites and two enhancer regions (PRE1 and PRE2), a −47 RII-CAT (wild type Sp1 site), a −47 Spm RII-CAT (mutated Sp1 site), and IGF-II constructs (−58/+124) containing a distinct TATA box in combination with either two wild type Sp1 (−58 IGF-II-CAT) or two mutated Sp1 sites (−58 Spm IGF-II-CAT) sites were used in this study. MCF-7L cells that were untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml 5-aza-2′-dC, respectively, were transiently transfected with 30 μg of −274/+50 RII promoter-CAT construct or −58/+124 IGF-II promoter-CAT construct by electroporation with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 250 mV and 960 microfarads. For normalization of transfection efficiency, 5 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase was cotransfected into the cells. Cells were plated into 10-cm Petri dishes, and 48 h later cells were harvested to carry out the standard β-galactosidase (31Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and CAT assays (32Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase was analyzed using a molecular dynamics microtiter plate reader and the Softmax software package. Results from CAT assays were analyzed by TLC, and the TLC plate was quantitated directly using an Ambis system as well as by autoradiography. Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the two Sp1 sites (−25 bp and −143 bp relative to start site), the two positive regulatory regions (PRE1 and PRE2), and a mutant Sp1 oligonucleotide (18Kim D.H.

The oligonucleotides were end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (50 μCi at 3,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified using probe QuantTM G-50 microcolumns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions were performed using 3 μg of nuclear extracts, buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 5% glycerol), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide in a volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Competition reactions were performed by adding an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide to the reaction mixture. Samples were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 1.5 h in 100 mm Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were vacuum dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For the supershift assay, the32P-labeled oligonucleotide plus nuclear extract was incubated further at room temperature for 15 min with 2 μg of Sp1 antibody (anti-rabbit, Santa Cruz) before electrophoresis and autoradiography. Total RNA from the control and 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells was extracted by guanidine thiocyanate homogenization and ultracentrifugation through a cesium gradient as described previously (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was fractionated on 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 65 °C using RIPA buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA probe for Sp1 was labeled with [32P]dCTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Nuclear extracts (4 μg) from 5-aza-2′-dC-treated and untreated MCF-7L cells were resolved using 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by wet electrophoretic transfer (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was probed with a rabbit anti-human Sp1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with TTBS for 10 min each. Bound antibodies were detected with an anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was reprobed with rabbit anti-human c-Jun polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). The MCF-7L cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide and harvested at the indicated time points for the Sp1 protein stability studies (33Mortensen E.R. Marks P.A. Shiotani A. Merchant J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16540-16547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that ER+ breast cancer cells express low RII levels and hence are TGF-β-resistant (11Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A.J. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. Van den Eijnden-Van Raiij A.J.M. Van der Saag P.T. Van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajakarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several different strains of various ER+ breast cancer cell lines have been reported which exhibited differential sensitivities to TGF-β. Hence we have screened for RI and RII transcripts in TGF-β-resistant ER+ breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7L, BT20, ZR75, T47D) using an RNase protection assay. The TGF-β-sensitive ER−cell line MDA MB 231 was used as a positive control. All of the ER+ cell lines expressed RI mRNA, but RII mRNA was undetectable (Fig. 1). The ER− MDA MB 231 cell line has both RI and RII transcripts. Because RI and RII are interdependent for TGF-β binding and signaling, we carried out receptor binding studies with125I-TGF-β1 to determine the expression of cell surface receptors RI and RII. Cell surface receptors were not detected in the ER+ cell lines but were present in the ER−cell line and the mink lung epithelial cell line CCL64, which were used as positive controls (Fig. 2). The specificity of binding was demonstrated by competing with a 50-fold excess of cold TGF-β1. RNase protection assays were performed to determine whether treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-dC leads to expression of RII transcript. Accumulation of RII transcript was observed in all of the ER+ cell lines (Fig. 3). To examine whether RII expression permitted TGF-β binding to RI, cell surface receptor binding studies with 125I-TGF-β1 were carried out. The data show that expression of RII resulted in the cell surface binding of TGF-β to both RII and RI (Fig. 4). Increased binding for RIII was also noted. This phenomenon has also been observed after RII transfection in previous studies (12Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V.

Binding specificity was demonstrated by competing with a 50-fold excess of TGF-β1.Figure 4Detection of cell surface RI and RII in 5-aza-2′-dC-treated breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cells were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were incubated with 200 pm125I-TGF-β1, cross-linked with 0.3 mm disuccinimidyl suberate, and separated by 4–10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Binding specificity was demonstrated by a 50-fold excess of cold TGF-β1 (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate whether 5-aza-2′-dC-mediated RII expression in MCF-7L cells restored TGF-β sensitivity, TGF-β-dependent promoter activity was analyzed using the p3TP-Lux plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter-TGF-β-responsive element in tandem with a luciferase reporter. The TGF-β-responsive promoter-luciferase construct or a p21/WAF1/CIP1 control promoter lacking the TGF-β-responsive element (p21/WAF1/CIP1/smaIΔ) was transiently transfected into 5-aza-2′-dC-treated or untreated MCF-7L cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were subjected to treatment with 5 or 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for an additional 24 h, and luciferase activity was then determined (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). TGF-β had no effect on the control cells, but 5-aza-2′-dC-treated cells showed 2- and 5-fold increases in luciferase activity at 5 or 10 ng/ml TGF-β1, respectively (Fig. 5). Southern analysis of the RII promoter region did not reveal any methylated sites (data not shown). We have compared the RII promoter activity in control and 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells using an RII promoter-CAT construct (Fig. 6 A) to examine whether the induction of RII after 5-aza-2′-dC treatment is caused by the activation of a transactivator. This promoter element contains two Sp1 binding sites (at −25 bp and −143 bp relative to the start site) and two positive regulatory elements (PRE1, −219 bp/−172 bp; PRE2, +1 bp/+50 bp relative to the start site). 5-Aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells showed higher promoter activity than control cells, thus suggesting the activation of nuclear proteins that bind to the RII promoter and enhance its activity (Fig. 6 B). To narrow the identity of the proteins that are enhancing the RII promoter activity in the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts and the32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the two Sp1 binding sites as well as the two positive regulatory elements (PRE1 and PRE2), which have been recognized previously (18Kim D.H. Chang J.H. Lee K.H. Lee H.-Y. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild type RII promoter PRE1, PRE2, and the two Sp1 sites as well as a mutated Sp1 oligonucleotide were analyzed for binding to nuclear proteins (Figs. 7 A and 8 A). Gel shift analysis of nuclear extracts from 5-aza-2′-dC-treated and control MCF-7L cells do not reveal any differences in the proteins that bind to PRE1 and PRE2 (Fig. 7 B). Cold oligonucleotides competed with32P-labeled PRE oligonucleotides for binding to the protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 7 B). However, there was enhanced binding of nuclear proteins from the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells to both of the 32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotides compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 8 B). The low mobility complexes that were present in the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated extracts were absent in the control nuclear extracts. The mobilities of these complexes were similar to that of recombinant human Sp1 (Promega)-bound32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide complex, which was used as a positive control. Wild type Sp1 oligonucleotides competed with32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotides for binding to the protein complexes, whereas the mutant Sp1 oligonucleotide could not, thus indicating the specificity of the shifts. To confirm further that the enhanced protein-DNA complex contains Sp1, supershift assays were carried out by incubating the protein-DNA complexes with 2 μg of Sp1 antibody (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Sp1 antibody recognized the Sp1 in the protein-DNA complexes, resulting in a clear shift of the mobility of the protein bound to the32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 9).Figure 8Panel A, sequences of the sense strands of the double-stranded Sp1 and mutant (Spm) oligonucleotides used for the gel shift analysis. Panel B, binding of the nuclear proteins to Sp1 oligonucleotides. EMSA was performed using32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotides by incubating with 3 μg of nuclear extracts from the control and 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells.

To confirm that protein-DNA complexes contained Sp1, supershift assays were carried out by incubating the nuclear extract plus 32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide complexes for 15 min at room temperature with 2 μg of Sp1 antibody. A lower mobility complex resulting from the binding of Sp1 antibody to protein-DNA complexes was observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm the role of Sp1 in the enhanced RII promoter activity, the −47 RII promoter-CAT construct containing either the wild type or mutant Sp1 site was transiently transfected into control and 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 10 A). 5-Aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells expressed higher wild type RII promoter activity compared with control untreated MCF-7L cells. The Sp1 mutant RII promoter-CAT construct was not expressed (Fig. 10 B). To determine if 5-aza-2′-dC-mediated Sp1 activity leads to enhanced expression of other Sp1-dependent promoters, we transiently expressed either the wild type or Sp1 site-mutated IGF-II promoter-CAT constructs (Fig. 11 A) in 5-aza-2′-dC-treated or untreated MCF-7L cells. The IGF-II promoter contains a distinct TATA box and two Sp1 sites (30Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 5-Aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells exhibited a significantly higher IGF-II promoter activity compared with untreated control cells. The 5-aza-2′-dC-induced IGF-II promoter activity disappeared but retained the basal promoter activity when the Sp1 sites were mutated (−58 Spm IGF-II-CAT). These data further confirm the activation of Sp1 by 5-aza-2′-dC in the MCF-7L cells (Fig. 11 B). To determine if 5-aza-2′-dC treatment induces Sp1 transcript, Northern analysis using Sp1 cDNA as a probe was performed. Control and 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells both expressed similar levels of Sp1 mRNA (Fig. 12), suggesting that demethylation was not affecting Sp1 transcription. To determine whether 5-aza-2′-dC treatment stimulates the Sp1 protein expression, Western immunoblot was performed using 4 μg each of nuclear extracts from 5-aza-2′-dC-treated and untreated MCF-7L cells. Western analysis showed two protein species of 95 and 105 kDa. The two species are the result of differential post-translational modification of the Sp1 polypeptide (34Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 35Jackson S.P. McDonald J.J. Lees-Miller Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Significant increases of both the species were observed in the nuclear extracts of 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells, whereas there was no change in the c-Jun levels (Fig. 13). Sp1 protein stability studies after treatment with 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide were performed as described previously for this protein (33Mortensen E.R. Marks P.A. Shiotani A. Merchant J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16540-16547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to determine if 5-aza-2′-dC stabilizes Sp1 protein indirectly. Sp1 protein from 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells showed enhanced stability compared with untreated MCF-7L control cells (Fig. 14), thus indicating that the increased steady-state levels of Sp1 protein and oligonucleotide binding activity were the result of indirect actions of the demethylating agent on Sp1.Figure 14Sp1 stability in control and 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells. Control (panel A) and 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells (panel B) were treated with 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide, and cells were harvested at the indicated time points to isolate nuclear extracts.

Previous work from our laboratory (15Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajakarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kalkhoven et al. (11Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A.J. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. Van den Eijnden-Van Raiij A.J.M. Van der Saag P.T. Van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that ER+ breast cancer cells acquire resistance to TGF-β because of a lack of or inadequate expression of RII. Replacement of RII in a TGF-β resistant ER+ MCF-7L cell line restored TGF-β response and reduced tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice (15Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajakarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reversal of malignancy of a human colon carcinoma cell line was also reported after RII expression (12Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Hence, targeting re-expression of RII may offer potential novel approaches for treatment or chemoprevention of breast cancer. In this study, we have examined the ability of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-dC to restore endogenous RII expression in the ER+ breast cancer cells. Treatment with 5-aza-2′-dC led to induction of RII expression in all three of the ER+ breast cancer cell lines examined (Figs. 3and 4). Significantly, 5-aza-2′-dC-mediated RII induction resulted in restoration of TGF-β response in the MCF-7L cells (Fig. 5). However, the induction of RII expression after 5-aza-2′-dC treatment was not found to be a result of the direct demethylation of the RII gene. This raised the possibility of the involvement of increased activation of a transactivator as a cause for enhanced RII transcription. RII repression resulting from decreased binding of nuclear proteins to the enhancer regions (PRE1 and PRE2) of the RII promoter has been reported in adenovirus E1A-transformed mouse keratinocytes (18Kim D.H. Chang J.H. Lee K.H. Lee H.-Y. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 688-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, 5-aza-2′-dC-treated and untreated MCF-7L cells showed no differences in the nuclear proteins that bind to these enhancer regions (PRE1 and PRE2). The RII promoter lacks a distinct TATA box, and Sp1 has been reported to play an important role in the initiation of transcription from promoters lacking distinct TATA boxes (36Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The human RII promoter contains two Sp1 sites at −25 and −143 bp relative to the start site (29Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Enhanced RII promoter activity (Fig. 6) as well as the increased binding of nuclear proteins to the32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotides (Figs. 8 B and9) in the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells indicate that increased Sp1 activity was induced by 5-aza-2′-dC. An RII promoter-CAT construct with a mutated Sp1 site was not expressed in the 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells, further demonstrating the specificity of enhanced Sp1 activity resulting from 5-aza-2′-dC treatment (Fig. 10 B). Enhancement of Sp1 levels also led to the increased expression of the Sp1-dependent IGF-II promoter in 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells (Fig. 11 B). Consequently, the results presented in this study indicate that suboptimal activity of Sp1 results in transcriptional repression of RII in the ER+ breast cancer cells. This appears to have a role in uncontrolled growth and subsequent malignant progression as evidenced by studies showing that RII replacement reverses malignancy in MCF-7L cells (15Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajakarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 5-aza-2′-dC studies on MCF-7L cells have raised some interesting questions. A similar drug (5-azacytidine) has been reported to increase Sp1 activity without altering protein expression leading to TGF-α transcription in melanoma cells (37Shin T.H. Paterson A.J. Grant III, J.H. Meluch A.A. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells did not show any increase in the Sp1 transcript levels (Fig. 12). Thus, Sp1 induction as a result of the demethylation at the Sp1 gene locus was eliminated. However, 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L cells exhibited enhanced Sp1 activity as well as increased Sp1 nuclear protein levels (Fig. 13). This may result from the effects of 5-aza-2′-dC at a different gene locus, whose product may be required for Sp1 expression and activity. Sp1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation (34Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 35Jackson S.P. McDonald J.J. Lees-Miller Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Glycosylation may aid in nuclear localization and DNA binding, and phosphorylation may assist in stabilizing the Sp1·DNA complex. It has been shown that glycosylation stabilizes Sp1, and hypoglycosylated Sp1 is susceptible to proteasome degradation (38Han I. Kudlow J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, recent modeling studies of Sp1 indicated that the modification adversely affected protein-protein interactions involving the transcription factor (39Roos M.D. Su K. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Protein stability studies after cyclohexamide treatment suggested a significant increase in the Sp1 protein stability from 5-aza-2′-dC-treated MCF-7L nuclear extracts compared with control untreated MCF-7L nuclear extracts (Fig. 14). The mechanism for increased stability is not clear at this time. The available data indicate that the affected gene resulting in Sp1 protein stabilization is probably not affecting glycosylation. A transiently transfected RII promoter-CAT element exhibited enhanced promoter activity in MCF-7L cells when cotransfected with Sp1 cDNA, demonstrating further that low expression levels of Sp1 contribute to repression of RII expression in the MCF-7L cells. 2K. Liu, Brattain, M. G., and S. Banerji, manuscript in preparation. In summary, the results of our present study demonstrated that the tumor suppressor gene RII is repressed in the ER+ breast cancer cells because of suboptimal activity of Sp1. 5-Aza-2′-dC treatment indirectly stabilizes and activates Sp1, thus leading to enhanced RII transcription and subsequent restoration of TGF-β response. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells escape the negative growth regulatory effects of TGF-β leading to malignant behavior.

https://openalex.org/W1970668422,"In vivo and in vitroexperiments carried out on L929 mouse fibroblasts suggested that the poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation process acts somehow as a protecting agent against full methylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA. Since CpG islands, which are found almost exclusively at the 5′-end of housekeeping genes, are rich in CpG dinucleotides, which are the target of mammalian DNA methyltransferase, we examined the possibility that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction is involved in maintaining the unmethylated state of these DNA sequences. Experiments were conducted by two different strategies, using either methylation-dependent restriction enzymes on purified genomic DNA or a sequence-dependent restriction enzyme on an aliquot of the same DNA, previously modified by a bisulfite reaction. With the methylation-dependent restriction enzymes, it was observed that the “HpaII tiny fragments” greatly decreased when the cells were preincubated with 3-aminobenzamide, a well known inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The other experimental approach allowed us to prove that, as a consequence of the inhibition of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation process, an anomalous methylation pattern could be evidenced in the CpG island of the promoter fragment of the Htf9 gene, amplified from DNA obtained from fibroblasts preincubated with 3-aminobenzamide. These data confirm the hypothesis that, at least for the Htf9 promoter region, an active poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation protects the unmethylated state of the CpG island.

These data confirm the hypothesis that, at least for the Htf9 promoter region, an active poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation protects the unmethylated state of the CpG island. During pre-implantation development, most DNA sequences undergo extensive demethylation. This unmethylated state is maintained through the blastula stage to the time of embryo implantation, when a burst ofde novo methylation generates a bimodal pattern, characterized by unmethylated CpG islands versus the bulk of genomic DNA, which is highly methylated (1Brandeis M. Ariel M. Cedar H. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A problem yet to be solved is the identification of different cis-acting signals andtrans-acting protein factors that may play a key role in defining the bimodal pattern of methylation involved in cell differentiation and gene expression. Our previous in vitro experiments, carried out with the aim of individuating chromatin proteins involved in determining and/or maintaining in some way the DNA methylation pattern, have shown that histone H1 (2Caiafa P. Reale A. Allegra P. Rispoli M. D'Erme M. Strom R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Santoro R. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Caiafa P. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Zardo G. Santoro R. D'Erme M. Reale A. Guidobaldi L. Caiafa P. Strom R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), is a chromatin protein that is able to greatly inhibit (>90%) methylation of double-stranded DNA. Moreover, gel retardation experiments have emphasized that H1e is the only variant able to bind CpG-rich sequences, both unmethylated CpG-rich double-stranded oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA purified from chromatin fractions enriched in CpG islands. Further experiments have evidenced that the inhibition ofin vitro enzymatic DNA methylation by histone H1 was essentially due to the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated isoform of this protein and/or to the long and branched protein-free ADP-ribose polymers (6Zardo G. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Perilli M. Caiafa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7937-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vivo experiments carried out on L929 mouse fibroblasts preincubated for 24 h with or without 8 mm3-ABA, 1The abbreviations used are: 3-ABA, 3-aminobenzamide; S-AdoMet,S-adenosyl-l-methionine; bp, base pair; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. a well known inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, confirmed the existence of a negative correlation between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation processes. A block of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation process allowed, in the isolated nuclei, a considerable increase in the susceptibility of DNA to methylation by endogenous DNA methyltransferase. Subsequent methylation by exogenous enzymes was, as a consequence, severely reduced. The aim of this paper was to verify if, in cells preincubated with 3-aminobenzamide, the DNA methyltransferase becomes able to modify the unmethylated state of CpG islands, which normally remain untouched by the action of DNA methyltransferase even though they are located in the promoter region of housekeeping genes (7Bird A.P.

Our results, obtained using two different experimental approaches, allowed us to observe that the block of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation process modifies the methylation pattern of CpG islands in general and in particular introduces an anomalous methylation pattern in the Htf9 promoter region (10Lavia P. Macleod D. Bird A.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) when it is purified from cells treated with 3-aminobenzamide. These data confirm the hypothesis that, at least for the Htf9 promoter region, an active poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation protects its unmethylated state.

Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.14), trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), T4 polynucleotide kinase (DNA nucleotidyltransferase (DNA-directed), EC 2.7.7.7), Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and 50-bp ladder molecular size markers were from Boehringer Mannheim. The BstUI restriction enzyme and SssI methylase were from New England Biolabs Inc.MspI and HpaII restriction enzymes,Taq DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7), and the Wizard DNA Clean-Up system were from Promega. 3-Aminobenzamide and S-adenosyl-l-methionine were from Sigma.

All other chemicals used were of the highest purity commercially available. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of L929 mouse fibroblast cells, performed according to the previously described method (6Zardo G. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Perilli M. Caiafa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7937-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicated that the cell cycle of synchronized fibroblasts was not influenced by the presence of 3-ABA. In nuclei, obtained from 6.5 × 106 L929 mouse fibroblasts (11Davis T. Rinaldi A. Clark L. Adams R.L.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 866: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and preincubated for 24 h with or without 8 mm 3-ABA, the endogenous methyl-accepting ability was saturated by adding 16 μm unlabeled S-AdoMet for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNAs purified from these nuclei (2 μg) were used as substrates to evaluate their residual methyl-accepting ability in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of 2.5 units of bacterial SssI methylase using, as methyl donor, 80 μm S-AdoMet plus 100 μCi/mlS-[3H]AdoMet. The enzymatic reaction was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C and then was stopped by addition of 1% (w/v) SDS and 250 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C overnight. Purified DNAs were analyzed for their methyl-accepting ability (2Caiafa P. Reale A. Allegra P. Rispoli M. D'Erme M. Strom R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and incorporation of labeled methyl groups was evaluated in a Beckman LS-6800 liquid scintillation spectrometer. The bisulfite reaction was carried out according to Frommer et al. (12Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar) on a genomic DNA purified from nuclei (obtained from cells treated with or without 8 mm 3-ABA) in which the DNA methyl-accepting ability was saturated in the presence of 16 μm S-AdoMet, exploiting endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. Before the reaction, the DNAs (2.5 μg) were digested for 4 h with 5 units of EcoRI restriction enzyme (that did not cut within the DNA regions that would subsequently be examined) and denatured by adding NaOH to a final concentration of 0.3 m for 15 min at 37 °C. The DNAs were incubated in the dark for 16 h at 55 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm hydroquinone and 3.1m sodium bisulfite, both of which were freshly prepared, in a final volume of 0.24 ml at pH 5.0. DNAs were purified from the mixture reactions using the Wizard DNA Clean-Up system according to the manufacturer's instructions and resuspended in 100 μl of barren MilliQ H2O, and then NaOH (final concentration of 0.3m) was added for 15 min. The solution was neutralized by adding NH4OAc (pH 7) to reach a final concentration of 3m. The samples, after ethanol precipitation, were dried, resuspended in 100 μl of previously barren MilliQ H2O, and stored at −80 °C. The bisulfite-modified DNAs were used to PCR-amplify fragment 1482–1773 of the Htf9 promoter region on the 5′–3′ strand. The same pair of modified primers was used to amplify DNAs purified from cells preincubated either with or without 3-ABA. The sequences of the primers were as follows: forward, 5′-AGGTGTTGTTGGTTTGGTGGTTTTTGGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-AATACACACATAAATCACCAAAAAAACACACTCC-3′. The PCR mixture contained 150 ng of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA, primers (50 pmol both in frame and in reverse), dNTPs (final concentration of 0.2 mm), and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase in 67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8.), 6.7 mm MgCl2, 170 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 16.6 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.5 mmtetramethylammonium chloride. The reaction (50 μl) was carried out under the following conditions: denaturation at 96 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 37 cycles and a final cycle of 95 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 6 min. Primers were removed from the PCR mixture using the QIAGEN PCR purification kit. Methylathion-dependent restriction analysis was performed on 70–100 ng of DNA (20 μl) purified from nuclei (obtained from cells treated with or without 8 mm 3-ABA) in which the DNA methyl-accepting ability was saturated in the presence of 16 μm S-AdoMet, exploiting endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. Samples were digested with MspI and HpaII restriction enzymes (30 units added three times) for 36 h at 37 °C. DNA fragments were end-labeled with 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP in the presence of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (2 units) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of NaEDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. DNAs were coprecipitated in the presence of 3 μg of tRNA and stored at −80 °C. Samples (dissolved in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8)) were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands were autoradiographed on Kodak x-ray film. Sequence-dependent restriction analysis was performed on DNA fragments amplified after bisulfite modification. Before the restriction analysis, the amplified DNA was identified by 2% low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band, correspondent to a 291-bp fragment, was excised from the gel and purified using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit. Each DNA sample (30 μl) was incubated with 10 units of BstUI restriction enzyme for 16 h at 60 °C. DNA samples were loaded onto 2.5% agarose gel, and electrophoresis was carried out at 120 V for 3 h in 0.5% Tris borate/EDTA buffer (pH 7.8). DNA samples were transferred from the agarose gel to a nylon GeneScreen membrane using the capillary transfer method (13Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar), and to identify the products of the digestion mixture, they were hybridized with a uniformly 32P-labeled probe obtained using random oligonucleotide primers. A mixture of amplified undigested DNA fragments was used as a labeled probe. A 50-bp ladder end-labeled with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase was used as marker after removing unincorporated [γ-32P]dATP with the QIAGEN nucleotide removal kit. Bands were evidenced by autoradiograpy on Kodak x-ray film. Experiments were done to verify the possible direct role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in maintaining the characteristic unmethylated state of CpG islands. The DNA used in the experiments was purified from nuclei obtained from cells in which the block of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation allowed the introduction of new methyl groups. The DNAs used in the experiments were different in their residual methyl-accepting ability as this was reduced, according to previous results (6Zardo G. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Perilli M. Caiafa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7937-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), to ∼30 ± 10% in the three different cell preparations examined (in comparison with the control taken as 100%) when DNA was purified from cells preincubated with 3-aminobenzamide. The first experimental approach was carried out in accordance with the method used by Bird et al. (7Bird A.P. Taggart M. Frommer M. Miller O.J. Macleod D. Cell. 1985; 40: 91-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 8Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar, 9Bird A.P. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (650) Google Scholar) to evidence the clusters of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA named CpG islands. The methylation state of CpG islands was investigated by digesting, with methylation-dependent restriction enzymes, the genomic DNAs purified from nuclei (obtained from cells treated with or without 3-aminobenzamide) in which the DNA methyl-accepting ability was saturated in the presence of 16 μm S-AdoMet, exploiting endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. As shown by gel electrophoresis, those “HpaII tiny fragments,” which typically appear following digestion of genomic DNA with HpaII, were present when the DNA was purified from control cells, but were greatly decreased if the DNA was purified from cells preincubated with 3-ABA (Fig. 1). In the second experimental approach, fragment 1482–1773 of the mouse CpG island Htf9 promoter region was amplified by PCR after the bisulfite reaction, which converts cytosine to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine does not react (12Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). Since this reaction immortalizes the methylation state of CpG sites on DNA, the fragment, even after amplification, retains the memory of the original methylation pattern. Following amplification of the DNA fragment, uracil was amplified as thymine, whereas the 5-methylcytosine residues were amplified as cytosine, so that we replaced the use of methylation-dependent restriction enzymes with sequence-dependent ones. As the sequence-dependent restriction enzyme, we chose theBstUI enzyme, which recognizes and cuts CGCG sequence. The use of this enzyme (14Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5231) Google Scholar, 15Xiong Z. Laird P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2532-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) allowed us to observe alterations in the methylation pattern only if both cytosines were methylated in the sequence since the methylation of only one cytosine or the absence of 5-methylcytosine produces TGCG, CGTC, or TGTG sequences thatBstUI cannot recognize and cut. Following digestion of PCR-amplified DNA fragments with theBstUI restriction enzyme, it was possible to observe an anomalous methylation pattern when the Htf9 promoter region was purified from fibroblasts preincubated with 3-ABA. In fact, Southern blot analysis of digestion products showed the presence of a 55-bp fragment only in the 3-ABA sample (Fig. 2 a, lane 2), suggesting that the CGCG sequence involved in the methylated state could be the sequence at position 1536 (Fig. 2 b). An additional control experiment is reported in Fig. 2 a (lane 3), showing theBstUI restriction pattern of the 291-bp fragment amplified from DNA purified from nuclei obtained from cells that had not been treated with 3-ABA and that had not undergone the unlabeledS-AdoMet incubation step, but had been subjected to the bisulfite reaction. How the CpG islands maintain their unmethylated state despite being rich in CpG dinucleotides is still an intriguing unanswered question. The problem is made interesting by the fact that the pattern of CpG islands remains unmethylated despite the fact that they are correlated mainly with the housekeeping genes (8Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar), which are located in the decondensed chromatin structure. In this chromatin region, to which the transcription factors and the enzymes involved in the transcription process have easy access, the DNA methyltransferase should have easy access, too (17Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Cantoni G.L. Razin A. Gene Methylation Patterns and Expression: DNA Methylation and Its Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 353-378Google Scholar). Taking into consideration the importance that this biological process assumes for the regulation of gene expression (16Keshet I. Ysraeli J. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2560-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), many researchers are working with the aim to individuate somecis-acting and/or trans-acting factors that directly or indirectly play a role in regulating the methylation pattern of CpG islands, specially since in vitro experiments (18Carotti D. Palitti F. Lavia P. Strom R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9219-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Bestor T.H. Gundersen G. Kolsto A.B. Pryd H. Genet. Anal. Tech.

The results shown in this paper demonstrate how the regulatory role played by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA methylation does not involve only the in toto genomic DNA (6Zardo G. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Perilli M. Caiafa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7937-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but also the CpG islands. While these results clearly indicate the direct influence of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation process on the regulation of the methylation pattern of CpG islands, much still has to be done to clarify the mechanism by which this protection takes place and to identify the chromatin protein(s) that assumes this role. As this post-synthetic modification introduces several negative charges into the modified proteins (45Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. ADP-Ribose Transfer Reactions: Mechanisms and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar), it must be clarified if the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation carries out this regulatory role by introducing the ADP-ribose polymers into the proteins able to bind methylated or unmethylated DNA. A third possibility is that the long and branched polymers of poly(ADP-ribose) by themselves directly, or positioned by a specific protein, act as trans-acting factors in this process (6Zardo G. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Perilli M. Caiafa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7937-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Starting from the simplest hypothesis that there is a protein or another kind of molecule directly involved in protecting the unmethylated state of CpG islands, we propose histone H1 either covalently (46Naegeli H. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10596-10601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified by ADP-ribose polymers and/or noncovalently (47Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) linked to long and branched ADP-ribose polymers as the protein responsible for this protection. A possible mechanism is that histone H1 in its covalently modified isoform could position itself on the CpG islands, for which it shows a greater affinity (6Zardo G. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Perilli M. Caiafa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7937-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and, when there, attract the long and branched polymers that inhibit methylation of double-stranded DNA (6Zardo G. D'Erme M. Reale A. Strom R. Perilli M. Caiafa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7937-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), thus preventing DNA methyltransferase from having access to these DNA regions. Histone H1 could participate in this role through its genetic variant H1e, which is (i) the only one involved in inhibiting the in vitro DNA methylation process (4Santoro R. D'Erme M. Mastrantonio S. Reale A. Marenzi S. Saluz H.P. Strom R. Caiafa P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Zardo G. Santoro R. D'Erme M. Reale A. Guidobaldi L. Caiafa P. Strom R.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); (iii) the only one involved in chromatin condensation and, in its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated isoform, chromatin decondensation (48D'Erme M. Zardo G. Reale A. Caiafa P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using methyl-accepting ability assays, we have been able to demonstrate that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the histone H1e variant facilitates chromatin decondensation, even though this modification does not remove histone H1 from chromatin (48D'Erme M. Zardo G. Reale A. Caiafa P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Analyzing the data in light of the above, it is possible to suppose that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated isoform of histone H1 is present in a decondensed chromatin structure with the aim of safekeeping the expression of the housekeeping genes, through maintaining the unmethylated state of CpG islands. How histone H1 could be involved in modulating the transcription is “still an enigma” (49Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the idea that such a protein is almost absent in transcriptionally active chromatin regions (50van Holde K. Chromatin.

This contrast could only be apparent if indeed the small amount of histone H1 found associated with these DNA regions is the variant H1e in its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated isoform that is specifically involved in this protector role."

To examine the contribution of long range electrostatic interactions to the thiol/disulfide exchange between protein-disulfide oxidoreductases and target proteins, we constructed three variants of E. coli thioredoxin in which an acidic (Glu-30) and a neutral residue (Leu-94) were replaced by lysines. After purification to homogeneity, the reduction of the unique disulfide bond by NADPH via NADP-thioredoxin reductase proceeded at similar rates for all variants. However, the conversion of cysteine residues back to cystine depended on the target protein.

Moreover, the affinity of E30K, L94K, and E30K/L94K E. colithioredoxin for chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (A 0.5 = 9, 7, and 3 μm, respectively) increased with the number of positive charges, and was higher than wild type thioredoxin (A 0.5 = 33 μm), though still lower than that of thioredoxin-f (A 0.5 = 0.9 μm). We also demonstrated that shielding of electrostatic interactions with high salt concentrations not only brings the A 0.5for all bacterial variants to a limiting value of ∼9 μmbut also increases the A 0.5 of chloroplast thioredoxin-f. While negatively charged chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (pI = 4.9) readily interacted with mutant thioredoxins, the reduction rate of rapeseed napin (pI = 11.2) diminished with the number of novel lysine residues.

Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Their widespread occurrence and structural stability are matched by a range of biological properties from metabolic regulation (2Wolosiuk R.A. Ballicora M.A. Hagelin K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 622-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to virus replication (3Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

The ability of the redox-active site to reduce a broad spectrum of disulfide bonds in proteins is intimately linked to the regulation of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur assimilation (2Wolosiuk R.A.

Biophys. 1995; 318: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conversion of the active disulfide bond back to sulfhydryl groups proceeds via NADPH and the flavoprotein NADP-thioredoxin reductase in most cellular compartments (9Williams Jr., C.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and by reduced ferredoxin and the iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin-Trx reductase in oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms (10Staples C.R. Ameyibor E. Fu W. Gardet-Salvi L. Stritt-Etter A-L. Schürmann P. Knaff D.B. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11425-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In higher plant chloroplasts, the presence of two distinct Trxs, Trx-m and Trx-f, is a highly relevant but still poorly understood issue (11Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The comparison of their primary structures with counterparts from other sources revealed that the former bears a significant identity with a variety of prokaryotic Trxs whereas the latter groups with eukaryotic ones (12Hartman H. Syvanen M. Buchanan B.B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1990; 7: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar). Although the relationship between the phylogenetic origin and the metabolism of chloroplasts remains unknown, it was found that the reduced forms of both Trxs participate in the light-dependent modulation of enzymes. Moreover, these studies led to the view that chloroplast Trx-m preferentially activates and deactivates NADP-malate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively, whereas chloroplast Trx-f is highly efficient in the stimulation of key enzymes of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (CFBPase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, phosphoribulokinase, NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase). However, evidence suggests the existence of other, perhaps complementary, mechanisms that may regulate the specificity of Trx for target proteins (13Schürmann P. Roux J. Salvi L. Physiol. Vég. 1985; 23: 813-818Google Scholar, 14Ballicora M.A. Wolosiuk R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Mora-Garcı́a S. Ballicora M.A. Wolosiuk R.A.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For example, in vitro studies have shown that spinach chloroplast Trx-m and Escherichia coli Trx are indistinguishable from chloroplast Trx-f when the activation of CFBPase is performed in the presence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and Ca2+ (13Schürmann P. Roux J. Salvi L. Physiol. Vég. 1985; 23: 813-818Google Scholar, 15Mora-Garcı́a S. Ballicora M.A. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Native (oxidized) CFBPase serves as excellent substrate for the analysis of the interaction between Trx and target proteins because the enzyme activity is effectively modulated not only by the formation of sulfhydryl groups but also by subtle alterations of the tertiary structure (14Ballicora M.A. Wolosiuk R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Mora-Garcı́a S. Ballicora M.A. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The reductive activation of CFBPase, but not the catalytic step, depends on three cysteines clustered in a solvent-exposed structure encompassing ∼15 amino acid residues (named the 170's loop by Villeret et al.) (17Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Xue Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4299-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Rodrı́guez-Suárez R.J. Mora-Garcı́a S. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this context, the presence of a highly negative potential around the 170's loop was met with considerable interest because electrostatic attractions constitute a conceptually interesting framework for analyzing the affinity of Trxs for CFBPase (18Rodrı́guez-Suárez R.J. Mora-Garcı́a S. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Congruent with this view, the introduction and replacement of negatively charged amino acid residues in Trxs was detrimental and beneficial, respectively, for the modulation of CFBPase. For example, K44(58)D, N60(74)D, and Q61(75)D chloroplast Trx-f as well as K69(70)E chloroplast Trx-m were less efficient than wild type counterparts, whereas the substitution of Asp-61 by asparagine in E. coli Trx enhanced 2-fold the affinity for CFBPase (henceforth, the numbering of amino acid residues refers to the location in E. coli Trx and those enclosed between parentheses to the homologous position in the particular Trx) (16López-Jaramillo J.

Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, previous studies lacked two relevant features related to the functional significance of electrostatic interactions. First, the creation of novel positively charged groups on the surface of Trx should not only enhance the affinity for the negatively charged domain of CFBPase but also impair that for basic proteins. Second, the interaction of Trx with target proteins should be sensitive to the shielding of electrostatic attractions by neutral salts. Our goal in the present study was to establish whether novel positive charges will make inefficient Trxs much more effective in the activation of CFBPase and concurrently sensitive to high ionic strength. Therefore, the charge distribution on the surface of E. coli Trx was approached to that of chloroplast Trx-f by site-directed mutagenesis. The data reported herein show that mutants of E. coli Trx, in which lysine residues are located at positions 30 and 94, evoke chloroplast Trx-f in the modulation of CFBPase, even if the capacity of the active site for thiol/disulfide exchange with reductants and oxidants only changes slightly. However, more importantly, the affinity of all variants for CFBPase approaches to a common limiting value when high concentrations of neutral salts shield the attraction between these interacting proteins. Consistent with the predominant role of electrostatics in the interaction between variants of E. coli Trx and the target protein, the higher the number of lysine residues, the lower the reduction rate of a positively charged protein, rapeseed napin (22Ericson M. Jodin J. Lenman N. Glimelius K. Joseffson L. Rask L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14576-14581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene coding for the entire sequence of the E. coli Trx flanked byNdeI and EcoRI restriction sites was amplified by PCR using as template the plasmid pFP1 (21de Lamotte-Guéry F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J.P Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this fragment of DNA was subcloned into an IPTG-inducible vector, pET22b(+), containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a high-affinity ribosome binding site. Detailed properties of this overexpression vector have been described elsewhere (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The overexpression strain JM109/DE3 (F′ traD36 proAB lacIq Δ{lacZ}M15/recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 (rK−,mK−)supE44 Δ(lac-proAB) relA1) was used as a host strain for transformation in all experiments (Promega, Madison, WI). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml), and cell number was determined by light attenuation at 600 nm. Enzymes and solutions for DNA manipulations were used according to either manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), or Ausubelet al. (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore E.W. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). Deoxiribonucleotides were procured from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden) and oligonucleotides from NBI (Plymouth, MN) or GenSet (La Jolla, CA). Bovine pancreas insulin (henceforth insulin) and biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. E. coli NADP-thioredoxin reductase was purchased from IMCO (Stockholm, Sweden). CFBPase and chloroplast Trx-f were purified from fresh spinach leaves, according to Stein and Wolosiuk (26Stein M. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16171-16179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using the “megaprimer” method described by Sarkar and Sommer (27Sarkar G. Sommer S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two successive PCRs required a pair of common oligonucleotides containing either theNdeI or the EcoRI restriction sites flanking the gene of E. coli Trx at the 5′ and 3′ positions, respectively (primers A and B) and a particular mismatch-bearing oligonucleotide that complemented the internal segment to be mutagenized. The first round of amplification on the wild type gene as template yielded a truncated Trx sequence that spanned from either the 5′- or the 3′-end to a short sequence beyond the mutagenized codon. Using the same template, the novel (large) oligonucleotide and the other common primer, the second PCR restored the entire, but mutated, DNA sequence of Trx. The primers used for the specific mutation are listed below (mismatches in bold type). Thirty-three cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 45 s at variable temperatures, 45 s at 72 °C) were performed in 0.05 ml of a solution that contained 5 ng of the pET22b(+) plasmid harboring the complete coding sequence of E. coli Trx, 5 nmol of each dNTP, 25 pmol of flanking oligonucleotides, 1 unit of Vent polymerase, and the respective commercial buffer (New England Biolabs). Alternatively, this outline used the single mutant E30K E. coli Trx as template for the construction of the double mutant E30K/L94K E. coli Trx. After the predicted size of the PCR product was confirmed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose, the excess of dNTP and oligonucleotides was removed by passage through Wizard DNA Clean Up (Promega). Amplified DNAs and the expression vector pET22b(+) were digested with NdeI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. Expression of recombinant wild type and mutant Trx was accomplished by electroporation of the E. coli strain JM109/DE3 and subsequent induction with IPTG. Given that the replacement of amino acids altered the net charge of proteins, we screened the appearance of mutants by nondenaturing PAGE of whole cell lysates. Plasmids were isolated from overnight cultures of selected colonies and, to ensure that only desired mutations were present, the entire coding region was verified by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing on both strands of DNA with Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). After an overnight incubation, a 20-ml culture was inoculated into 1 liter of LB broth containing ampicillin and grown at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (OD600 nm ∼ 0.6). IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C for additional 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, washed off from medium with 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and resuspended in the same buffer devoid of NaCl. After two rounds of freezing and thawing, bacterial cells were subjected to two passages through a French press (100 megapascals). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min before fractionation of the supernatant fraction with ammonium sulfate (20% to 90% of saturation). The final precipitate was dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 1 mm EDTA and exhaustively dialyzed against the same solution containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialyzate was applied onto a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated and eluted with 30 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 100 mm NaCl. Fractions having protein-disulfide reductase activity (see below) were pooled and loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the latter buffer. After desorption of proteins with a linear gradient between 0.1 and 0.6 m NaCl, fractions containing the protein-disulfide reductase activity were concentrated by ultrafiltration or lyophilization and dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The activity of Trx as protein-disulfide reductase was assessed in the presence of a dithiol (DTT) and an oxidized protein (insulin, di-FTC-insulin). In the classical turbidimetric assay (28Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we followed at 25 °C the increase of light attenuation at 650 nm after DTT (0.5 mm) was added to a solution of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm insulin, and Trx (∼1.5 μm). In the novel fluorometric assay (29Heuck A.P. Wolosiuk R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,30Heuck A.P. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1997; 34: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the reaction, carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.7 μmdi-FTC-insulin and Trx (typically 0.1 μm), was started adding DTT (0.1 mm). The reduction of di-FTC-insulin was monitored in a Jasco FP-770 spectrofluorometer by following the emission intensity at 519 nm when the fluorophore was excited at 495 nm. Given the appearance of lag phases in both procedures, we used the maximum rate of the measurement for the calculation of the protein-disulfide reductase activity. Alternatively, the couple NADPH and NADP-thioredoxin reductase can be used as a reductant of Trx instead of DTT. To this end, the reaction was carried out at 25 °C with Trx (∼1.5 μm) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mmEDTA, 0.3 mm NADPH, and either 0.1 mm insulin or 0.026 mm napin. The reaction was started by the addition of NADP-thioredoxin reductase (25 nm) and followed by the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm. To evaluate the interaction of Trx with NADP-thioredoxin reductase, we analyzed the oxidation of NADPH linked to the reduction of DTNB (Ellman's reagent). The reaction was performed at 25 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmNADPH, 1 mm DTNB, and Trx (from 0.3 to 10 μm). The generation of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate was started by the addition of NADP-thioredoxin reductase (25 nm) and followed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. The molar absorptivity of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate at 412 nm was 14,140m−1·cm−1 for all calculations, and data were fitted to a hyperbolic function by a non-linear least squares method. The reversibility of the reaction was followed at 25 °C according to Moore et al. (33Moore E.C. Reichard P. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH+H++Trx(S)2↔NADP­thioredoxin reductaseNADP++Trx(SH)2REACTION 1 Briefly, the reaction cuvette contained initially 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mmEDTA, 50 μm NADPH (ε340 nm = 6, 200m−1·cm−1), 1.18 mmNADP (ε260 nm = 15, 300m−1·cm−1), 20 nmNADP-thioredoxin reductase, and variable amounts of Trx (from 8 to 20 μm). Absorbance at 340 nm was followed spectrophotometrically until it remained constant for 2 min. At this stage, NADP+ was added and the time-progress variation ofA 340 was measured again. On the basis of (i) changes of NADPH concentration and (ii) the stoichiometry of the above reaction, concentrations of NADP+ and oxidized and reduced Trx were calculated. From these data, the calculation of the equilibrium constant Keq=[Trx(SH)2]·[NADP+]·[Trx(S)2]−1·[NADPH]−1Equation 1 provided the redox potential, E°′(Trx)= E°′(NADP) + (RT/nF)·ln K eq, in whichE°′(NADP) = −0.324 V (25 °C, pH 7.0),R = 8.31 J·m−1·K−1, n= 2, and F = 96,487 J·m−1·V−1. To assess the reductive activation of CFBPase, the activity was analyzed by the two-stage assay (31Hertig C.M. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 984-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme (typically 0.8 μg) was incubated at 24 °C for 30 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9), 5 mm DTT, and Trx. Following the incubation, an aliquot was withdrawn and injected into the solution for the assay of activity (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and 0.1 mm EGTA). The hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was halted after 3 min at 24 °C by adding the reagent for the quantification of the Pi released (32Chen P.S. Toribara T.I. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. using bovine serum albumin as standard (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A molar extinction coefficient of 13,700m−1·cm−1 at 280 nm was used to quantitate pure Trx preparations (35Reutimann H. Straub B. Luisi P.L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6796-6803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-dimensional PAGE was run using the Mini-PROTEAN II equipment from Bio-Rad. SDS-PAGE and nondenaturing PAGE were performed according to Schägger and von Jagow (36Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10501) Google Scholar) and Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar), respectively. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained in methanol:acetic acid:H2O (5:1:4, v/v/v). The coordinates of the oxidized wild type E. coli Trx were derived from the high resolution NMR studies of Jeng et al. (38Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.A. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Model building of spinach chloroplast Trx-f by the automated SWISS-MODEL program (41Peitsch M.C. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) used as template the coordinates of human Trx (39Qin J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 503-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas the tertiary structures of spinach chloroplast Trx-m and E. coli variants were based on the solved structures of E. coli (38Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.A. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) andAnabaena (40Saarinen M. Gleason F.K. Eklund H. Structure. 1995; 3: 1097-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) counterparts. Electrostatic potential maps on the surface of proteins were obtained by running the GRASP program (42Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics Iris 4.X computer. To this end, the electrostatic potential was calculated using the following parameters: internal dielectric of the protein, 2.0; solvent dielectric, 80.0; ionic strength, 150 mm; probe radius, 1.4 Å; ionic radius, 2 Å; net charge of all arginine and lysine residues, +1; and net charge of all aspartic and glutamic residues, −1. Any rational attempt to determine the amino acid residues of chloroplast Trx-f that contribute to the formation of the binary complex with CFBPase should be based on the atomic model of both partners. At the onset of the project, there had been no published three-dimensional structures of the former (43Génovésio-Taverne J.-C. Jetzer Y. Sauder U. Hohenester E. Hughet C. Jansonius J.N. Gardet-Salvi L. Schürmann P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but the structures of the oxidized and reduced forms of E. coli and human Trx were available (44Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed a comparative study among computer-simulated models of site-directed mutants aimed at specifically defining the distribution of charges on the surface that surrounds the redox-active site. We initially relied on the atomic coordinates of human Trx to simulate the tertiary structure of plastidic Trx-f by the SWISS-MODEL program (41Peitsch M.C. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similarly, the tertiary structure assignment of spinach chloroplast Trx-m was based on the atomic coordinates of E. coli andAnabaena Trxs (38Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.A. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 40Saarinen M. Gleason F.K. Eklund H. Structure. 1995; 3: 1097-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As expected, modeled chloroplast Trxs retained the general features of these proteins, i.e.they consisted of a β-pleated sheet of three parallel and two antiparallel strands surrounded by four helical segments (45Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16924-16927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We subsequently calculated by the GRASP program the electrostatic potential at the level of solvent-accessible surface and represented the isopotential contours at ± 2 kT (Fig. 1). Although modeled proteins had almost the same size (E. coli Trx, 13,300 Å3; spinach chloroplast Trx-f, 13,600 Å3; spinach chloroplast Trx-m, 13,700 Å3), the volume of positively charged isopotential shells of chloroplast Trx-f (3,200 Å3) exceeded that ofE. coli Trx (2,500 Å3) and chloroplast Trx-m (1,200 Å3). Mirroring this distribution of charges, the volume of negative contours was 12,700 Å3 for chloroplast Trx-m, 9,200 Å3 for E. coli, and 7,800 Å3 for chloroplast Trx-f. These calculations, however approximate, disclosed that the surface of chloroplast Trx-f lacked large negatively charged areas which were present in E. coliand chloroplast m-type Trxs. Moreover, these data were consistent with a higher pI value for spinach chloroplast Trx-f (6.1) than for E. coli (4.67) and spinach chloroplast Trx-m (4.5) (46Schürmann P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In light of these results, we sought in the primary structure of E. coliTrx information on amino acid residues that (i) interacted with the solvent in the vicinity of the active site, (ii) lay on somewhat distorted regions, an"
https://openalex.org/W2120156016,"To investigate a possible association between G-proteins and presenilin-1 (PS-1), a series of glutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins containing portions of PS-1 were prepared and used in vitro in binding experiments with tissue and recombinant G-proteins. The results demonstrate that the 39 C-terminal amino acids of PS-1 selectively bind the brain G-protein, Go. Addition of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate promoted Godissociation from PS-1, indicating that this domain mimics the function of G-protein-coupling domains found in receptors. The 39-amino acid synthetic polypeptide activated Go in a magnesium ion-dependent manner. Physical interaction of full-length PS-1 and Go was also demonstrated. Following transfection of Goα and N-terminally FLAG-tagged PS-1 in COS-7 cells, Go was immunoprecipitated by FLAG antibodies. In addition, endogenous PS-1 and Goα were colocalized immunocytochemically in human glioma cell lines. The results indicate that PS-1 regulates Go activities in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2142798708,"The cerebellar Purkinje cell-specific PCP-2 gene is transcriptionally activated by thyroid hormone during the 2nd and 3rd weeks of postnatal life in the rat. In contrast, thyroid hormone has no detectable effects on PCP-2 expression in the fetal rat. We now present data that suggest that the orphan nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) represses triiodothyronine (T3)-dependent transcriptional activation of PCP-2 in the immature Purkinje cell. Gel shift assays show that the PCP-2 A1TRE and adjoining sequences (−295/−199 region) bind to rat and mouse brain nucleoproteins in a developmentally regulated fashion and that one of these nucleoproteins could be the orphan nucleoprotein COUP-TF. In support of this hypothesis, in vitro translated COUP-TF binds to the −295/−199 region and COUP-TF represses T3-dependent activation of the PCP-2 promoter in transient transfection analyses. Finally, immunohistochemical studies reveal that COUP-TF is specifically expressed in the immature fetal and early neonatal Purkinje cell and that this expression diminishes coincident with thyroid hormone induction of PCP-2 expression. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the presence or absence of inhibitory proteins bound to the thyroid hormone response element of T3-responsive genes governs the responsivity of these genes to thyroid hormone during brain development."

However, in a vascularized organ, a xenograft between discordant species, such as swine to human (4Calne R.Y. Transplant. Proc. 1970; 2: 550-556PubMed Google Scholar), hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes due to the destruction of endothelial cells, a process that is mediated by fixation of natural antibodies and/or complement activation (5Miyagawa S.

Therefore, in the present study, we employed ST3Gal III, which catalyzes the transfer of sialic acids to a lactosamine structure, mainly to N-linked terminal sugar residues.DISCUSSIONThe amelioration of antigenicity of SECs by overexpression of α2,3ST was examined as a possible approach to provide a permanent solution for overcoming hyperacute rejection in clinical xenotransplantation.As expected, the down-regulation of xenoantigenicity was quite obvious for the case of the α2,3ST transfectants as judged by flow cytometric analysis and a cytotoxicity assay. However, no measurable differences between α2,3ST and α1,2FT transfectants were observed. Therefore, Western and lectin blot analysis of the α2,3ST transfectants was carried out. However, both α2,3ST and α1,2FT also reduced the the extent of reactivity to human IgG and IgM, and they reduced the reactivity to α-galactosyl epitopes in nearly the same manner (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the changes in the bands for these transfectants were more evident for IgG and IB4 lectin than for IgM blotting. This is consistent with data reported by Galili et al. (15Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A. Peleg A. Flechner I. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 16Galili U. Clark M.R. Shohet S.B. Buehler J. Macher B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nearly the same results were obtained for the α1,2FT transfectants.It might be generally thought that α1,2FT is effective in modulatingN-linked sugars as well as O-linked sugars and glycolipids, whereas α2,3ST;ST3GalIII mainly affectsN-linked sugars (31Hamamoto T. Kawasaki M. Kurosawa N. Nakaoka T. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, at the present time, there are no specific data to support this hypothesis. Therefore, it is possible that α2,3ST;ST3GalIII might have affectedO-linked sugars and glycolipids, as well asN-linked sugars, on the SECs. On the contrary, the results in this study are consistent with findings in our previous study of SEC transfectantants with β-d-mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, which acts on an N-linked sugar (41Tanemura M. Miyagawa S. Ihara Y. Matsuda H. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this is that the α2,3ST;ST3GalIII and α1,2FT gene acts largely on the same xenoepitopes of N-linked sugars.In addition, regarding α1,2FT-transfected SECs, Sepp et al. (32Sepp A. Skacel P. Lindstedt R. Lechler R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23104-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported only a 40–50% decrease in the expression of the α-galactosyl epitopes in their PLECT cell model, which contained α1,2FT. However, Sandrin et al. (33Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) reported an approximately 70% decrease in the α-galactosyl epitopes of LLC-PK1 in their study. In this study, the data relative to α1,2FT-transfected SECs are in good agreement with the latter study.It is generally accepted that transfection of α1,2FT or α2,3ST decreases the α-galactosyl epitope as the result of the intracellular enzymatic competition for a common acceptor substrate with α1,3GT. In this study, we also analyzed the mechanism by which the α-galactosyl epitope is reduced. As expected, the data in this study clearly showed that the α-galactosyl epitopes were reduced in both the α1,2FT and α2,3ST transfectants. However, to our surprise, the data provided evidence that the enzymatic activities of α1,3GT in the transfectants were remarkably low as compared to those of parental SECs and mock controls (Table II).In each enzymatic activity assay in this study, excess substrate was used to avoid the effect of artifacts resulting from overexpressed glycosyltransferases. The reliability of each value for enzymatic activity was confirmed by the fact that the value in enzymatic assay of α1,3GT was not affected by adding a high dose of exogenous α1,2FT and α2,3ST (Table III).Furthermore, Northern blotting was carried out to verify that this reduction of α1,3GT activity was the result of mRNA production. The results relative to the mRNA levels of α1,3GT correspond to those of α1,3GT enzymatic activity in each transfectant. However, the rate of down-regulation of α1,3GT activity in each transfectant was milder than that of antigenicity to NHS and changes in the complement dependent cell lysis. Therefore, the alteration of the α-galactosyl epitopes cannot be explained solely by the the down-regulation of mRNA levels of α1,3GT. We therefore conclude that transfections of the α1,2FT and α2,3ST genes into SECs reduced the α-galactosyl epitopes as the result of both intracellular enzymatic competition and the reduction of intrinsic activity of α1,3GT due to the low expression of mRNA.Regarding the β1,4GT activity, the up-regulation of the enzyme activities of these transfectants is shown in Table II. However, because the gene code of this molecule in swine has not yet been reported, it is impossible to verify the mRNA levels of this enzyme. To understand the mechanism will require more detailed investigations into the influence of, for example, α1,3GT and β1,4GT activities, message formation, gene transcription, and so forth, by the overexpression of other glycosyltransferase genes. Xenotransplantation has been proposed as the most promising procedure to alleviate the world-wide shortage of organs for transplantation (1Auchincloss Jr., H.

However, in a vascularized organ, a xenograft between discordant species, such as swine to human (4Calne R.Y. Transplant. Proc. 1970; 2: 550-556PubMed Google Scholar), hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes due to the destruction of endothelial cells, a process that is mediated by fixation of natural antibodies and/or complement activation (5Miyagawa S.

Initial attempts to prevent hyperacute rejection have focused on modification of the donor xenograft via the expression of human complement regulatory proteins (6Seya T. Turner J.R. Atkinson J.P. J.

Therefore, humans produce a natural antibody that makes up as much as 1% of the circulating IgG in humans and is also found in significant amounts as an IgM antibody (15Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A.

One strategy to down-regulate the α-galactosyl epitope is to knock out the α1,3GT gene using embryonic stem cells (21Thall A.D. Maly P. Lowe J.B. J. Biol.

Another strategy for down-regulating the α-galactosyl epitope is to take advantage of enzymatic competition involving terminal glycosylation between the α1,3GT and other glycosyltransferases for the common acceptor substrate. Several glycosyltransferases, such as α1,2 fucosyltransferase (α1,2FT) (24Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the antigenicity of swine endothelial cells is affected by α2,3ST, an enzyme that catalyzes the sialylation of N-acetyllactosamine (Gal β1-4GluNAc β1-) to form α2,3-sialylN-acetyllactosamine, the precursor of the sialyl Lewis X structure (35Mollicone R.

However, the rate of down-regulation of α1,3GT activity in each transfectant was milder than that of antigenicity to NHS and changes in the complement dependent cell lysis. Therefore, the alteration of the α-galactosyl epitopes cannot be explained solely by the the down-regulation of mRNA levels of α1,3GT. We therefore conclude that transfections of the α1,2FT and α2,3ST genes into SECs reduced the α-galactosyl epitopes as the result of both intracellular enzymatic competition and the reduction of intrinsic activity of α1,3GT due to the low expression of mRNA.Regarding the β1,4GT activity, the up-regulation of the enzyme activities of these transfectants is shown in Table II. However, because the gene code of this molecule in swine has not yet been reported, it is impossible to verify the mRNA levels of this enzyme. To understand the mechanism will require more detailed investigations into the influence of, for example, α1,3GT and β1,4GT activities, message formation, gene transcription, and so forth, by the overexpression of other glycosyltransferase genes. The amelioration of antigenicity of SECs by overexpression of α2,3ST was examined as a possible approach to provide a permanent solution for overcoming hyperacute rejection in clinical xenotransplantation. As expected, the down-regulation of xenoantigenicity was quite obvious for the case of the α2,3ST transfectants as judged by flow cytometric analysis and a cytotoxicity assay. However, no measurable differences between α2,3ST and α1,2FT transfectants were observed. Therefore, Western and lectin blot analysis of the α2,3ST transfectants was carried out. However, both α2,3ST and α1,2FT also reduced the the extent of reactivity to human IgG and IgM, and they reduced the reactivity to α-galactosyl epitopes in nearly the same manner (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the changes in the bands for these transfectants were more evident for IgG and IB4 lectin than for IgM blotting. This is consistent with data reported by Galili et al. (15Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A. Peleg A. Flechner I. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 16Galili U. Clark M.R. Shohet S.B. Buehler J. Macher B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 17Galili U. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 480-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Nearly the same results were obtained for the α1,2FT transfectants. It might be generally thought that α1,2FT is effective in modulatingN-linked sugars as well as O-linked sugars and glycolipids, whereas α2,3ST;ST3GalIII mainly affectsN-linked sugars (31Hamamoto T. Kawasaki M. Kurosawa N. Nakaoka T. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, at the present time, there are no specific data to support this hypothesis. Therefore, it is possible that α2,3ST;ST3GalIII might have affectedO-linked sugars and glycolipids, as well asN-linked sugars, on the SECs. On the contrary, the results in this study are consistent with findings in our previous study of SEC transfectantants with β-d-mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, which acts on an N-linked sugar (41Tanemura M. Miyagawa S. Ihara Y. Matsuda H. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this is that the α2,3ST;ST3GalIII and α1,2FT gene acts largely on the same xenoepitopes of N-linked sugars. In addition, regarding α1,2FT-transfected SECs, Sepp et al. (32Sepp A. Skacel P. Lindstedt R. Lechler R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23104-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported only a 40–50% decrease in the expression of the α-galactosyl epitopes in their PLECT cell model, which contained α1,2FT. However, Sandrin et al. (33Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) reported an approximately 70% decrease in the α-galactosyl epitopes of LLC-PK1 in their study. In this study, the data relative to α1,2FT-transfected SECs are in good agreement with the latter study. It is generally accepted that transfection of α1,2FT or α2,3ST decreases the α-galactosyl epitope as the result of the intracellular enzymatic competition for a common acceptor substrate with α1,3GT. In this study, we also analyzed the mechanism by which the α-galactosyl epitope is reduced. As expected, the data in this study clearly showed that the α-galactosyl epitopes were reduced in both the α1,2FT and α2,3ST transfectants. However, to our surprise, the data provided evidence that the enzymatic activities of α1,3GT in the transfectants were remarkably low as compared to those of parental SECs and mock controls (Table II). In each enzymatic activity assay in this study, excess substrate was used to avoid the effect of artifacts resulting from overexpressed glycosyltransferases. The reliability of each value for enzymatic activity was confirmed by the fact that the value in enzymatic assay of α1,3GT was not affected by adding a high dose of exogenous α1,2FT and α2,3ST (Table III). Furthermore, Northern blotting was carried out to verify that this reduction of α1,3GT activity was the result of mRNA production. The results relative to the mRNA levels of α1,3GT correspond to those of α1,3GT enzymatic activity in each transfectant. However, the rate of down-regulation of α1,3GT activity in each transfectant was milder than that of antigenicity to NHS and changes in the complement dependent cell lysis. Therefore, the alteration of the α-galactosyl epitopes cannot be explained solely by the the down-regulation of mRNA levels of α1,3GT. We therefore conclude that transfections of the α1,2FT and α2,3ST genes into SECs reduced the α-galactosyl epitopes as the result of both intracellular enzymatic competition and the reduction of intrinsic activity of α1,3GT due to the low expression of mRNA. Regarding the β1,4GT activity, the up-regulation of the enzyme activities of these transfectants is shown in Table II. However, because the gene code of this molecule in swine has not yet been reported, it is impossible to verify the mRNA levels of this enzyme. To understand the mechanism will require more detailed investigations into the influence of, for example, α1,3GT and β1,4GT activities, message formation, gene transcription, and so forth, by the overexpression of other glycosyltransferase genes.

https://openalex.org/W2083078196,"A number of cellular proteins have been identified as caspase targets during cell death, including the PITSLRE protein kinases. These targets generally fall into one of three possible categories: 1) other caspases, 2) proteins that are inactivated during apoptosis, and 3) proteins that are required for execution of the cell death program. However, not all proteins are cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. Why only specific proteins are destined to be processed by caspases during cell death is currently not clear. Here we show that multiple caspase-like activities are involved in the processing of the PITSLRE p110 isoforms during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells. Three p110 caspase cleavage sites have been mapped to the amino-terminal domain of p110 and verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Curiously, the mutagenesis studies revealed that cleavage of two juxtaposed caspase sites is necessary for the complete processing of this protein during cell death in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the PITSLRE p110 protein is rapidly phosphorylated during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells and that phosphorylation of an amino-terminal portion of the protein may enhance caspase cleavage in this region.

Finally, we demonstrate that the PITSLRE p110 protein is rapidly phosphorylated during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells and that phosphorylation of an amino-terminal portion of the protein may enhance caspase cleavage in this region. It has been well established that a family of cellular cysteine proteases, collectively known as caspases, act in a cascade to elicit and potentiate a number of apoptotic responses (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Not all cellular proteins are targets of these caspases. Those proteins that are targets generally fall into three categories: 1) other caspases, 2) proteins whose function must be ablated for cell death to occur, and 3) proteins whose function is required for execution of the cell death program. More recently, interest has been focused on the possible relationship between phosphorylation and caspase cleavage (3Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Gilmore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of IκB-α was shown to inhibit its cleavage by caspase-3 in vitro, whereas the unphosphorylated form of the protein is readily cleaved. Thus, phosphorylation of certain caspase targets may be part of an important cellular mechanism for controlling apoptosis. Furthermore, a number of protein kinases have been identified as caspase substrates, and their processing by these proteases frequently generates active forms of these kinases by removing autoinhibitory domains (4Lahti J.M.

Ectopic expression of these activated protein kinases induces many of the biochemical and cellular changes associated with cell death, suggesting that they participate in regulating some aspect of apoptotic signaling (9Cardone M.H.

Based on these studies, it is tempting to speculate that caspase cleavage and activation of specific protein kinases/phosphatases during apoptosis facilitate caspase processing of certain protein targets. The PITSLRE protein kinases constitute a large family of p34cdc2-related kinases whose function(s) appear to be somewhat diverse (4Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The larger PITSLRE p110 isoforms may function to regulate some aspect of RNA splicing/transcription during the cell cycle (19Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11694-11697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of a PITSLRE p50 isoform that resembles the final caspase-modified product has been shown to induce apoptosis (13Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7467-7471Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fas-mediated T-cell death has also been correlated with PITSLRE proteolysis and an increase in its histone H1 kinase activity (4Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the in vivo caspase cleavage sites involved in PITSLRE p110 proteolysis during Fas-induced apoptosis and the possible relationship between the phosphorylation and proteolysis of these p110 isoforms. Intriguingly, phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain of p110 during Fas-induced death appears to facilitate its processing by caspases in vivo. In addition, the p110 isoforms are rapidly serine-phosphorylated once Fas-induced apoptosis is initiated in Jurkat T-cells. Others have recently shown that phosphorylation of IκB-α by MEKK1-activated IκB-α kinasein vitro blocked its cleavage by caspase-3 (3Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Gilmore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that phosphorylation of specific proteins during Fas-induced apoptosis may help to regulate their processing by caspases in vivo. Human Jurkat cells and Jt-1 cells, Jurkat cells stably transfected with the rtTA transactivation plasmid pUHD172-1 (21Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For Fas-induced cell death analysis, cells at a density of 1.5 × 106 were treated with an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, CH-11 (Kamiya Biomedical Co.), at 100 ng/ml for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. Apoptotic cells were examined with a light microscope for the appearance of plasma membrane blebbing and by the TUNEL assay (22Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). PITSLRE expression constructs were generated by insertion of appropriate cDNA fragments corresponding to the protein kinase into the Tet-inducible vector pUHD10-3. The PITSLRE ICE2 expression construct was made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the cDNA fragment containing amino acid residues 392–771 with a pair of primers containing a Kozak sequence at the N terminus and a FLAG tag at the C terminus. The amplified cDNA fragment was then inserted into the pUHD10-3 vector at EcoRI andXbaI sites, and its sequence integrity was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Using the same strategy, additional C-terminal FLAG-tagged expression constructs of PITSLRE, including the p58-FLAG construct containing amino acid residues 339–771, N419 (residues 1–419), N370 (residues 1–370), N290 (residues 1–290), were generated. Transient transfection of Jt-1 cells with PITSLRE expression constructs was performed by electroporation using Gene PulserTM(Bio-Rad). Typically, 107 cells resuspended in 0.3 ml of cell growth medium containing 12 μg of the designated plasmid DNA were electroporated using a 4-mm gap cuvette at 0.25 kV and 960 microfarads. Cells were then cultured in 12 ml of growth medium for 48 h in the presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The transfection efficiency was routinely between 20 and 30% as determined by FACS analysis using green fluorescent protein as a marker. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glyceryl phosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Boehringer Mannheim). 50 μg of cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk. This was followed by incubation with a designated primary antibody. Signals were detected by use of an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-Fas mAb (CH-11) induced caspase activation in Jurkat and Jt-1 cells, which was monitored by cleavage of endogenous caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by Western blot analysis. The extent of Fas-induced cell death was purposely limited to <30–40% of all cells to allow visualization of proteolytic changes, particularly the formation of PITSLRE p110 intermediates. Inhibition of Fas-induced caspase activation was carried out by incubation of Jurkat or Jt-1 cells with leupeptin, ZFA-fmk, YVAD-fmk, IETD-fmk, DEVD-fmk, or zVAD-fmk (Enzyme System Products) at 1–50 μm concentrations for 2 h before the addition of, and during incubation with, the CH-11 antibody to the cells. Single site-directed substitution and double site-directed substitutions were generated in the PITSLRE expression constructs by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis protocol that is similar to that described in a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (ExsiteTM PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit). For single substitution of Asp391 with Ala, a pair of 5′-phosphorylated nonoverlapping primers carrying the designed nucleotide substitution on the 5′-end of the primer was used to amplify the p58 PITSLRE-pUHD10-3 construct by PCR usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After treatment of the PCR with DpnI to destroy the parental DNA template at 37 °C for 1.5 h, the amplified DNA was gel-purified and intramolecularly ligated to recircularize the DNA molecule. The primers used to substitute D391A were 5′-pCCTCCCCTGCCCTGTCG-3′ and 5′-pCGGGCACATAGTCGCCC-3′. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 15 min for 20 cycles using a DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer). Using the same strategy, the single substitution of D387A and the double substitution of D387A and D391A in the p58 background and the single substitution of D39A or D42A and the double substitution of these residues with Ala in the N419, N370, and N290 backgrounds were generated. The oligonucleotides used for this mutagenesis were as follows: D387A, 5′-pCTATGTGCCCGACTCCCCTG-3′ and 5′-pGCGCCCTCTGTCAGGGC-3′; D387A/D391A, 5′-pTGCCCGCCTCCCCTGCCCTGTCG-3′ and 5′-pCATAGGCGCCCTCTGTCAGGC-3′; D39A, D42A, and D39A/D42A, 5′-pCGGGM(ATC)TTCCAAGCGGGATTCCCTT-3′ and 5′-pGTCAK(TTG)CAGAATTTTTTAAGCGTTTTATCTCTG-3′. Verification of the proper mutation and the integrity of the remainder of these constructs were accomplished by DNA sequence analysis of the final products. Apoptotic cells were detected by the TUNEL assay (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's protocol. The percentage of apoptotic cells during the anti-Fas CH-11 antibody treatment was quantitated using FACS analysis to detect cells with DNA content less than G0/G1 (23Fraker P.J. King L.E. Lill-Elghanian D. Telfork W.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 57-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Basically, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol at a density of 106/ml for 1 h. After washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were stained with a propidium iodide solution containing phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml RNase A, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were then subjected to FACS analysis. Typically, the percentage of apoptotic Jurkat cells after 2, 4, 6, and 8 h of anti-FAS antibody treatment was ∼5, 11, 15, and 25, respectively. Jurkat cells were cultured in the presence of inorganic phosphorus-32 (0.5 mCi/ml) for 6 h and then challenged with the anti-Fas CH-11 antibody for different periods of time. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer as described above. The phosphorylated PITSLRE p110 protein was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the first 100 amino acid residues of the kinase, P2N100 (16Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μg of total cell lysate was incubated with the antibody plus protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C for 4 h, and the protein A-agarose beads were then washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitated p110 proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. Phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography at −80 °C with a pair of amplifying screens overnight. The area of the membrane containing phosphorylated PITSLRE p110 was then cut out, and phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out using a Hunter thin-layer electrophoresis system (Model HTLE-7000) according to a published protocol (24Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). For phosphatase treatment, N370 PITSLRE, expressed in Jt-1 cells, was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) and then resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0, 10, 20, and 40 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× SDS protein sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE separation followed by immunoblotting with the P2N100 antibody. We were initially interested in determining whether caspase cleavage of the PITSLRE p110 isoforms during Fas-mediated apoptosis resembled what was previously observed during TNFα-induced cell death (20Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11694-11697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mapping of these caspase cleavage sites was accomplished through analysis of cell lysate from Jurkat cells treated with various caspase inhibitors and transient expression of numerous PITSLRE expression constructs in these same cells. To determine whether Asp391 (Asp393 in the PITSLRE α2-1 cDNA used by Beyaert et al. (20Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11694-11697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) cleaved during TNF-induced apoptosis was also cleaved during Fas-mediated death, we examined the proteolysis of exogenously expressed PITSLRE β1 (p58-FLAG) and a truncated form of the PITSLRE p110 protein that mimics the Asp391 cleavage (ICE2-FLAG) (Fig. 1 A). Both of these exogenously expressed PITSLRE proteins were tagged at their carboxyl terminus with a FLAG epitope that is recognized by commercially available anti-FLAG polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. As expected, the p58-FLAG protein containing the equivalent Asp391 was readily cleaved, whereas the ICE2-FLAG protein, which mimicked cleavage at this site, was not (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, this caspase cleavage site must be localized to a region between residues 339 and 391 of the PITSLRE α2-2 p110 protein. Cell death was confirmed by monitoring the cells using the TUNEL assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). To help in determining the nature of this cleavage site, peptide inhibitors that block all or specific caspases (e.g. zVAD, DEVD, and YVAD (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem.

Two additional peptide inhibitors, ZFA and leupeptin, were used as controls. As expected, zVAD effectively blocked cleavage (data not shown), and 50 μm DEVD-fmk, which preferentially inhibits caspase-3 (27Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. et al.Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar), also inhibited the formation of the caspase-processed fragment (Fig. 1 B). We also examined a D562N p58-FLAG mutant, which effectively disrupts kinase activity, to determine whether intrinsic kinase activity influences the cleavage process. Caspase processing of the D562N p58-FLAG protein and DEVD inhibition of its cleavage were identical to what was observed for the wild-type protein (Fig. 1 B). Whereas neither of the control peptides inhibited caspase-directed cleavage at concentrations that were comparable to those of zVAD and DEVD-fmk, high concentrations of ZFA (10–20-fold higher than either zVAD or DEVD) appeared to inhibit the generation of the PITSLRE p14 fragment (Fig. 2). Furthermore, 10–40 μmZFA inhibited caspase processing of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, whereas a 50 μm concentration did not. This rather curious effect of ZFA, a serine protease inhibitor, is similar to what has been reported when the chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibitor TPCK was used to treat apoptotic T-cells (30Zhu H. Dinsdale D. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was suggested that these effects are consistent with at least three distinct targets of TPCK, involving cell survival, internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, and modulation of apoptosis induced by different stimuli. In addition, others have shown that serine proteases (e.g. granzyme B and AP24) act both upstream and downstream of caspase-3 during apoptosis (31Quan L.T. Tewari M. O'Rourke K. Dixit V. Snipas S.J.

When cells were treated with leupeptin, however, there was no discernible effect on caspase processing of PITSLRE p110 or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 2). This is similar to what has been reported by another group studying caspase processing of protein kinase Cδ (5Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar).Figure 2Multiple caspases appear to be involved in cleavage of PITSLRE p110 during Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Cells were cultured in the presence of different reagents at different concentrations, as indicated, for 2 h and then treated for 4 h with the anti-Fas CH-11 mAb. Cell lysate (50 μg) from each condition was immunoblotted with the PITSLRE-specific P2N100 antibody (Ab) (16Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (upper panels) or an anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) polyclonal antibody (lower panels). The intact and caspase-processed PITSLRE and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteins are indicated by the arrows. The results from Western blot analysis of PITSLRE proteins and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from ZFA/anti-Fas mAb- and leupeptin/anti-Fas mAb-treated cells are shown the third and fourth panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If only the Asp391 site was utilized during Fas-induced apoptosis, a proteolytic fragment of ∼64 kDa should be detected with the previously characterized P2N100 antiserum (16Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which reacts specifically with the amino terminus of p110 (Fig. 3 C). However, when the PITSLRE p110 isoforms were examined with P2N100, additional fragments that did not correspond to the Asp391 site were observed (Fig. 2,upper panels). Several new prominent bands of ∼64, 56, and 14 kDa (p64, p56, and p14) were seen 1–2 h after anti-Fas mAb treatment (Fig. 2, upper panels). In these experiments, cell death was monitored by both TUNEL assay and caspase cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 2,lower panels). By 6 h post anti-Fas mAb treatment, the p110, p64, and p56 bands were greatly diminished, and p14 was very prominent (data not shown). Once again, various peptide inhibitors of caspase activity were used in an effort to determine the nature of these cleavage events (Fig. 2, upper panels). The peptide inhibitor zVAD-fmk has been shown to inhibit all cellular caspase activity (25Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). As expected, 1–5 μm zVAD effectively inhibited proteolysis of p110, but the cleavage sites involved in the generation of the p56 and p64 intermediates appeared to be more sensitive to zVAD than the cleavage site for p14 (Fig. 2, first upper panel). This differential sensitivity to caspase peptide inhibitors suggests that the p110 caspase cleavage sites involve multiple enzymes. A 10 μm concentration of IETD, a peptide inhibitor that preferentially blocks caspase-8 (33Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), was required to block the generation of p14, p56, and p64 (Fig. 2, first upper panel). Formation of the p14, p56, and p64 fragments was also blocked by 10–25 μm DEVD-fmk, but even at a 50 μm concentration of YVAD-fmk, a caspase-1-sensitive inhibitor (27Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. et al.Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar), the formation of the p56 and p64 fragments was not completely inhibited (Fig. 2, second upper panel). These results suggest that more than one caspase-like activity is involved in the processing of p110 during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Since Asp391 had previously been identified as a caspase-3/caspase-1-like p110 cleavage site in vitro during TNF-induced apoptosis (20Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11694-11697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we used a p58-FLAG expression construct containing an Ala residue at this location (D391A) to examine caspase cleavage during Fas-induced cell death in vivo (Fig. 3 A). The FLAG tag at the carboxyl terminus allowed us to clearly distinguish the exogenous and endogenous PITSLRE proteins, and it also allowed us to confirm that caspase cleavage was not occurring beyond Asp391. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that this mutation was not sufficient to block caspase cleavage at this site in vivo, whereas it effectively blocked TNF-induced caspase cleavage in vitro (20Beyaert R. Kidd V.J. Cornelis S. Van de Craen M. Denecker G. Lahti J.M. Gururajan R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. J. Biol.

A closer examination of the sequence of the p110 protein in this region (Leu-Thr-Glu-Gly-Asp387-Tyr-Val-Pro-Asp391-Ser) revealed that an additional caspase cleavage site is located at Asp387. Whereas the Asp391 cleavage site most closely resembles the consensus caspase-1 recognition motif (1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2087913577,"The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is a member of the cytokine receptor family. Its function is to mediate cellular responses upon binding of growth hormone. Ligand binding induces dimerization and activation of the GHR. One mechanism by which the GHR is rapidly inactivated involves the ubiquitin conjugation system, a system implicated in the degradation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. We have shown previously that the ubiquitin-conjugating system mediates internalization of the GHR. Here, we present evidence that in addition to the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis signal, the cytosolic tail of the GHR contains a di-leucine motif. Upon truncation of the GHR at amino acid residue 349, this di-leucine motif is activated and mediates ubiquitin-independent internalization of the receptor. Di-leucine-mediated GHR internalization requires functional clathrin-coated pits and results in GHR transport to the lysosome. Although the full-length GHR internalizes independent of the di-leucine motif, this motif may function in internalization of GHR isoforms.

Although the full-length GHR internalizes independent of the di-leucine motif, this motif may function in internalization of GHR isoforms. Internalization of membrane proteins may be mediated via several amino acid sequences within the cytosolic domain (1Trowbridge I.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The most common sequences consist of short stretches of amino acids, termed coated pit localization signals. The tyrosine-based motifs NPXY and YXXØ (where X is any amino acid and Ø is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic group) are well known internalization motifs involved in endocytosis of many transmembrane proteins (3Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Receptors such as the LDL receptor are endocytosed via their NPXY motif (4Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while receptors such as the transferrin receptor and the asialoglycoprotein receptor are sorted from the plasma membrane via a YXXØ motif (5Collawn J.F.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10009-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). These tyrosine-based motifs are thought to form a tight turn conformation. Another well known endocytosis motif is the di-leucine motif. Internalization of the insulin and β2-adrenergic receptor is mediated by this motif (7Haft C.R. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

The amino terminus of GLUT4 contains a FQQI internalization motif (14Piper R.C. Tai C. Kulesza P. Pang S. Warnock D. Baenziger J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Puri C. James D.E. J.

Recently, it was shown that the attachment of ubiquitin moieties is involved in internalization of several plasma membrane proteins (17Hicke L.

The growth hormone receptor (GHR) 1The abbreviations used are: GHR, growth hormone receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MEM-α, Eagle's minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: GHR, growth hormone receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MEM-α, Eagle's minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a mammalian plasma membrane protein whose internalization is mediated by the ubiquitin conjugation system (21Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In particular, the Phe327 residue within the GHR cytosolic tail is involved in both GHR ubiquitination and ligand-induced receptor endocytosis (22Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D.

However, whether the GHR itself needs to be ubiquitinated in order to internalize ligand remains to be elucidated. The GHR initiates the cellular actions of growth hormone (GH) and belongs to the family of cytokine receptors (24Finidori J. Kelly P.A. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The GHR is a type I glycoprotein (M r130,000) consisting of 620 amino acid residues with a 350-cytoplasmic residue tail, a 24-amino acid transmembrane domain, and 246 residues in the extracellular domain containing five potentialN-glycosylation sites. The receptor has a short half-life (26Murphy L.J. Lazarus L. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Baxter R.C.

Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that the GHR is transported to the nucleus (29Lobie P.E. Mertani H. Morel G. Morales-Bustos O. Norstedt G. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21330-21339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to detergent-insoluble membrane domains (30Goldsmith J.F. Lee S.J. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 36: E932-E941Google Scholar) and back to the plasma membrane (31Ilondo M.M. Vanderschueren Lodeweyckx M. Courtoy P.J. de Meyts P. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2037-2044PubMed Google Scholar). GHR signaling is initiated at the plasma membrane when two receptors are dimerized by a single GH molecule (32Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). This dimerization induces recruitment and binding of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 (33Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), resulting in the activation of various signal transduction pathways (34Argetsinger L.S. Cartersu C. Physiol.

In the present study, we examined the internalization of GHR truncation mutant 1–349. Although the wild-type receptor internalized in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, this truncation mutant internalized independent of the ubiquitin conjugation system. Further analysis revealed that a carboxyl-terminal di-leucine motif was responsible for internalization of truncation mutant 1–349. This di-leucine motif mediated clathrin-dependent internalization of the mutant, but not of the full-length wild type receptor. Antibody (mAb5) recognizing the luminal part of the GHR was from AGEN Inc., Parsippany, NJ. Antiserum specific for protein-ubiquitin conjugates was a generous gift from Dr. A. Ciechanover (Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel). hGH was a generous gift of Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN. GHR cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. William Wood, Genentech. Culture medium, fetal bovine serum, and Geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The CHO cell line CHO-ts20 (36Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in this study. Due to a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), the ubiquitin conjugating system is inactive at the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C. CHO-ts20 cells were transfected with a pCB6 construct containing the full-length rabbit GHR cDNA sequence using the calcium phosphate transfection method. Truncated receptors were constructed by introducing stop codons at various positions within the cDNA of the rabbit GHR. For the GHR truncations 1–399, 1–349, and 1–314 without additional mutations, polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed, using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing an NcoI restriction site, corresponding to the NcoI site in the cDNA of the transmembrane region of the GHR, together with 3′-oligonucleotides containing a KpnI restriction site, a stop codon, and overlapping sequences at various positions within the cDNA, encoding the intracellular domain of the GHR. PCR products were cut byNcoI and KpnI and ligated into a PGEM3Z-GHR construct. The truncated GHR cDNAs were subcloned into the CMV-NEO expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For the other GHR truncations, PCRs were performed, using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing a PflMI site, corresponding to the PflMI site in the cDNA of the luminal part of the GHR and 3′-oligonucleotides containing a KpnI restriction site, a stop codon, and overlapping sequences at various positions within the cDNA, encoding the intracellular domain of the GHR. For construct GHR L347,348A a 5′-oligonucleotide was used that contained the mutations and a ClaI site, corresponding to the secondClaI site in the cDNA of the intracellular domain of the GHR. The 3′-oligonucleotide used for this construct overlapped cDNA surrounding the Bsu36I site. The 5′-oligonucleotide used for GHR construct 1–399 L347,348A contained the mutations and aClaI site, corresponding to the second ClaI site in the cDNA of the intracellular domain of the GHR, while the 3′-oligonucleotide contained a KpnI restriction site, a stop codon, and a sequence overlapping the cDNA, encoding the intracellular domain of the GHR up to amino acid residue 399. For construct 1–349 L347,348A a 5′-oligonucleotide was used which contained a PflMI site, corresponding to thePflMI site in the cDNA encoding the luminal domain of the GHR. The 3′-oligonucleotide used for this construct contained aKpnI restriction site, a stop codon, and a sequence overlapping the cDNA, encoding the intracellular domain of the GHR up to amino acid residue 349, including the appropriate mutations. These PCR products were digested by the indicated restriction enzymes and ligated directly into a pcDNA3-GHR construct, which was digested by the same enzymes. All constructs were verified by in vitro transcription-translation assays (Promega) and by sequencing. The cDNA constructs were transfected into CHO-ts20 cells using the calcium phosphate transfection method. For truncations 1–399, 1–349, and 1–314 and for GHR 1–349 L347,348A, clonal cell lines were obtained that expressed the receptor stably. For the other mutated receptors, cells were grown for 2 weeks in Geneticin after transfection, whereafter the cells were used for experiments. Stable Geneticin-resistant transfectants were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM-α) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin, and 0.45 mg/ml Geneticin. For experiments, cells were grown in 30- or 60-mm dishes in the absence of Geneticin to approximately 75% confluence. In the experiments described herein, 10 mm sodium butyrate was added to the cells 18 h before use to increase GHR expression (23Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Treatment of transfected CHO-ts20 cells with sodium butyrate did not alter the behavior of the GHR in any of the parameters examined in this study. The expression of wild-type and mutant receptors was analyzed by binding of 125I-hGH.125I-hGH was prepared using chloramine T (26Murphy L.J. Lazarus L. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in six-well culture dishes, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 2 h on ice with 0.2–18 nm125I-GH in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled GH. After extensive washing, 1 m NaOH was added, and the cell extracts were counted in an LKB γ counter. Plasma membrane receptor numbers and binding affinities were calculated by Scatchard analysis. For internalization studies, cells were grown in 30-mm dishes, washed with MEM-α, supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, incubated for 1 h at 30 °C or 42 °C in MEM-α/HEPES and for 0–120 min with 8 nm125I-GH (700,000 cpm), in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled GH. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, membrane-associated GH was removed by acid wash (0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m glycine, pH 2.5) (37Roupas P. Herington A.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1986; 47: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and internalized GH was determined by measuring the radioactivity after solubilization of the acid-treated cells by 1 m NaOH. To measure intracellular 125I-GH degradation, the incubation medium was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated after incubation of the cells with 125I-GH for different time periods. Briefly, part of the incubation medium was mixed with an equal volume of 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was determined. Cy3-GH was prepared using a Fluorolink-Cy3 label kit according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected CHO cells, grown on coverslips, were incubated for 60 min in MEM-α, supplemented with 20 mm HEPES at 30 °C or at the nonpermissive temperature (42 °C) and for 60 min with Cy3-GH (0.7 μg/ml). Cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound label and fixed for 2 h in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were embedded in mowiol, and confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS 4D system. Cells used for immunoprecipitations expressed wild-type GHR, GHR truncation 1–349, or GHR 1–349 L347,348A and contained 0.98 ± 0.09 × 106, 0.96 ± 0.05 × 106, and 1.79 ± 0.15 × 106 GH binding sites at the plasma membrane, respectively. These cells displayed the same binding affinity for hGH. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (21Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells, grown in 6-cm dishes, were incubated for 1 h in MEM–α, supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and for 15 or 30 min with 8 nm hGH. After GH incubation, cells were immediately lysed in 0.25 ml of boiling buffer, containing 1% SDS in PBS to avoid isopeptidase activity. After heating the lysate for 5 min at 100 °C and shearing the DNA, immunoprecipitations were performed in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin in PBS. The lysate was incubated with anti-ubiquitin antiserum for 2 h on ice. Immune complexes were isolated by the use of protein A-agarose beads (Repligen Co., Cambridge, MA). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the same buffer and twice with 10-fold diluted PBS. Immune complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with total cellular lysate and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper. Blots were immunostained using anti-GHR (23Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After incubating the blots with rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP, antigens were visualized using the ECL system (Boehringer Mannheim). Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by cellular cytosol acidification was performed as described by Sandvig et al. (38Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O., W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 30 min in MEM–α/HEPES and for 30 min in MEM–α/HEPES containing 20 mm NH4Cl. After washing the cells once with 0.14 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm amiloride, 1 g/liter glucose, 0.1% BSA pH 7.0, cells were incubated in the same buffer for 5 min, whereafter Cy3-GH or unlabeled GH was added to the dishes. Control cells were subjected to the same incubations, except that they were incubated in the absence of NH4Cl. All incubation steps were performed at 30 °C. The GHR consists of 620 amino acid residues, of which 350 residues are located intracellularly (Fig. 1). This intracellular domain contains all of the information required for signal transduction as well as for down-regulation. Previously, we characterized the internalization and ubiquitination of several GHR truncation mutants (23Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We showed that GHR truncation 1–349 internalized ligand and was ubiquitinated, while truncation mutants shorter than 314 amino acids residues were neither ubiquitinated nor able to internalize after binding of ligand. In the present study we examined whether the ubiquitin conjugation system was involved in endocytosis of these GHR mutants. Therefore we used the Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-ts20, which contains a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). This temperature-sensitive enzyme is inactive when the CHO-ts20 are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C, while at 30 °C the enzyme retains its full activity. We transfected the cDNAs of the truncation mutants into these cells and examined whether internalization of fluorescence-labeled GH via these receptors was abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 2 A). As we have shown before (21Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), wild-type GHR (panels 1–620) internalized in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. GH was internalized by the GHR at 30 °C, while the ligand remained at the plasma membrane at 42 °C, when the ubiquitin conjugation system is inactive. GHR truncations 1–600, 1–522, and 1–434 showed the same phenotype (not shown). Internalization of these receptors was also dependent on an intact ubiquitin-conjugating system, as was the case for GHR truncation 1–399 (Fig. 2 A). GHR truncation 1–349 showed vesicular Cy3-GH staining at 30 °C as well as at 42 °C (Fig. 2 A,panels 1–349), indicating that this truncation was still able to internalize ligand in the absence of an intact ubiquitin conjugation system. GHR truncation 1–314 on the other hand was not able to internalize ligand at 30 °C nor at 42 °C (Fig. 2 A). Quantification of ligand uptake using 125I-GH confirmed these data (Fig. 2 B). Unexpectedly, truncation of the GHR at amino acid residue 399 increased the uptake and internalization rate of125I-GH at 30 °C compared with the wild-type GHR. However, at the nonpermissive temperature, internalization of ligand was inhibited. In contrast, uptake of radiolabeled ligand by GHR truncation 1–349 at 42 °C occurred with similar kinetics as at 30 °C, indicating ubiquitin-independent internalization. Using the same thermosensitive CHO cells, we have demonstrated previously that the transferrin receptor is internalized independent of the ubiquitin conjugation system (21Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since this receptor returns to the plasma membrane after internalization, it was tempting to speculate that GHR truncation 1–349 was recycling. Therefore we determined the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium after incubating the cells with 125I-GH at 30 °C (Fig. 2 C). If the receptor recycled, this should not result in degraded (trichloroacetic acid-soluble) GH in the medium, since dissociation of ligand from the GHR does not occur at endosomal pH (391). However, truncation 1–399 as well as truncation 1–349 showed an increase in trichloroacetic acid-soluble radiolabel in the medium compared with wild-type GHR (GHR 1–620). This result derives from the increase of ligand uptake and clearly indicates that for both truncations the ligand and receptor are sorted to lysosomes. GHR truncation 1–349 internalizes independent of the ubiquitin conjugation system. Previously, we have shown that internalization of the wild type GHR is both ubiquitin-dependent and clathrin-mediated (23Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To examine whether truncation 1–349 was internalized via clathrin-coated pits, we subjected the cells to cellular cytosol acidification (Fig. 3 A), which retains clathrin lattices at the membrane but prevents coated vesicle formation. Cells were preincubated in 20 mm NH4Cl, whereafter they were incubated with fluorescence-labeled GH in a KCl/amiloride buffer. This treatment inhibited ligand uptake both for the wild type GHR (1–620) as well as for GHR truncation 1–349 (Fig. 3 A,right panels). Control incubations of the cells in the KCl/amiloride buffer without NH4Cl preincubation did show GH internalization (Fig. 3 A, left panels). This indicates that internalization of the GHR truncated at amino acid residue 349 is ubiquitin-independent but still dependent upon the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. We have shown previously that ubiquitination of the GHR is dependent upon clathrin-mediated endocytosis and that GHR truncation 1–349 can be ubiquitinated (23Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, we next determined whether this GHR truncation, which does not require an intact ubiquitin conjugation system for internalization, remains ubiquitinated upon inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. Therefore, we examined ubiquitination of wild type GHR and GHR truncation 1–349 when clathrin-mediated endocytosis was inhibited by cellular cytosol acidification (Fig. 3 B). Cells expressing wild-type GHR or GHR 1–349 were preincubated for 30 min in 20 mmNH4Cl and incubated for 5 min in a KCl/amiloride buffer and for 15 min in a KCl/amiloride buffer with or without 8 nmhGH. Control cells were incubated with or without 8 nm GH in the KCl/amiloride buffer without the NH4Cl preincubation. After the incubations, the cells were lysed, and protein-ubiquitin conjugates were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted (Fig. 3 B). The left lane in the two panels contains total cellular lysate and shows the apparent molecular masses of the two receptors (130 and 75 kDa, respectively). In each panel, the faster migrating band represents the receptor precursor and the slower migrating band represents the mature receptor. As only a few percent of the GHR is ubiquitinated, ubiquitination of the GHR cannot be detected in this lane, in accordance with our previous findings (21Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing approximately equal amounts of GHR were used for the anti-ubiquitin immunoprecipitation. The high molecular weight bands visible in the upper part of these lanes represent ubiquitinated receptors. Cells expressing wild-type GHR or GHR truncation 1–349 showed ubiquitination of the GHR, which was enhanced upon incubation of the cells with GH. However, when clathrin-mediated internalization was inhibited by cellular cytosol acidification, ubiquitination of both receptors was almost completely abrogated. This effect on GHR ubiquitination is not caused by a general inactivation of the ubiquitin conjugation system, since cellular cytosol acidification does not affect total cellular ubiquitination (23Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These data indicate that, while ubiquitination of GHR truncation 1–349 is not involved in internalization, inhibition of receptor internalization results in a marked reduction of ubiquitination of this mutant. To determine which domains are involved in the ubiquitin-independent internalization of GHR 1–349, we examined internalization of fluorescence-labeled GH by various GHR truncation mutants (Fig. 1) in the presence (30 °C) or absence (42 °C) of an active ubiquitin-conjugating system (Fig. 4). Cy3-GH internalization by truncations 1–399 to 1–359 was dependent upon an intact ubiquitin-conjugating system. At 30 °C these truncations showed a vesicular pattern, but at the nonpermissive temperature Cy3-GH remained at the plasma membrane. This indicated that amino acid residues 350–359 restored the ubiquitin-dependent internalization of the GHR. Ubiquitin-dependent GHR internalization was also restored by truncation of the receptor at amino acid residue 346, suggesting that the amino acid residues 347, 348, and 349 were involved in the ubiquitin-independent internalization of GHR truncation 1–349. Since this amino acid residue triplet comprised two sequential leucine residues and a serine residue, it likely represented a di-leucine endocytosis motif, responsible for ubiquitin-independent GHR internalization when the receptor was truncated at amino acid residue 349. The full-length receptor, however, was internalized only when the ubiquitin conjugation system is active, indicating that the di-leucine motif at position 347–348 was not an active endocytosis signal in the full-length GHR. GHR truncation mutants shorter than 330 amino acid residues did not internalize ligand at 30 °C nor at 42 °C. This finding demonstrated that the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif was located upstream of amino acid residue 334. For these experiments we used a mixed culture of stable transfectants, of which only a small percentage expressed the GHR to a considerable extent. Therefore, we were unable to determine whether these GHRs were ubiquitinated. We expect that GHR truncation 1–334 was ubiquitinated, while the internalization-deficient truncation 1–330 was not ubiquitinated. To investigate the role of the di-leucine motif at position 347–348 in internalization of the wild-type GHR, we mutated th"

Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytosolic polysomes as preproteins with amino-terminal targeting sequences (presequences) that are cleaved off after import into the organelle (1Ryan K.R.

Biochem. 1988; 36: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Each carrier protein consists of about 300 amino acid residues, is predicted to contain six membrane-spanning segments, and is thought to have evolved by triplication of an ancient gene (5Walker J.E.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The targeting signals in the carrier proteins are not exactly known. The available evidence indicates that the AAC contains at least two targeting signals distributed on distinct thirds of the preprotein (7Pfanner N. Hoeben P. Tropschug M. Neupert W. J. Biol.

In the past years, protein transport machineries have been identified in the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, termed Tom and Tim, respectively. Thereby a detailed picture was obtained of how presequence-containing (cleavable) preproteins are translocated into mitochondria (2Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 3Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 4Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr.

Biol. 1997; 13: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The presequences are recognized by the receptors Tom20 and Tom22 on the cis side of the outer membrane, and with the help of the small protein Tom5, the preproteins are inserted into the import pore Tom40. On the trans side of the outer membrane, the presequences can interact with the intermembrane space domain of Tom22. Driven by the membrane potential Δψ, the preproteins are inserted into the translocase of the inner membrane, formed by Tim23 and Tim17, and are then translocated into the matrix with the help of a driving system containing Tim44 and the heat shock protein 70. Based on import studies of AAC into mitochondria of the fungusNeurospora crassa, a number of import stages for inner membrane metabolite carriers were proposed (11Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol.

Stage I, the cytosolic transport form of AAC, probably in a complex with molecular chaperones; stage II, binding of AAC to the receptors on thecis side of the outer membrane (accumulation of AAC in the absence of Δψ and ATP); stage III, accumulation of AAC in mitochondria in the absence of a Δψ, but presence of ATP, leading to a transport intermediate that is protected against a treatment of mitochondria with trypsin (or low concentrations of proteinase K); stage IV, Δψ-dependent insertion of AAC into the inner membrane; stage V, assembled AAC in the inner membrane. Only the stage II intermediate(s) has been characterized in detail, initially inN. crassa and then mainly in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The carrier precursors are first recognized by the import receptor Tom70 (14Söllner T. Pfaller R. Griffiths G. Pfanner N. Neupert W.

Little is known about the requirements/components for the further steps of import of carrier proteins except of the strict Δψ dependence for insertion into the inner membrane (stage IV) (11Pfanner N.

Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). While Tim23-17 seems to be able to mediate a low efficient insertion of AAC (24Haucke V. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4560-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), Sirrenberg et al. (23Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) reported that the main machinery for insertion of carriers into the inner membrane is distinct from the Tim23-17 complex and is formed by a complex containing Tim22. It is unknown if and where the import pathway of carrier proteins separates from that of presequence-containing preproteins. For this report, we attempted to characterize the stage III intermediate of AAC to get insight into steps occurring between recognition by surface receptors of the outer membrane and insertion into the inner membrane. We used mitochondria from S. cerevisiae, the organism in which most mitochondrial import components have been identified and where mutant mitochondria are available. We describe a translocation intermediate of AAC during transfer across the outer membrane that can be quantitatively chased to the mature form in the inner membrane. The major portion of the translocation intermediate is exposed to the intermembrane space, while a small segment is still on the cytosolic side. Accumulation of the intermediate requires Tom7, but does not depend on the intermembrane space domain of Tom22. In contrast to cleavable preproteins, the productive accumulation of the translocation intermediate is insensitive to salt. Moreover, opening of the intermembrane space inhibits the import of AAC, but not that of cleavable preproteins. These results indicate that the import route of AAC diverges from the general import pathway already at the trans side of the outer membrane. The S. cerevisiae strains used are shown in TableI. Mitochondria were isolated as described by Daum et al. (25Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hartl et al. (26Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). After in vitro transcription, preproteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (13Söllner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the accumulation of the AAC at stage III, the mitochondria were incubated together with the radiolabeled preprotein in binding buffer (3% (w/v) BSA, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm sodium malate, 20 mmKPi, 1 μm valinomycin, 10 mmMOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) at 25 °C. (ATP was supplied from the reticulocyte lysate.) The mitochondria were either treated with proteinase K (150–200 μg/ml), reisolated, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (13Söllner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or were reisolated and incubated in chase buffer (3% (w/v) BSA, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium malate, 20 mm NaPi, 1 μm valinomycin, 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.2) at 25 °C to allow the AAC to be imported to its final location in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mitochondria were then treated with proteinase K (27Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For swelling, the mitochondria were reisolated and resuspended in EM buffer (10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA) or 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for 15 min at 4 °C (in case of a subsequent proteinase K treatment, 50 μg/ml were used). In cases where preproteins were directly imported without an accumulation at the outer membrane, import was performed in BSA buffer (3% (w/v) BSA, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KPi, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) containing 2 mm ATP and 2 mm NADH. To dissipate the membrane potential, a mixture of 1 μm valinomycin, 20 μm oligomycin, and 8 μm antimycin A was added to the import reaction.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReferenceYPH499 (wild-type)ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 lys2–80147Sikorski R.S.

Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were lysed with Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl). The lysed material was subjected to a clarifying spin, applied onto protein A-Sepharose, and incubated for 1 h. The bound material was eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Alkaline extraction of mitochondria (100 mmNa2CO3) and separation of pellet and supernatant were performed as published (27Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For the salt extraction of accumulated AAC, mitochondria were incubated with radiolabeled AAC in binding buffer for 15 min at 25 °C. Samples were split into two aliquots and were either reisolated or first treated with proteinase K and then reisolated. The pelleted mitochondria were resuspended in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) containing different concentrations of NaCl and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. For sonication, the mitochondria were resuspended in SEM buffer with 200 mmNaCl and sonified for 6 × 6 s in a Branson sonifier 250 (50% duty cycle) (29Blom J. Kübrich M. Rassow J. Voos W. Dekker P.J.T. Maarse A.C. Meijer M. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7364-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), followed by separation into pellet and supernatant by centrifugation at 266,000 × g for 90 min at 2 °C and precipitation with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.0125% sodium deoxycholate. Standard procedures were used for Western blotting onto nitrocellulose using enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and storage phosphorimaging technology (Molecular Dynamics). The precursor of AAC was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine and incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria in the presence of ATP, but the absence of a Δψ across the inner membrane. The AAC accumulated at this stage III is protected against trypsin (or a low concentration of proteinase K) added to the mitochondria (13Söllner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Rassow J. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Alconada A. Gärtner F.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 263-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) but becomes accessible to the protease after opening of the intermembrane space by swelling of mitochondria and rupturing of the outer membrane (formation of mitoplasts) (30Rassow J. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the preprotein may be exposed to the intermembrane space. It could not be excluded, however, that the preprotein was enclosed by proteinaceous components of the import machinery and became accessible to the intermembrane space side only after proteolytic degradation of protecting components. We therefore applied a non-destructive assay to test for the localization of AAC, that is the accessibility to antibodies (we previously showed that AAC accumulated at the surface receptors (cis side of the outer membrane; no treatment with protease) was, as expected, accessible to antibodies (28Söllner T. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). Deenergized mitochondria with AAC accumulated at stage III were treated with proteinase K at a low concentration (10 μg/ml) to remove surface-bound preproteins. The mitochondria were reisolated, and the intermembrane space was opened. Then antibodies specifically directed against the AAC were added. After an incubation, antibodies that were not bound to the mitochondria were removed by reisolation of the mitochondria. Then the mitochondria were lysed in Triton X-100-containing buffer, and immunocomplexes were harvested by protein A-Sepharose. By this procedure we found that the accumulated AAC was efficiently recognized by the antibodies upon opening of the intermembrane space (Fig. 1 A,upper panel, lane 2), while it was not accessible to the antibodies in intact mitochondria (Fig. 1 A, upper panel, lane 1). The lack of immunoprecipitation from intact mitochondria excludes that antibodies added prior to lysis and reisolation of mitochondria became active in immunoprecipitation after the lysis. The total amount of immunoprecipitable AAC was then determined by addition of antibodies after the lysis of the mitochondria (Fig. 1 A,middle panel, lanes 1-4). AAC completely imported into the inner membrane in the presence of a Δψ was not accessible to antibodies even after swelling (Fig. 1 A, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4); it was precipitated only by antibodies added after lysis (Fig. 1 A, middle panel, lanes 3 and 4). We conclude that AAC accumulated at stage III is exposed to the intermembrane space such that entire antibody molecules can efficiently bind to it. To assess the localization of AAC accumulated in deenergized mitochondria, two assays were applied, treatment at alkaline pH and sonication. A treatment of the mitochondria at pH 11.5 (sodium carbonate) releases soluble proteins and peripheral membrane proteins (bound by protein-protein interactions) to the supernatant and leaves integral membrane proteins (protein-lipid interaction) in the membrane sheets (32Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 33Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This treatment released the AAC (stage III) to the supernatant (Fig. 1 B, column 2), while AAC completely imported into the inner membrane in the presence of a Δψ (stage V) remained membrane-integrated (Fig. 1 B,column 3) (11Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To test if the AAC accumulated at stage III was soluble in the intermembrane space or still membrane-bound, the mitochondria were sonicated (29Blom J. Kübrich M. Rassow J. Voos W. Dekker P.J.T. Maarse A.C. Meijer M. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7364-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and soluble proteins and membrane vesicles were separated. The AAC was found to be stably associated with the membrane vesicles (Fig. 1 B,column 1). Together with the release at pH 11.5, this result suggests that the AAC at stage III is bound to the membranes by protein-protein interactions. Is the AAC intermediate still in contact with the mitochondrial outer membrane? Deenergized mitochondria with accumulated AAC (Fig. 1 C, upper panel, lane 1) were treated with proteinase K (150 μg/ml), leading to the generation of fragments of AAC that were 2–4 kDa smaller than the full-length protein (Fig. 1 C, lower panel, lane 1). Since we will show below that the AAC molecules giving rise to these fragments can be quantitatively chased to the fully imported form, they represent true translocation intermediates at stage III and are henceforth referred to as AACIII. The proteinase K treatment degraded surface-exposed components of the protein import machinery, such as Tom20 (Fig. 1 C, upper panel,lane 6), but did not affect the outer membrane barrier, as evidenced by the full protection of the intermembrane space protein cytochrome b 2 (Fig. 1 C,lower panel, lane 6) and of AAC transported into the inner membrane (Fig. 1 C,lower panel, lane 2) (31Alconada A. Gärtner F. Hönlinger A. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 263-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After opening of the intermembrane space by swelling, AACIII was no longer protected against the protease but completely degraded (Fig. 1 C, lower panel, lane 3). We did not observe fragments that could be resolved by the SDS-PAGE suggesting that AAC at stage III was exposed to the intermembrane space with major portions. In parallel reactions, we imported the precursor of AAC into energized mitochondria (stage V) (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). A treatment with proteinase K did not lead to generation of AACIII (Fig. 1 C, lower panel, lane 2). After swelling of the mitochondria, however, the proteinase K cleaved off a small piece (∼1 kDa) from the imported AAC (Fig. 1 C, lower panel, lane 4). This fragmentation in swollen mitochondria is indicative of fully imported AAC (21Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4787-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Haucke V. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4560-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Rassow J. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and is thus referred to as AACV. We conclude that AAC at stage III is mainly exposed to the intermembrane space but remains in stable contact with the outer membrane and exposes a small segment to the cytosolic side. We asked if AAC giving rise to AACIIIrepresented a true translocation intermediate, i.e. if the accumulated AAC could be chased to the fully imported form after regeneration of a Δψ. The 35S-labeled precursor of AAC was accumulated in deenergized mitochondria (dissipation of Δψ by valinomycin in the presence of potassium in the incubation buffer) with three different incubation times. In a first set, the accumulated AAC was directly analyzed (Fig. 2,lanes 1-6): a treatment of the mitochondria with proteinase K generated AACIII (Fig. 2,lanes 1-3), whereas after swelling proteinase K completely degraded AACIII; no fully imported AAC was detected (Fig. 2, lanes 4-6). In a second set (Fig. 2, lanes 7-12), the mitochondria with accumulated AAC were reisolated and were subjected to a second incubation in the presence of a Δψ by generating a potassium diffusion potential (valinomycin in the absence of potassium in the buffer (27Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Pfanner N. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35Martin J. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18051-18057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). By this “chase incubation,” the AACIII completely disappeared (non-swollen mitochondria; Fig. 2, lanes 7-9). After swelling of the mitochondria, proteinase K did not degrade the AAC, but led to removal of a small fragment in a considerable fraction of the AAC (Fig. 2,lanes 10-12), i.e.AACV was generated. This demonstrates that AAC accumulated at stage III (AACIII) was efficiently chased to the fully imported form. Does the chase reaction involve the function of surface-exposed (cis) components of the protein import machinery of the outer membrane? We took advantage of the observation that AAC accumulated at stage III is resistant to a treatment of mitochondria with trypsin under conditions that lead to a removal of the cytosolic domains of the surface receptors Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70 (13Söllner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Rassow J. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Alconada A. Gärtner F. Hönlinger A. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 263-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a third set of samples, the AAC was accumulated in deenergized mitochondria, followed by a trypsin treatment (Fig. 2,lanes 13-18). Then the mitochondria were reisolated and subjected to the chase incubation (generation of a Δψ). Lanes 13-18 of Fig. 2demonstrate that the AAC accumulated at stage III was efficiently chased to the fully imported form (AACV), also after removal of the cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70. We asked if other components of the Tom machinery were involved in the accumulation of AACIII. Two small Tom proteins have been identified that modulate the dynamics of the outer membrane translocase. Studies with deletion mutants of yeast showed that Tom6 (36Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) promotes association of components of the Tom machinery (37Alconada A. Kübrich M. Moczko M. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6196-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) whereas Tom7 supports a dissociation of the Tom machinery (27Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). tom6Δ mitochondria were able to generate AACIII (Fig. 3 A, upper panel, lane 1) that was degraded by proteinase K after swelling of the mitochondria (Fig. 3 A,lower panel, lane 1). In contrast, with tom7Δ mitochondria no AACIIIwas observed (Fig. 3 A, upper panel,lane 2). The tom7Δ mitochondria were not unspecifically damaged since they were still able to import AAC in the presence of a Δψ, including formation of the fragment AACV (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, lane 6), although with a reduced efficiency (27Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, proteinase K formed fragments of AAC in swollen mitochondria after import in the presence of a Δψ that were 5–7 kDa smaller than full-length AAC (AACIV; Fig. 3 A, lower panel, lane 6). These fragments, indicating incomplete insertion of AAC into the inner membrane, were found in only small amounts in wild-type and tom6Δ mitochondria (Fig. 3 A,lower panel, lane 5; Fig. 3 B, columns 1 and 2), but were significantly more abundant in tom7Δ mitochondria (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, lane 6; Fig. 3 B, column 3). This result supports an impairment of tom7Δ mitochondria in import of AAC. Tom6 and Tom7 function in an antagonistic manner in modulating the dynamics of the Tom machinery (27Hönlinger A. Bömer U.

Although CAML appears to directly participate in Ca2+-dependent signaling initiated by the transmembrane activator and CAML interactor cell surface receptor, its mechanism of action is unknown. To address this issue, we have determined its membrane topology, subcellular localization, and ability to mobilize intracellular Ca2+pools. Fractionation of cell extracts on discontinuous sucrose gradients and indirect immunofluorescence indicate that CAML co-localizes with sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium/ATPase-2 and calreticulin at membrane-bound cytosolic vesicles. Limited trypsin digests indicate that the hydrophilic NH2-terminal domain of CAML is directed toward the cytoplasm. Functionally, CAML overexpression was shown to deplete thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pools. These data suggest that CAML may initiate Ca2+ signaling through activation of a capacitative Ca2+ influx pathway."

Initiation of messenger RNA synthesis is the major site for regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Our knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression stems largely from the combination of biochemical and genetics studies of gene transcription. It is now widely appreciated that transcription initiation can be broadly divided into several steps including initiation complex assembly, isomerization promoter clearance, and elongation (1Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D.

Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In the first step, RNA polymerase and associated factors bind reversibly to the promoter. In the second step, a stretch of promoter DNA becomes unwound and serves as a template for transcription. The efficiency of each step can be subject to regulation by transcription activator or repressor protein (3Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 4Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Upon binding their cognate sites, activator proteins stimulate transcription via an activation domain that is functionally distinct, and usually physically separate, from the DNA-binding domain (2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 3Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

DNA-bound transcription factors are proposed to influence transcription through protein-protein interactions with components of the general transcription factors (GTFs). 1The abbreviations used are: GTF, general transcription factor; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor; Inr, initiator; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TAR, Tat-responsive element; CAT chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tet, tetracycline; AdMLP, adenovirus major late promoter; aa, amino acid(s); LTR, long terminal repeat; Tdt, terminal deoxynucleotidyl- transferase. In vitrostudies have shown that different activator domains interact with different GTFs, including TFIIB, TFIID, and TFIIF (2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D.

Physical interactions between activators and GTFs have been proposed to recruit or stabilize the activity of basal promoter complex to the template (2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D.

Genetic studies in yeast have shown that the binding of GTFs to a promoter template in vivo can be rate-limiting, since artificially tethering GTFs (TBP, TFIIB and TAF) to a promoter overcomes the requirement for an activator to generate elevated levels of transcription (8Apone L.M.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5757-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The importance of GTF recruitment is heightened by the discovery, in yeast and mammalian cell nuclei, of large holoenzyme complexes that contain a number of the GTFs as well as other polypeptides (13Greenblatt J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The discovery that a subset of GTFs are preassembled in an RNA pol II holoenzyme has led to the proposal that, in vivo, the protein machinery required for initiation associates with a promoter template in a single step, analogous to the initiation of transcription by the bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme (15Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In principle, a single activator-holoenzyme interaction can recruit the entire initiation machinery to a promoter. Accordingly, it has been shown in yeast that creating an artificial interaction between a DNA-bound protein and a holoenzyme component is sufficient for activation in vivo (16Barberis A. Pearlberg J.

Because artificial recruitment of holoenzyme components can bypass the requirement for activator, the holoenzyme is clearly able to recruit TBP (TFIID), which is not present in the holoenzyme complex. Likewise, tethering of TBP and other GTFs (TFIID) can recruit the holoenzyme in the absence of activator (15Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar,18Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 311-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). While transcriptional activation by artificial recruitment of GTFs has been documented in yeast, it is not known whether tethering of TBP in higher eukaryotes would result in an elevated level of transcription. It has been recently suggested that the binding of TFIID alone is not sufficient for activation and that the isomerized TFIIA·TFIID·TATA ternary complex is necessary and sufficient for gene activation (7Chi T. Carey M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2540-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Clearly, the genetic activator bypass experiments in yeast, and the biochemical studies with human cell factors are not easily reconcilable. One possibility is that activation in higher eukaryotes requires interaction of an activator with TFIID and/or TFIIA, resulting in the isomerization of this complex, and unlike that in yeast, artificial recruitment of TBP will not bypass the isomerization step required for activation. We have addressed this issue by studying the functional consequences of the artificial recruitment of human TBP in transient transfection assays in mammalian cell lines. We found that, as in yeast, artificial recruitment of the hTBP to a promoter in vivo triggers gene expression in the absence of any activator. We found that transcription activation by the hTBP, tethered to promoter DNA, is strictly dependent upon the presence of a functional core TATA element, and it directs faithful transcription initiation. It thus appears that, as in yeast, recruitment of human TBP to the TATA-containing promoters is a major rate-limiting step for transcription in mammalian cells. Interestingly, recruitment of hTBP to Inr-dependent TATA-less promoters is insufficient for transcription activation. Hence, TBP binding to DNA is not a rate-limiting step for TFIID recruitment to initiator-dependent TATA-less promoter. Finally, we have analyzed the synergy between defined activator domains and hTBP tethered to a TATA-containing promoter. We found that synergy occurs only for activation domains acting at steps subsequent to the recruitment of TBP. The G1-TATA and G1′-TATA were constructed by substituting the five GAL4 DNA-binding sites (SphI-XbaI fragment) of the G5-E1b (19Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 38-44Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar) with double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing a single GAL4 site in either orientation, flanked by the SphI-XbaI sites. The G1-Inr and G1-Inr/TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase) were constructed by replacing, in G1-TATA, theXbaI/KpnI fragment containing the E1a TATA box with a double-stranded oligonucleotide flanked by theXbaI-KpnI sites containing the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) Inr element (20Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or the TdT Inr (–10/+30) (21Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), respectively. The G5-Inr and the G5-TATA-Inr have been described (20Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To construct G1-TGTA, the TATA box of G1E1b (XbaI/KpnI fragment) was substituted with a double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing the mutations. The T7G1-TATA was derived from the T7G5-TATA after the substitution of the 5 GAL4 DNA-binding sites (SphI-XbaI fragment) with double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing a single GAL4 site, flanked by the SphI-XbaI sites. The G5–83HIV and G5–38HIV have been described (22Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The G1–38HIV reporter was derived from the G5–38HIV by substituting the 5 GAL4 sites with a double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing a single GAL4 site. The pCMV-hTBP, expressing the human full-length TBP cDNA, was kindly provided by Drs. A. Hoffman and R. Roeder (Rockefeller University). The GAL4-hTBPfl was constructed by PCR amplification of the complete hTBP coding region and inserted into theSmaI site of pSG424. The GAL4-hTBPc was constructed by inserting the HincII fragment from CMV-hTBP, encoding aa 106–339 of the human TBP, in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the SmaI-digested pSG424. The GAL4-hTBP(AS) was constructed by PCR-amplification of the region coding for aa 106–339 of the hTBPM3 (23Strubin M. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 68: 721-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by M. Strubin, University of Geneva) with altered TGTAA specificity and cloned into pSG424. The pTet-VP16 (previously named pUHD 15–1) has been previously described (24De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The pTet-Sp1 was constructed by subcloning the coding sequence for the Sp1A domain obtained, as an EcoRI fragment from GAL4-Sp1 (20Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in the pTetR vector (24De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). pTet-Sp3(1–358) was constructed by replacing in the pGAL4-Sp3(1–358) (26Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) theHindIII-EcoRI fragment, containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, with the HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the Tet R DNA-binding coding region (aa 1–206) derived from the pTetR vector (24De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A similar subcloning strategy was used to construct the pTet-E1a starting from the pGAL4-E1a (19Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 38-44Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Both reporter and effector plasmids were analyzed by DNA sequencing to confirm correct construction. Full details of each construction are available upon request. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation using subconfluent cell cultures with different amounts of reporter and effector plasmids. For normalization of transfection efficiencies, a β-Gal expression plasmid was included in the co-transfections (pSV-β-Gal expression plasmid, Promega). CAT assays were performed with different amounts of extract to ensure linear conversion of the chloramphenicol with each extract, and results are presented as the means ± S.D. of at least four duplicated independent transfection experiments. The CAT activity was quantified using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SystemTM. Forty-four h after transfection, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated and analyzed by primer extension using a CAT primer as described previously (22Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The primer extension products were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide/7 m urea sequencing gel. The length of the fragments obtained was estimated by comparison with sequence reactions loaded on the same gel. Thirty μg of RNA from transfected cells were used for the RNase protection assay. To make the HIV LTR probe, the 270-base pair-longPstI-KpnI fragment from G5–83HIV (22Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), containing the GAL4 sequences fused to the LTR nucleotides from –83 to +82, was cloned into pGEM4Z, and the SP6 polymerase was used to produce [α-32P]GTP-labeled RNA probe. Protected fragments were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide/7 m urea sequencing gel, exposed to x-ray films, and/or analyzed using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager System. Genetic studies in yeast have demonstrated that the binding of TBP to a promoter in vivo is rate-limiting because artificially tethering TBP to a promoter overcomes the requirement for an activator to generate elevated levels of transcription (9Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Klages N. Strubin M. Nature. 1995; 374: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5757-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To extend this observation to higher eukaryotes, we constructed mammalian expression plasmids in which the GAL4 DNA-binding domain present in the expression vector pSG424 was fused to either the full-length hTBP or to a core region (aa 106–339), respectively. GAL4-hTBP-mediated activation was then monitored by co-transfection experiments in the human HeLa cell line with reporters in which the CAT gene was under the control of the E1b TATA box (G1-TATA) or the HIV-1 TATA (G1–38HIV), with a single GAL4 DNA-binding site located upstream of the TATA box. While expression of pSG424 did not induce detectable activation (data not shown), we found that tethering hTBP to a promoter via a GAL4-DNA-binding site resulted in a strong (30–50-fold) transcriptional activation (Fig. 1). Both the full-length and core hTBP GAL4 fusion proteins gave similar results (data not shown), and for all the data reported below, we used the GAL4 fusion containing the core (aa 106–339) hTBP region. As reported in Fig. 1, B and C, TBP-mediated activation required a direct connection of hTBP to a promoter-bound protein since enforced expression of hTBP did not induce promoter activity. These experiments suggest that, as in yeast, the binding of hTBP to a promoter appears to represent a rate-limiting step for transcription activation in human cells. To extend these observations further, we designed simple promoter constructs bearing altered core promoter elements. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the orientation of the single GAL4-binding site, relative to the TATA motif, did not alter the GAL4-hTBP-mediated activation, which is consistent with the ability of the GAL4 protein to bind to the cognate DNA-binding site as a dimer. When the GAL4-hTBP effector was tested on a promoter bearing a mutated TATA element (TGTAA), it failed to activate transcription (Fig. 1). Since GAL4-hTBP-mediated activation strictly requires the presence of the TATA box, we sought to determine the transcription initiation site induced by the hTBP bound to the promoter via a single GAL4 site. The G1–38HIV reporter was transfected into HeLa cells along with increasing amounts of GAL4-hTBP, and the transcription initiation site was mapped by an RNA primer-extension assay using an oligonucleotide complementary to the CAT sequence as a primer. The reporter G5–83HIV (22Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with GAL4-VP16 and used as a control. As presented in Fig. 2, GAL4-hTBP directed faithful transcription initiation from the canonical HIV LTR 5′ start site. Having defined that recruitment of hTBP to a promoter template suffices for transcriptional activation, we wished to exclude that GAL4-hTBP may act as a conventional DNA-bound activator due to the presence of a fortuitous activation domain. Several observations provide independent evidence that GAL4-hTBP behaves differently from that of a conventional activator. First, it is well documented that multiple copies of a single activator bound to a promoter cause more than additive stimulation of transcription, a phenomenon called synergy (27Carey M. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 28Lin Y.S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if GAL4-hTBP was acting as a conventional activator, synergy should be found using a template bearing multiple GAL4 DNA-binding sites. We then compared the activities of GAL4-hTBP and GAL4-VP16 on isogenic templates bearing a single (G1-TATA) or five GAL4 DNA-binding sites (G5-TATA), respectively. While synergy was observed with GAL4-VP16, comparable levels of activation were mediated by GAL4-TBP, regardless of the number of GAL4 DNA-binding sites (Fig. 3 A). Next, we tested the ability of a specific hTBP mutant (hTBPM3) with altered DNA-binding specificity for TATA element to activate transcription from a TGTAA template. The hTBPM3 mutant has an increased affinity for TGTAA element (23Strubin M. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 68: 721-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and it has been previously shown that it is able to activate transcription driven by either the canonical TATAA or by the mutated TGTAA core elements (29Tansey W.P. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Herr W. Genes and Dev. 1994; 8: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The two isogenic reporters, G1-TATA and G1-TGTA were then tested in the presence of GAL4-hTBP and GAL4-hTBPas, respectively. As reported in Fig. 3 B, we found that GAL4-hTBPM3 retains the ability to activate both reporters, whereas GAL4-hTBP was unable to activate the G1-TGTA reporter. These results extend to the mammalian cells the original observation made in yeast (9Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that supports the relevance of TBP-TATA interaction, and together with the results reported in Fig. 2, they strongly suggest that stimulation is mediated by a bona fide TBP-TATA interaction. An increasing large number of promoters of mammalian protein-encoding genes lack a TATA box, and they contain a functional initiator as a promoter core element. The initiator (Inr) is a core promoter element sufficient to position the basal transcription machinery in the absence of a TATA element (21Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 30Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which the basal machinery assembles into a functional complex on an Inr-dependent TATA-less promoter has not been fully elucidated (30Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 31Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 32Kaufmann J. Verrijzer C.P.

We sought to analyze the function of GAL4-hTBP on Inr-dependent TATA-less promoters, and for such analysis, the TATA box present in G1-TATA and G5-TATA was substituted with the AdMLP initiator element (Inr) sequence or with the murine TdT initiator (Fig. 4). Since many natural promoters contain both the TATA and the Inr elements, we also constructed the G1-TATA-Inr, containing a single GAL4 DNA-binding site located upstream of the E1b TATA box and the AdMLP Inr elements. The relevant features of these reporters are outlined in Fig. 4. Each construct was transfected into HeLa cells, along with the GAL4-hTBP or GAL4-VP16, and the fold activities relative to the samples without effector are shown in Fig. 4. As expected GAL4-VP16 activates, albeit at different levels, transcription mediated by each of the different templates (20Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 30Weis L. Reinberg D.

A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results clearly indicated that, unlike that for TATA-containing promoters, targeting of the TBP to a promoter template is not sufficient to trigger transcription from Inr-dependent TATA-less promoters. Hence, in contrast with TATA-containing promoters, recruitment of the hTBP does not represent a rate-limiting step for transcription activation of Inr-dependent TATA-less promoters. Consequently, transcription activation mediated by recruitment of the hTBP to the template is specific for TATA-containing promoters. Finally, we noticed that the activated transcription found with G1-TATA-Inr was considerably stronger than the activation observed with the TATA-promoter (Fig. 4). This result may reflect the ability of TATA and Inr elements to strongly synergize with each other when tested either in the presence or in the absence of upstream activators (30Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar,34Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Moreover, these results suggest that the Inr element does not play a negative role in GAL4-hTBP activation, but rather it is the presence of the TATA element that is strictly required for GAL4-hTBP activation. In summary, our results demonstrated that, while recruitment of hTBP to a TATA-containing promoter provides a substantial activation of transcription, TBP tethered to Inr-dependent TATA-less promoters is insufficient for activation, suggesting the existence of alternative TFIID recruitment mechanisms. If the function of a defined activator is to increase the rate-limiting step of TBP recruitment to the TATA element, then it is predicted that the presence of such a type of activator would not enhance the transcriptional activation achieved by direct connection of TBP to a promoter-bound protein. On the other hand, if the functional interactions between activator domains and GTFs occur after TBP recruitment (for example, interactions between the activator and TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNAPII), then it is predicted that a marked synergy between the activator and the DNA-bound TBP would be observed. In line with the above mentioned considerations we sought to analyze the function of defined transcription activator domains using an experimental strategy in which the rate-limiting TFIID recruitment step was artificially overcome. To this end, we developed an in vivo transcription assay in which various well characterized transcription activation domains were fused to the C terminus of the prokaryotic TetR encoded by Tn10 from Escherichia coli. Thus, the TetR-chimeric proteins were able to bind to the tet operator (tetO) sequences. As a template, we constructed the T7G1-TATA reporter, which contains the CAT gene under the control of the E1b TATA box with single GAL4 DNA binding and seven tetO sequences (25Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The presence of the GAL4 DNA-binding site allowed the recruitment of the GAL4-hTBP protein. Relevant features of the effectors and the reporter plasmid are outlined in Fig. 5. As expected, both the GAL4-hTBP and the TetR chimeric activators stimulated transcription when allowed to bind next to the TATA box (Fig. 5 A). To evaluate the functional consequences between activators and promoter-bound hTBP, HeLa cells were transfected with the reporter T7G1-TATA in the presence of the GAL4-hTBP together with the various TetR-activators. Results of gel shift assays with transiently transfected HeLa cell extracts ensured that all of the Tet fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels and were competent for DNA binding (data not shown). As reported in Fig. 5 B, both VP-16 and E1a enhanced the GAL4-hTBP activation in a synergistic manner (more than additive). Interestingly, only additive effects were observed when the chimeric Tet-VP16 and Tet-E1a activators were co-expressed along with"

Conotoxins are small peptides present in the venoms of predator snails of the genus Conus. These pharmacologically active materials are employed by the snails to paralyze their prey by envenomation, thus enhancing their effectiveness as predators of fish, mollusks, and polychaete worms (reviewed in Ref. 1Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Ramilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). A large number of these types of peptides are used by a variety of species of these snails. Consequently, the structures and functions of the peptides are diverse. The conotoxins are broadly divided into three classes, those that function via effects on acetylcholine receptors (α-conotoxins), muscle Na+ channels (μ-conotoxins), or voltage-sensitive Ca2+-channels (ω-conotoxins). In general, these small peptides are highly conformationally constrained, in part due to disulfide bridges, viz., 2–4 disulfide loops over peptide stretches of 10–30 amino acids. These types of constraints likely provide a smaller distribution of possible conformations for these peptides, which in turn might govern their tight receptor binding properties. Because of their high functional selectivity, many different Conus peptides are employed as probes of specific receptors (2Myers R.A. McIntosh M. Imperial J. Williams R.W. Oas T. Haack J.A.

Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6025-6029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they contain 17 and 21 amino acid residues, respectively. These neuroactive peptides target for their functions the ligand-gated Ca2+/Na+ channels of the NMDA-R subtype, acting as noncompetitive inhibitors of ion flow through the channels. On a molecular level, this property is based on the noncompetitive inhibition by the conantokins of the positive allosteric effects of polyamines on this receptor (5Skolnick P. Boje K. Miller R. Pennington M. Maccecchini M.-L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Structurally, the conantokins lack disulfide bonds. However, these peptides contain a very high relative amount of Gla, specifically, 5 mol/mol in con-G and 4 mol/mol in con-T. Because of this feature, it is likely that some of the conformational stability that is lacking due to the absence of disulfide bonds might be accommodated by the divalent cation binding afforded these peptides by the presence of Gla residues. This metal ion binding, the thermodynamic characteristics of which have been described, might enhance the receptor binding properties of these peptides by reducing the range of their possible conformations (6Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, recent activity in several laboratories has centered on structures of the apo- and cation-loaded forms of these peptides. We have shown from CD measurements that apo-con-G is relatively structureless, but its conformation is nearly entirely α-helical when the peptide is saturated with Ca2+ and Mg2+. On the other hand, con-T contains a high relative amount of α-helix in both states (6Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This former conclusion is in basic agreement with studies employing Fourier transformed-infrared spectroscopy (2Myers R.A. McIntosh M. Imperial J. Williams R.W. Oas T. Haack J.A. Hernandez J.-F. Rivier J. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1990; 9: 179-202Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but it is at variance with NMR studies that were designed to probe these same structures (7Rigby A.C. Baleja J.D. Furie B.C. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and with a study based on CD measurements (8Zhou L.-M. Szendrei G.I. Fossom L.H. Maccecchini M.-L. Skolnick P. Otvos L. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in which it was concluded that significant amounts of helical conformations were present in the metal-free form of con-G. Because of the possible importance of the metal ion-induced conformational alteration of con-G, we undertook a solution structural analysis of con-G in its metal-free and Ca2+- and Mg2+-loaded forms, using one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR. Although other NMR studies have been published for the apo- and Ca2+-dependent forms of con-G (7Rigby A.C. Baleja J.D. Furie B.C. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Skjaerbaek N. Nielsen K.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P. Craik D.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), they have mainly focused on backbone conformations. We recently performed extensive1H NMR studies on the solution conformation of apo-con-T (11Warder S.E. Chen Z.G. Zhu Y. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Ca2+/con-T (12Warder S.E. Prorok M. Chen Z. Li L. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7512-7522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), allowing establishment of both backbone and side-chain conformations. This same strategy has now been applied to con-G to determine the backbone and side-chain conformations of the metal-bound form. Results of this structural analysis, as well as direct metal binding and CD measurements of wild-type and mutant Con-G peptides, are presented in the current report. Con-G (G1EγγL5QγNQγ10LIRγK15SN-CONH2) was synthesized by Fmoc chemistry on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 433A peptide synthesizer using 5-(4-(9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxy-phenoxy) valeric acid resin (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). TheNα-Fmoc-(γ,γ′-di-O-tBu)-l-Gla andNα-Fmoc-(γ,γ′-di-O-tBu)-d-Gla employed were chemically synthesized, as described previously (13Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All other Nα-Fmoc-l-amino acids used in the synthesis of con-G were purchased from Sigma or Nova Biochem (La Jolla, CA). The following side-chain protecting groups were present on the amino acids: Arg(NG-2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-sulfonyl), Asn(Nγ-trityl), Gln(Nδ-trityl), Glu(O-tBu), Lys(Nε-t-butyloxycarbonyl), and Ser(O-tBu). The protocols employed for synthesis, deprotection, and purification of the resulting con-G have been described earlier (6Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After deblocking, the peptide contained an amidated carboxyl terminus, as is the case for naturally occurring con-G. The samples for NMR measurements were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of the purified peptide in 450 μl of a buffered solution containing 10 mmNaBO3, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. A volume of 50 μl of 2H2O was added to the peptide solutions to provide the 2H lock signal. 4,4-Dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate was added as an internal reference. Peptide concentrations were approximately 1 mmfor one-dimensional and 2 mm for two-dimensional NMR experiments. Stock solutions of CaCl2 and MgCl2at concentrations of 0.2 m were prepared in the same buffer used for the peptide samples. In some experiments, CaCl2and MgCl2 were titrated to the NMR samples of the con-G peptide at concentrations up to 20-fold in excess of that of the peptide. All NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AMX2–500 MHz and/or a DRX-500 MHz spectrometer at temperatures of 5, 15, or 25 °C. The solvent H2O signal was suppressed by use of the WATERGATE method for one-dimensional and most of the two-dimensional NMR experiments, implemented through the 3-9-19 pulse train for selective inversion (14Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional NMR experiments included NOESY with water flip-back (15Lippens G. Dhalluin C. Wieruszeski J.-M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and TOCSY (16Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar, 17Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) using the TOWNY-16 spin-lock sequence (18Kadkhodaei M. Hwang T.-L. Tang J. Shaka A.J. J. Mag. Reson. 1993; A 105: 104-107Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Water suppression in the DQF-COSY (19Rance M. Sorenson O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) experiments was achieved by presaturation during the preacquisition delay. Two-dimensional NMR experiments were acquired using time proportional phase incrementation along the t1 dimension for phase-sensitive detection, with a relaxation delay of 1.5–2 s (20Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). Mixing times of 30–60 ms were used for the TOCSY experiments, and 150 ms and 250 ms for the NOESY spectra. Free induction decays were acquired with 2K complex data points for the TOCSY and NOESY data sets and with 4K complex data points for DQF-COSY experiments. A total of 400 t1 increments were collected for NOESY, 300–350 for TOCSY, and 512 for DQF-COSY data sets. Sine modulation was used along the t1 dimension, with the initial t1 delays adjusted so that the zero and first-order phase corrections along F1 were 90° and 0°, respectively (21Ni F. Ripoll D.R. Purisima E.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed using an in-house program, nmrDSP, incorporating fast cosine and sine transformation, linear prediction, and optimized baseline correction procedures. The free induction decay matrices were multiplied by cosine-squared window functions in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. The experimental data were extended along the t1 dimension of the NOESY and TOCSY data sets by linear prediction to 512 points and then zero-filled to 1024 before the application of the window functions and sine transformation. The matrices of the DQF-COSY spectra were 1K × 1K real points for use in resonance assignments and were expanded to 8K (F2) × 1K (F1) for the determination of coupling constants. The DQF-COSY spectra were phased along the F2 dimension in both absorptive and dispersive modes. The splittings of cross-peak extrema were measured in both modes and were used to calculate the 3JHNα coupling constants corrected for line width effects (22Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 9-13Google Scholar). Residue-specific assignments of the proton resonances were achieved by spin system identification using DQF-COSY and TOCSY, followed by sequential assignments through NOE connectivities (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Despite a number of residues with similar spin types, the dispersion of the amide proton resonances was sufficiently large to allow the complete assignments of the proton resonances in the absence and presence of metal ions. Gla residues were easily identified in a TOCSY spectrum because their γCH proton resonances appear at a lower frequency (≈3 ppm). The side-chain amide protons of Asn and Gln residues were assigned on the basis of the cross peaks in the amide region of the TOCSY spectra and intraresidue NOESY cross peaks to their βCH2 protons. The εNH proton of Arg13 of con-G is well shifted downfield in the presence of metal ions, and its assignment was based on a strong TOCSY (and COSY) correlation to the δCH2 protons of Arg. The guanidino protons of Arg13 in apo-con-G are very broad as a result of solvent exchange and appear upfield of the backbone and side-chain NH resonance envelope. In the presence of metal ions, these protons also had intraresidue NOE connectivities to the εNH and δCH2protons of Arg13. The intensities of the cross peaks in the NOESY spectra of con-G were classified from the number of contours as strong, medium, or weak and converted to distance upper bounds of 2.7, 3.7, and 5.0 Å, respectively. All side-chain/side-chain or side-chain/main-chain medium-range (i, i + 2 and i, i + 4) constraints were set to an upper bound of 5 Å and a lower bound of 2.0 Å. Starting structures were generated by distance geometry using uniquely assigned NOE constraints and with fixed bond lengths and bond angles provided in the ECEPP/3 data base (24Némethy G. Gibson K.D. Palmer K.A. Yoon C.N. Paterlini G. Zagari A. Rumsey S. Schereaga H.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 6472-6484Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Averaged distances between groups of protons with resonance overlaps were required to satisfy both the upper and lower bounds of the penalty function (25Ni F. Konishi Y. Bullock L.D. Rivetna M.N. Scheraga H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3106-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Ni F. Zhu Y.i. Scheraga H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 656-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These initial structures yielded information for assignment to specific proton pairs of some overlapped NOEs. Optimization of the structures was carried out by varying all dihedral angles except for the ω angles governing the planarity of the peptide bond (25Ni F. Konishi Y. Bullock L.D. Rivetna M.N. Scheraga H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3106-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Ni F. Zhu Y.i. Scheraga H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 656-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Vásquez M. Scheraga H.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1988; 5: 757-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A set of low-energy structures was selected for further calculations incorporating all NOE distance constraints in the distance geometry minimization. Visualization of the structures was performed using the Sybyl software package (Tripos, Inc.). Placement of the metal ions in con-G and further energy minimization-based refinement of the metal-bound structure were accomplished by the genetic algorithm-molecular dynamics simulation approach described previously (28Li L. Darden T.A. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Smith H. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the initial coordinates for Mg2+/con-G used in the genetic algorithm midpoint calculations were those determined by NMR in this study for the Mg2+/con-G complex. The initial positions of the Mg2+ ions were determined by searching through the O–O midpoints that were within 6 Å of each other, using all oxygen atoms in the midpoint calculation. A total of 195 midpoints were found. The lowest Amber (29Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E.I. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Amber, Version 4.1. University of California, San Francisco1995Google Scholar) energy structure, verified also by a systematic search, was subjected to a Particle Mesh Ewald molecular dynamics simulation (30Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15693) Google Scholar). In this case, the peptide was solvated in a 9.0-Å box, and H2O, Na+, and Mg2+were energy-minimized at constant volume. A Particle Mesh Ewald molecular dynamics simulation was then performed on Na+, Mg2+, and H2O for 100 ps, followed by energy minimization. The side-chain residues, the ions, and H2O were then subjected to another Particle Mesh Ewald molecular dynamics simulation for 150 ps under conditions of fixed backbone, followed by data collection over 300 ps. The binding isotherms of Mg2+ to con-G and con-G mutants were determined by ITC measurements of the heat changes accompanying titration of Mg2+ into solutions of the relevant con-G sample. The titrations were performed with a Microcal (Northampton, MA) OMEGA titration calorimeter at 25 °C in a buffer of 10 mmNa-Mes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. Peptide samples ranging in concentrations from 0.23–1.0 mm (determined from quantitative amino acid analysis) in a total volume of 1.4 ml were placed in the reaction cell. After equilibration, an appropriate concentration of MgCl2 (typically 30–50 times higher than that of the peptide solution) in matching buffer was delivered at discrete intervals, and the observed heat was measured after each injection. The total observed heat was corrected for the heat of dilution of the ligand by performing control titrations in the absence of peptide. The resulting titration curves were deconvoluted and inspected for the best-fit model using the ORIGIN for ITC software package supplied by Microcal. CD spectra of the con-G peptides as a function of metal ion concentration was monitored at 222 nm on an AVIV model 62DS spectrometer using a 1-cm path length cell. The relevant peptides were dissolved in a solution of 10 mmNaBO3, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of 35 μm. The α-helical content of the peptides at various Mg2+ concentrations were calculated as described previously (31Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). The C50Mg-CD values (the concentration of Mg2+ required to induce 50% of the alteration to the conformational change as determined by CD measurements) were determined by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data using a Michaelis-Menten-type equation. The nature of the interaction of con-G with metal ions was assessed by use of one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the effects of additions of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the spectrum of apo-con-G. Here, it is seen that these cations influenced most of the αNH proton resonances of con-G. Both shifts and broadening (Fig. 1 B) of the resonance peaks were noted in the presence of Ca2+ (all proton resonance assignments for apo-con-G and metal-loaded con-G are provided in Table S1a–c 2Supplementary Tables S1a–c and S2 are available from the corresponding author. ). In the case of Mg2+, the proton signals are also shifted, but they remain relatively sharp (Fig. 1 C), therefore suggesting that Mg2+ has fully occupied its binding site(s) on con-G under the experimental conditions used (40 mmMg2+ and 2 mm con-G). The dramatic shifts observed in apo-con-G as a result of Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding suggest that a conformational change in the peptide accompanies cation/con-G interactions. The well-resolved two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of con-G allowed chemical shifts to be assigned to all of the protons of the peptide (Table S1a–c) and facilitated examination of the residue-specific effects of metal binding in the one-dimensional spectra (Fig. 1, A–C). In particular, the εNH resonance of Arg13 exhibits a very large downfield shift, from 7.5 to 8.1 ppm and to 8.7 ppm, as a consequence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding, respectively. Also, the extremely broad guanidino resonance in the apo-spectrum (Fig. 1 A) narrows significantly in the metal-bound spectra (Fig. 1, B andC). Clearly resolved are the binding-induced shifts of the amide proton resonances for the side-chains of residues Asn8 and Gln9 and of the amide protons at the carboxyl terminus. Also notable are the large up-field shifts of the side-chain protons of residues that are incapable of metal binding,viz., Leu5, Leu11, and Ile12 (Table S1a–c). These types of alterations, which are present throughout the peptide, indicate that global conformational reorientations occur in con-G upon binding of metal ions to this peptide. The secondary structure of con-G was investigated by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. All NMR observations on con-G indicate that this peptide has no defined secondary structure in the absence of divalent cations. Initial evidence in support of this point originates from the αCH chemical shifts values, an approach commonly used to qualitatively identify secondary structural elements in peptides and proteins (32Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Because there are no reported random coil values for the Gla residue, and because these chemical shifts would be expected to be sequence-dependent in the random coil state, the αCH proton chemical shifts of con-G determined in 6 m urea were used as the reference random coil values. The fact that four or more residues, without disruptions, do not experience upfield or downfield shifts of 0.1 ppm or greater when compared with the random coil values suggests that there is no dominant secondary structure (Fig. 2). In addition, the temperature coefficients of the backbone chemical shifts for apo-con-G were determined through a series of TOCSY spectra acquired at 5° intervals from 5 °C through 30 °C. A temperature coefficient in the range of −6 to −9 ppb/K was found for all backbone αNH protons of apo-con-G. These values are consistent with random coil conformation and suggest no preference for the backbone hydrogen bonding that exists in a helical state. Consistent with the chemical shift values, NOE patterns also suggest that the peptide backbone of apo-con-G does not fold in any preferred structural arrangement. Fig. 3 A provides a summary of NOE values observed for con-G in the absence of divalent metal ions. Except for intraresidue and sequential NOEs, neither long-range nor medium-range NOE contacts were observed at sample temperatures of 15 or 25 °C. Even at a lowered temperature of 5 °C, there were only three very weak medium-range NOEs between the αNH protons of residues Gln9 and Leu11 and residues Leu11and Arg13 (i, i + 2), and between the αCH proton of Asn8 and the αNH proton of Leu11 (Fig. 3 A). Additionally,3JHNα coupling constants were found to be approximately 7 Hz for all residues of apo-con-G (TableI), again consistent with a peptide with no dominant conformation.Table I3JHNα coupling constantsResidueapo-conantokin-GCa2+-conantokin-GGlu26.96.3Gla36.65.4Gla46.75.4Leu56.75.4Gln66.76.3Gla76.76.3Asn86.75.4Gln96.75.4Gla106.76.9Leu116.65.4Ile126.55.4Arg136.65.4Gla146.75.4Lys156.75.4Ser166.65.4Asn177.46.3 Open table in a new tab In contrast to apo-con-G, all NMR parameters of con-G in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ indicate that the peptide possesses a substantial metal cation-induced α-helical structure. Large negative values of deviations of the αCH proton chemical shifts were seen for most residues in the presence of either Ca2+(Fig. 3 B) or Mg2+ (Fig. 3 C). Of special note, >0.2-ppm shifts were observed for seven amino acid residues in con-G in the presence of Ca2+ and for nine residues in the presence of Mg2+. Positive values for the αCH conformational shifts were detected for some of the Gla residues,viz., Gla10 in the presence of Ca2+, and Gla3, Gla7, and Gla10 in the presence of Mg2+. However, because these positive values only occur for Gla residues, they likely reflect direct metal ion binding effects, rather than the conformations at these residues. The NOE connectivities of Ca2+-bound con-G are summarized in Fig. 3 B. Due to line broadening, the resonances could not be assigned unambiguously at lower temperatures (≤15 °C). Thus, the NOEs shown in Fig. 3 B were obtained at 25 °C. Even with sharper signals at the higher temperature, some expected NOEs were not observed or could not be unambiguously assigned. Despite this, many NOEs characterizing an α-helical structure were identified. For example, strong sequential NOEs between the αNH protons were detected for amino acid residues 3 to 9 and for residues 10 to 16. The missing NOE contacts between the backbone amide protons of residues 2 and 3, 9 and 10, and 16 and 17 are due to resonance overlap in these cases. However, there were many (i, i + 3) NOE contacts between the αCH and the αNH protons of the same residues in Ca2+/con-G. Furthermore, five (i, i + 3) NOE connectivities between αCH and βCH protons were found, providing additional NOEs characteri"
https://openalex.org/W2060824554,"V(D)J site-specific recombination mediates the somatic assembly of the antigen receptor gene segments. This process is initiated by the recombination activating proteins RAG1 and RAG2, which recognize the recombination signal sequences (RSS) and cleave the DNA at the coding/RSS junction. In this study, we show that RAG1 and RAG2 have the ability to directly interact in solution before binding to the DNA. RAG1 forms a homodimer, which leads to the appearance of two distinct RAG1.RAG2 complexes bound to DNA. To investigate the properties of the two RAG1.RAG2 complexes in the presence of different Me2+ cofactors, we established an in vitro Mg2+-based cleavage reaction on a single RSS. Using this system, we found that Mg2+ confers a specific pattern of DNA binding and cleavage. In contrast, Mn2+ allows aberrant binding of RAG1.RAG2 to single-stranded RSS and permits cleavage independent of binding to the nonamer. To determine the contribution of Me2+ ions at the early stages of V(D)J recombination, we analyzed specific DNA recognition and cleavage by RAG1.RAG2 on phosphorothioated substrates. These experiments revealed that Me2+ ions directly coordinate the binding of RAG1.RAG2 to the RSS DNA."

By using the promoter for the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene, conditional, tissue-specific expression of the constitutively active mutant form (Q205L) of Gαi2 was achieved in mice harboring the transgene. Expression of Q205L Gαi2 was detected in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue of transgenic mice. Whereas the Gαi2-deficient mice displayed blunted insulin action, the Q205L Gαi2-expressing mice displayed enhanced insulin-like effects. Glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle was found to be activated in Q205L Gαi2-expressing mice, in the absence of the administration of insulin. Analysis of members of mitogen-activated protein kinase family revealed that both c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 are constitutively activated in vivo in the mice that express the Q205L Gαi2. ERK1,2, in contrast, are unaffected in the Q205L Gαi2-expressing mice. Insulin, like expression of Q205L Gαi2, activates both p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases as well as glycogen synthase. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal and p38 kinases in vivo with anisomycin, however, was insufficient to activate glycogen synthase. Much like Gαi2 deficiency provokes insulin resistance, expression of Q205L constitutively active Gαi2 mimics insulin action in vivo, sharing with insulin the activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinase members, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases.

ERK1,2, in contrast, are unaffected in the Q205L Gαi2-expressing mice. Insulin, like expression of Q205L Gαi2, activates both p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases as well as glycogen synthase. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal and p38 kinases in vivo with anisomycin, however, was insufficient to activate glycogen synthase. Much like Gαi2 deficiency provokes insulin resistance, expression of Q205L constitutively active Gαi2 mimics insulin action in vivo, sharing with insulin the activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinase members, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. G-proteins mediate signals from a populous class of cell-surface membrane-bound receptors to a lesser group of effectors that includes adenylylcyclases, phospholipase Cβ, and various ion channels (1Gilman A.G.

Insulin receptors and other growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, in contrast, phosphorylate substrate molecules that link directly or indirectly through adaptor molecules to pathways that include the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; PCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; PCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. kinase regulatory network (3Ullrich A.

Elucidation of the manner by which these two pathways integrate signaling poses formidable problems, and understanding of this integration is critical to cell signaling. Insights on the integration of signaling between G-protein-linked and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors have emerged. Signal integration can occur at the most proximal point, i.e. receptor-to-receptor. G-protein-linked receptors, e.g. the β-adrenergic and bradykinin receptors, have been shown to act as substrates for growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (5Hadcock J.R.

The ability of insulin to phosphorylate these G-protein-linked receptors as well as the ability of insulin to counter-regulate catecholamine activation of adenylylcyclase (6Baltensperger K. Karoor V.

G-proteins have been implicated as elements influencing insulin action. Inactivation of G-proteins with pertussis toxin alters insulin action in the liver (8Gawler D. Milligan G. Spiegel A.M. Unson C.G. Houslay M.D. Nature. 1987; 327: 224-232Google Scholar), and treating cells with insulin induces changes in the accessibility of the G-protein that mediates the inhibitory control of adenylylcyclase, denoted Gαi2, to antibody binding (9Record R.D. Smith R.M. Jarret L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Expression of RNA antisense to the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi2-subunit in selected target tissues of the mouse both eliminates Gαi2 expression (10Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and generates profound insulin resistance in vivo (11Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Gαi2deficiency provokes blunted glucose tolerance, loss of insulin-stimulated hexose transport, inability of insulin to recruit GLUT4 transporters to the plasma membrane, blunted glycogen synthase activation in liver and skeletal muscle of the transgenic mice, and enhanced expression of phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1b but not SYP (11Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Conditional, tissue-specific targeting of expression of the constitutively active mutant form (Q205L) of Gαi2 in vivo has insulinomimetic effects (12Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the current work we investigate downstream elements of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways to explore the potential roles of ERK1,2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases in mediating the insulinomimetic effects of expression of Q205L Gαi2 in transgenic mice. Details of the design of the vector and creation of mice harboring a transgene driving the expression of the constitutively active Q205L mutant of Gαi2 are provided elsewhere (12Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 1.7-kilobase pair cDNA harboring the constitutively active Q205L mutant of Gαi2 (kindly provided by Dr. Gary L. Johnson, National Jewish Center, Denver, CO) was excised from the vector pCW1 and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The parental genomic PEPCK gene fragment used was a 7.0-kilobase pairEcoRI/BamHI fragment described previously (10Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This genomic clone contains the elements necessary to maintain the developmental and tissue-specific expression of PEPCK mRNA as seen with the endogenous PEPCK gene. Prior to ligation with the Q205L Gαi2 mutant cDNA, the PEPCK gene was digested withNheI (−11 with respect to transcription start site) andAatII (∼+4920) leaving the 5′ promoter and 3′-untranslated region of mRNA intact. HindIII linkers were then engineered at both the NheI and AatII sites to facilitate ligation with the Q205L Gαi2 mutant. After successful ligation, the proper orientation of the Q205L Gαi2 mutant cDNA was verified by restriction digest analysis. The transgene was excised as a 3.2-kilobase pair fragment using XhoI (5′) and NotI (3′) and prepared for a new round of microinjection into single cell, pre-implantation embryos, as described for the previous founders which were lost to disease (12Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mice were generated in the Transgenic Mouse Facility at Stony Brook. Mouse tail biopsies were obtained from the product litters, and DNA was isolated for PCR amplification with pPCK-Q205LGαi2 transgene-specific primers, described elsewhere (12Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Four founder lines were bred for 10 generations, and mice used in these experiments were 8–12 weeks of age, with no age-related differences observed in the parameters measured. All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. For each experiment reported animals from at least two founder lines were analyzed, samples being treated separately. In all cases, mice derivative of each founder line displayed a uniform phenotypic character with respect to those parameters reported herein. Samples of protein were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 11% gels. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose blots and the blots subjected to immunoblotting (10Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For determinations of glycogen synthase activity, control and transgenic mice (8–12 weeks in age) were anesthetized using a solution containing ketamine (120 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (80 mg/kg body weight), injected intraperitoneally. Once deep anesthesia is achieved, the abdominal cavity is opened and the viscera exposed. Mice were administered either vehicle alone or insulin (10 units), via intravenous injection into the inferior vena cava. At the times indicated after injection, portions (200 mg wet weight) of the skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) were removed and measurements of glycogen synthase activity performed as described previously (11Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were performed according to Lowry et al. (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of protein were subjected to 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies to the following antigens employed in these studies were obtained from the indicated sources: JNK-1 (number SC-474-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); ERK1 and -2 (number 61-7400, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA); dually phosphorylated, active ERK1 and -2 (number V6671, Promega, Madison, WI); p38 MAP kinase (number 06-394, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and dually phosphorylated (Thr-180 and Tyr-182), active p38 MAP kinase (number 9211S, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). In most cases, the immune complexes formed were made visible by using alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.), rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.), or rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma). For antibodies against the dually phosphorylated, active forms of ERK1,2 and of p38 MAP kinase, the immune complexes were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the chemiluminescence reagent, and brief autoradiography of Kodak X-Omat film. An aliquot (4 mg of protein) of the clarified lysate was mixed with the JNK1-specific antibody (5 μl of undiluted stock) and resuspended to 0.5 ml in the same cell lysis buffer. After 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation, 10 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1.5 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with same lysis buffer and then washed twice with JNK assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a final volume of 40 μl of the JNK assay buffer. A 20-μl aliquot was used for Western blot analysis, and the other 20 μl was used for JNK assay. Aliquots of immunoprecipitates were mixed with 2 μg of GST fusion proteins encoding for the N-terminal region of GST-Jun-(1–79) and placed on ice. Reaction was started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/tube, 100 μmfinal concentration) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped by addition of 6 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer (200 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 8% SDS, 0.08% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol). After separation of proteins by 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and autoradiography, the bands for GST-Jun were excised and the incorporated 32P was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Following FPLC fractionation, ERK1,2 are confined to fractions 4 and 5, whereas p38 is confined to fractions 7 and 8 (14Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An aliquot of clarified lysate sample (2.5 mg of protein) was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and fractionated by chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was washed with 8 column volumes of buffer A (70 mmβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the bound proteins were eluted with a 12.5-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–400 mm) in buffer A. Ten fractions (1.0 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A 15-μl aliquot of FPLC fraction was mixed with 5 μl of 4× kinase assay buffer (100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 160 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 40 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 2 mm EGTA) and 2 μg of either epidermal growth factor receptor peptide (Sigma) or GST-ATF2-(1–109) fusion protein used as substrates for measurement of ERK1,2 and p38 activities, respectively. Each reaction was started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/tube, 100 μm final concentration) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions of p38 kinase were terminated by addition of 6 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer. After separation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels, staining of the resolved proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, and autoradiography, the bands for GST-ATF2-(1–109) were excised and the incorporated 32P into these substrates quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The assay reactions of ERK1,2 were terminated by the addition of 0.01 ml of trichloroacetic acid (25% w/v). A 35-μl aliquot of the terminated assay product was spotted onto P81 Whatman filter paper, washed twice for 5 min with 75 mm phosphoric acid and once with acetone, and air-dried. The radioactivity on the filter papers was quantified using liquid scintillation spectrometry. Mice harboring the pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 transgene were identified by PCR analysis of tail DNA using unique primers (Fig. 1 A). Shown are the PCR products of tail DNA from six members of a large litter in which animals 1–3 and 6 display amplification of the transgene. Mice identified as harboring the transgene (T) by PCR amplification expressed increased amounts of immunoreactive Gαi2(endogenous Gαi2 and the Q205L Gαi2) in fat (Fig. 1 B), liver, and skeletal muscle (14Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In each of these target tissues for the PCK promoter-driven expression, the levels of Gαi2 expression were well in excess of that in the corresponding tissues of their control littermates (C). In non-target tissues, such as lung (Fig. 1 B) as well as brain or spleen (not shown), the PCK promoter is not active, and expression of Gαi2 is equivalent in transgenic (T) and control littermates (C) alike. Constitutive expression of Q205L Gαi2 was persistent in all members of the four founder pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 transgenic lines, each line propagated for more than 10 generations. The activity ratio (−/+ Glu-6-P) of glycogen synthase for fasting mice in the absence of insulin (t = 0) was markedly greater in skeletal muscle from the mice harboring the pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 transgene than in their FVB control littermates (Fig. 2). In fact, the levels of activation of glycogen synthase observed in skeletal muscle of the fasted, pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 mice is comparable to that observed in skeletal muscle of control mice treated with insulinin vivo for 15 min. The activity ratios for skeletal muscle glycogen synthase in control mice are 0.25 ± 0.001 without insulin and 0.39 ± 0.03 (n = 6) following intravenous administration of insulin. These data agree well with earlier results of hepatic glycogen synthase activation, glucose tolerance tests, analysis of hexose transport, and the data on GLUT4 recruitment (12Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The elevated levels of glycogen synthase activation in skeletal muscle of pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 mice observed in the absence of insulin administration provide compelling evidence that expression of Q205L Gαi2 in vivo is insulinomimetic with respect to activation of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle. Earlier we elucidated a signal linkage map of the control of glycogen synthase activation in the BDF1 strain of mice (14Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) at the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases), ribosomal S6 kinase, and glycogen synthase kinase-3. ERK1,2 has been implicated in downstream signaling by several growth factors, including insulin. To address the possible role of ERK1,2, activation was assessed using phospho-specific antibodies that recognize only the dually phosphorylated, fully active form of the kinases. When administered to mice in vivo, insulin stimulated activation of ERK1,2 (Fig. 3). The activation of ERK1,2 peaks at about 8 min following insulin injection into the vena cava (Fig. 3). Activation of glycogen synthase, in contrast, is absent at 2, 4, and 8 min postinsulin administration in vivo, occurring between 8 and 16 min postinsulin in the FVB strain of mice. Glycogen synthase activation increased from 1.1 ± 0.1-fold at 8 min to 1.7 ± 0.2.5-fold at 16 min postinsulin (mean ± S.E., n= 6). The activation of glycogen synthase in vivo in the BDF1 strain of mice, in contrast, was much more rapid, measurable within 2 min post-administration of insulin and peaking at about 4 min (14Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To address if activation of ERK1,2 was mediating the constitutive activation of glycogen synthase in the mice harboring the pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 transgene, the activity of ERK1,2 was measured both in skeletal muscle of control and of transgenic mice, after the mice have been fasted overnight. Although glycogen synthase is fully activated in the fasted mice expressing the Q205L Gαi2, ERK1,2 activity actually displayed a slight, although non-significant, reduction rather than marked elevation in the transgenic mice compared with their control littermates, i.e. epidermal growth factor receptor peptide phosphorylation (dpm/20 μg/15 min) in skeletal muscle samples decreasing from 2910 ± 470 in FVB controls to 2330 ± 290 in the transgenic mice (mean ± S.E.,n = 6). Expression of constitutively active Q205L Gαi2 in vivo provokes constitutive activation of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle but has little effect on the activity of ERK1,2. These data obtained in FVB mice support earlier temporal studies of insulin action performed in BDF1 mice suggesting that activation of ERK1,2 is not an important element of glycogen synthase activation by insulin in skeletal muscle (14Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The status of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was assessed, since activation of glycogen synthase by insulin is accompanied by and perhaps mediated via activation of JNK in BDF1 mice (14Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). JNK activity was measured by the solid phase assay using a GST-c-Jun fusion peptide as the substrate. Administration of insulin in vivo results in a rapid and robust activation of JNK (Fig. 4). Activation of JNK in response to insulin was observed as early as 30 s following insulin administration in vivo, far more rapid in response than the activation of ERK1,2. Maximal activation of JNK is achieved within 2 min following administration of insulin. JNK activation is increased approximately 5-fold over basal at 2 min postinsulin. Basal activity of skeletal muscle JNK is increased 3-fold in the mice expressing the Q205L Gαi2 (TableI), following an overnight fast. The activity of JNK in the unstimulated, fasted transgenic mice is indistinguishable from the level of JNK activation observed in the fasted FVB control littermates following challenge with insulin. Of interest, administration of insulin to the Q205L transgenic mice fails to increase appreciably the level of JNK activity over that observed in the basal, unstimulated state, i.e. t = 0 for insulin administration. Constitutive activation of JNK activity is not confined to skeletal muscle; measurement of JNK in fat tissue likewise displays constitutive activation of JNK in the fasted transgenic mice (Table I). Fat and skeletal muscle are target tissues for expression of the pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 transgene (10Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In spleen and heart, which are non-target tissues for expression of the pPCK-Q205L Gαi2 transgene, basal JNK activity of the transgenic mice is equivalent to the values obtained with these tissues obtained from the FVB control mice (Table I). These data demonstrate not only tissue-specific expression of the pPCK-Q205L Gαi2transgene but also expression in the target tissues does not lead to a pleiotropic activation of JNK at non-target sites. More importantly, the constitutive activation of JNK in the skeletal muscle and fat of mice expressing the constitutively active Q205L Gαi2suggests strongly that JNK is a likely contributor to the insulinomimetic effects observed in the transgenic mice.Table IJNK activation is enhanced in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice with targeted expression of the constitutively active Q205L Gαi2AnimalTissueInsulinTimeAssayFold activationminFVB controlSkeletal muscleNo0JNK1.0 ± 0.09FVB controlSkeletal muscleYes2JNK3.5 ± 0.53*Q205L miceSkeletal muscleNo0JNK3.2 ± 0.67*Q205L miceSkeletal muscleYes2JNK3.5 ± 0.38*AnimalTissueAssayGST-Jun phosphorylation (dpm/15 min)FVBFatJNK410 ± 080Q205LFatJNK830 ± 075*FVBSkeletal muscleJNK390 ± 020Q205LSkeletal muscleJNK795 ± 035*FVBSpleenJNK1510 ± 290Q205LSpleenJNK1500 ± 250FVBHeartJNK3490 ± 630Q205LHeartJNK3470 ± 620The time course for the activation of JNK in skeletal muscle of FVB mice following administration of insulin in vivo by using GST-Jun fusion protein as the substrate for JNK phosphorylation is shown in Fig. 4.

The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin has been reported to activate selective members of MAP kinase family, at concentrations less than that necessary to block protein synthesis (16Gould G.W. Cuenda A. Thompson F.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Although a non-physiological agent, anisomycin was tested for its ability to activate JNK activity of skeletal muscle in vivo. Administration of anisomycin (20 mg/kg body weight) in vivoprovoked activation of JNK activity in skeletal muscle (Fig. 5) but failed to activate appreciably glycogen synthase within 16 min of administration. The activity ratio (−glucose-6-phosphate/+glucose-6-phosphate) was unchanged from the 0 time point (0.26 ± 0.1) at either 8 min (0.26 ± 0.2) or 16 min (0.28 ± 0.6) following administration of 20 mg/kg body weight of anisomycin (mean ± S.E., n = 3). These observations in FVB mice are very different from those obtained with the mice of the BDF1 strain, which display a rapid activation both of JNK and of glycogen synthase in response to administration of anisomycin in vivo. Taken together, the time course of JNK activation and its persistent activation in the mice expressing the constitutively active form of Q205L Gαi2 suggest that activation of JNK alone may be insufficient to activate glycogen synthase. p38 is a newly discovered member of the MAP kinase family shown earlier to be a novel feature of insulin signaling in some cells in culture (15Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19664-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We explored the ability of insulin to activate p38 kinase in control FVB mice administered insulin in vivo, using antibodies that recognize only the dually phosphorylated, fully active form of p38 (Fig. 6). Insulin stimulates a rapid and robust activation of p38 kinase in skeletal muscle. Activation of p38 is measurable within 1 min and peaks at 4 min following challenge with insulin in vivo. A ∼3.5-fold increase in the amounts of active p38 is observed at 4 min postinsulin challenge. These data provide the first demonstration of a rapid, robust activation of p38 kinase in vivo in a major target tissue for insulin action, i.e. skeletal muscle.

Here, we provide evidence that this abnormal processing results from defective initial folding of the secreted FAF gelsolin due to the lack of the Cys188-Cys201 disulfide bond, normally formed next to the FAF mutation site. We compared cells of different tissue origin and discovered a dramatic difference between the amount of cleavage of FAF gelsolin to the amyloid precursor in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. More than half of the mutant gelsolin was cleaved in PC12 and in vitro differentiated human neuronal progenitor cells. In contrast, human fibroblasts and Schwannoma cell cultures showed only a limited capacity to cleave FAF gelsolin, although the cleavage mechanism per se seems to be similar in the various cell types.

Amyloidosis represents a group of diseases in which abnormal fibrillar protein deposits, derived from biochemically distinct proteins are found in the extracellular space of patients' tissues (1Glenner G.G.

Genet. 1992; 2: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), an actin-modulating protein. Intracellular and secreted forms of gelsolin differ by the presence of a disulfide bond between amino acids 188 and 201, a signal sequence, and a short amino-terminal extension in the secreted form (12Yin H.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. Mole J.E. Cole F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5271-5276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel gelsolin isoform of intracellular gelsolin, gelsolin-3, has been recently described in oligodendrocytes (14Vouyiouklis D.A. Brophy P.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transient expression of the wild-type and mutant gelsolin in COS-1 cells results in the abnormal cleavage of the secretory form of FAF-mutant gelsolin. Consequently, secretion of both the full-length (83 kDa) and the 68-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (GSN-c68) of gelsolin consisting of amino acids 173–755 is observed (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GSN-c68 has been found also in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of FAF patients (16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Paunio T. Kiuru S. Karonen S.L. Palo J. Peltonen L. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin.

The second putative cleavage of this fragment at amino acid position 244 is likely to generate the FAF amyloid (amino acids 173–243) (19Maury C.P. Alli K. Baumann M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Haltia M. Prelli F. Ghiso J. Kiuru S. Somer H. Palo J. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These in vitro and in vivo findings have led to the conclusion that GSN-c68 represents the immediate precursor for FAF amyloid, and thus, generation of this polypeptide seems to be the first crucial event in the molecular pathogenesis of FAF. This study was carried out to further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying FAF with particular emphasis on (i) the impact of the FAF mutation on the initial folding of gelsolin and (ii) on the role of the processing of FAF gelsolin by different cell types. By providing evidence for the specific role of neurons in the generation of precursor protein for FAF amyloid, our data give interesting insight into the vigorously studied issue of the cellular pathogenesis of an amyloidosis affecting the nervous system. COS-1and Hep2C cells as well as cultured primary fibroblasts from a control individual and from a 55-year-old male FAF patient with the G654A mutation of gelsolin (22Paunio T. Kiuru S. Hongell V. Mustonen E. Syvänen A.C. Bengtström M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Genomics. 1992; 13: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and A549 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 or 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Undifferentiated PC12 cells were cultured on plates coated with a 1:40 dilution of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Labware, MA) and in RPM1 1640 medium supplemented with 10% normal horse serum (HS) and 5% FCS. For differentiation, a medium with 1% HS and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) (Alomone Labs, Israel) was used. Human macrophages and monocytes were obtained as described previously (23Ronni T. Matikainen S. Sareneva T. Melén K. Pirhonen J. Keskinen P. Julkunen I. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2363-2374PubMed Google Scholar). Primary human Schwannoma cell cultures were derived from the trigeminal Schwannoma of a 15-year-old male and from the vestibular Schwannoma of a 59-year-old female with histopathological diagnosis of neurilemmoma atypicum and neurilemmoma as published earlier (24Kaasinen S. Pyykkö I. Koskiniemi M. Vaheri A. Acta Otolaryngol. 1995; 1: 25-26Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Staining with S-100 antibody, a marker for Schwann cells, was performed to confirm the phenotype of the cultured cells. Human neuronal telencephalic progenitor cells (HNP) were obtained after the legal abortion of an 8-week old fetus and cultivated as earlier described (25Buc-Caron M.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 1995; 2: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with the addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mm) (Sigma) to the culture medium. This medium allowed differentiation of the progenitors into cells of neuronal lineage, as was confirmed by the staining of most of the cells with antibodies against the microtubule-associated protein, MAP-2. Site-directed mutagenesis changing nucleotide G658 to C (Cys188 → Ser) was performed with a ChameleonTM double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on pcDX-X expression vectors containing either the wild-type (Asp187) or FAF-mutant (Asn187) secretory gelsolin cDNA (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mutant clones (p-sGSNSer188 and p-sGSNAsn187Ser188) were identified using solid-phase minisequencing. cDNAs encoding for the wild-type and the FAF-mutant gelsolin were ligated to a shuttle vector between the long terminal repeat from Rous sarcoma virus and the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence, flanked by regions derived from the adenoviral genome. Linearized shuttle plasmid and the large ClaI fragment of Ad-5 DNA with deletion in E3 regions were co-transfected to the 293 cell line. After homologous recombination, the recombinant E1/E3 deleted adenoviruses were plaque-purified and expanded in 293 cells (26Strafford-Perricaudet L.D. Makeh I. Perricaudet M. Briand P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The correct structures were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blotting as well as by a minisequencing test for gelsolin (22Paunio T. Kiuru S. Hongell V. Mustonen E. Syvänen A.C. Bengtström M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Genomics. 1992; 13: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transfection with the plasmid constructs as well as collection of the transfected cells and their media were performed as described earlier (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were infected for 1–2 h in serum-free medium using the recombinant adenoviruses at different amounts of multiples of infectivity (1–100) in order to avoid a plausible artifact caused by the varying capability of the vectors to transduce different types of cells. After infection, medium supplemented with 2% FCS or 1% FCS and 1% HS was added to all cell types except for the HNP cells, the medium of which contained no FCS. In protease inhibition assays, EDTA (1.2 or 10 mg/ml) was added to serum-free medium, and the cells were incubated for 4 h. Similar efficiency of transduction in COS-1 and PC12 cell cultures was confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of gelsolin in the transduced cells. Monoclonal anti-gelsolin (GS-2C4) (27Chaponnier C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), anti-MAP 1 (HM-1), anti-MAP 2 (HM-2) (Sigma), and monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (SY 38, DAKO, Denmark) antibodies were used in the immunocytochemical studies using dilutions provided by the manufacturer. The polyclonal antibodies for gelsolin (K-572, AM904, and NH951) have been described in detail elsewhere (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To obtain a polyclonal COOH961 antibody (amino acids 420–755 of gelsolin), gelsolin cDNA was digested with BglII andEcoRI and cloned in pGEX-2T+1 vector. The expression of the fusion protein, immunizations, and titer specificity were performed as described (16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1.). Western blotting and detection of proteins as well as the metabolic labeling of PC12 cells were prepared as described in (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The optical densities of the gelsolin-specific bands were determined by a BioImage Analyzer (Milligen, Bioresearch) on autoradiographs. Immunoprecipitations were performed as published in Kangas et al. (16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or with a mixture of AM904 and COOH961 antibodies at a 1:100 dilution using protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Sweden). The lysed cells were incubated first with the antibody followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose, both at 4 °C for 1 h. In temperature-shift experiments, the cells were labeled for 2 h at 19.5 °C (16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cells and media were harvested after a 1-h chase and immediately cooled on ice. In some experiments, the cells were transferred to 37 °C for 1 h after the pulse. Immunofluorescence staining of PC12 cells was performed as described previously for COS-1 cells (16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and immunocytochemical stainings were performed with standard techniques using the Vectastain ABC-standard kit (Vector Laboratories, CA). Double labeling with two monoclonal antibodies involved the secondary antibody with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, and the staining and development reactions were carried out separately. The coverslips were mounted in GelMount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), or glycerol gelatin (Sigma) and viewed with a Leica confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axiophot light microscope using a × 40 or × 63 objective. We wanted to determine whether the abnormal cleavage of FAF secretory gelsolin to GSN-c68 fragment results from disruption of the Cys188-Cys201 bond formed in the immediate vicinity of the FAF-causing mutation in secretory gelsolin (13Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A Cys188 → Ser (G658C) mutation was introduced into expression plasmids coding for both wild-type and FAF-mutant gelsolin. The plasmids were expressed in COS-1 cells, and the cells and media were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies recognizing different epitopes of gelsolin (Fig. 1). Cells transfected with either of the two plasmids containing the cysteine mutation secreted not only the full-length gelsolin but also the truncated polypeptide of the expected size and immunoreactivity as that of the GSN-c68 gelsolin fragment (Fig. 2). Based on densitometric scanning, approximately 30% of the mutant gelsolin was processed to the abnormal 68-kDa form (GSN-c68). The cell fraction contained only the full-length gelsolin, and the aberrant fragmentation could be inhibited by EDTA (Fig. 2). Thus the results obtained for the secreted gelsolin with the disrupted cysteine bridge Cys188–201 were identical to those we had obtained earlier for gelsolin carrying the FAF mutation (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To monitor the processing of secreted FAF gelsolin in various cell types, we utilized recombinant adenoviruses encoding for the wild-type or FAF form of secretory gelsolin (Ad-sGSNwt and Ad-sGSNAsn187, respectively) and infected cells of different tissue origin with these constructs. The processing of mutant gelsolin in COS-1 cells was found to be similar both in the adenovirus-driven and in the transient expression experiments (Fig. 3, left). The wild-type and FAF-mutant gelsolin were then expressed in cell lines derived from canine kidney (MDCK), human lung carcinoma (A549), and hepatocarcinoma (Hep2c). In each case, wild-type gelsolin was secreted in the full-length form, whereas the media from the Ad-sGSNAsn187 virus-infected cultures contained the additional, aberrant GSN-c68 fragment (Fig. 3). We observed, however, some variation in the different types of cells, the proportion of GSN-c68 being highest in the media of MDCK cells (27% of total gelsolin) and lowest in the media of Hep2c cells (6%). In contrast, human fibroblasts transduced with Ad-sGSNAsn187 similarly to fibroblasts derived from a FAF patient secreted only the full-length gelsolin into the culture media (Fig. 3). To ascertain whether fibroblasts have any role in the processing of exogenous FAF gelsolin, non-transduced control fibroblast cultures were incubated with culture media derived from Ad-sGSNAsn187-infected MDCK cells. Further cleavage of the mutant secretory gelsolin was not observed, and in particular, no FAF amyloid polypeptide was observed. Similar results were obtained using cultured monocytes instead of fibroblasts (data not shown). Since neuropathy is a characteristic feature of FAF, we were interested in analyzing the processing of FAF gelsolin in cells of neuroectodermal origin. Schwannoma cell cultures obtained from two patients showed a limited capacity to cleave FAF gelsolin because only 0–7% of secreted FAF gelsolin was cleaved (Fig. 4,left). However, unlike all the other cell types tested so far, a major fraction (approximately 60–90%) of the mutant gelsolin was cleaved in both undifferentiated and NGF-induced PC12 cells (Fig. 4, middle). Furthermore, the abnormal GSN-c68 polypeptide was detected not only in the medium but also in the PC12 cell extracts (Fig. 4, middle). In order to confirm the results obtained with PC12 cells, HNP cells that had been differentiated in vitro into cells of neuronal lineage were applied for transduction analyses. Also in these cells, more than half of the secreted FAF gelsolin was cleaved to GSN-c68 (Fig. 4, right). The cleavage of FAF gelsolin (83 kDa) into GSN-c68 should also generate an amino-terminal 15 kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1). We detected this polypeptide both in the cells and media of NGF-induced PC12 cells expressing FAF gelsolin. The polypeptide proved to be unstable because it was not found in the COS-1 cells or media and only occasionally in the media from the MDCK and A549 cells expressing FAF gelsolin (Fig. 5). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the GSN-c68 polypeptide was secreted from the PC12 cells at the same rate as the full-size gelsolin while no signs of endocytosis of gelsolin polypeptides were observed (Fig. 6). This was further confirmed by the finding of only the 83-kDa gelsolin in the media and no endocytosed gelsolin polypeptides from non-transduced PC12 cells that had been incubated with medium derived from fibroblasts expressing FAF gelsolin (data not shown). Pulse-chase experiments on a temperature block of 19.5 °C (28Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) showed that secreted FAF gelsolin gets cleaved in the PC12 cells after the trans-Golgi network but prior to secretion (Fig. 6 B). Finally, a high concentration (10 mg/ml) of EDTA had some inhibitory effect on the fragmentation of FAF-gelsolin (Fig. 6 C). Thus the results obtained here are very similar to those we obtained earlier in the COS-cells (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzymatic process cleaving FAF gelsolin is most likely similar in the PC12 and COS cells. In order to examine the distribution of wild-type and mutant secretory gelsolin in neuronal cells, differentiated PC12 and HNP cells transduced either with Ad-sGSNwt or with Ad-sGSNAsn187 were subjected to immunocytochemical stainings using anti-gelsolin antibody. The infected and uninfected cells were found to be morphologically similar, and no signs of induced death of cells expressing mutant gelsolin was observed. The wild-type and mutant gelsolin were identically distributed so that, in either case, immunostaining was seen both in the soma and along the processes where the staining was most prominent at the tip of the extensions (Fig. 7 A, B, andD-F). Double staining of the transduced PC12 cells using anti-gelsolin antibody with antibodies against either synaptophysin, MAP-1, or MAP-2 showed similar distributions to these marker proteins. The immunostaining pattern of anti-gelsolin antibody was perhaps closest to that obtained with the synaptophysin antibody (Fig. 7 C). FAF is a dominantly inherited amyloidosis caused by Asp187 → Asn/Tyr mutations in gelsolin (7Maury C.P. Baumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1096: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Ghiso J. Haltia M. Prelli F. Novello J. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Chapelle A.de la Tolvanen R. Boysen G. Santavy J. Bleeker-Wagemakers L. Maury C.P. Kere J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have shown earlier in COS cells that the abnormal cleavage of the amyloidosis-associated forms of secretory gelsolin results in the secretion of an aberrant 68-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of gelsolin (GSN-c68) (15Paunio T. Kangas H. Kalkkinen N. Haltia M. Palo J. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), presumably representing an immediate precursor protein for FAF amyloid. Intracellular FAF gelsolin also contains the FAF mutation but is not subject to alternative cleavage in COS cells, suggesting that the secreted form of FAF gelsolin is the only source of FAF amyloid (16Kangas H. Paunio T. Kalkkinen N. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Characteristic only to the secretory gelsolin is a disulfide bond that gets formed in close vicinity to the FAF mutation, between amino acids 188 and 201 (13Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Consequently, the aberrant processing restricted to the secretory FAF gelsolin could be related to disturbed disulfide bridge formation and abnormal primary folding of the molecule. We demonstrated here that secretory gelsolin carrying the Cys188 → Ser mutation was processed in a fashion similar to that of the FAF mutant protein in COS-1 cells, resulting in the secretion of a truncated carboxyl-terminal polypeptide that corresponded in size and immunoreactivity to the GSN-c68 fragment. Since the introduction of this serine mutation to FAF gelsolin did not cause any other obvious changes in the protein processing or secretion, the present data would indicate that the 188–201 disulfide bond is not properly formed in the mutant secretory gelsolin. This would result in abnormal initial folding of the protein and aberrant proteolytic cleavage producing the FAF amyloid precursor fragment. A similar portion, about 30% of both the FAF and the Cys188 → Ser mutated secretory gelsolin was found to become abnormally cleaved in the expression system of COS-1 cells, most probably due to the insufficient capacity of gelsolin-cleaving enzyme(s). Our in vitro expression data are slightly in contrast with the assumption made by Burtnick et al. (29Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) who suggested, based on the three-dimensional structure of wild-type horse plasma gelsolin, that the Cys188-Cys201 disulfide bond might help to stabilize the FAF amyloid fragment accumulating in tissues. Although the present data strongly suggest that the formation of this bond is actually disturbed in the case of secreted FAF gelsolin, these cysteine residues might, nevertheless, play an important role in later processing steps of the GSN-c68 to FAF amyloid. Rearrangement of inter- or intramolecular disulfide bonds have been described in another protein (fibrillin) in extracellular matrix after secretion and might occur also in the case of FAF gelsolin polypeptides (30Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, it is noteworthy that, although we demonstrated similar abnormal cleavage of FAF and cysteine-defective gelsolin in COS cells, the actual amyloid formation might still be influenced by additional factors in vivo (31Maury C.P.J. Nurmiaho-Lassila E.-L. Rossi H. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 558-564PubMed Google Scholar). The amyloid deposits in FAF are found in particular in the cornea, nerves, skin, and kidney in addition to the walls of vessels in various organs (3Kiuru S. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1992; 86: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Meretoja J. Teppo L. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. Sec. A. 1971; 79: 432-440PubMed Google Scholar, 5Meretoja J.

Yanagisawa N. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1996; 3: 134-139Google Scholar). In addition to the high level of production of gelsolin, for example in the skin, there seem to be additional factors affecting the characteristic tissue distribution of FAF amyloid (32Paunio T. Kangas H. Kiuru S. Palo J. Peltonen L. Syvänen A.-C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One such factor could be differential processing of the mutant secretory gelsolin in different types of cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression provided us with a convenient means to analyze the processing of FAF-mutant gelsolin in cultured cells. In cells of renal, hepatic, and lung origins, approximately 10–30% of the mutant protein was cleaved. In contrast, fibroblasts did not process FAF gelsolin abnormally, nor did monocytes seem to degrade it, suggesting that these cells of the connective tissue and immune system do not play a major role in the generation of FAF amyloid. Interestingly, in the glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, the Schwann cells, only 0–7% of secreted FAF gelsolin was found to be cleaved, whereas a distinct majority of the mutant protein was cleaved in PC12 cells, the classical model of neuronal lineage. Furthermore, the GSN-c68 fragment was found both in the cell culture medium of the PC12 cells and inside the cells, and the amino-terminal counterpart derived from the proteolysis of full-length FAF gelsolin was reproducibly detected only in these cells and their medium. To confirm the results obtained with PC12 cells, primary cultures of human telencephalic progenitor (HNP) cells that had been differentiatedin vitro into cells of the neuronal lineage were analyzed. Also in these cells, the FAF gelsolin was extensively cleaved as compared with the non-neuronal cells. Consequently, our results emphasize the particular role of cells of neuronal origin in the abnormal proteolysis of FAF gelsolin and in production of the characteristically observed amyloid of the cranial and peripheral nerve fibers. Since a similar level of fragmentation was observed in differentiated and undifferentiated PC12 cells, it is possible that a constantly high level or activity of gelsolin-cleaving enzyme is found in these as well as in HNP cells. Results suggesting a specific role for neuronal cells in the processing of an amyloid precursor protein have so far been obtained only for APP, the precursor protein of the β amyloid found in Alzheimer's disease. For example, post-translational signaling events in APP differ between neurons and other cell types (33Tienari P. Strooper de B. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Czech C. Hartmann T. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Leuven V.F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and neurons also appear to generate more β amyloid peptide than astrocytes or microglia (34LeBlanc A.C. Xue R. Gambetti P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2300-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed identical distributions of wild-type and mutant secretory gelsolin in NGF-induced PC12 cells. We did not detect morphological differences between uninfected cells or cells expressing wild-type or mutant gelsolin, nor did the mutant gelsolin seem to induce increased cell death. Secretory gelsolin was localized in the cell soma, near the endoplasmic reticulum, and in Golgi-like structures as well as along the processes and nerve endings of both differentiated PC12 and HNP cells. Since the best colocalization was observed with synaptophysin, a presynaptic marker, it is likely that substantial amounts of secretory neuronal gelsolin are secreted in the presynaptic region of the neurons, although more detailed analyses including immunoelectronmicroscopy would be needed to confirm the data. Nevertheless, these observations have interesting implications when considering the deposition of FAF amyloid in those organs that are clinically perhaps most severely affected, namely the nerves and cornea, in the latter of which the characteristic lattice lines have been suggested to correspond to the trigeminal nerve endings (5Meretoja J. Ophthalmologica. 1972; 165: 15-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Starck T. Kenyon K.R. Hanninen L.A. Beyer-Machule C. Fabian R. Gorn R.A. McMullan F.D. Baum J. McAdam K.P.

Thus, the present findings provide evidence for the importance of neurons in the production of precursor protein for FAF amyloid and, furthermore, in the tissue pathogenesis of an amyloid disease affecting the nervous system.

Antibodies that bind to distinct epitopes along the large hydrophilic N-terminal segment of the exchanger labeled the extracellular surface of the rod outer segment plasma membrane, whereas antibodies against a large hydrophilic loop between the two membrane domains labeled the intracellular side. Enzymatic deglycosylation studies indicated that the exchanger primarily containsO-linked sialo-oligosaccharides located within the N-terminal domain. Removal of the extracellular domain with trypsin or the large intracellular domain with kallikrein did not alter the Na+- or K+-dependent Ca2+ efflux activity of the exchanger when reconstituted into lipid vesicles. Anti-exchanger antibodies were also used to visualize the distribution of the exchanger in the retina by light and electron microscopy. The exchanger was localized to the plasma membrane of rod outer segments. No labeling was observed in the disk membranes, cone photoreceptor cells, or other retinal neurons, and only faint staining was seen in the rod inner segment. These results indicate that the O-linked glycosylated rod Na/Ca-K exchanger is specifically targeted to the plasma membrane of rod photoreceptors and has a topological organization similar to that reported for the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger. The large intracellular and extracellular domains do not directly function in the transport of ions across the rod outer segment plasma membrane, but instead may play a role in protein-protein interactions that maintain the spatial organization of the exchanger in the plasma membrane or possibly regulate transport activity of the exchanger.

The Na/Ca-K exchanger, together with the cGMP-gated channel, plays a crucial role in vertebrate phototransduction and light adaptation by controlling the dynamic level of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. In the dark, Ca2+ entering the outer segment through cGMP-gated cation channels is removed by the Na/Ca-K exchanger, thereby maintaining a steady state cytoplasmic Ca2+ level in the range of 220–550 nm (1Ratto G.M.

Continued extrusion of Ca2+ from the ROS by the Na/Ca-K exchanger leads to a significant decrease in intracellular Ca2+. This reduction in Ca2+ results in the activation of guanylate cyclase by a guanylate cyclase-activating protein called GCAP (3Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H.

Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa, but migrates anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent mass of ∼230 kDa due, in part, to posttranslational glycosylation (10Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The rod exchanger is localized in the plasma membrane of ROS (10Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), where it has recently been shown to exist as a dimer (11Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.-Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The rod exchanger exhibits some similarity in structure and function to the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger (NCX1) and its isoforms (NCX2 and NCX3) found in the other tissues (12Nicoll D.A.

Hydropathy profiles suggest that both types of transporters have two membrane domains, each consisting of six transmembrane segments and a large hydrophilic, negatively charged loop connecting the two membrane domains (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The first membrane spanning segment serves as a cleavable signal sequence and is absent in the mature proteins (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Hryshko L. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both the rod and cardiac exchangers are electrogenic transporters (14Yau K.-W. Nakatani K. Nature. 1984; 311: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Reeves J.P. Sutko J.L. Science. 1980; 208: 1461-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), coupling the influx of Na+ with the efflux of Ca2+ across the cell membrane.There are, however, notable differences in the structure and function of these two types of exchangers. The rod Na/Ca-K exchanger and the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger show no significant similarity in their primary structure (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, the rod exchanger contains a large hydrophilic segment at its N terminus that is absent in the other Na/Ca exchangers. At a functional level, the rod exchanger utilizes the energy derived from the influx of 4 Na+ and efflux of 1 K+ to transport 1 Ca2+ against its electrochemical gradient (16Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C153-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the cardiac exchanger and related isoforms are potassium-independent, coupling the influx of 3 Na+ to the efflux of 1 Ca2+ from the cell (18Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crepso L.M. Grantham C.J. Cannell M.B. Nature. 1990; 345: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).To date there is little direct experimental evidence for the topological organization of the rod exchanger in the ROS plasma membrane, and information concerning the role of specific domains in transport activity of this exchanger is lacking. This is due largely to the limited success in expressing the rod exchanger in heterologous cells for structure-function analyses. In this study, we have generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies to specific regions of the bovine rod Na/Ca-K exchanger. These antibodies have been used as probes: 1) to study the topological organization and glycosylation of the exchanger in the ROS plasma membrane, 2) to examine the role of the hydrophilic N-terminal and a large hydrophilic internal domain on sodium- and potassium-dependent Ca2+ transport activity of the rod exchanger, and 3) to map the cellular and subcellular distribution in retinal tissue.DISCUSSIONIn this study, a panel of monoclonal antibodies was generated against two immunodominant regions of the bovine rod Na/Ca-K exchanger for use as probes to examine the structural and functional properties of this transporter and its distribution in photoreceptor cells. The antibodies that bind to distinct epitopes within the large, hydrophilic N-terminal domain of the exchanger label the extracellular side of rod outer segments, as visualized by immunogold labeling techniques, whereas the antibodies directed against specific sites within the large hydrophilic internal domain of the exchanger label the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. These studies provide direct experimental evidence in support of the membrane topology of the exchanger that was first proposed by Reilander et al. (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) on the basis of protein sequence and hydropathy profiles. In this model a long extracellular segment precedes the first hydrophobic domain consisting of five transmembrane segments (H1–H5). A large, negatively charged hydrophilic segment localized on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane is present between this first membrane domain and a second membrane domain consisting of six transmembrane segments (H6–H11). A similar membrane topology has been proposed for the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger, but for this transporter, the large N-terminal extracellular domain is absent (26Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The location of the epitopes for the various antibodies in context to the topological model of the rod Na/Ca-K exchanger is shown in Fig. 10.The role of the large extracellular and intracellular domains of the exchanger in ion transport was examined by limited proteolysis and functional reconstitution. Removal of at least the first 350 amino acids of the extracellular segment did not affect the Na+-dependent Ca2+ transport activity of the exchanger. Likewise, removal of a substantial portion of the intracellular segment with kallikrein had no significant effect on K+-dependent or -independent Na+/Ca2+ exchange. On this basis, we conclude that most, if not all, of the large extracellular and intracellular segments do not play a crucial role in the ion binding or transport by the exchanger. Instead, ion transport across the membrane appears to be mediated by the membrane domains of the exchanger and possibly the proximal hydrophilic segments. The importance of the membrane domains for the function of the exchanger is supported by recent findings indicating that the primary structure of the membrane domains of the bovine and human rod Na/Ca-K exchangers are 94% identical in amino acid sequence, whereas the large extracellular and intracellular domains are only 59% and 45% conserved, respectively (27Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a recently cloned potassium-dependent Na/Ca exchanger from rat brain that shares an overall amino acid identity of 55% with the bovine rod exchanger, is 80% identical in the membrane spanning segments (28Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lower degree of conservation of the extracellular and intracellular domains is also evident by the general lack of cross-reactivity of the bovine anti-exchanger monoclonal antibodies employed in this study with the rod exchanger of other species 2D. M. Reid, T. S. Y. Kim, and R. S. Molday, unpublished results. Interestingly, theV max for Na+-dependent exchange was observed to increase by 2-fold after protease treatment. A similar increase in activity of cardiac Na/Ca exchanger has been reported after proteolysis (29Nicoll D.A. Barrios B.R Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1212-C1216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of the large extracellular and intracellular domains may facilitate conformational changes, which the exchanger most likely undergoes as part of the ion transport mechanism as suggested for other transporters (30Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers and Pumps. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 127-169Crossref Google Scholar, 31Niggli E. Lederer W.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The biochemical properties of the large extracellular domain of rod Na/Ca-K exchanger have not been extensively studied. Earlier studies, however, have indicated that this segment of the exchanger is heavily glycosylated and contains significant amounts of sialic acid residues (10Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Studies carried out here using neuraminidase in combination withO- and N-specific endoglycosidases indicate that the exchanger is primarily O-glycosylated. This modification is responsible to a large part for the anomalously slow migration (high apparent molecular mass) of the exchanger by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The negatively charged intracellular loop also appears to contribute to the retarded migration on SDS gels (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The number ofO-linked sialo-glycosylation sites is not currently known; however, Reilander et al. (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have reported that residues Ser-84, Thr-234, Thr-244, and Thr-245 could not be detected during peptide sequencing. This suggests that at least these four residues serve as sites for O-linked glycosylation. Although there are two conserved consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation in the bovine and human rod exchangers (27Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar), no change in mobility of the bovine exchanger was observed after endo-N-glycosidase treatment. Either these sites are not glycosylated or the oligosaccharide chains are small and their removal does not affect the mobility of the exchanger on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.The functional role of the extracellular and intracellular domains of the rod Na/Ca-K exchanger remains to be investigated. It is possible that the glycosylated extracellular domain contains a site(s) for anchoring components of the interphotoreceptor matrix to the rod outer segment or for interaction with receptors on adjacent retinal pigment epithelial cells. Alternatively, the oligosaccharide chains with their high content of sialic acid residues may simply provide the surface of the ROS with a negative charge, analogous to glycophorin on red blood cells. The role of the intracellular segment of the rod exchanger also remains to be determined. In the case of the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger, this segment has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the exchanger by Na+ and Ca2+ (32Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The intracellular segment of the rod Na/Ca-K may play a role as a Ca2+ sensor since studies by Schnetkamp and co-workers (34Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Li X.-B. Szerencsei R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22983-22990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) indicate that Ca2+ extrusion from ROS is inhibited at a low intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The intracellular segment of the exchanger may also be involved in the association of the exchanger with the cGMP-gated channel in rod outer segment plasma membranes (36Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Molday R.S. Molday L.L. Vis. Res. 1998; 10: 1315-1323Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and/or interaction with cytoskeletal components within the outer segment.Immunolabeling studies of intact retina have provided insight into the cellular and subcellular distribution of the exchanger in rod photoreceptor cells. The antibodies against various epitopes of the exchanger were found to label only rod photoreceptor cells. A similar result was reported by Haase et al. (38Haase W. Friese W. Gordon R.D. Müller H. Cook N.J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody. The exchanger in cone cells, therefore, is either expressed at levels below the sensitivity of the labeling methods used in this study or, more likely, is encoded by a distinct gene. Many outer segment proteins expressed in rod and cone cells including opsin, transducin, phosphodiesterase, and the cGMP-gated channel are known to be encoded by distinct genes. The labeling studies also indicate that the exchanger, like the cGMP-gated channel is specifically targeted to the plasma membranes. The mechanism for specific sorting of rod photoreceptor membrane proteins to either the plasma membrane or disk membranes remains to be elucidated. The Na/Ca-K exchanger, together with the cGMP-gated channel, plays a crucial role in vertebrate phototransduction and light adaptation by controlling the dynamic level of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. In the dark, Ca2+ entering the outer segment through cGMP-gated cation channels is removed by the Na/Ca-K exchanger, thereby maintaining a steady state cytoplasmic Ca2+ level in the range of 220–550 nm (1Ratto G.M. Payne R. Owen W.G. Tsien R.Y. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3240-3246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B.

Continued extrusion of Ca2+ from the ROS by the Na/Ca-K exchanger leads to a significant decrease in intracellular Ca2+. This reduction in Ca2+ results in the activation of guanylate cyclase by a guanylate cyclase-activating protein called GCAP (3Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H.

Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa, but migrates anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent mass of ∼230 kDa due, in part, to posttranslational glycosylation (10Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The rod exchanger is localized in the plasma membrane of ROS (10Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), where it has recently been shown to exist as a dimer (11Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.-Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The rod exchanger exhibits some similarity in structure and function to the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger (NCX1) and its isoforms (NCX2 and NCX3) found in the other tissues (12Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Hydropathy profiles suggest that both types of transporters have two membrane domains, each consisting of six transmembrane segments and a large hydrophilic, negatively charged loop connecting the two membrane domains (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The first membrane spanning segment serves as a cleavable signal sequence and is absent in the mature proteins (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Hryshko L. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both the rod and cardiac exchangers are electrogenic transporters (14Yau K.-W. Nakatani K. Nature. 1984; 311: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Reeves J.P. Sutko J.L. Science. 1980; 208: 1461-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), coupling the influx of Na+ with the efflux of Ca2+ across the cell membrane. There are, however, notable differences in the structure and function of these two types of exchangers. The rod Na/Ca-K exchanger and the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger show no significant similarity in their primary structure (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, the rod exchanger contains a large hydrophilic segment at its N terminus that is absent in the other Na/Ca exchangers. At a functional level, the rod exchanger utilizes the energy derived from the influx of 4 Na+ and efflux of 1 K+ to transport 1 Ca2+ against its electrochemical gradient (16Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C153-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the cardiac exchanger and related isoforms are potassium-independent, coupling the influx of 3 Na+ to the efflux of 1 Ca2+ from the cell (18Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crepso L.M. Grantham C.J. Cannell M.B. Nature. 1990; 345: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To date there is little direct experimental evidence for the topological organization of the rod exchanger in the ROS plasma membrane, and information concerning the role of specific domains in transport activity of this exchanger is lacking. This is due largely to the limited success in expressing the rod exchanger in heterologous cells for structure-function analyses. In this study, we have generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies to specific regions of the bovine rod Na/Ca-K exchanger. These antibodies have been used as probes: 1) to study the topological organization and glycosylation of the exchanger in the ROS plasma membrane, 2) to examine the role of the hydrophilic N-terminal and a large hydrophilic internal domain on sodium- and potassium-dependent Ca2+ transport activity of the rod exchanger, and 3) to map the cellular and subcellular distribution in retinal tissue. DISCUSSIONIn this study, a panel of monoclonal antibodies was generated against two immunodominant regions of the bovine rod Na/Ca-K exchanger for use as probes to examine the structural and functional properties of this transporter and its distribution in photoreceptor cells. The antibodies that bind to distinct epitopes within the large, hydrophilic N-terminal domain of the exchanger label the extracellular side of rod outer segments, as visualized by immunogold labeling techniques, whereas the antibodies directed against specific sites within the large hydrophilic internal domain of the exchanger label the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. These studies provide direct experimental evidence in support of the membrane topology of the exchanger that was first proposed by Reilander et al. (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) on the basis of protein sequence and hydropathy profiles. In this model a long extracellular segment precedes the first hydrophobic domain consisting of five transmembrane segments (H1–H5). A large, negatively charged hydrophilic segment localized on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane is present between this first membrane domain and a second membrane domain consisting of six transmembrane segments (H6–H11). A similar membrane topology has been proposed for the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger, but for this transporter, the large N-terminal extracellular domain is absent (26Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The location of the epitopes for the various antibodies in context to the topological model of the rod Na/Ca-K exchanger is shown in Fig. 10.The role of the large extracellular and intracellular domains of the exchanger in ion transport was examined by limited proteolysis and functional reconstitution. Removal of at least the first 350 amino acids of the extracellular segment did not affect the Na+-dependent Ca2+ transport activity of the exchanger. Likewise, removal of a substantial portion of the intracellular segment with kallikrein had no significant effect on K+-dependent or -independent Na+/Ca2+ exchange. On this basis, we conclude that most, if not all, of the large extracellular and intracellular segments do not play a crucial role in the ion binding or transport by the exchanger. Instead, ion transport across the membrane appears to be mediated by the membrane domains of the exchanger and possibly the proximal hydrophilic segments. The importance of the membrane domains for the function of the exchanger is supported by recent findings indicating that the primary structure of the membrane domains of the bovine and human rod Na/Ca-K exchangers are 94% identical in amino acid sequence, whereas the large extracellular and intracellular domains are only 59% and 45% conserved, respectively (27Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a recently cloned potassium-dependent Na/Ca exchanger from rat brain that shares an overall amino acid identity of 55% with the bovine rod exchanger, is 80% identical in the membrane spanning segments (28Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lower degree of conservation of the extracellular and intracellular domains is also evident by the general lack of cross-reactivity of the bovine anti-exchanger monoclonal antibodies employed in this study with the rod exchanger of other species 2D. M. Reid, T. S. Y. Kim, and R. S. Molday, unpublished results. Interestingly, theV max for Na+-dependent exchange was observed to increase by 2-fold after protease treatment. A similar increase in activity of cardiac Na/Ca exchanger has been reported after proteolysis (29Nicoll D.A. Barrios B.R Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1212-C1216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of the large extracellular and intracellular domains may facilitate conformational changes, which the exchanger most likely undergoes as part of the ion transport mechanism as suggested for other transporters (30Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers and Pumps. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 127-169Crossref Google Scholar, 31Niggli E. Lederer W.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The biochemical properties of the large extracellular domain of rod Na/Ca-K exchanger have not been extensively studied. Earlier studies, however, have indicated that this segment of the exchanger is heavily glycosylated and contains significant amounts of sialic acid residues (10Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Studies carried out here using neuraminidase in combination withO- and N-specific endoglycosidases indicate that the exchanger is primarily O-glycosylated. This modification is responsible to a large part for the anomalously slow migration (high apparent molecular mass) of the exchanger by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The negatively charged intracellular loop also appears to contribute to the retarded migration on SDS gels (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The number ofO-linked sialo-glycosylation sites is not currently known; however, Reilander et al. (9Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have reported that residues Ser-84, Thr-234, Thr-244, and Thr-245 could not be detected during peptide sequencing. This suggests that at least these four residues serve as sites for O-linked glycosylation. Although there are two conserved consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation in the bovine and human rod exchangers (27Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar), no change in mobility of the bovine exchanger was observed after endo-N-glycosidase treatment. Either these sites are not glycosylated or the oligosaccharide chains are small and their removal does not affect the mobility of the exchanger on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.The functional role of the extracellular and intracellular domains of the rod Na/Ca-K exchanger remains to be investigated. It is possible that the glycosylated extracellular domain contains a site(s) for anchoring components of the interphotoreceptor matrix to the rod outer segment or for interaction with receptors on adjacent retinal pigment epithelial cells. Alternatively, the oligosaccharide chains with their high content of sialic acid residues may simply provide the surface of the ROS with a negative charge, analogous to glycophorin on red blood cells. The role of the intracellular segment of the rod exchanger also remains to be determined. In the case of the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger, this segment has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the exchanger by Na+ and Ca2+ (32Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The intracellular segment of the rod Na/Ca-K may play a role as a Ca2+ sensor since studies by Schnetkamp and co-workers (34Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Li X.-B. Szerencsei R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22983-22990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) indicate that Ca2+ extrusion from ROS is inhibited at a low intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The intracellular segment of the exchanger may also be involved in the association of the exchanger with the cGMP-gated channel in rod outer segment plasma membranes (36Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Molday R.S. Molday L.L. Vis. Res. 1998; 10: 1315-1323Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and/or interaction with cytoskeletal components within the outer segment.Immunolabeling studies of intact retina have provided insight into the cellular and subcellular distribution of the exchanger in rod photoreceptor cells. The antibodies against various epitopes of the exchanger were found to label only rod photoreceptor cells. A similar result was reported by Haase et al. (38Haase W. Friese W. Gordon R.D. Müller H. Cook N.J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody. The exchanger in cone cells, therefore, is either expressed at levels below the sensitivity of the labeling methods used in this study or, more likely, is encoded by a distinct gene. Many outer segment proteins expressed in rod and cone cells including opsin, transducin, phosphodiesterase, and the cGMP-gated channel are known to be encoded by distinct genes. The labeling studies also indicate that the exchanger, like the cGMP-gated channel is specifically targeted to the plasma membranes. The mechanism for specific sorting of rod photoreceptor membrane proteins to either the plasma membrane or disk membranes remains to be elucidated. In this study, a panel of monoclonal antibodies was generated against two immunodominant regions of the bovine rod Na/Ca-K exchanger for use as probes to examine the structural and functional properties of this transporter and its distribution in photoreceptor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2071792172,"The human ST5 gene encodes three proteins with predicted molecular masses of 126, 82, and 70 kDa. These widely expressed proteins share a C-terminal region that bears significant sequence homology to a group of GDP/GTP exchange proteins for the Rab3 family of small GTP binding proteins. The N-terminal region of the largest ST5 protein, p126, contains two proline-rich sequences, PR1 and PR2, with consensus motifs similar to Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions and to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation sites. Based on these properties, we sought to investigate the activity of ST5 proteins in signal transduction pathways. In vitro, p126 displayed preferential binding to c-Abl SH3, as compared with other SH3 domains. This interaction was mediated by the PR2 sequence. In vivo, expression of p126, but not p82 or p70, activated MAPK/ERK2 in response to EGF in COS-7 cells. Expression of c-Abl with p126 greatly enhanced this activity. Deletion of PR1 blocked the ability of p126 to activate ERK2. Deletion of PR2 did not affect the basal activity, but blocked the stimulatory effect of c-Abl. Whereas p82 expression had no effect on ERK2 activation by p126, p70 completely abrogated this activity. These observations suggest that ST5 can function as a signaling protein and can provide a link between c-Abl and ERK2.

This widely expressed gene was mapped proximal to the β-globin locus on chromosome 11 and is expressed as three mRNA species, 4.6, 3.1, and 2.8 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); ERK2, extracellular signal regulated kinase 2, SH3, Src homology 3; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; aa, amino acid(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S- transferase; MADD, MAP kinase-activating death domain protein; JNK, c-jun N-terminal kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HA, influenza hemagglutinin. in length (2Richard C.W.

Cell Genet. 1991; 58: 1968Google Scholar). These messages encode three predicted gene products, designated by their molecular masses as p126, p82, and p70. The expression of theST5 gene was of interest because it correlated directly with cellular morphology and suppression of tumorigenicity in the Hela/fibroblast system as well as in several carcinoma cell lines (1Lichy J.H. Modi W.S. Seuanez H.N. Howley P.M. Cell Growth. Differ. 1992; 3: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar). While the two larger mRNA species were expressed at similar levels in all cell lines examined, expression of the 2.8-kb message was specific for non-tumorigenic cells. In the HeLa/fibroblast system, the 2.8-kb message was detected in the non-tumorigenic hybrids but was undetectable or markedly reduced in their tumorigenic derivatives. The structure of ST5 mRNAs has been previously characterized. The differentially regulated 2.8-kb message consists of the 3′ terminal sequence common to all three ST5 transcripts and derives from a promoter located within an intron of the ST5 gene. We previously identified and characterized an enhancer sequence within this promoter. This sequence contains one AP-1 and 5 YY1 sites that were shown to play a critical role in the differential regulation of the 2.8-kb message in the Hela/fibroblast system (4Lichy J.H. Majidi M. Elbaum J.E. Tsai M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4700-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 4.6- and 3.1-kb messages are alternatively spliced products sharing 5′ and 3′ ends but differing in that the 4.6-kb transcript has an additional 1260-nucleotide sequence located near its 5′ end. This 1260-nucleotide segment encodes a segment of the protein containing two proline-rich regions, PR1 and PR2, unique to p126. The specific organization of proline residues in this sequence raised the possibility of a function for this protein in signal transduction pathways. Specific proline-rich sequences constitute consensus motifs that serve as binding sites for specific domains in signaling proteins or as substrates for certain protein kinases (5Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The recognition site for Src homology 3 (SH3) domains consists of a proline-rich sequence with at least one PXXP core (6Musacchio A. Noble M. Pauptit R. Wierenga R. Saraste M.

SH3 domains are peptides 60–70 amino acids in length involved in protein-protein interactions leading to the activation of a wide variety of signal transduction pathways, including those leading to the activation of the MAP kinase family members ERK1, ERK2, and JNK (10Bar-Sagi D.

Characterization of the sequence requirements for binding to various SH3 domains has revealed that the amino acids surrounding the PXXP core participate in determining the specificity of these interactions. Ren et al. (8Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) identified a 10-amino acid proline-rich consensus sequence that mediates association between the c-Abl SH3 domain and a variety of interacting proteins. Since then, a number of SH3 binding proteins have been identified, including mSos, PI3K, p22phox, AAP1, RIN1, and FBPWW (15Kapeller R. Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhaussen B.S. Rudd C.E.

In this study, we present several lines of evidence supporting a role for the ST5 protein, p126, in the MAP kinase pathway leading to the activation of ERK2. First, analysis of the sequence of the protein now demonstrates a region of homology to guanine nucleotide exchange factors for small GTP binding proteins as well as the proline-rich, SH3 binding motifs described above. Furthermore, we show in vitro the preferential binding of c-Abl SH3 with the proline-rich region, PR2, of the p126 protein. In an effort to determine the functional significance of this interaction, we show that expression of p126 stimulates ERK2 activation in response to EGF. Co-expression of c-Abl with p126 results in a synergistic stimulation of ERK2 activity as compared with p126 or c-Abl alone. We show that while the proline-rich region PR1 is required for the activation of ERK2 by p126, the PR2 region mediates the stimulatory effect of the c-Abl·p126 complex in COS-7 cells. Last, we found that neither p82 nor p70 activates ERK2; however, p70 inhibits the activation of ERK2 by p126. p70 also interferes with ability of the c-Abl·p126 complex to activate ERK2 cooperatively. These observations support a model in which the ST5 proteins are novel components of a growth regulatory signaling pathway, possibly involving the c-Abl protein, linking EGF stimulation to the activation of ERK2. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against aa 494–784 of the p126 sequence expressed as a TrpE fusion, following standard protocols (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Additional characterization of this antiserum will be reported separately. 2A. E. Hubbs, M. Majidi, and J. H. Lichy, manuscript submitted for publication. For Western blots, the ST5 proteins were separated on 12% SDS/PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the ST5 antibody. The blot was incubated with protein A-peroxidase, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and developed by chemiluminescence with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 4.6-, 3.1-, and 2.8-kb ST5 cDNAs, cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the T7 in vitrotranscription/translation kit (Promega) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The translated gene products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. For use in expression studies, the 4.6-, 3.1-, and 2.8-kb ST5 cDNAs were cloned in the sense orientation into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). HA-ERK2, HA-JNK, and c-Abl cDNAs were generously provided by J. Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health). Mutations were introduced directly into the 4.6 kb cDNA/pcDNA3 plasmid using the Unique Site Elimination Mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′-CCATCACACTGGCGGCCGCTGCAGCATGCAT CTAGAGG-3′, which eliminates theXhoI restriction site in the pcDNA3 vector; 5′-CGGGGGACTCTGAGCAG-CTTCGGTTATTTGGACAG-3′, which deletes amino acids 28–98 (PR1 domain, hyphen at site of deletion); and 5′-GAATACGAGGCTGAGAAAG-TCC TTTGAGTTTGAGGAT-3′, which deletes amino acids 401–447 (PR2 domain). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Using the cDNA of ST5 as a template, DNA fragments corresponding to the various domains were synthesized using the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides that contained appropriate restriction sites and bordered the domains of interest. The amplified DNAs were digested and cloned into pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Large scale cultures were grown, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h, and lysed by sonication in NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl. The following ST5 fusions were prepared: GST aa 1–27; GST aa 28–447; GST aa 28–100 (PR1 domain); GST aa 101–400; GST aa 401–447 (PR2 domain); GST aa 447–528; and GST aa 531–586. Fusion proteins encoding SH3 domains of Abl, Grb2, and Src were generated as described (15Kapeller R. Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhaussen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Equal amounts of each full-length ST5 fusion protein were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk, and probed with 3 μg of [γ-32P]ATP labeled GST Abl SH3, GST Grb2 SH3, or GST Src SH3 domain in TBST (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween) plus 5% milk powder. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the membrane was washed five times with TBST, and the labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Subconfluent COS-7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of HA-epitope-tagged ERK2 and 2 μg of additional expression plasmids by the DEAE-dextran method (23Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3 vector to 6 μg per plate. Two days post-transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and cultured for an additional 24 h. EGF was added to a concentration of 150 ng/ml 15 min prior to harvesting. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. After high speed centrifugation for 30 min, the epitope-tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of supernatants containing equal amounts of protein with 2 μg of the mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, one time in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5m lithium chloride, and once in kinase buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. The MAPK activity was measured by suspending the anti-HA precipitates in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 40 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) per reaction. After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 4× Laemmli sample buffer, heat denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and exposed to a screen for detection and quantitation with a Molecular Dynamics Storm imaging system. Equal amounts of COS lysates transfected with ERK2 HA and the indicated expression plasmids were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk, and probed with ST5 antibody. After an incubation with the secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, the blot was developed by chemiluminescence with ECL reagents. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of HA-epitope-tagged JNK and additional DNAs by the DEAE-dextran method. The total amount of DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3 vector to 6 μg per plate. After overnight serum starvation, transfected cells were stimulated with 150 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. The epitope-tagged JNK protein was immunoprecipitated with the HA antibody (12CA5), and JNK activity was determined in kinase buffer using GST-ATF as substrate. Products were detected as in the MAPK assay. The sequence of the three ST5 mRNA species predicts proteins with molecular masses of 126, 82, and 70 kDa. Proteins consistent with those predicted sizes were readily produced from the cloned, full-length cDNAs either by transient transfection in COS-7 cells or by in vitrotranscription/translation (Fig. 1 A and B). The migration of p126 was somewhat slower than predicted, presumably due to the presence of proline-rich regions unique to this gene product. Fig. 2 shows the complete amino acid sequence of p126. The structure of the three ST5 proteins is shown schematically in Fig. 3 A. The p126 sequence contains 23 S/T-P motifs, of which 16 occur within the segment unique to p126. Five of these, including three present only in p126, conform to the expanded motif P-X-S/T-P, which is the optimal site for MAP kinase phosphorylation (24Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J.

The sequence also contains potential sites for casein kinase 2 phosphorylation (aa 240, 657, and 1015) and N-linked glycosylation (aa 8 and 557).Figure 2The predicted amino acid sequence of p126.

The p126 amino acid sequence was searched against the non-redundant GenBankTMprotein data bank using the BLASTP program (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60189) Google Scholar). Significant homology was found to the Rab3 GEF protein (Expect value = 1 × 10−7), MADD (Expect = 4 × 10−7), the C. elegans aex3 protein (Expect = 3 × 10−11), and the C. elegans cDNA yk86e5.5 (Expect = 6 × 10−10).

Among the homologous proteins are two anonymousCaenorhabditis elegans cDNAs and a group of highly similar proteins, including the C. elegans aex-3 gene product, a Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange factor from Rattus norvegicus, and three nearly identical human proteins identified as MADD (MAP kinase activating death domain protein), DENN, and KIAA0358 (27Iwasaki K. Staunton J. Saifee O. Nonet M. Thomas J.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Schievella A. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.L. J. Biol.

The region of homology includes the leucine zipper motif of MADD, suggesting that this region of ST5 may function as a site for dimerization or interaction with other proteins. The 420 amino acid segment unique to p126, extending from amino acids 28–447, contains two proline-rich regions, designated PR1 and PR2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Within these two stretches are several occurrences of the 10-amino acid consensus sequenceX P XXPPPΨX P(X = any amino acid; Ψ = a hydrophobic amino acid) reported as a consensus binding site for the Abl SH3 domain (8Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Motifs with prolines at positions 2, 7, and 10, which were found to be important for c-Abl binding, are repeated four and three times in PR1 and PR2, respectively (Fig. 3 B). However, the occurrences of this motif in PR1 lack the hydrophobic amino acid at position 8, which was found to be important for Abl binding (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, this sequence suggested the possibility of a specific interaction between the c-Abl SH3 domain and PR2. Since PR1 and PR2 share a consensus characteristic of c-Abl SH3 ligands (8Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of segments of the ST5 proteins to interact directly with c-Abl in vitro. GST fusion proteins containing various regions of the ST5 coding sequence were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, immobilized on nitrocellulose, and probed with 32P-labeled c-Abl SH3 domain. The SH3 binding domain of the 3BP-1 protein (8Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) expressed as a GST fusion served as the positive control for c-Abl SH3 binding. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the SH3 domain of c-Abl bound strongly to fusion proteins containing aa 401–447 (PR2) or 28–447, the sequence unique to p126, containing both PR1 and PR2. In contrast, c-Abl SH3 did not recognize aa 28–100 (PR1), GST alone, or GST fused to any region of the ST5 protein C-terminal to PR2. To further examine the specificity of c-Abl·p126 interaction, we studied the binding of the Grb2 protein and the Src SH3 domain to the ST5 fusion proteins. Like the c-Abl fusion, the Grb2 probe recognized the PR2 fusion, GST-aa 401–447, and GST-aa 27–447 (Fig. 4 C). In addition, this probe bound to aa 102–401, the sequence between PR1 and PR2. In contrast, the Src SH3 domain failed to bind to either PR1 or the PR2 fusion proteins but interacted very weakly with fusions containing the region between these two proline-rich domains (aa 28–447 and 101–400, Fig. 4 D). The results show that p126 can interact with certain SH3 domains in vitro and that the PR2 region interacts preferentially with the c-Abl SH3 domain, as predicted from the sequence. The observations that p126 shares some structural features with signaling proteins and can bind the intracellular kinase c-Abl in vitro prompted us to explore whether ST5 can participate in signaling pathways involving c-Abl leading to the activation of either ERK2 or JNK (14Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 30Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell. Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Initially, we tested the effect of ST5 proteins alone on these pathways. COS-7 cells were transfected with the epitope-tagged ERK2 or JNK cDNAs together with expression vectors carrying the cDNA for the ST5 proteins, p126, p82, or p70. Transfection with the active form of Ras (Ras 12V) served as a positive control. After 72 h, cells were treated with EGF (150 ng/ml) for 15 min. The HA-tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the 12CA5 antibody to the HA epitope, and the precipitates were assayed for kinase activity on an appropriate substrate, either myelin basic protein (MBP) for ERK2 or GST-ATF for JNK. Expression of p126 induced a 4-fold increase in ERK2 activity (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, expression of p82 or p70 had little effect. Deletion of the PR1 region (p126 lacking aa 28–100, ΔPR1) resulted in the complete loss of the ability to stimulate ERK2 activation, whereas deletion of PR2 (p126 lacking aa 401–447, ΔPR2) had little effect (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 5 C shows approximately equal expression of the wild-type and mutant ST5 proteins in COS lysates. Each of the three ST5 proteins failed to stimulate JNK activity significantly in response to EGF (Fig. 5 D). Without EGF treatment, the stimulatory effect of p126 on ERK2 was less pronounced (data not shown). Thus, wild type p126 can function in the signal transduction pathway leading to ERK2 activation in response to EGF, and this activity requires the PR1 region of the protein. In vitro, p126 bound strongly to the SH3 domain of c-Abl. The ERK2 activation assay provided a tool to study the effects of the interaction between p126 and c-Abl in vivo. COS-7 cells were transfected with c-Abl and an ST5 cDNA. Co-transfection of wild type p126 with c-Abl stimulated ERK2 activity 8–13-fold over basal levels (Fig. 6 A), as compared with 4-fold by p126 and less than 2-fold by c-Abl alone. Expression of ΔPR2 with c-Abl resulted in the same degree of ERK2 activation as ΔPR2 alone. The pattern of expression of p70 in Hela/fibroblast hybrids suggests that this ST5 isoform functions in maintaining the nontumorigenic phenotype (4Lichy J.H. Majidi M. Elbaum J.E. Tsai M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4700-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that p70 acts to inhibit signal transduction through p126. To test this possibility, the effect of p70 on p126-mediated activation of ERK2 was examined. Expression of p70 strongly inhibited the induction of ERK2 by p126 (Fig. 6 B). Transfection of p82 slightly reduced the stimulatory effect of p126 on ERK2, but to a lesser extent than p70. Co-transfection of p70 with p126 and c-Abl reduced ERK2 activity to basal levels (Fig. 6 A). These data support the conclusion that p70 negatively regulates signaling through p126. We have presented several lines of evidence supporting the involvement of ST5 proteins in growth regulatory signaling pathways. First, homology searches revealed significant sequence similarities to rab3-specific GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs) from rat and C. elegans and to a human protein named MADD, for “MAP kinase activating death domain protein” (27Iwasaki K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The homology to receptor binding proteins with GEF activity raises the possibility that the ST5 proteins may represent additional members of a novel class of such proteins. This possibility is consistent with the other findings reported in this study regarding both the protein binding properties observed in vitro and the ability of p126 to activate ERK2 in vivo. Short sequence motifs, particularly in the 420 aa segment unique to p126, also suggested involvement of the ST5 proteins in signal transduction pathways. These motifs include the proline-rich domains PR1 and PR2, and many copies of a consensus that conforms to phosphorylation target sites by MAP kinases (24Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The organization of prolines in PR1 and PR2 suggested the possibility that these regions might interact with SH3 domains. PR2 was noted to contain several copies of a motif that has been shown to bind preferentially to the c-Abl SH3 domain (8Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In vitro filter binding assays confirmed the ability of PR2 to bind to the c-Abl SH3 domain and, furthermore, supported the inference from the sequence analysis that PR2 would bind preferentially to c-Abl over other SH3 containing proteins. PR1 was not required for the association with Abl SH3. The binding specificity was most pronounced when compared with results obtained with the c-Src SH3 domain, which did not bind PR1 or PR2. The Grb2 protein also bound to PR2, as well as to the sequence between PR1 and PR2, presumably through short proline-rich sequences in this segment of the protein. The ability of the protein to interact with Grb2, together with homology to the GEFs, raises the possibility that p126 could function as a link between an adaptor protein, such Grb2, and a small GTP binding protein, such as Ras, in a manner analogous to the well studied Sos protein (11Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S.S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Based on inferences from the amino acid sequence and the ability of p126 to bind SH3 domains, experiments were designed to investigate the possible function of this protein in signal transduction pathwaysin vivo. In COS-7 cells, transfection of p126 resulted in the stimulation of the enzymatic activity of the MAP kinase ERK2. In contrast, no stimulation of JNK activity was detected under the same conditions. Through the use of deletion mutants, the PR1 region was shown to be critical for this activity, whereas PR2 was not required. These results show that p126 can function as an activator of the EGFR-mediated ERK2 pathway. Consistent with other studies, transfection of c-Abl by itself had little effect on ERK2 activation. However, co-transfection of c-Abl with p126 resulted in a pronounced stimulation of the activity obtained with p126 alone. This result provides direct evidence that c-Abl can interact with p126 in vivo. Further support for this conclusion came from transfection of the ΔPR2 mutant, which lacks the sequences necessary for interaction with the c-Abl SH3 domain in vitro. This mutant was able to stimulate ERK2 activity to approximately the same extent as wild-type p126. However, the c-Abl protein was no longer able to stimulate the basal activity obtained by transfecting ΔPR2 alone. The results indicate that the stimulatory effect of c-Abl on p126 results from a physical interaction of the two proteins in vivo and that this interaction is dependent on the PR2 region of p126. Stimulation of ERK2 activity by ST5 proteins was only observed with the largest gene product, p126. Neither p82 nor p70 has any effect on this activity. However, we report here that p70 inhibits the activation of ERK2 mediated by p126 or the p126·c-Abl complex. An important problem in understanding the role of the ST5 proteins in tumor suppression is to identify the specific role played by p70. The expression of this ST5 isoform correlates well with the non-tumorigenic phenotype in a variety of cell lines. In the HeLa/fibroblast hybrids in particular, p70 is detectable only in the non-tumorigenic hybrids (4Lichy J.H. Majidi M. Elbaum J.E. Tsai M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4700-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transfection of the cDNA encoding p70 has the ability to reverse the morphological features of transformation in at least some transformed derivatives of NIH 3T3 cells.2 Thus, we can speculate that p126 acts as a link in a signaling pathway that promotes growth and that p70 inhibits this growth-promoting signal. Although the specific mechanism by which p70 inhibits p126 signaling has not been established in the present study, several plausible possibilities exist. For example, p126 may function as a homodimer, perhaps utilizing the region homologous to the rab3 GEFs as a dimerization domain. In this scenario, p70 might compete with homodimerization by forming inactive p126/p70 heterodimers, thereby blocking activity of the protein. An alternative model, based on the similarities noted between p126 and GEF proteins such as Sos, envisions p126 as a link between two proteins, A and B, in the signal transduction pathway, with the N-terminal portion of the protein interacting with protein A and the C-terminal segment with protein B. Transmission of the signal from A to B would require both segments of p126; interaction of the C-terminal segment alone (i.e. p70) with protein B would fail to activate the downstream components of the pathway. The role of p70 in this model would be to compete with p126 for binding to protein B, again blocking signaling through p126. The results of this study identify the ST5 gene product p126 as a component of a signal transduction pathway leading to activation of the MAP kinase ERK2. To gain a greater understanding of how the ST5 proteins participate in regulating the non-tumorigenic phenotype, it will be important to identify the specific signals to which these proteins respond, the specific function of p126 in the pathway, and the mechanism of inhibition of the pathway mediated by the differentially expressed ST5 gene product, p70.

https://openalex.org/W2130499987,"Homologous recombination in Escherichia coli is initiated by the RecBCD enzyme and is stimulated by an 8-nucleotide element known as Chi (chi). We present a detailed biochemical characterization of a mutant RecBCD enzyme, designated RecBC1004D, that displays a reduced level of chi site recognition. Initially characterized genetically as unable to respond to the chi sequence, we provide evidence to indicate that the ability of this mutant enzyme to respond to chi is reduced rather than lost; the mutant displays about 20-fold lower chi recognition than wild-type RecBCD enzyme. Although this enzyme exhibits wild-type levels of double-stranded DNA exonuclease, helicase, and ATPase activity, its ability to degrade single-stranded DNA is enhanced 2-3-fold. The data presented here suggest that the reduced recombination proficiency of the recBC1004D strain observed in vivo results from a basal level of modification of the RecBC1004D enzyme at both chi-specific, as well as nonspecific, DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1974644164,"We have studied the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in amylase secretion from differentiated AR4-2J cells. The secretagogue bombesin, the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate induced tyrosine phosphorylation of different proteins, including paxillin and p125FAK, which was reduced or blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin B56, respectively. Both PMA and pervanadate continuously increased amylase secretion with a similar time course, reaching the level of bombesin-induced amylase release after 60 min. Their effects were not additive and could be inhibited by preincubation of AR4-2J cells with genistein or tyrphostin B56, respectively. Inhibition of protein kinase C with Ro 31-8220 nearly abolished the effects of PMA, but had no effect on either pervanadate-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation or amylase secretion. An increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration by thapsigargin or A23187 caused a rapid increase in amylase release within the initial 5 min. In the presence of PMA or pervanadate, amylase secretion was further stimulated to levels comparable to those induced by bombesin after 30 min of stimulation. Inhibition of PMA-induced amylase secretion by Ro 31-8220 was less at elevated cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations than without Ca2+. Furthermore, an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration had no effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in either the absence or presence of PMA or pervanadate. We therefore conclude that in the cascade of events that lead to bombesin-induced protein secretion from AR4-2J cells, protein tyrosine phosphorylation occurs downstream of protein kinase C activation. A further step in secretion that is Ca2+-dependent occurs distal to protein tyrosine phosphorylation.

A further step in secretion that is Ca2+-dependent occurs distal to protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In a variety of different cell types, cellular responses to hormones and/or growth factors are mediated by the activation of tyrosine kinases (1Rozengurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in specific proteins is due to the activity of not only tyrosine kinases, but also phosphotyrosine phosphatases. Specific phosphatase inhibitors, such as sodium vanadate (2Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), are useful tools in the study of hormone- and growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Vanadium salts have been shown to have “insulin-like” effects both in intact animals and in cell cultures (3Shechter Y. Shisheva A. Endeavour New Ser. 1993; 17: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). H2O2, like vanadate, partially mimics the effects of insulin in different cell culture systems (4Czech M.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Lynn W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4173-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 5May J.M. de Haen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9017-9021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that pervanadate, which is generated by vanadate peroxidation in the presence of H2O2, is a new powerful insulin-like agent that exceeds the sum of both vanadate and H2O2effects (6Kadota S. Fantus G.I. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Hersh B. Posner B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal injection of pervanadate into mice leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins in the liver and kidney within minutes (7Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, pervanadate may be a useful tool to study the role of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins involved in signaling pathways. In rat pancreatic acinar cells, enzyme secretion is stimulated in response to secretagogues such as cholecystokinin or bombesin (8Schulz I. Schultz S.G. Fork J.G. Raūner B.B. Handbook of Physiology: The Gastrointestinal System. Salivary, Gastric, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary Secretion. III. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1989: 443-463Google Scholar). The signal cascade involves activation of receptor-coupled G-proteins, leading to the stimulation of phospholipase C activity, which is followed by production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Whereas inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores (9Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar), diacylglycerol leads to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (10Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Iwasa Y. Kawahara Y. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3692-3695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins could be observed following stimulation of the cells with cholecystokinin (11Lutz M.P. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11119-11124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation could amplify the secretory response rather than provide an obligate signal for enzyme secretion. On the other hand, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein and tyrphostin 25 were shown to inhibit agonist-induced amylase secretion and phospholipase C activation in rat pancreatic acinar cells (12Piiper A. Stryjek-Kaminska D. Stein J. Caspary W.F. Zeuzem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G363-G371PubMed Google Scholar, 13Duan R.-D. Wagner A.C.C. Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G303-G310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that tyrosine kinases are involved in receptor-mediated stimulation of amylase secretion. In Swiss 3T3 cells, bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins, the cytosolic protein kinase p125FAK and the cytoskeletal-associated protein paxillin, has been described as an early event in hormone-mediated cell growth (14Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19031-19034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both p125FAK and paxillin is accompanied by profound changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the assembly of the focal adhesion plaques, which represent the sites of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (16Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both p125FAK and paxillin are localized in these distinct areas. They are assumed to be regulatory components of the complex of cytoskeletal proteins that link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 18Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). It was the purpose of this study to investigate if protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a step in the signal cascade of stimulus-secretion coupling in rat pancreatic acinar cells. We have used the tumor cell line AR4-2J, which has been described as a model system for long-term studies on pancreatic acinar cell function (19Jessop N.W. Hay R.J. In Vitro (Rockville). 1980; 16 (abstr.): 212Google Scholar, 20Logsdon C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2096-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of protein kinase C activation is involved in stimulation of enzyme secretion from pancreatic AR4-2J cells. An increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration accelerated amylase secretion, but had no effect on either PMA- or pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore assume that Ca2+ is involved in protein secretion distal to protein tyrosine phosphorylation in such a way that priming of target proteins by tyrosine phosphorylation is a prerequisite for Ca2+-dependent activation of secretion. Genistein, tyrphostin B56, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, Ro 31-8220, and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany) and were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide as stock solutions. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (clone PY20) were purchased from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany), anti-p125FAK antibody (clone 2A7) from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and anti-paxillin antibody (clone 349) and protein G PLUS/protein A-agarose from Dianova (Hamburg). Peroxide of vanadate (pervanadate) was prepared by mixing vanadate (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) with H2O2 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by addition of catalase (Sigma) to remove residual H2O2 as described by Fantus et al. (21Fantus G.I. Kadota S. Deragon G. Foster B. Posner B.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8864-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Fetal calf serum was obtained from PAA Laboratories (Cölbe, Germany), and penicillin/streptomycin from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, Germany). Leupeptin was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg), and trypsin inhibitor (hen egg white) from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and all other reagents (of analytical grade) were from Sigma. AR4-2J cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL1492; Rockville, MD). The cells were seeded at 750,000 cells/35-mm Petri dish and were routinely grown for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Differentiation of the cells was induced by addition of 100 nm dexamethasone. After 72 h, the cells were washed with the appropriate buffer and used for the assays. For measurement of amylase release, AR4-2J cells were washed three times with KRH buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4) and preincubated for 10 min with or without kinase inhibitors at 37 °C. The cells were stimulated by addition of agonists with or without pervanadate, and at the indicated times, aliquots of the supernatants were removed for the determination of amylase released by the cells. For measurement of the total amount of amylase, the cells were broken and scraped off in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 280 mm mannitol, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μmleupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. Amylase activity was determined using the Phadebas amylase test (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and is expressed as a percent of the total cellular content of amylase. For determination of tyrosine phosphorylation, AR4-2J cells were washed three times with KRH buffer and preincubated with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors for 10 min at 37 °C. Bombesin, PMA, or pervanadate was added for the indicated times, followed by washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were then scraped off and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100). After sonication of the cell lysates, 3× concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min to denature proteins. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μl of lysate containing 500 μg of total protein was incubated with 1.5–3 μg of primary antibody for 60 min on ice. After this time, 30 μl of a 30% suspension of protein G PLUS/protein A-agarose in phosphate-buffered saline was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 60 min with agitation at 4 °C. The agarose beads were centrifuged and washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were then resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min to release precipitated proteins from the beads. Proteins were electrophoretically separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes was done in a buffer containing 48 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS, and 20% methanol for 60 min at 0.8 mA/cm2. After staining with 0.2% Ponceau S to check the efficiency of the transfer, free binding sites of the membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) for 60 min, followed by a 60-min incubation with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-paxillin antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Corp., Braunschweig, Germany) and ReflectionTM autoradiography film (NEN Life Science Products, Köln, Germany). The density of bands on the film was measured using a scanning densitometer (Fröbel Labortechnik, Lindau, Germany). Protein was assayed as described by Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In the presence of pervanadate, amylase secretion from AR4-2J cells increased with time. However, the kinetics of amylase secretion induced by different concentrations of pervanadate were different compared with those for bombesin-induced amylase secretion (Fig. 1 A). Whereas bombesin stimulated amylase secretion mostly during the initial 10 min, pervanadate-stimulated amylase release above basal levels was detectable after 15 min and increased continuously within 60 min of observation. After 60 min of incubation, maximal amylase release was obtained with 100 μm pervanadate, which was comparable to that obtained by a maximally effective bombesin concentration. In Fig. 1 B, the dose-response relationship of pervanadate-stimulated amylase release in the absence and presence of bombesin is shown. After 30 min of incubation, secretion was stimulated by the maximally effective concentration of 100 μm pervanadate from 7.0 ± 0.7% of total amylase in control cells to 13.3 ± 1.2%. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at 20 μmpervanadate. At a maximally effective concentration of bombesin, amylase secretion over 30 min (19.4 ± 1.8%) was not significantly increased by pervanadate (23.1 ± 2.3%). After 60 min of incubation, amylase secretion was stimulated from 17.4 ± 0.8 to 34.3 ± 1.0% of total amylase by 100 μmpervanadate and was in the same range as the amylase release induced by a maximally effective bombesin concentration (31.6 ± 0.2%). Bombesin-stimulated amylase release was not further increased by any of the tested pervanadate concentrations. Taken together, these results indicate that bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion is probably mediated by a tyrosine kinase. As shown in TableI, the single components that are necessary to prepare pervanadate did not increase basal or bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion. H2O2alone had an inhibitory effect on both unstimulated and bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion. This effect is probably due to free oxygen radicals because no inhibition of amylase secretion was observed when H2O2 was preincubated with catalase (Table I).Table IEffect of the components for the preparation of pervanadate, H2O2, vanadate, and catalase on basal and bombesin-stimulated amylase secretionControl10 nmbombesinNone8.3 ± 0.521.6 ± 1.21 mm vanadate7.4 ± 0.421.8 ± 0.61 mm H2O24.9 ± 1.77.3 ± 0.7120 milliunits catalase7.7 ± 0.323.0 ± 3.11 mm H2O2 + 120 milliunits catalase7.5 ± 0.321.6 ± 1.31 mm vanadate + 1 mm H2O212.0 ± 2.614.2 ± 1.81 mm vanadate + 1 mm H2O2 + 120 milliunits catalase15.6 ± 0.123.8 ± 2.0AR4–2J cells were incubated with 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm H2O2, or 120 milliunits of catalase, alone or in combination as indicated, without and with 10 nm bombesin. After 30 min of incubation, amylase secretion was determined and is expressed as a percent of total amylase content of the cells present at the beginning of the incubation (n = 3). The inhibition of bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion by H2O2 was nullified after treatment with catalase. Open table in a new tab AR4–2J cells were incubated with 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm H2O2, or 120 milliunits of catalase, alone or in combination as indicated, without and with 10 nm bombesin. After 30 min of incubation, amylase secretion was determined and is expressed as a percent of total amylase content of the cells present at the beginning of the incubation (n = 3). The inhibition of bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion by H2O2 was nullified after treatment with catalase. To further assess the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in stimulus-secretion coupling, we compared both pervanadate- and bombesin-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in AR4-2J cells by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine. Fig. 2 A shows that treatment of cells with 100 μm pervanadate leads time-dependently to a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins. The earliest phosphorylation of proteins migrating with apparent molecular masses of 145, 120–140, 82, and 70 kDa was observed already after 3 min of incubation of the cells with pervanadate and increased during the observed period of 25 min. During this time, more and more proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). At pervanadate concentrations of 2 and 5 μm, a protein band of 145 kDa and one of 82 kDa appeared, respectively. After 25 min of incubation of cells with 50 μm pervanadate, protein bands were detected that migrated with apparent molecular masses of 180, 145, 120–140, 98, 82, 70, 62, 58, 55, 51, 42, and 37 kDa (Fig. 2 B). Bombesin-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which was maximally stimulated after 15 min of incubation with 10 nm bombesin, showed a different pattern (Fig. 2B, bn). The most prominent bands observed migrated with apparent molecular masses of 120–140 and ∼70 kDa. These bands probably correspond to the focal adhesion proteins p125FAK and paxillin, respectively, known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after bombesin treatment in Swiss 3T3 cells (14Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19031-19034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting showed that previous treatment of AR4-2J cells with pervanadate increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin ∼5- and 39-fold, respectively, compared with basal phosphorylation in control cells (Fig. 3). Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK induced by bombesin was also ∼3-fold of the control, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was increased only by ∼12-fold above basal phosphorylation. In the anti-paxillin immunocomplexes of bombesin- and pervanadate-stimulated cells, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity migrated as broad diffuse bands with an apparent molecular mass of 66–75 kDa. After pervanadate stimulation, the anti-paxillin antibody detected several protein bands between 63 and 73 kDa (see Fig. 5 B, lower panel), indicating that paxillin is present in several higher phosphorylated forms, whereas after bombesin stimulation, the anti-paxillin antibody detected a shift from 63 kDa to the phosphorylated form at 64–70 kDa (see Fig. 5 B,lower panel). This indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by the physiological stimulus bombesin is lower compared with the nonspecific stimulus pervanadate. Furthermore, the finding that the anti-paxillin antibody detected bands with a lower molecular mass compared with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (see Fig. 5 B, compare lower and upper panels) suggests that these bands represent minor phosphorylated or unphosphorylated forms of paxillin.Figure 3Effect of bombesin and pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin.AR4-2J cells were incubated in the absence (control (c)) or presence of 10 nm bombesin (bn) or 100 μm pervanadate (pv) for 15 min at 37 °C. After lysis of the cells, immunoprecipitation of p125FAKand paxillin was performed. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiment shown is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Effect of genistein and tyrphostin B56 on bombesin- or pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin. AR4-2J cells were preincubated in KRH buffer in the absence (- -) or presence of 100 μmgenistein (gen) or 100 μm tyrphostin B56 (tyr) for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, cells were left unstimulated (addition of a corresponding volume of vehicle; control (c)) or were stimulated by addition of 10 nmbombesin (bn) or 100 μm pervanadate (pv) for 15 min at 37 °C. After lysis of the cells, immunoprecipitation of p125FAK and paxillin was performed. Total cell lysates (A) and immunoprecipitates of paxillin (B) and of p125FAK (C) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-paxillin antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiment shown is representative of two (immunoprecipitation) and four (total cell lysates) separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of pervanadate on amylase secretion and tyrosine phosphorylation indicate that a tyrosine kinase is involved in these processes. We therefore tested the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on pervanadate- and bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion and on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4, 100 μm genistein reduced both pervanadate- and bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion to basal levels, whereas 100 μm tyrphostin B56 nearly completely inhibited basal and pervanadate- and bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion. Similarly, both genistein and tyrphostin B56 also reduced pervanadate-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation by ∼60 and 90%, respectively (Fig. 5 A), whereas bombesin-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced to basal phosphorylation by genistein and was completely blocked by tyrphostin B56. As shown in Fig. 5 B (upper panel), pervanadate-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was ∼39-fold of the control and was reduced by genistein and tyrphostin B56 by ∼70 and 90%, respectively, whereas bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was ∼14-fold of the control and was reduced to basal phosphorylation by genistein and was completely blocked by tyrphostin B56. The apparently lower content of paxillin, as detected with the anti-paxillin antibody, in immunoprecipitates of bombesin- and pervanadate-stimulated cells compared with that of control cells is likely due to the shift of paxillin (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). Densitometric scanning showed that the total amount of paxillin in the immunoprecipitates of stimulated cells was 82.5 and 135.7% after bombesin and pervanadate stimulation, respectively, compared with that of control cells. This indicates that the differences in the phosphotyrosine content of paxillin are due to different levels of phosphorylation and not to various amounts of protein (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). In the samples from genistein-treated cells, the amount of precipitated paxillin was about half of the control and was probably due to degradation of paxillin. Fig. 5 C shows that pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was 4-fold of the control and was reduced to basal levels by genistein and by ∼90% by tyrphostin B56. Bombesin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was 5-fold of the control and was also reduced to basal levels by genistein and was completely inhibited by tyrphostin B56. Since the anti-p125FAK antibody is not useful for immunoblot analysis, it was not possible to control the amounts of protein precipitated with this antibody. However, equal amounts of immunoglobulins in each lane detected by immunoblot analysis suggested that equal amounts of p125FAK had been precipitated. We compared the ability of various concentrations of genistein to inhibit bombesin-induced amylase secretion with its ability to decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin. As shown in Fig. 6, inhibition of bombesin-stimulated amylase release was detectable at ∼30 μm, half-maximal at 60 μm, and maximal at ∼150 μm. The dose-response relationship for inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin by genistein was similar. Inhibition was detectable at 20 μm, half-maximal at ∼50 μm, and maximal at 200 μm. Previous reports on rat pancreatic acinar cells suggest that tyrosine kinases are involved in the activation of phospholipase C induced by different secretagogues such as cholecystokinin, bombesin, or carbachol (12Piiper A. Stryjek-Kaminska D. Stein J. Caspary W.F. Zeuzem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G363-G371PubMed Google Scholar, 13Duan R.-D. Wagner A.C.C. Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G303-G310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test if pervanadate-stimulated amylase secretion is induced by pervanadate-mediated activation of phospholipase C, AR4-2J cells were treated with 100 μm or 1 mm pervanadate for 10 s to 50 min and with 10 nm bombesin for 15 s for comparison. Phospholipase C activity was determined by measurement of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. At no time could any significant change in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production be observed in response to pervanadate compared with the control, whereas bombesin increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels to ∼5-fold of the control (data not shown). It is well established that secretagogue-stimulated amylase secretion from rat pancreatic acinar cells is mediated by PKC (24Matozaki T. Zhu W.-Y. Tsunoda Y. Göke B. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G858-G864PubMed Google Scholar, 25Williams J.A. Blevins G.T. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 701-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To test if pervanadate-induced amylase release is also mediated by PKC activity and if a tyrosine kinase is involved in the PKC-activated pathway, the specific PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 (26Keller H.U.

As shown in Fig. 7 A, the time course of PMA-stimulated amylase secretion was nearly identical to that induced by pervanadate. Incubation of the cells with both PMA and pervanadate showed no higher stimulatory effect than with each component alone. Preincubation of AR4-2J cells with Ro 31-8220 inhibited PMA- and bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion by ∼80 and 50%, respectively, whereas secretion i"

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play an important role in skeletal development, fracture repair, and osteoblast function. The osteoblastic cell line MC3T3 was used to study the regulation of stromelysin-3 by FGF-2. Acutely, FGF-2 decreased stromelysin-3 mRNA levels, whereas prolonged treatment caused an induction of stromelysin-3 mRNA. RNA stability studies and nuclear run-off assays indicated that acute treatment with FGF-2 decreased stromelysin-3 mRNA stability but did not alter gene transcription. However, the induction of stromelysin-3 after prolonged treatment with FGF-2 resulted from increased gene transcription, with no effect on RNA stability. The stimulatory effect was protein synthesis-dependent, whereas the inhibitory effect was not. This study demonstrates dual regulation of stromelysin-3 by FGF-2: acute destabilization of stromelysin-3 mRNA, followed by induction of gene transcription. This complex regulation may be important in the function of stromelysin-3 in bone and in remodeling processes, such as wound and fracture repair.

This complex regulation may be important in the function of stromelysin-3 in bone and in remodeling processes, such as wound and fracture repair. Stromelysin-3 or matrix metalloproteinase-11 was originally cloned from stromal fibroblasts surrounding invasive breast cancer cells (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M.

Subsequently, it was found to be expressed by stromal cells surrounding other invasive carcinomas, including those of the lung, colon, and skin (2Anderson I.C. Sugarbaker D.J. Ganju R.K.

In addition, stromelysin-3 expression is associated with normal remodeling processes, such as wound healing, involuting mammary gland, and cycling endometrium (4Wolf C.

Osteen K.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Stromelysin-3 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme of ∼60 kDa. However, it differs from most members of the matrix metalloproteinase family in that the proenzyme is processed intracellularly by a furin-like enzyme within the Golgi apparatus, and the mature, processed ∼45-kDa enzyme is released from the cell (7Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The mature 45-kDa form of stromelysin-3 does not appear to cleave major extracellular matrix components. To date, the only characterized substrates for the enzyme are α1 proteinase inhibitor, a serine protease inhibitor, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; UTR, untranslated region; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; kb, kilobase. -binding protein-1, a regulator of IGF bioavailability (8Pei D.

In contrast, mature stromelysin-3 forms that lack the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain have stromelysin-like activity and are able to degrade casein and some extracellular matrix components, including laminin, fibronectin, and aggrecan (10Murphy G. Segain J.-P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15435-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the role of stromelysin-3 in remodeling processes involves the activities of both the intact mature form and proteolytically cleaved form of the enzyme. Stromelysin-3 transcripts were detected in osteogenic tissue of mouse embryos, suggesting that osteoblasts express the enzyme (11Lefebvre O. Regnier C. Chenard M.-P. Wendling C. Chambon P. Basset P. Rio M.-C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bone is a continuously remodeling tissue, and osteoblasts produce metalloproteinases in response to local and systemic growth factors and hormones. For example, systemic parathyroid hormone induces collagenase-3 in osteoblasts, as do local factors, including fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor α (12Partridge N.C.

In nonskeletal cells, stromelysin-3 is regulated by growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and FGF-2; however, the mechanisms responsible for this induction have not been reported (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). It is possible that such growth factors regulate stromelysin-3 expression in osteoblasts. In the skeleton, FGFs regulate development, fracture repair, and osteoblast function (16Kawaguchi H. Kurikawa T. Hanada K. Hiyama Y. Tamura M. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi T.P. Rossant J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). FGF-2 is a potent mitogen for cells of the osteoblastic lineage, and it represses the differentiated function of the cell (18Canalis E. Centrella M. McCarthy T. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). For example, FGF-2 represses type I collagen, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression in osteoblasts (19Hurley M.M. Abreu C. Harrison J.R. Lichtler A.C. Raisz L.G. Kream B.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 19934-19941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2 is expressed during fracture repair, and local administration of FGF-2 stimulates the repair process, suggesting a role in matrix remodeling (16Kawaguchi H. Kurikawa T. Hanada K. Hiyama Y. Tamura M. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The importance of FGFs in skeletal development is illustrated by the finding that loss or gain of function mutations in FGF receptors can lead to skeletal defects (21Jabs E.W. Li X. Scott A.F.

Because stromelysin-3 is expressed in areas of active remodeling and FGFs play a role in remodeling and repair in bone, we hypothesized that stromelysin-3 is expressed by osteoblasts and that it is regulated by FGF-2 in these cells. In the present study, cultures of the nontransformed murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 were used to characterize the mechanisms by which FGF-2 regulates stromelysin-3 expression in osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 is an osteogenic cell line derived from neonatal mouse calvaria. Early passage MC3T3 cells were cultured in α minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20 mm HEPES and 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnologies, Ft. Collins, CO) (24Sudo H. Kodama H-A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasa I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence, rinsed, and transferred to serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Fluka Chemical Corp, Ronkonkoma, NY) and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for 24 h. Cultures were then exposed to test or control medium in the absence of serum for 2–48 h. In cultures used for Western blot analysis, the medium did not contain bovine serum albumin and was harvested after the first 24 h of incubation, and the cells were then exposed to fresh medium for a second 24-h period. In all other cultures, the medium was not renewed. Primary cultures of mouse osteoblastic cells were isolated from parietal bones of neonatal CD-1 mice (25McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This procedure was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Parietal bones, dissected free of sutures, were subjected to five sequential 15-min digestions with bacterial collagenase (CLS II, Worthington Biochemical, Freehold, NJ). Cells harvested from digestions 3–5 were cultured as a pool at an initial plating density of approximately 10,000 cells/cm2. These cells have been demonstrated to have osteoblastic characteristics (25McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar,26Delany A.M. Canalis E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C734-C740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 20 mm HEPES, 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10% fetal bovine serum. When the cells reached confluence, approximately 1 week after plating, they were rinsed and transferred to serum-free medium for 24 h and then exposed to test or control medium for 2–48 h, without renewal of medium. Cycloheximide, indomethacin, and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) (Sigma) were dissolved in absolute ethanol, and at dilutions of <1:10,000, an equal amount of ethanol was added to control cultures. FGF-2 (Austral, San Ramon, CA) was dissolved in α minimum essential medium. Total cellular RNA was isolated with guanidine thiocyanate, at acid pH, followed by a phenol-chloroform (Sigma) extraction as described (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) or by using PUREscript RNA isolation kits (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MI). Equal amounts of RNA (15 μg) were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis through formaldehyde-agarose gels, and the RNA was blotted onto Gene Screen Plus as directed by the manufacturer (DuPont). A 1.6-kilobase (kb)SphI/SalI fragment of the mouse stromelysin-3 cDNA (provided by P. Basset, IGBMC, Illkirch, France) and a 750-base pair rat cyclophilin cDNA (provided by P. Danielson, La Jolla, CA) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont) by random primed second strand synthesis (Prime-A-Gene kit, Promega, Madison, WI) (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C.

Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 750 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.4% SDS (Sigma) (29Delany A.M. Jeffrey J.J. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26607-26612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Posthybridization washes were performed at 65 °C in 150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS. Autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometry, and stromelysin-3 mRNA levels were normalized to those of cyclophilin. Nuclei were isolated from confluent MC3T3 cells by Dounce homogenization in a Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Nascent transcripts were labeled by incubation of nuclei in a reaction buffer containing 500 μm each ATP, GTP, CTP, and RNasin (Promega) and 250 μCi of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mM, DuPont) (26Delany A.M. Canalis E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C734-C740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was isolated by treatment with DNase I and proteinase K, followed by ethanol precipitation. Linearized plasmid DNA containing approximately 1 μg of cDNA was immobilized onto GeneScreen Plus by slot blotting according to the manufacturer's directions (DuPont). cDNA for rat cyclophilin and 18S rRNA (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were used as controls for loading of the radiolabeled RNA (28Danielson P.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The plasmid vector pGEM5zf+ (Promega) was used as a control for nonspecific hybridization. Equal counts per minute of [32P]RNA from each sample were hybridized to cDNA using the same conditions as for Northern blot analysis and were visualized by autoradiography. Conditioned medium samples were stored at −80 °C after the addition of 0.1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween-20, Pierce), 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Prior to electrophoresis, 750-μl samples of conditioned medium were precipitated with 3.3% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in reducing Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% SDS. Proteins were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% gel and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and exposed to a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant human stromelysin-3 (provided by Dr. S. Weiss, Ann Arbor, MI) (9Manes S. Mira E. del Mar Barbacid M. Cipress A. Fernandez-Resa P. Buesa J.M. Merida I. Aracil M. Marquez G. Martinez A.C. J. Biol.

The membranes were then washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum, washed, and developed using a horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescent reagent (DuPont). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using Reflection x-ray film (DuPont). Slopes of RNA decay curves were analyzed by the method of Sokal and Rohlf (32Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. 2nd ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, CA1981Google Scholar). MC3T3 osteoblasts constitutively express a major stromelysin-3 transcript of approximately 2.2 kb, with a minor, slower mobility transcript of approximately 3.2 kb. The larger size transcript is observed primarily when the smaller size transcript is abundant. FGF-2 had two distinct effects on stromelysin-3 mRNA levels. FGF-2 at 30 ng/ml decreased stromelysin-3 transcripts after 2 h of treatment, and a decrease of 62 ± 1% (mean ± S.E.; n= 6) was observed after 6 h (Fig. 1). After 24 h of treatment, FGF-2 had a modest and variable effect on stromelysin-3 transcript levels, causing only a 6 ± 1% (n = 7) decrease (Fig. 1). After 48 h, FGF-2 increased stromelysin-3 transcripts 3.5 ± 0.4-fold (n = 6). Both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of FGF-2 on stromelysin-3 mRNA were dose-dependent, and the lowest effective dose tested was 1 ng/ml (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of FGF-2 at 1–50 ng/ml on stromelysin-3 mRNA expression in MC3T3 cells treated for 6 or 48 h. Total RNA from control (0) or treated cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis and hybridized with a32P-labeled stromelysin-3 cDNA (S3); the blot was stripped and hybridized with a labeled cyclophilin cDNA (cyclo). Transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. These results are representative of three cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Multiple stromelysin-3 protein species were detected by Western blot analysis of MC3T3 cell conditioned medium (Fig. 3). The mature form of stromelysin-3, lacking the propeptide, has a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa; however, the most abundant species present in the osteoblast conditioned medium had a molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa, probably representing a proteolytic fragment (7Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with FGF-2 for 24 h decreased the abundance of the 34-kDa fragment by 55 ± 2% (n = 3), whereas secretion of the 62-kDa species was modestly increased or unchanged. Treatment with FGF-2 for 48 h increased the level of 34-kDa stromelysin-3 species by approximately 8.4 ± 2.2-fold (n = 3), whereas the 62-kDa form was increased by a lesser extent. When the conditioned medium samples were concentrated using chloroform and methanol, rather than trichloroacetic acid, a similar distribution of stromelysin-3 species was observed, suggesting that fragmentation of stromelysin-3 was not due to acidification of the samples (Ref. 33Franchimont N. Rydziel S. Delany A.M. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12144-12150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and data not shown). These results indicate that changes in transcript levels are followed by changes in polypeptide levels. The inhibition of stromelysin-3 transcripts by FGF-2 after 6 h of treatment was observed in the presence and absence of 2 μg/ml cycloheximide (Fig. 4) (26Delany A.M. Canalis E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C734-C740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the recovery of stromelysin-3 mRNA levels in cells treated with FGF-2 for 24 h was prevented by cycloheximide (Fig. 4 A). In cells treated with cycloheximide for 48 h, stromelysin-3 transcripts were no longer detectable (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that the stimulatory effect of FGF-2 on stromelysin-3 mRNA expression is dependent on a new protein synthesis. Because FGF-2 stimulates prostaglandin production, and prostaglandin E2 increases stromelysin-3 mRNA levels, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin was used to determine whether prostaglandin synthesis played a role in the stimulatory effect of FGF-2 on stromelysin-3 (34Kawaguchi H. Pilbeam C.C. Gronowicz G. Abreu C. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Raisz L.G. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). 2A. M. Delany, unpublished data. Indomethacin had no effect on the stimulation of stromelysin-3 by FGF-2, suggesting a prostaglandin-independent mechanism (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effect of FGF-2 at 30 ng/ml, in the presence or absence of indomethacin at 10 μm, on stromelysin-3 mRNA expression in MC3T3 cells treated for 48 h. Total RNA from untreated cells or cells treated with FGF-2 or indomethacin (Indo) was subjected to Northern blot analysis and hybridized with a 32P-labeled stromelysin-3 cDNA (S3); the blot was stripped and hybridized with a labeled cyclophilin cDNA (cyclo). Transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. These results are representative of three cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether FGF-2 modified the stability of stromelysin-3 mRNA in osteoblasts, the RNA polymerase II-specific inhibitor DRB was used to arrest transcription, and the decay of stromelysin-3 mRNA was monitored by Northern blot analysis (25McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Zandomeni R. Bunick D. Ackerman S. Mittleman B. Weinmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 561-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In a first set of experiments, serum-deprived cultures were exposed to control medium or to 30 ng/ml FGF-2 for 1 h and then treated with 72 μm DRB for up to 5 h. In transcriptionally arrested osteoblasts, the half-life of stromelysin-3 mRNA was approximately 2.5 h, but in the presence of FGF-2, the stability of the transcript decreased by one-half, to approximately 1.25 h (Fig. 6, left panel). In a second set of experiments, serum-deprived cultures were exposed to control medium or to 30 ng/ml bFGF for 24 h and then treated with 72 μm DRB for up to 5 h. In these cultures, the half-life of stromelysin-3 mRNA was approximately 2.5 h, and the stability of the transcripts was not altered by treatment with FGF-2 (Fig. 6, right panel). These data indicate that destabilization of stromelysin-3 mRNA is an acute effect of FGF-2 and that this effect is no longer evident after 24 h of treatment with the growth factor. To determine whether there was a transcriptional component to the regulation of stromelysin-3 by FGF-2, nuclear run-off assays were performed. FGF-2 did not alter the rate of stromelysin-3 gene transcription after 2 (not shown) or 6 h of treatment. However, after 24 or 48 h, FGF-2 increased stromelysin-3 gene transcription 1.8–3-fold (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the acute FGF-2-mediated decrease in stromelysin-3 mRNA is due to a decrease in metalloproteinase transcript stability, and the increase in stromelysin-3 mRNA observed after 48 h of treatment is due to an increase in gene transcription.Figure 7Effect of FGF-2 at 30 ng/ml on stromelysin-3 gene transcription in MC3T3 cells treated for 6, 24, or 48 h.Nuclei were isolated from control or FGF-2-treated cells. Nascent transcripts were labeled in vitro with [32P]UTP, and the labeled RNA was hybridized to immobilized cDNA for stromelysin-3 (S3), cyclophilin (cyclo), and 18S rRNA (18S). pGEM5zf+ vector DNA (pGEM) was used as a control for nonspecific hybridization. The top panel represents 16 h of autoradiography, and the bottom panel, showing hybridization to 18S cDNA, represents 1 h of autoradiography. These results are representative of three cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that the regulation of stromelysin-3 by FGF-2 was not a cell line-specific phenomenon, primary cultures of osteoblastic cells were prepared from neonatal mouse calvaria. Similar to the MC3T3 cell line, primary osteoblastic cells express two stromelysin-3 transcripts, and acute treatment with FGF-2 at 30 ng/ml decreased stromelysin-3 mRNA levels, whereas 48 h treatment with FGF-2 increased stromelysin-3 mRNA (Fig. 8). Although stromelysin-3 was first found expressed by stromal fibroblasts surrounding invasive breast cancer cells, it was subsequently found to be expressed in other nonpathological remodeling processes. This study confirms that cultured osteoblasts constitutively express stromelysin-3 (10Murphy G. Segain J.-P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15435-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both MC3T3 cells and primary cultures of murine osteoblasts express a major stromelysin-3 transcript of approximately 2.2 kb and a minor transcript of approximately 3.2 kb. Presently, it is difficult to determine whether the 3.2-kb transcript represents a gene product closely related to stromelysin-3 or whether it is due to the use of alternative transcription initiation sites, splicing, or polyadenylation. Others have not detected the minor transcript in human fibroblastic cells or in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the 3.2-kb stromelysin-3 transcript may be cell type-specific (36Guerin E. Ludwig M.-G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,37Noel A.C. Lefebvre O. Maquoi E. VanHoorde L. Chenard M.P. Mareel M. Foidart J.-M. Basset P. Rio M.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1924-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cultured murine osteoclasts can express gelatinases and membrane type matrix metalloproteinase-1; however, preliminary studies indicate that they do not express stromelysin-3 (38Sato T. del Carmen Ovejero M. Hou P. Heegaard A.-M. Kumegawa M. Foged N.T. Delaisse J.-M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 589-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,39Tezuka K. Nemoto K. Tezuka Y. Sato T. Ikeda Y. Kobori M. Kawashima H. Eguchi H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15006-15009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 This also suggests cell type-specific expression of stromelysin-3 in bone. FGFs are important regulators of osteoblast gene expression. They play a role in skeletal development and fracture repair, events associated with extracellular matrix remodeling (16Kawaguchi H. Kurikawa T. Hanada K. Hiyama Y. Tamura M. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi T.P. Rossant J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our data reveal a complex regulation of stromelysin-3 by FGF-2 in osteoblasts. Acutely, FGF-2 decreases stromelysin-3 mRNA and protein expression by decreasing the stability of the transcript. Nuclear run-off data failed to demonstrate a transcriptional component to this down-regulation, indicating that the reduction in stromelysin-3 RNA stability alone accounts for the decrease in steady-state mRNA levels. Down-regulation of stromelysin-3 mRNA by FGF-2 is independent of protein synthesis, suggesting a direct effect of the growth factor. FGF receptors are ligand-activated tyrosine kinases (40Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It is possible that changes in protein phosphorylation resulting from the activation of the FGF receptor alters the activity of stromelysin-3 RNA-binding proteins and causes a decrease in RNA stability. It is suggested that the activity of several RNA-binding proteins is regulated by changes in protein phosphorylation. In particular, protein kinase C pathways are implicated in regulating the activity of ferritin and RNA-binding proteins associated with urokinase-type plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor, and ribonucleotide reductase component R2 transcripts (41Nanbu R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Amara F.M. Sun J. Wright J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20222-20229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Such RNA-binding proteins could be nucleases or proteins that protect the transcript from degradation. Frequently, sequences contained in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA are associated with the regulation of transcript stability. For example, AU-rich elements within the collagenase-1 3′-UTR play a role in destabilizing the collagenase mRNA (44Vincenti M.P. Coon C.I. Lee O. Brinckerhoff C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4818-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Like collagenase-1, collagenase-3 and stromelysin-1 can be regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms, and the 3′-UTRs of these transcripts contain AU-rich sequences (29Delany A.M. Jeffrey J.J. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26607-26612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 45Delany A.M. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). AU-rich motifs are important in the destabilization of short-lived cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs and are implicated in increasing stability of the transcripts in response to cytokines (46Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 161-215Crossref Google Scholar). In transcriptionally arrested osteoblasts, collagenase-3 mRNA has a longer half-life than stromelysin-3 mRNA (29Delany A.M. Jeffrey J.J. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26607-26612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the stromelysin-3 3′-UTR does not contain classical AU-rich motifs seen in the 3′-UTR of collagenase-1 or collagenase-3 (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the mechanisms regulating the stability of stromelysin-3 mRNA differ from those regulating collagenase-3 or other metalloproteinase mRNAs containing AU-rich motifs. Nuclear run-off assays indicate that FGF-2 stimulates stromelysin-3 gene transcription after 24 and 48 h of treatment. The delayed induction of stromelysin-3 mRNA by FGF-2 and the ability of cycloheximide to block the induction suggest that the phenomenon is a secondary effect of the growth factor. It is possible that the transcriptional increase is mediated by a newly synthesized, FGF-2-regulated protein. For example, one transcription factor known to be induced by FGF is c-Jun (47Okazaki R. Ikeda K. Sakamoto A. Nakano T. Morimoto K. Urakawa K. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To date, only the human stromelysin-3 promoter has been cloned and characterized. The proximal promoter lacks a functional AP-1 (Fos/Jun binding) site; therefore, c-Jun may not have direct action on the stromelysin-3 promoter (36Guerin E. Ludwig M.-G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 48Anglard P. Melot T. Guerin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The lack of a functional AP-1 site and the presence of a DR1 type retinoic acid responsive element are some of the characteristics that make the human stromelysin-3 promoter different from other matrix metalloproteinase genes (36Guerin E. Ludwig M.-G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 48Anglard P. Melot T. Guerin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar to collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1, the stromelysin-3 promoter contains a PEA-3 site, which could potentially bind members of the c-Ets family of transcription factors. In contrast to these metalloproteinases, this site does not appear to be functional because a promoter fragment containing the PEA3 motif is not transactivated by c-Ets-1 (48Anglard P. Melot T. Guerin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Identification of the DNA elements necessary for transcriptional induction by FGF-2 could provide insight into the regulation of stromelysin-3 in development and wound or fracture repair. Western blot analysis of osteoblast conditioned medium showed little intact, mature stromelysin-3, whereas the most abundant form was a 34-kDa species. This 34-kDa species may lack the hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (49Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M.-C. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Stromelysin-3 peptides lacking the hemopexin-like domain have been shown to have stromelysin-like activities (10Murphy G. Segain J.-P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15435-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a 35-kDa stromelysin-3 species was purified from FGF-2 treated tumor/stroma cocultures (50Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning Y.Y. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This 35-kDa stromelysin-3 is cleaved at the N-terminal end and lacks a portion of the catalytic domain, suggesting that it lacks the metalloproteinase activity associated with the intact enzyme. The generation of the 35-kDa stromelysin-3 requires the presence of FGF-2 and is thought to involve a matrix metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism (50Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning Y.Y. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the 34-kDa stromelysin-3 found in cultured osteoblasts may be truncated at the N terminus, although this peptide is observed in the presence and absence of exogenous FGF-2. However, endogenous FGFs may be present because osteoblasts can secrete FGFs and store them in their matrix (51Globus R.K. Plouet J. Gospodarowicz D. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The function of stromelysin-3 in bone is not yet defined. Stromelysin-1 and -2 are not constitutively expressed by normal osteoblasts; in contrast, stromelysin-3 is constitutively expressed (15Rifas L. Fausto A. Scott M.J. Avioli L.V. Welgus H.G. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).2Because forms of stromelysin-3 that lack the hemopexin-like domain have activities similar to that of other stromelysins, cleaved stromelysin-3 may provide stromelysin-like activity to the bone environment (10Murphy G. Segain J.-P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15435-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through its ability to degrade serine proteinase inhibitors, stromelysin-3 may potentiate the matrix degradation cascade in remodeling, because serine proteinases can activate other matrix metalloproteinases, such as collagenases and stromelysins 1 and 2 (52Matrisian L.M. Hogan B.L.M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1990; 24: 219-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Indeed, hormonal regulation of stromelysin-3 appears to be important in normal remodeling processes. For example, stromelysin-3 is induced by thyroid hormone in the metamorphosing intestine of the frogXenopus laevis. Its expression peaks at the metamorphic climax, in concert with endogenous thyroid hormone levels (53Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, stromelysin-3 synthesis is repressed by progesterone in endometrial cells. In cycling human endometrium, stromelysin-3 expression is high in the proliferative and menstrual phases (when tissue growth and remodeling occurs and progesterone levels are low) (6Rodgers W.H. Matrisian L.M. Giudice L.C. Dsupin B. Svitek C. Gorstein F. Osteen K.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In addition, stromelysin-3 can affect growth factor activity through its degradation of IGF-binding protein-1, a protein that limits IGF I bioavailability (9Manes S. Mira E. del Mar Barbacid M. Cipress A. Fernandez-Resa P. Buesa J.M. Merida I. Aracil M. Marquez G. Martinez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25706-25712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). IGF I has important anabolic effects on bone. It stimulates cell proliferation and collagen synthesis while decreasing the expression of collagenase-3 (54Delany A.M. Canalis E. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease.in: LeRoith D. Bondy C. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1997Google Scholar). It is probable that stromelysin-3, like collagenase and stromelysin, can degrade IGF-binding proteins that are important in bone (55Fowlkes J.L. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Thrailkill K.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2810-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 56Thrailkill K.M. Quarles L.D. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Serra D.L. Fowlkes J.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other proteins found abundantly in bone, such as noncollagenous extracellular matrix components, may also be target substrates for stromelysin-3. Breast cancer cells preferentially metastasize to bone, and it is suggested that stromelysin-3 contributes to the survival of tumor cells outside their compartment of origin (37Noel A.C. Lefebvre O. Maquoi E. VanHoorde L. Chenard M.P. Mareel M. Foidart J.-M. Basset P. Rio M.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1924-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is possible that the ability of breast cancer cells to flourish in the bone environment is due, in part, to the constitutive expression of stromelysin-3 by osteoblasts. In conclusion, we find dual regulation of stromelysin-3 by FGF-2 in osteoblasts. The FGF-2-mediated decrease in metalloproteinase mRNA levels is due to transcript destabilization, whereas the subsequent increase in mRNA levels is due to transcriptional induction. Further characterization of stromelysin-3 substrates and the regulation of its expression by growth factors and cytokines will clarify the function of this enzyme in bone and in pathologic processes.

This ability, however, is suppressed by Mos proteins and maturation/mitosis promoting factor during the second meiosis phase (meiosis II; MII) until fertilization. Inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D during early MI prevented induction of the replication ability, but did not interfere with initiation of the meiotic cell cycle progression characterized by oscillation of the maturation/mitosis promoting factor activity and germinal vesicle breakdown. Microinjection of recombinant proteins such as dominant-negative E2F or universal Cdk inhibitors, p21 and p27, but not wild type human E2F-1 or Cdk4-specific inhibitor, p19, into maturing oocytes during MI abolished induction of the DNA replication ability. Co-injection of human E2F-1 and cyclin E proteins into immature oocytes allowed them to initiate DNA replication even in the absence of progesterone treatment. Injection of cyclin E alone, which was sufficient to activate endogenous Cdk2 kinase, failed to induce DNA replication. Moreover, the activation of Cdk2 was not affected under the conditions where DNA replication was blocked by actinomycin D. Thus, like somatic cells, both activities of E2F and cyclin E-Cdk2 complex are required for induction of the DNA replication ability in maturing Xenopus oocytes, and enhancement of both activities enables oocytes to override DNA-replication inhibitory mechanisms that specifically lie in maturing oocytes.

In Xenopus, fully grown oocytes are naturally arrested at the first meiotic prophase and progesterone (PG) reinitiates maturation (1Masui Y. Clarke H.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 57: 185-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). PG stimulation of oocytes induces synthesis of Mos proteins and activates MPF (5Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), which causes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and progression through the first M phase of the meiotic cell cycle (meiosis I (MI)) (1Masui Y. Clarke H.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 57: 185-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 3Masui Y. Markert C.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). MPF activity falls after GVBD, and rises again to initiate the second M phase (meiosis II (MII)) (6Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Gerhart J. Wu M. Kirschner M. J. Cell. Biol. 1984; 98: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Meiosis is arrested again at MII with high MPF activity. Fertilization down-regulates MPF activity, triggering entry into S phase, and thereby allowing matured eggs to start the early embryonic cell cycle (1Masui Y. Clarke H.J. Int. Rev.

During maturation, protein expression is mostly regulated at the translational level (7Gerhart J. Wu M. Kirschner M. J. Cell.

Cell Res. 1975; 91: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) by polyadenylation of the pre-existing mRNAs (12Stebbins-Boaz B. Hake L.E. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2582-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), or by unmasking translationally silent mRNAs (13Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Inhibition of transcription has little effect on activation of MPF and initiation of meiotic maturation in response to PG (10Brachet J. Baltus E. de Schutter A. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Hubert E. Iacobelli S. Steinert G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1974; 3: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Curr. Top. Dev.

Therefore, although relatively high levels of transcription (mostly of rRNA) occur during MI (16LaMarca M.J. Fidler M.C. Smith L.D. Keem K. Dev. Biol. 1975; 47: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Webb A.C. LaMarca M.J. Smith L.D. Dev. Biol. 1975; 45: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), this has been assumed simply to enable enough RNA to accumulate for early embryonic development. Although no chromosomal DNA replication actually occurs duringXenopus oocyte maturation, the ability to induce DNA replication develops in the late MI phase some time after GVBD in response to PG (18Benbow R.M. Ford C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2437-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Gurdon J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and is suppressed by Mos proteins and MPF until fertilization (6Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MPF re-activation after GVBD by cycloheximide (CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor), antisense oligonucleotides to Mos or dominant-negative Cdc2 prevents maturing oocytes from progressing into MII, but, in turn, allows them to initiate semi-conservative and aphidicolin (APD, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase α)-sensitive DNA replication (6Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The factors and molecular mechanisms involved in induction of the DNA replication ability are poorly understood. In the somatic cell cycle of higher eukaryotes, S phase entry is governed by a variety of regulators of G1 phase progression (20Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar, 21Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar), whose expressions are mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. Two types of G1 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes (cyclin D-Cdk4 or Cdk6, and cyclin E-Cdk2) promote G1 progression by phosphorylating key substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (22Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated form of pRb binds to a family of heterodimeric transcription factors, collectively termed the E2Fs (23Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar), and represses expression of E2F target genes. Phosphorylation of pRb by G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes in late G1 frees these E2Fs, enabling them to transactivate the same genes (24Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar). The E2F-inducible genes include the cyclin E gene (25Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), thereby creating a positive feedback loop between E2F and cyclin E (cyclin E-Cdk2 complex) allowing a rapid rise of both activities as cells approach the G1/S boundary. In addition, recent findings suggest that E2F and cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase have their own pathways to promote S phase entry (26DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activities of G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes are negatively regulated by two groups of proteins collectively termed Cdk inhibitors (28Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar). The Cip/Kip family of Cdk inhibitors (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) bind to cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin D-Cdk6, cyclin E-Cdk2, and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes and inhibit their protein kinase activities. INK4 family members (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) specifically target cyclin D-dependent kinases (Cdk4 and Cdk6). Both types of Cdk inhibitors are induced or activated in response to a variety of anti-proliferative stimuli such as DNA damage, contact inhibition, transforming growth factor-β, cell senescence, or terminal differentiation, and arrest cells in G1. In this paper, we addressed whether any of the G1regulators of the somatic cell cycle participate in induction of the replication ability in late MI during Xenopus oocyte maturation, focusing particularly on E2F transcription factor. Our findings suggest that, as in the somatic cell cycle, both E2F and cyclin E-Cdk2 activities were required and sufficient to induce DNA replication. However, Cdk2 activation by exogenous cyclin E was not sufficient to initiate DNA replication, suggesting that E2F functions other than activating cyclin E promoter play an important role in S phase induction. Ovaries were manually dissected and treated with collagenase (2 mg/ml) to remove follicle cells as described (29Gurdon J.B. Wickens M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 370-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Stage VI oocytes were induced to mature by addition of PG (5 μg/ml). GVBD, which usually occurred 2–4 h after PG stimulation, was first judged by the appearance of a white spot and was confirmed by cutting boiled eggs in half with a razor blade. In some cases, oocytes were treated with CHX (100 μg/ml), AMD (100 μg/ml in most experiments unless otherwise noted in the figures), or APD (20 μg/ml) at the times indicated in the figures. Oocytes were microinjected before PG stimulation with 36.8 nl of a solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing [α-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and purified recombinant proteins (see below). Basically [α-32P]dCTP-preinjected oocytes were stimulated with PG, treated with CHX 1 h after GVBD, and incubated another 3 h. Individually labeled single oocytes were mixed with 14 non-treated oocytes and homogenized in the presence of proteinase K (10 μg/ml). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, high molecular weight DNAs were extracted, separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and analyzed with a Fuji BAS-2000 image analyzer. In some inhibition experiments, the mixture of [α-32P]dCTP and recombinant proteins was injected immediately before PG stimulation. To examine the effect of recombinant proteins on induction of DNA replication, CHX treatment was omitted. To inhibit DNA polymerase α activity, APD was added after injection. For kinetic analyses, oocytes were injected as quickly as possible, and sampled at the indicated times. Relative incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP into chromosomal DNA was determined with a Fuji BAS-2000 image analyzer. All recombinant proteins, except for p27, were made and purified as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. DN-E2F consists of only the DNA-binding domain of human E2F-1 (30Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Harter M.L. Stine J.T. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2605-2612PubMed Google Scholar) and other fusion constructs contain the entire coding sequences. As for E2F-1, DP-1, cyclin D1, and p21, each of the cDNAs was cloned into the pGEX vector (Pharmacia). Other GST fusion constructs were as described previously (30Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Harter M.L. Stine J.T. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2605-2612PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.-y. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 32Kato J.-y. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), or gifts from other investigators. GST fusion proteins were induced to express in bacteria with 0.25 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 h at 18 °C, purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography, and eluted with 100 mm glutathione. p27 was expressed as a 6 × histidine-tagged protein in bacteria (33Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) under the same inductive conditions as GST fusions, absorbed onto Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and eluted with 100 mm EDTA and 250 mm imidazole. Eluted samples were extensively dialyzed to remove glutathione, EDTA, or imidazole. In some cases, especially for GST-E2F-1, the recombinant proteins were further purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography. Because truncated GST-E2F-1 proteins contain a DNA-binding domain but not a transactivation domain, it inhibited the function of full-length E2F-1 as a dominant-negative mutant. As for GST-p21 and GST-DN-E2F, further purification accelerated their degradation and did not improve recovery of the intact proteins. Therefore, we did not go through further purification steps for these two. All recombinant proteins were concentrated by pressure filtration in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Purified recombinant proteins retained their specific activities (e.g. Cdk inhibitory activity, DNA binding activity, etc.) as far as we and others determined, indicating that fusion to GST or 6 × histidine tag did not alter the specific functions at least as assayed in vitro. Injections were performed under conditions where the final concentrations of each recombinant protein in Xenopus oocytes did not exceed 5-fold those in proliferating NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Note that elevated expression of Cdk inhibitors by 3–5-fold was just sufficient to arrest proliferating NIH 3T3 cells in G1. The stability of recombinant proteins inXenopus oocytes was tested as follows. GST fusion proteins were injected into immature oocytes and were recovered after 4 h by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. More than 80% of the proteins were rescued, suggesting that injected recombinant proteins were relatively stable in oocytes. Individual single oocytes treated with various reagents were homogenized on ice in 50 μl of extraction buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Extracts were incubated with rabbit antiserum to Xenopus Cdk2 (34Furuno N. Ogawa Y. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) for 1 h on ice, mixed with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, washed with low and high salt buffers (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and either 100 mm or 1 mNaCl, respectively), and finally washed with Cdk2 kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) as described previously (35Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were incubated in 25 μl of Cdk2 kinase buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml histone H1, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.12 mCi/ml) at 25 °C for 20 min. Phosphorylated histone H1 was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified for32P incorporation by a Fuji BAS-2000 image analyzer. For MPF kinase assay, 5 μl of oocyte extracts (equivalent to 0.1 oocyte) was incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mg/ml histone H1, 62.5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.15 mCi/ml) at 25 °C for 15 min. The samples were analyzed as described above. The DNA replication capability is induced in late MI some time after GVBD during Xenopusoocyte maturation, but is masked by Mos proteins and MPF activity through MII until fertilization (6Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To visualize the DNA replication ability, we chose to use CHX to block protein synthesis after GVBD. This treatment hampers MPF re-activation and progression to MII (7Gerhart J. Wu M. Kirschner M. J. Cell. Biol. 1984; 98: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and, instead, allows maturing oocytes to incorporate preinjected [α-32P]dCTP into chromosomal DNA (6Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis induced by CHX represents replication rather than repair because it is sensitive to APD and occurs only once in a semi-conservative manner (6Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To know the exact timing of CHX treatment for the efficient induction of DNA replication, we added CHX before GVBD (at intervals of 1 h after PG stimulation) or after GVBD (at intervals of 15 min) to PG-stimulated oocytes that had been preinjected with [α-32P]dCTP. High molecular weight DNAs were extracted from oocytes 4 h after GVBD and separated in an agarose gel (Fig. 1 A). The results clearly indicate that new proteins accumulated until 15 min after GVBD are required for induction of the chromosomal DNA replication ability, while synthesis of mitochondrial DNAs was constitutive and was minimally affected by CHX. We decided to treat oocytes with CHX 1 h after GVBD in the following experiments. Although vigorous transcription (mostly of rRNA) occurs during MI, transcription is thought not to be required for initiation of meiotic maturation (14Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1970; 5: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Ziegler D. Masui Y. J. Cell. Biol. 1976; 68: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16LaMarca M.J. Fidler M.C. Smith L.D. Keem K. Dev. Biol. 1975; 47: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Webb A.C. LaMarca M.J. Smith L.D. Dev. Biol. 1975; 45: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We asked whether RNA synthesis might be involved in induction of the replication ability and examined the effect of AMD on CHX-induced DNA replication in PG-stimulated oocytes. When AMD was added to [α-32P]dCTP-preinjected oocytes at the same time as PG stimulation, no DNA replication was induced by CHX (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–5, for data from individual oocytes). Titration experiments indicated that the minimum concentration required for inhibition of CHX-induced DNA replication was 80 μg/ml (lanes 8–11). To exclude the possibility that AMD might bind to DNA and prevent replication itself, we treated oocytes with AMD (100 μg/ml) after GVBD at the same time as CHX and incubated them for an additional 4 h (lanes 17–19). Since CHX treatment initiates DNA replication approximately 2–3 h after GVBD (Ref. 6Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar and data not shown), there should be enough time for AMD to access chromosomal DNA. The results show that addition of AMD after GVBD had little inhibitory effect on CHX-induced DNA replication, suggesting that AMD did not directly inhibit DNA replication itself, and that early MI-specific transcription is required for induction of the replication ability. In fact, the inhibitory effect was somewhat more distinct when AMD was added in early rather than in mid MI (data not shown). In addition, another inhibitor of transcription, α-amanitin, also prevented induction of the replication ability when added in early MI (data not shown), supporting this conclusion. One explanation of efficient inhibition of CHX-induced DNA replication by AMD is that transcriptional blockade interferes with initiation or progression of oocyte maturation itself. To test this possibility, we examined GVBD and fluctuation of MPF activities in oocytes stimulated with PG in the presence or absence of AMD. When oocytes were treated with PG, they exhibited a white spot, a mark of GVBD, 2–4 h after stimulation even in the presence of AMD (100 μg/ml) and the kinetics were indistinguishable with or without AMD (Fig. 2 A). To confirm that GVBD had certainly occurred, oocytes displaying a white spot were boiled and cut in half with a razor blade. Fig. 2 B shows that GV disappeared in oocytes treated with PG and AMD. In a control experiment, oocytes simultaneously treated with PG and CHX at the same time retained the GV intact (7Gerhart J. Wu M. Kirschner M. J. Cell. Biol. 1984; 98: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 10Brachet J. Baltus E. de Schutter A. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Hubert E. Iacobelli S. Steinert G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1974; 3: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Wasserman W.J. Masui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 91: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Oocytes stimulated with PG alone or together with AMD were harvested at intervals of 1 h after GVBD and the MPF activities in their individual extracts were measured. As shown in Fig. 2 C, AMD treatment had little effect on activation of MPF and its fluctuation. Therefore, inhibition of transcription during MI did not affect progression of the meiotic cell cycle under the conditions where induction of the DNA replication ability was prevented. Since we did not perform cytological analysis, we were unable to exclude the possibility that transcription during MI is required for chromosome condensation and/or spindle formation. Transcription factors, E2Fs (E2F/DP heterodimers), are well known to govern the transition from G1 to S phase in the somatic cell cycle of higher eukaryotes (23Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the DNA replication ability induced during Xenopus oocyte maturation is dependent upon the functions mediated by E2Fs. To suppress all of the E2F activities contained in oocytes, we utilized a dominant-negative E2F (DN-E2F) protein consisting of only the DNA-binding domain of human E2F-1, which has been previously shown to inhibit S phase entry when introduced into mammalian cells (30Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Harter M.L. Stine J.T. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2605-2612PubMed Google Scholar). We also used several Cdk inhibitory proteins (28Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar) to test whether any of the G1cyclin-Cdk (cyclin D-Cdk4 or Cdk6, and cyclin E-Cdk2) activities, which are also well known to govern G1/S transition (22Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar), are involved in this process. When immature oocytes were injected with recombinant proteins and subsequently treated with PG, DN-E2F very effectively prevented CHX-induced DNA replication (Fig. 3,lane 9), suggesting that certain functions (most probably induction of specific mRNA transcription) mediated by an E2F-like factor contained in Xenopus oocytes is required for induction of the DNA replication ability. Injection of wild-type E2F-1 (E2F-1) had no inhibitory effect (lane 8), precluding the possibility that injection of DNA-binding proteins nonspecifically inhibited DNA replication. The pRb, a negative regulator for some family members of E2F transcription factors (mammalian E2F-1, -2, and -3, but not E2F-4 or -5) (24Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar) did not prevent replication under these conditions (lane 7). We do not yet know whether human pRb is capable of binding to and suppressing Xenopus E2Fs. Or, alternatively, oocytes might express a different set of E2Fs which are free from restraint by pRb. Cloning and characterization ofXenopus E2Fs expressed in oocytes are required to elucidate this matter. Among Cdk inhibitors, p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, but not p19INK4a, efficiently prevented induction of replication (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6). Since a high dose of p27Kip1 (p21Cip1 as well) is capable of inhibiting MPF activity and thereby preventing GVBD and progression through oocyte maturation, we had performed a series of preliminary experiments and titrated the amount of recombinant Cdk inhibitory proteins. The dosage of Cdk inhibitory proteins used in Fig. 3 was low enough not to show any inhibitory effect on MPF and GVBD. As a matter of fact, oocytes injected with this amount of Cdk inhibitors initiated and progressed through meiotic maturation (data not shown) (34Furuno N. Ogawa Y. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As it is well known that p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 inhibit Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 activities and that p19INK4a is specific for cyclin D-dependent kinases, Cdk4 and -6 (28Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar), these results suggest that CHX-induced replication requires Cdk2 but not Cdk4 kinase activities. Taken together, these findings suggest that the function (most probably transcription) mediated by an E2F-like factor together with the activity of Cdk2, but not of Cdk4 or -6, is required to induce DNA replication ability during MI. We injected recombinant E2F components and G1 cyclins separately or in combinations into immature oocytes together with [α-32P]dCTP and activated them with PG to examine their effects on induction of DNA replication without CHX treatments (Fig. 4 A). Wild type E2F-1 or DP-1 alone showed marginally higher efficiencies in inducing 32P incorporation into chromosomal DNA compared with GST control, while co-injection of E2F-1 and DP-1 allowed approximately half of the injected oocytes to initiate DNA replication. Higher dose of E2F-1 alone did not improve the efficiency, suggesting that although expression of the E2F family gene is rate-limiting for activation of the heterodimeric E2F/DP transcription factors in somatic cells, both E2F and DP subunits might be limited in Xenopusoocytes. Alternatively, mammalian E2F componen"
https://openalex.org/W2040243072,"We used an approach of protein surface epitope mapping by synthetic peptides to analyze the surface structure-function relationship of the CD8 protein. Small synthetic peptide mimics of the CD8 DE loop were shown to effectively block CD8 binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and possess significant inhibitory activity onin vitroCD8+ T cell function. These results suggested that the DE loop region of the CD8 protein is an important functional epitope mediating CD8-MHC class I interaction and the activation of CD8+ T cells, a finding that is consistent with the recently reported crystal structure of the CD8-MHC class I complex. The structural basis for the biological activity of the DE loop peptide was further analyzed in a series of analogs containing alanine substitutions. This study provides support for the concept of bioactive peptide design based on protein surface epitopes and suggests that such an approach may be applicable to other protein-protein complexes, particularly those of immunoglobulin superfamily molecules.

These results suggested that the DE loop region of the CD8 protein is an important functional epitope mediating CD8-MHC class I interaction and the activation of CD8+ T cells, a finding that is consistent with the recently reported crystal structure of the CD8-MHC class I complex. The structural basis for the biological activity of the DE loop peptide was further analyzed in a series of analogs containing alanine substitutions. This study provides support for the concept of bioactive peptide design based on protein surface epitopes and suggests that such an approach may be applicable to other protein-protein complexes, particularly those of immunoglobulin superfamily molecules.

Recently, we have used the CD4 protein, a member of IgSF, as a model system to demonstrate two distinct yet complementary strategies for the development of small molecular modulators of IgSF functions, the bioactive peptide design based on IgSF protein surface epitopes and a computer screening approach to IgSF structures and interactions (4Li S.

In an effort to further test the general utility of these drug design approaches for other IgSF molecules, we have applied these techniques to the CD8 protein to analyze its surface structure-function relationship and develop small synthetic peptide inhibitors of CD8 function. Human CD8 (hCD8) is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of T cells that have specificity for antigens presented by MHC class I proteins, found on most tissue types (8Swain S.L. Immunol. Rev. 1983; 74: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The hCD8 exists as a disulfide-linked αα homodimer and αβ heterodimer. Both hCD8α- and β-chains contain an amino-terminal immunoglobulin(Ig)-like extracellular domain and a transmembrane cytoplasmic segment (9Norment A.M. Littman D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Littman D.R. Thomas Y. Maddon P.J. Chess L. Axel R.

MHC class I is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that consists of an α-chain, with three extracellular domains (designated α1, α2, and α3) and a transmembrane cytoplasmic domain (13Tykocinski M.L. Marche P.N. Max E.E. Kindt T.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2261-2269PubMed Google Scholar) associated with a β2-microglobulin (β2m). The hCD8 protein is known to mediate two critical functions: 1) it can act as a co-receptor with the T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen by binding to the MHC class I molecule on the antigen-presenting cell, thereby increasing the avidity of the TCR for its ligand (14Norment A.M.

Nature. 1989; 338: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar); and 2) it has signal transduction capabilities, as studies have indicated that the cytoplasmic tail of hCD8 is associated with the Src-like tyrosine kinase p56Lck (18Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). CD8+ T cells are key components of the protective immune response to infectious pathogens, functioning as cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) and as important sources of cytokines, including interferon γ. However, CD8+ T cells are also involved in deleterious responses related to cellular and organ transplantation reactions. For this reason, small molecular agents that regulate the activity of these CD8+ T cells may have important clinical applications. In general, it is believed that the surface binding sites of Ig-related molecules involve a combination of three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) (19Colman P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1988; 43: 99-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Mutational and synthetic peptide studies of CD8 have demonstrated the involvement of the CDR loops in MHC class I recognition (20Sanders S.K. Giblin P.A. Kavathas P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Giblin P.A. Leahy D.J. Mennone J. Kavathas P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, the roles of other surface regions of the CD8 molecule are less well defined, and it has been suggested that the side of the molecule containing the A and B strands (21Giblin P.A. Leahy D.J. Mennone J. Kavathas P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1716-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) may also be important for MHC class I interaction. A similar observation was made in the CD4 protein, where the CC′ loop located on the side of the molecule formed an integrated binding pocket with other CDR loops located on the top face (6Li S. Gao J. Satoh T. Friedman T. Edling A. Koch U. Choksi S. Han X. Korngold R. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Zhang X. Gaubin M.

To test this hypothesis in relation to the potential functional role of CD8 surface regions other than the CDR loops, in the present study we used an approach of protein surface epitope mapping with small conformationally constrained peptides mimicking various protein surface loops as specific probes of the structure-function of the corresponding sites in the native molecule. This strategy had been previously useful in identifying new functional surfaces of the CD4 protein (5Satoh T. Aramini J.M. Li S. Friedman T.M. Gao J. Edling A. Townsend R. Germann M.W. Korngold R. Huang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12175-12180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Satoh T. Li S. Friedman T.M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Korngold R. Huang Z. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A theoretical analysis to search for surface protruding regions as potential candidates for hCD8α functional epitopes was initially carried out based on the assumption that these highly exposed sites are most likely to be able to participate in molecular recognition. This was followed by the design, synthesis, and biological assay of peptides that may mimic putative binding sites. The results from these studies suggested that the DE loop, together with other well studied CDR loops, were involved in the binding to MHC class I molecules and the activation of CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, the proposed role of the DE loop in mediating CD8 function was consistent with the recently reported crystal structure of the CD8-MHC class I complex (24Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Of most importance, the peptide analogs derived from the CD8 DE loop, as described here, may represent promising leads for the further development of novel immunotherapeutic agents. The peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis using Fmoc strategy on a 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a 9050 Pepsynthesizer Plus (Perseptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA), as described previously (5Satoh T. Aramini J.M. Li S. Friedman T.M. Gao J. Edling A. Townsend R. Germann M.W. Korngold R. Huang Z. J. Biol.

A 4-fold excess of Nα-Fmoc amino acid,O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, and a 10-fold excess of diisopropylethylamine were used in every coupling reaction step. Removal of the NH2-terminal Fmoc group was accomplished by 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. The cleavage of peptides from the resin was carried out with reagent K (25King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature with gentle stirring. Crude peptides were then precipitated in ice-cold methyl t-butyl ether, centrifuged, and lyophilized. The cyclization of disulfide cyclic peptides was achieved by using a modified procedure of Misicka et al. (26Misicka A. Lipkowski A.W. Horvath R. Davis P. Yamamura H.I. Porreca F. Hruby V.J. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Crude peptides were then purified by preparative reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Dynamax 300Å C18 25 cm × 21.4 mm, inner diameter column with a flow rate of 9 ml/min and two solvent systems of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile. Fractions containing the appropriate peptide were pooled together and lyophilized. The purity of the final products was assessed by analytical reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The inhibition of hCD8-MHC class I binding by the peptide analogs derived from the hCD8 protein was assessed in a standard cell adhesion assay that reflects this functional interaction (21Giblin P.A. Leahy D.J. Mennone J. Kavathas P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1716-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Following a modified procedure of Moebiuset al. (27Moebius U. Clayton L.K. Abraham S. Diener A. Yunis J.J. Harrison S.C. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12008-12012Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), 5 × 104 COS-7 cells/well of a 6-well plate were transfected with the T8-pcDNA plasmid, which was constructed by subcloning 1.5 kilobase pairs of cDNA encoding the full-length transmembrane hCD8 in T8-pMV7 (R. Axel, the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH) into theEcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), by DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the supplier's protocol. Usually, at 48-h post-transfection, 30–40% of the COS-7 cells expressed hCD8, as defined by immunofluorescence. MHC class I-expressing Raji cells (107 in 1 ml of RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 200 mm glutamine) were then added to each well in the presence of peptide at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by extensive washing (6×). Rosette formation between Raji cells and transfected COS-7 cells was scored microscopically at 100-fold magnification by counting the number of rosettes containing more than 5 Raji cells in 10 random optical fields for each individual well. The positive control without peptide exhibited 300–400 rosettes/well, and the percent inhibition of rosette formation for each experimental peptide was determined by the ratio of the number of rosettes obtained in the presence of the peptide to the number of rosettes in the positive control. COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone served as a negative control for rosette formation. The peptides were tested for their effect on CD8+ T cell function in a human in vitro CML assay. Allogenic-specific human CTL were generated by co-culturing purified human peripheral blood lymphocyte responder cells (2 × 106; purified from donor blood by standard procedures) with irradiated (30 Gy) peripheral blood lymphocytes from a second donor (4 × 106) in a 2 ml volume of RPMI medium containing 10% human serum,l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. After 6 days of incubation at 37 °C, 7% CO2, CTL activity was measured in a standard 4-h 51Cr-release CML assay using51Cr-labeled peripheral blood lymphocyte (second donor) targets at effector:target (E:T) cell ratios of 50:1 and 25:1. Percent-specific lysis was determined as the mean lysis % of quadruplicate experimental samples minus the spontaneous release % (target cells incubated in medium alone) divided by the maximum release % (target cells incubated in centrimide) minus the spontaneous release %. Peptides were added to either the generation or effector phases of CTL development at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Toxic effects of the peptides were determined by the lysis % above background that was obtained by incubating labeled targets with peptide alone. Relative solvent accessibility (RSA) was used as the quantitative measure to evaluate the surface exposure of various CD8 loop regions. RSA was calculated as the solvent accessible surface area of an amino acid residue in a given loop region relative to its value in a tripeptide Ala-Xaa-Ala sequence (28Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5358) Google Scholar). TableI lists the RSAaverage values for various sequences of CD8 surface loops. It was found that two loops, C′′D and DE, have a RSAaverage value comparable with those of the CDR loops and thus may be possible sites for molecular interaction with MHC class I (Fig. 1).Table ITheoretical analysis of surface loop regions of hCD8 proteinhCD8 loop regionsResidue numbersAmino acid sequencesRSAaverageCDR124–32VLLSNPTSG0.46CDR251–58YLSQNKPK0.47CDR397–102LSNSIM0.31C“D loop58–68KAAEGLDTQRF0.45DE loop71–78KRLGDTFV0.47The protein structural analysis was based on the crystal structure of hCD8αα (31Leahy D.J.

To test the putative role of the CD8 C′′D and DE loops, synthetic peptide analogs derived from these sites were synthesized. A disulfide bond was incorporated into these peptide sequences to form cyclic structures that could stabilize the peptide conformation mimicking the native loop region. The ability of the peptides in blocking CD8 interaction with MHC class I was measured in a cell adhesion assay. The cyclic DE loop peptide exhibited significant inhibitory activity (53%), whereas the cyclic C′′D loop peptide did not show any effect, suggesting the involvement of the DE loop in binding to MHC class I molecules. Presumably, the peptide exerts its inhibitory activity through the structural mimicry of a surface epitope of the native protein. Results from a molecular modeling study suggested that the cyclic DE loop peptide closely mimicked the conformational feature of the β-turn of the native DE loop (data not shown). To test if the β-turn structure of the CD8 DE loop is essential for the interaction with MHC class I, a linear DE loop peptide was synthesized and assessed. This linear DE loop peptide showed decreased activity in the inhibition of rosette formation as compared with the cyclic constrained analog (Fig. 2 a), supporting the notion that the β-turn structure is important for the binding of the DE loop to MHC class I. An anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody was used as a positive control, which blocked CD8-MHC class I binding in the cell adhesion assay. As a negative control, a scrambled peptide (DE scr; identical amino acid composition, but a fixed randomized sequence) did not show any activity, demonstrating the sequence specificity of the activity of the DE loop peptide. To further characterize the amino acid residues and structural features within the CD8 DE loop important for its biological function, a series of DE loop peptide analogs containing alanine substitution at a single site were synthesized and their activity tested in the cell adhesion assay. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the replacement by alanine at positions Leu-73, Asp-75, and Thr-76 led to substantial loss of activity, indicating that these residues located on the tip of the β-turn may form the bioactive core of the DE loop. The CD8 DE loop peptides were also tested for inhibitory effect on thein vitro function of CD8+ CTL in a CML assay. The cyclic DE loop peptide was shown to be highly effective in the blockade of specific lysis (82.1% inhibition) of target cells, whereas the linear DE loop peptide and peptide analogs containing alanine substitution, L73A, D75A, and T76A, exhibited decreased activities (Fig. 2 b). These results were consistent with those observed in the cell adhesion experiments. Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrated the role of the CD8 DE loop in mediating CD8-dependent biological function and suggested the potential of CD8 DE loop peptides for therapeutic application. Studies are currently in progress in a murine skin allograft model, and preliminary data suggest that administration of the cyclized DE loop peptide can prolong graft survival. Concomitant with the completion of the in vitro DE loop peptide studies, as described above, the crystal structure of the hCD8-MHC class I complex was recently reported (24Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This allowed for an unbiased evaluation of the results about structure-function of the CD8 DE loop, which were obtained in the absence of this crystal structure. The crystal structure of the complex indicates that the hCD8 homodimer interacts with the α2, α3, and β2m domains of MHC class I. Of particular note is the direct contact observed between the DE loop of CD8 and the DE loop of the β2m domain of MHC class I (24Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The CD8 DE loop serves as a distinct recognition site in addition to the interface between the CDR loops of CD8 and the α3 loop of MHC class I. This is in full agreement with the proposed role of the CD8 DE loop in mediating CD8 function, as suggested by our present study. The structure of the CD8-MHC class I complex also provides a basis to explain the activity of the DE loop peptide and its alanine substituted analogs, as observed in our study. In the crystal structure, the CD8 DE loop is highly exposed and serves as a direct contact site with MHC class I, particularly with Asp-75 located on the tip of the CD8 DE loop forming a hydrogen bond interaction with Lys-58 of MHC class I (24Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). This explains the substantial loss of activity in both cell adhesion and CML assays of DE loop peptide analogs (L73A, D75A, and T76A) with alanine substitutions around this critical region (Fig. 2). The crystal structure of the CD8-MHC class I complex also suggests other residues important for the structural stability and biological function of the CD8 DE loop. As shown in Fig. 3, the aliphatic side chains of Lys-71 and Arg-72 seem to form potential hydrophobic interactions with the spatially proximate side chains of Val-78 and Phe-77, respectively. In addition, it is possible that the side chains of Arg-72 and Phe-77 may form a cation-π interaction (29Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Such interactions may be critical for maintaining a stable β-turn conformation of the Leu73–Thr-76 region on the tip of the DE loop, which is responsible for the direct contact with MHC class I (Fig. 3). To test this hypothesis, we synthesized and tested four additional peptide analogs (K71A, R72A, F77A, and V78A) containing a single alanine substitution at various sites of the DE loop. All of these modifications resulted in the significant loss of biological activity of the DE loop peptide in both cell adhesion and CML assays (Fig. 2), thus strongly suggesting that these residues play an essential structural role for the function of the DE loop. The results from this present study support the notion that small surface epitopes play a critical role in mediating large protein-protein interfaces (30Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Although the interaction between CD8 and MHC class I, as revealed in the crystal structure of their complex, involves a large surface on both molecules with many contacting regions, the small peptide mimic of the CD8 DE loop was able to effectively inhibit the formation of the CD8-MHC class I complex as shown in the cell adhesion assay. Together with our earlier design and discovery of small peptidic and nonpeptidic inhibitors that block the stable association between CD4 and MHC class II proteins (4Li S. Satoh T. Korngold R. Huang Z. Immunol. Today. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 5Satoh T. Aramini J.M. Li S. Friedman T.M. Gao J. Edling A. Townsend R. Germann M.W. Korngold R. Huang Z. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), these studies demonstrated an approach of using small molecules to modulate complex protein interactions in biological and pathological processes. In summary, we have found that the DE loop is an important functional epitope on the hCD8 protein surface. Small synthetic peptide mimics of this site were able to effectively block hCD8-MHC class I cell adhesion and CD8+ CTL function in vitro. These results suggest that the DE loop region of the CD8 protein may represent a new target for the design and development of peptidic and eventually nonpeptidic immunoregulatory agents. Finally, it is important to note that the recently reported crystal structure of the CD8-MHC class I complex fully supports the original findings regarding the role of the CD8 DE loop obtained in the absence of the crystal structure. As such, this study may provide a critically tested example, following our previous study of CD4 peptide design (5Satoh T. Aramini J.M. Li S. Friedman T.M. Gao J. Edling A. Townsend R. Germann M.W.

It is possible that such a strategy may serve as a general paradigm for the study of other protein-protein complexes, particularly those of IgSF molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2006987980,"Isolated sucrase deficiency has been demonstrated in a line of house musk shrew, Suncus murinus(laboratory name: suncus). This animal belongs to the order Insectivore and is phylogenetically different from ordinarily used laboratory animals. They are believed to have evolved with mainly animal food without sucrose. To study the molecular basis of the sucrase deficiency in suncus, we cloned 6.0-kilobase (kb) sucrase-isomaltase (SI, EC3.2.1.48–10) cDNA from suncus intestinal cDNA library. The cDNA clone contained a 5442-base pair (bp)-long open reading frame preceded by an in frame termination codon. The deduced 1813-amino acid sequence showed 68.6, 71.2, and 74.7% similarity with those of rat, rabbit, and human, respectively. A cleavage site between isomaltase and sucrase as well as the region surrounding the catalytic sites for sucrase and isomaltase were conserved among the species. Out of 18 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, 5 were common among all 4 species. In the connecting segment which was enriched with O-linked glycosylation sites in the other species, only two sites were present in suncus. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 6.0-kb SI mRNA was expressed in the KAT line with intact sucrase-isomaltase activity. In contrast, 3.0-kb SI mRNA was expressed in suncus of the MI line with isolated sucrase deficiency. The 3.0-kb mRNA cosegregated with sucrase deficiency phenotype as an autosomal recessive trait. Sequence analysis revealed a 2-nucleotide deletion at position 2767–2768, which results in a frameshift and an immature termination codon. The cDNA of the MI line diverged from that of the KAT line at position 2865, having an 18-bp unique sequence followed by a poly(A) tail. The mutant cDNA encodes 922 amino acid residues which preserves the region for isomaltase but lacks that for whole sucrase. While the cells transfected with the plasmids expressing SI in the KAT line showed both sucrase and isomaltase activity, the plasmids expressing MI line cDNA showed only isomaltase activity. Thus it was concluded that the mutation in the SI gene was responsible for isolated sucrase deficiency in the MI line. Isolated sucrase deficiency has been demonstrated in a line of house musk shrew, Suncus murinus(laboratory name: suncus). This animal belongs to the order Insectivore and is phylogenetically different from ordinarily used laboratory animals. They are believed to have evolved with mainly animal food without sucrose. To study the molecular basis of the sucrase deficiency in suncus, we cloned 6.0-kilobase (kb) sucrase-isomaltase (SI, EC3.2.1.48–10) cDNA from suncus intestinal cDNA library. The cDNA clone contained a 5442-base pair (bp)-long open reading frame preceded by an in frame termination codon. The deduced 1813-amino acid sequence showed 68.6, 71.2, and 74.7% similarity with those of rat, rabbit, and human, respectively. A cleavage site between isomaltase and sucrase as well as the region surrounding the catalytic sites for sucrase and isomaltase were conserved among the species. Out of 18 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, 5 were common among all 4 species. In the connecting segment which was enriched with O-linked glycosylation sites in the other species, only two sites were present in suncus. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 6.0-kb SI mRNA was expressed in the KAT line with intact sucrase-isomaltase activity. In contrast, 3.0-kb SI mRNA was expressed in suncus of the MI line with isolated sucrase deficiency. The 3.0-kb mRNA cosegregated with sucrase deficiency phenotype as an autosomal recessive trait. Sequence analysis revealed a 2-nucleotide deletion at position 2767–2768, which results in a frameshift and an immature termination codon. The cDNA of the MI line diverged from that of the KAT line at position 2865, having an 18-bp unique sequence followed by a poly(A) tail. The mutant cDNA encodes 922 amino acid residues which preserves the region for isomaltase but lacks that for whole sucrase. While the cells transfected with the plasmids expressing SI in the KAT line showed both sucrase and isomaltase activity, the plasmids expressing MI line cDNA showed only isomaltase activity. Thus it was concluded that the mutation in the SI gene was responsible for isolated sucrase deficiency in the MI line. Mammals of the order Insectivore have received attention as possible laboratory animals which are phylogenetically different from ordinarily used laboratory animals, such as the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit (1Oda S. Kitoh J. Ohta K. Isomura G. Suncus(Japanese). Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo, Japan1985Google Scholar, 2Novacek M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Both primates and rodents apparently originated from Insectivore and then evolved separately (3Colbert E.H. Evolution of the Vertebrates. 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar). In 1976, Oda and Kondo succeeded in rearing and breeding the house musk shrew, Suncus murinus, mammal belonging to the family Soricidae of Insectivore (4Oda S. Kondo K. Jikken Dobutsu (Japanese). 1977; 26: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, several laboratory lines of suncus which originated from different wild populations in Asian regions have been developed in Nagoya, Japan, and a number of studies have been carried out on the morphology, endocrinology, and physiology of this animal (1Oda S. Kitoh J. Ohta K. Isomura G. Suncus(Japanese). Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo, Japan1985Google Scholar). As a result, several lines of suncus were established as a model of sucrase deficiency. It was further established that hereditary sucrase deficiency in suncus was transmitted as an autosomal recessive manner (5Oda S. Yokota K. Takesue Y. Edition Foundation Mancel Merieux. 1991; (Lyon, France): 137-140Google Scholar, 6Yokota K. Oda S. Takesue S. Takesue Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1992; 103: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Sucrase-isomaltase (SI, 1The abbreviations used are: SI, sucrase-isomaltase; pro-SI, precursor ucrase-isomaltase; CSID, congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency; UTR, untranslated region; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). EC3.2.1.48–10) is an integral enzyme complex of the brush border membrane of the small intestine in mammals (7Galand G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1989; 94: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide which has two catalytic sites (8Hauri H.P. Wacker H. Rickli E.E. Bigler M.B. Quaroni A. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4522-4528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following its insertion into brush border membrane, SI is cleaved by pancreatic proteases to yield two separate enzymes (10Hauer J.M. Christensen K. Wilson H.D. Schedl H.P. Pancreas. 1987; 2: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Isomaltase remains anchored to the membrane by its NH2-terminal domain while sucrase is attached to isomaltase by strong ionic interaction (9Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Semenza G. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1981; 10: 691-706PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is responsible for the terminal digestion of dietary sucrose and starch (12Gray G.M. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A congenital deficiency of sucrase, either isolated or combined with isomaltase deficiency, can cause malabsorption syndrome in humans (13Perman J.A. Barr R.G. Watkins J.B. J. Pediatr. 1978; 93: 17-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Gudmand H.E. Krasilnikoff P.A. Skovbjerg H. Adv. Nutr. Res. 1984; 6: 233-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Treem W.R. J. Pediatr. Gastr. Nutr. 1995; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When subjects with sucrase deficiency take carbohydrate, they manifest abdominal distention and osmotic-fermentative diarrhea with liquid feces containing sucrose and glucose (14Gudmand H.E. Krasilnikoff P.A. Skovbjerg H. Adv. Nutr. Res. 1984; 6: 233-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the pathophysiology of sucrase(-isomaltase) deficiency or sucrose intolerance, a hereditary deficiency in SI in animal models is useful. However, there are no animal models which manifest congenital SI deficiency (CSID) or sucrose intolerance except for the suncus. To elucidate the molecular mechanism for CSID in suncus would contribute to our understanding of an autosomal recessive CSID in human. We thus cloned suncus SI cDNA from two lines of suncus, KAT line, expressing both sucrase and isomaltase, and MI line, expressing only isomaltase but not sucrase. We identified a mutation that resulted in deletion of the region coding for sucrase in an MI line. Transient transfection of the mutant cDNA revealed that peptide encoded by the mutant cDNA had isomaltase activity, but not sucrase activity in accordance with the phenotype of the animals. Two lines of suncus were employed in the present study. The KAT line has both sucrase and isomaltase activities in the small intestine which originated from a wild population in Katmandu. The MI line, which has isomaltase activity but not sucrase activity, was established among hybrid lines derived from wild populations in Nagasaki, Okinawa, Tarama of Japan and west Java of Indonesia. All these lines have been described in the previous reports (5Oda S. Yokota K. Takesue Y. Edition Foundation Mancel Merieux. 1991; (Lyon, France): 137-140Google Scholar, 6Yokota K. Oda S. Takesue S. Takesue Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1992; 103: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Suncus of MI line develop diarrhea and weight loss when they are given water containing sucrose, while those of KAT line or KAT/MI heterozygote do not (5Oda S. Yokota K. Takesue Y. Edition Foundation Mancel Merieux. 1991; (Lyon, France): 137-140Google Scholar, 6Yokota K. Oda S. Takesue S. Takesue Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1992; 103: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). They were kept on a solid diet of 5p pellets (Nippai Co. Ltd., Chita, Japan) used as food for aquafarming rainbow trout. The pellet contains high proteins (36–40%) but not sucrose. The enzyme activities in the animals used in this study were determined by the semi-quantitative Tes-tape method (16Ohno T. Oda S. Namikawa T. Exp. Anim. Tokyo. 1994; 43: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 17Oda S. Mamm. Sci.(Japanese). 1994; 34: 59-65Google Scholar, 18Ito T. Koyasu K. Yamamura H. Oda S. Ann. Res. Inst. Environ. Med. Nagoya University, 1996: 201-203Google Scholar). These two suncus lines were bred at Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University. Two-month-old suncus were killed by cardiac exsanguination under ether anesthesia. Proximal jejunal segments were removed and washed with cold 0.9% NaCl. Total RNAs were extracted by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform-extraction method (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63171) Google Scholar). Poly(A) RNAs of MI and KAT lines were prepared with OligotexTM-dT30(Super) (Roche, Tokyo, Japan) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The intestinal cDNA libraries were prepared by using λZap-cDNA® Gigapack® III Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene) and 5 μg of poly(A) RNA from each KAT and MI line. The Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library of KAT line yielded 1.5 × 106 independent clones and that of MI lines yielded 1 × 107. After plating, approximately 2 × 105 plaques were transferred onto the GeneScreen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products). After denaturation in alkali followed by neutralization, the membranes were incubated in a hybridization buffer containing 20% formamide, 900 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and denatured herring sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml) for 4 h at 42 °C. An EcoRI fragment of GC 4.5, a rat cDNA clone for SI provided by Dr. Susan J. Henning (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas), was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and then used as a probe. After hybridization at 42 °C for 20 h, the membranes were then washed in 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate) at 20 °C (2 × 5 min), 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 50 °C (2 × 30 min), and 0.1× SSC at 20 °C (2 × 10 min). The positive plaques were isolated based on the image from computer-assisted imaging analysis using a BAS-2000 Fujix Bioimage Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The positive λ clones were converted to pBluescript according to the instruction of the manufacturer. The sequence of the cDNA insert was determined by using ABI 373A DNA sequencer as described previously (20Hayashi Y. Ohmori S. Ito T. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sequence searches of GeneBankTM were carried out using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70635) Google Scholar). The homology of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of SI among human, rabbit, rat, and suncus were determined with Genetyx: Homology 1.0.1 (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). The suncus SI amino acid sequence was aligned with the other three species by FASTA program (22Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were excised from pBluescript by digestion with NotI and ApaI and inserted into the same sites in an expression vector, pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to construct p-KSI expressing SI cDNA of KAT line and p-MSI expressing that of MI line. After fractionation of 15 μg of total RNAs through 0.8% agarose gel, the RNAs were transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membranes. The hybridization condition was identical to that for library screening except that hybridization buffer contained 50% formamide rather than 20% and that washing in 2× SSC and 1% SDS was carried out at 65 °C. The membranes were exposed to Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for autoradiography. Genomic DNAs were isolated from livers of animals according to an established method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Twenty μg of DNA samples were digested with three restriction endonucleases (EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI). After fractionation of 20 μg of DNAs through 0.8% agarose gel, the DNAs were denatured and neutralized. Blotting, hybridization, washing of membrane, autoradiography, and probe used were carried out in the same manner as that for Northern blot analysis. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. The cells cultured in 100-mm plates were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation method (24Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar) with 9 μg of carrier plasmid, 1 μg of pSV-βGal (Promega), and 10 μg of p-KSI or p-MSI per dish. After overnight exposure to DNA-CaPO4precipitate, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in the medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Forty-eight h after the medium change, the cells were scraped with a rubber policeman into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. A 100-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was incubated with 10 mmsucrose or 10 mm isomaltose at 37 °C for various lengths of times. Glucose produced from the sucrose or isomaltose was measured using the glucose assay kit (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To monitor the transfection efficiency, a 20-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was subjected to β-galactosidase assay using β-Gal Detection System (CLONTECH) as described previously (20Hayashi Y. Ohmori S. Ito T. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library constructed from the intestinal mRNA of suncus KAT line with intact SI activity was screened with rat SI cDNA. Screening of 2 × 105 phage plaques resulted in the identification of approximately 400 positive clones, indicating that SI mRNA comprised 0.2% of the intestinal mRNAs. KSI (SI cDNA derived from KAT line). One of the clones that contained the longest insert was selected for sequencing. Sequencing of KSI insert revealed a single open reading frame of 5442 bp. The ATG start codon was found 54 bp downstream from the 5′ end of the cDNA. In-frame termination codon was present 39 bp upstream of the translation start codon. The 3′-untranslated region (UTR) was 395 bp followed by a poly(A) tail. The coding sequence showed 78.8, 77.3, and 71.8% homology with human (25Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), rabbit (26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and rat (27Chandrasena G. Osterholm D.E. Sunitha I. Henning S.J. Gene. 1994; 150: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively. The comparative analysis of available sequences for the 5′-UTR showed approximately 50% sequence homology with other species including human, rabbit, and rat. The 3′-UTR showed around 70% sequence homology among these species. The amino acid sequence of KAT line showed 74.7, 71.2, and 68.6% overall similarity with human (25Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), rabbit (26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and rat (27Chandrasena G. Osterholm D.E. Sunitha I. Henning S.J. Gene. 1994; 150: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively. The suncus SI amino acid sequence was alignment with the other species in Fig. 1. Stretches of 16 and 14 amino acids surrounding the suncus sucrase and isomaltase active sites, respectively (26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), were identical among the species (Fig. 1, boxes). A cleavage site between isomaltase and sucrase was present at the same position as the other species (arrowhead in Fig. 1). As indicated by N in boldface type, 17 potential N-glycosylation sites were present in SI of KAT line. Out of eight N-glycosylation sites conserved among rat, rabbit, and human, only five N-glycosylation sites were conserved in suncus (Fig. 1, indicated by #). The NH2 terminus of isomaltase containing the putative transmembrane domain (Fig. 1, indicated by a continuous line) showed 85% sequence identity among the four species. However, the region called stretch, putative connecting segment following the transmembrane domain with potential O-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1, dashed line), was much shorter in suncus when compared with the other species.Figure 1Comparison of deduced amino acids sequence of suncus KAT line (su), human (hu), rabbit (rb) and rat (rt) full-length SI cDNA. The suncus amino acids sequence (top line) is from the nucleotides sequence of KSI. The lines and symbols in the figure indicate as follows: solid line, transmembrane (TM) domain; dashed line, potential O-glycosylation sites; bold letter, potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr); short vertical line, identity of amino acids; period, similarity of amino acids; #, N-glycosylation sites conserved in three species except for suncus; asterisk, N-glycosylation sites conserved in four species; arrowhead, cleavage site between isomaltase and sucrase; arrow, immature stop site of MSI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern blot analysis of the intestinal RNA using KSI insert as a probe showed that a 6.0- and a 3.0-kb mRNA was expressed in KAT line and MI line, respectively (see Fig. 2). The size of mRNA in KAT line was similar to those reported in the other species (25Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 27Chandrasena G. Osterholm D.E. Sunitha I. Henning S.J. Gene. 1994; 150: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine whether the short mRNA is linked to the sucrase deficiency phenotype, we crossed an animal of KAT line and an animal of MI line. The resulting male heterozygote was further crossed with the mother (Fig. 2). As expected, the heterozygote expressed both 6.0- and 3.0-kb mRNAs. Out of four pups obtained from the backcross, three showed sucrase deficiency, and only 3.0 kb of mRNA could be detected in these animals. It was thus confirmed that lack of the 6.0-kb SI mRNA expression is responsible for the isolated sucrase deficiency in MI line. To characterize the structure of the SI gene in suncus, genomic DNA from KAT line and MI line were digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI and probed with KSI insert (Fig. 3). No gross difference between KAT (+/+) and MI (–/–) lines could be detected, indicating that a point mutation, a small deletion/insertion or a large alteration in intron region, is responsible for the generation of 3-kb mRNA. To characterize the 3-kb mRNA in the sucrase-deficient line, we screened a cDNA library constructed from the intestinal poly(A) RNA of MI line using KSI insert as a probe. Screening of 2 × 105 phage plaques resulted in the identification of approximately 200 positive clones, indicating that SI mRNA comprised 0.1% of the intestinal mRNAs. One of the clones, MSI (SI cDNA derived from MI line) contained the longest insert of 3.0 kb. The size was compatible with that of the mRNA detected by the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Sequencing of the MSI insert revealed that it contained an open reading frame of 2769 bp, a 5′-UTR of 39 bp, and a 3′-UTR of 93 bp followed by a poly(A) tract. The coding sequence was identical to that of KSI from the initiation codon to 2766 nucleotides, where two nucleotides were deleted. This deletion of two nucleotides resulted in a frameshift and appearance of an immature stop codon. It was deduced that MI-sucrase-isomaltase mRNA encoded an enzyme with 922 amino acid residues which lacked COOH-terminal, 69 amino acids of isomaltase and the entire region of sucrase. An arrow in Fig. 1 shows the COOH-terminal end of the enzyme. The alignment of the 3′ sequence of MSI with that of KSI is depicted as Fig. 4. Downstream of the 2-nucleotide deletion, three base substitutions were present in the following 78 bp. Then the cDNA of MI line completely diverged from that of KAT line, having an 18-bp unique sequence followed by a poly(A) tail. The sequence AGTAA at the position 2845 in MI line was considered to serve as a poly(A) signal as described by Guntaka (28Guntaka R.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 511-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the function of SI encoded by cDNAs in KAT line and MI line, we carried out the expression study using COS-7 cells and measured glucose production from sucrose or isomaltose. The cells transfected with p-KSI expressing SI of KAT line could digest sucrose to glucose after incubation of 120 min. In contrast, no significant glucose production could be detected in cells transfected with p-MSI expressing SI of MI line as in the nontransfected control cells after 120 min of incubation (Fig. 5A). Transfection efficiency monitored by β-galactosidase activity was not significantly different between cells transfected with p-KSI and those transfected with pMSI (data not shown). After incubating the cells with isomaltose for 60 and 120 min, glucose production could be detected in both cells transfected with p-KSI and p-MSI (Fig. 5B). Thus transient transfection study demonstrated that this mutant clone, MSI, retained isomaltase activity but not sucrase. It is concluded that 3-kb deleted mRNA with the immature termination codon is responsible for the isolated sucrase deficiency in MI line. The cloning of KSI, sucrase isomaltase cDNA in KAT line suncus with both enzyme activities provided some unique features in suncus, as well as conserved features among human, rat, rabbit, and suncus (25Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G.

Gene. 1994; 150: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Deduced amino acid sequence of KAT line suncus cDNA revealed 17 potential N-glycosylation sites, 7 in isomaltase site, and 10 in sucrase site. In human (25Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), rat (26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and rabbit (27Chandrasena G. Osterholm D.E. Sunitha I. Henning S.J. Gene. 1994; 150: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), eight N-glycosylation sites are conserved (Fig. 1, #), and only five of these were conserved in suncus. The five N-glycosylation sites, one in the isomaltase region and the other four in the sucrase region (Fig. 1, asterisk), conserved among the four species are considered to be important for the formation of the tertiary structure of SI. The region called connecting segments contains more than ten O-glycosylation sites in the other species, and it has been speculated that the glycosylated segment may protect itself from pancreatic enzymes (26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In KAT line suncus sucrase isomaltase, however, the connecting segment was very short and contains only two serine/threonine residues that may be glycosylated. Together with the fact that the SI activity of KAT line suncus was not much lower than that of rabbit (6Yokota K. Oda S. Takesue S. Takesue Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1992; 103: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the glycosylations of this segment are not playing a critical role for the expression and the activity of SI. On the other hand, stretches of 16 and 14 amino acid residues of the catalytic site of sucrase and isomaltase, respectively, were all conserved among human, rat, rabbit, and suncus, suggesting an important role of these residues in substrate recognition. Mammals of the order Insectivore including suncus are phylogenetically very different from rat and rabbit (1Oda S. Kitoh J. Ohta K. Isomura G. Suncus(Japanese). Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo, Japan1985Google Scholar, 2Novacek M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and are believed to conserve features of the common ancestor for primates and rodents. It is of note that the highest homology against suncus SI, both at nucleic acid and protein level, was observed in human, but not in rabbit or rat. If this is the case for other genes in suncus, suncus will emerge as a better animal model for human diseases (4Oda S. Kondo K. Jikken Dobutsu (Japanese). 1977; 26: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the function of suncus sucrase isomaltase expressed in heterologous cells was also examined by transient transfection. The enzyme complex is cleaved into two subunits by pancreatic enzymes in vivo. In contrast, this cleavage was considered not to take place in the transfection study. It has been reported that pro-SI on intestinal epithelia in pancreasectomized pig is enzymatically fully active (29Sjostrom H. Noren O. Christiansen L. Wacker H. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11332-11338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the present observation supports the conclusion that the catalytic sites for the specific substrates are already exposed to the outside of globular molecule in single-chain pro-SI complex. The molecular basis of isolated sucrase deficiency in MI line suncus was also elucidated in the present study. SI mRNA which has a smaller size was detected in MI line suncus. Mating experiments confirmed that sucrase deficiency inherited in an autosomal recessive manner is linked to this abnormal mRNA. Cloning of MI line cDNA revealed 2-nucleotide deletion, resulting in a frameshift and appearance of an immature termination codon followed by unique sequence and an aberrant polyadenylation. Sucrase deficiency in MI line is attributable to the 2-nucleotide deletion. On the other hand, the precise mechanism for generation of the short mRNA from the genome remains to be elucidated. The genomic region across the 2-base pair deletion could not be amplified by polymerase chain reaction using several pairs of primers either in KAT line or MI line, suggesting the presence of a large intron near the deleted two nucleotides. The cDNA derived from MI line encodes a 922-amino acids protein that lacks COOH-terminal 69 amino acids of isomaltase and the entire region of sucrase. A transient transfection study demonstrated that the protein encoded by the mutant cDNA retained isomaltase activity but not sucrase, confirming that the mutation is responsible for isolated sucrase deficiency in MI line suncus. It is of note that the sucrase subunit as well as COOH-terminal part of the isomaltase subunit are not required for proper folding and membrane-targeted transport of the molecule. SI gene is believed to have evolved by gene duplication from an ancestral, single subunit gene (26Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that a single subunit isomaltase similar to the hypothetical ancestral gene is functional, providing some insights to the molecular evolution of SI. The human congenital SI deficiency (CSID) has been considered as an example of a disease due to transport incompetent molecules (30Hauri H.P. Roth J. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4423-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Naim H.Y. Roth J. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M. Milla P. Schmitz J. Hauri H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In most cases, isomaltase deficiency is combined with sucrase deficiency. Synthesis and transport of SI molecule has been extensively studied using peroral biopsy specimen (32Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Naim H.Y. Baillieres Clin. Gastroenter. 1990; 4: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Fransen J.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the abnormality of the synthesis/transport has been classified into several types (15Treem W.R. J. Pediatr. Gastr. Nutr. 1995; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, single amino acid substitution was identified in sucrase subunit in a patient with CSID (34Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human cases with isolated sucrase deficiency are also reported, however, the precise molecular basis of this abnormality has not been elucidated (35Skovbjerg H. Krasilnikoff P.A. Pediatr. Res. 1981; 15: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Skovbjerg H. Krasilnikoff P.A. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1986; 5: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The present report is the first to investigate the molecular basis of isolated sucrase deficiency in the mammalian species. The mutation in suncus did not occur in the laboratory lines, and the mutant gene already had existed in the wild population (5Oda S. Yokota K. Takesue Y. Edition Foundation Mancel Merieux. 1991; (Lyon, France): 137-140Google Scholar). Thus, there would be no positive selection of animals with a normal SI activity, and the abnormal gene would remain in the population like human cases (37Gudmand H.E. Fenger H.J. Kern H.P. Madsen P.R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1987; 22: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Insectivore, including suncus, has probably evolved with mainly animal food (17Oda S. Mamm. Sci.(Japanese). 1994; 34: 59-65Google Scholar), and several types of sucrase deficiency may be also shown in other species belonging to the order. These species would be useful for the animals models of CSID. We are grateful to Dr. Susan J. Henning (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas) for providing a rat cDNA clone, GC 4.5. We thank Dr. Sachiko Takesue for helpful suggestion and encouragement."

In single-stranded phage G4, E. coli primase synthesizes pRNA from a special region termed as the origin of complementary DNA strand synthesis (oric) and requires an association with single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB). 1The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-strand DNA-binding protein; ddCTP, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate; nt, nucleotide; oligonucleotide, oligodeoxynucleotide; oric, the origin of complementary DNA strand synthesis; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. 1The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-strand DNA-binding protein; ddCTP, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate; nt, nucleotide; oligonucleotide, oligodeoxynucleotide; oric, the origin of complementary DNA strand synthesis; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. G4oric is a 140-nucleotide (nt) non-coding DNA sequence, containing three stem-loop structures (stem-loops I, II, and III) (10Fiddes J.C. Barrell B.G. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The sequence for pRNA transcription begins at the unique 5′-CTG-3′ trinucleotide (the pRNA initiation site) in the region 3′-flanking of stem-loop I (7Bouche J.P. Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Hiasa H. Sakai H. Tanaka K. Honda Y. Komano T. Godson G.N.

A specific structure of this priming complex has been reported (15Sun W. Godson G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the general priming system primase associates with DnaB helicase and synthesizes pRNA chains from many sites on any single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (16Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4308-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5260-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a study to investigate the effect of complementary oligodeoxynucleotides (referred to as oligonucleotides below) upon pRNA synthesis on G4oric, we have found that, in addition to synthesizing RNA de novo, primase catalyzed the synthesis of RNA chains from the 3′-hydroxyl terminus of oligonucleotides that hybridized to G4oric DNA. This primed RNA synthesis has been verified by size measurement, radioactive labeling, sequence mapping, and modification of the 3′-terminal group of oligonucleotide. The resulting DNA-RNA hybrid polynucleotide has been characterized by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and ribonuclease H (RNase H) cleavages. Efficiency of the primed RNA synthesis on the oligonucleotide-primed template was close to the efficiency of pRNA synthesis de novo on a non-primed template. In the G4oric-specific priming system, the primed synthesis occurred within the pRNA transcribed DNA sequence; in the primase/DnaB/ssDNA general priming system, the primed synthesis did not require a specific DNA sequence and takes place with and without the 5′-CTG-3′ sequence. This primed RNA can be used by E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme as an effective primer for the synthesis of DNA chain. A similar priming reaction for the synthesis of RNA at the 3′-hydroxyl termini of DNA had been found in prokaryotic (18Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Nath K. Yarbrough L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Nath K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2605-2615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eukaryotic (20Lewis M.K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8026-8039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by EcoRI cleavage of G4oric DNA from f1R199/G4oric circular ssDNA (f1R199 containing the 278-nt G4oric sequence (24Sakai H. Godson G.N. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 826: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) with complementary oligonucleotides annealed to the EcoRI cleavage sites. The cleaved G4oric fragment was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluted by soaking gel slices in 0.5 mNH4OAc, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA for several hours at room temperature. The eluted DNA was desalted with a Centricon-50 column (Amicon). The f1R199/G4oric and M13mp18 circular ssDNA was prepared as described in Ref. 23Sun W. Godson G.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used except for adding an annealing step prior to the synthesis reaction to generate a primed template. 0.2 pmol of 278-nt G4oric or f1R199/G4oric ssDNA template was mixed with 2.8 pmol of oligonucleotide (this ratio or higher yielded the maximum efficiency of primed synthesis) in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the mixture was heated to 85 °C for 2 min then cooled slow to 35 °C. When using 5′-32P-end labeled oligonucleotide for primed synthesis, the labeled oligonucleotide sample was heated to 67 °C for 15 min to inactivate T4 polynucleotide kinase and was used directly without further purification so that the concentration of oligonucleotide was not changed. The oligonucleotide-primed template was immediately added into a 50-μl synthesis reaction that was made up of pRNA synthesis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm MgCl2, and 4% sucrose), 4 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4.2 pmol of SSB protein (26 pmol for reaction using f1R199/G4oric), 10 pmol of primase, and different substrates. The complete synthesis reaction mixture contained 100 μm ATP, 20 μm each GTP, UTP, and CTP, and 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol). In the limited synthesis reaction, ddNTP was substituted for the rNTP. When 5′-32P-end labeled oligonucleotides were used to label primed products, [α-32P]GTP was omitted from the reaction. Synthesis reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. After precipitation with ethanol, the products were analyzed in 20% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:N′,N′-methylene bisacrylamide, 19:1), 7 m urea gels. The basic method used was as described in Ref. 16Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4308-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar. Here, conditions were similar with the reaction using G4oric, except that M13mp18 ssDNA (0.2 pmol) was the DNA template and 2 μg of dnaB protein (7 pmol) was added instead of SSB. The efficiency of RNA synthesis was measured by exposure of gels to PhosphorImagerTM screen and quantitation using the ImageQuantTM program (Molecular Dynamics). The poly(rA) size marker was prepared following the method described in Ref. 31Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4045-4053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; the ladder was standardized by comparison with the 9-nt pRNA synthesized by primase. The procedure of the RNA and DNA coupled syntheses followed was as described in Ref. 32Stayton M.M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13205-13212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, except for adding a step of annealing the template to the oligonucleotide before synthesis and separating primase and DNA polymerase reactions into successive processes. To prepare the primed DNA template with a primed RNA, a reaction mixture (20 μl) of 0.2 pmol of G4oric 278-nt ssDNA, 2.8 pmol of 17-nt oligonucleotide, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CTP and UTP, 30 μm GTP, 30 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4.2 pmol of SSB, and 10 pmol of primase in pRNA synthesis buffer (see “Primed RNA Synthesis”) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. DNA synthesis was immediately started by adding 50 μm each dGTP, dCTP, and TTP, 18 μm dATP plus 10 μCi of [α-35S]dATP (1,000 Ci/mmol, in the second half-life. Amersham), and 70 ng of pol III* plus 15 ng of β-subunit. The DNA synthesis reactions (25 μl) were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped by adding 40 mm EDTA. Control reactions followed the same processes. DNA synthesis products were precipitated with ethanol once, then separated by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:N′,N′-methylene bisacrylamide, 38:1), 7 m urea gel (20 × 40 cm), under 30 watts for 5 h. Two denaturing polyacrylamide gels were prepared. One for autoradiography was fixed with 12% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film without intensifying screen for 24 h. Another one for quantitation was exposed to a film without drying. The radioactive bands were excised from the gel and their radioactivity were measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, LS 6500). DNase I and RNase H cleavages were performed immediately after RNA synthesis without denaturing treatment. 20 units of DNase I (RNase-free) was added directly to the 50-μl synthesis reaction and digestion was carried on for 40 min at 37 °C. For RNase H cleavage, the volume of synthesis sample was adjusted with RNase H buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) to 100 μl. Samples were digested with 30 units of RNase H at 37 °C for 30 min and the digestion was stopped by adding 50 mm EDTA. The cleaved fragments were precipitated with ethanol once and then analyzed on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel (16 × 15 cm). All control samples were passed through the same procedure. A 278-nt G4oric ssDNA fragment (23Sun W. Godson G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8026-8039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in these experiments. The first oligonucleotide hybridized to G4oric was 20 nt in length and complementary to the 3′-sequence flanking the core stem-loop structures (Fig. 1 A). The 3′-flanking region contains the 5′-CTG-3′, the pRNA initiation site (7Bouche J.P. Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pRNA synthesized by primase from the G4oric template annealed with the oligonucleotide was examined and compared with pRNA synthesized from unannealed templates including G4oric alone and mixed with an uncomplementary oligonucleotide. As seen in Fig. 1 B, the majority of pRNA synthesized de novo from G4oric alone was a cluster of species from 24 to 28 nt in length, plus some smaller pRNA chains (lane 4). Synthesis from the G4oric annealed with the complementary oligonucleotide, however, mainly yielded a group of much larger products (approximately 38–42 nt, lane 5). It seemed unlikely that the large products were nascent pRNA because the maximum size of pRNA synthesized from G4oric by primase in the normal in vitro synthesis reaction we used is 29-nt (7Bouche J.P. Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These products were not synthesized from the oligonucleotide itself (i.e. using the oligonucleotide as a template), as no products were observed when the oligonucleotide was used in the absence of G4oric (lane 7). Comparison of sizes of the large products with the 20-nt oligonucleotide (lane 2) and poly(rA) size marker (lane 3) showed that the large species were 19 to 23 ribonucleotides longer than the oligonucleotide. These sizes were equal to the lengths of RNA chains that were extended from the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide (being hybridized at site +5 on G4oric, see Fig. 1 A) until the termination sites of pRNA synthesis (+24 to +28) on G4oric template. This result suggested that the large products were RNA chains extended from the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide by primase. A control 20-nt oligonucleotide (lane 1) of sequence unrelated to G4 sequence was not extended nor affected G4 pRNA synthesis with primase (lane 6). To further examine the possibility of primed synthesis by primase, a limited synthesis assay with 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (ddCTP) terminator (primase can use dNTP as well rNTP precursors (33Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 770-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) was adopted for primase reaction on the same templates as described above. Under such conditions, synthesis of nascent pRNA chains should be terminated at the first guanosine (site +9) of DNA template, and the new species should be stopped after adding 4 ribonucleotides to the oligonucleotide that is annealed on the template (see Fig. 1 A). The results are shown in Fig. 1 C. The G4oric template alone or mixed with the unrelated oligonucleotide produced a 9-nt pRNA de novo (lanes 3 and 5). Synthesis from the template bound by the complementary oligonucleotide (20-nt), as expected, generated a product that was exactly 4-nt longer than the original oligonucleotide (comparelane 4 with lane 1). The trace amount of the 9-nt pRNA product in this reaction was probably synthesized from a few non-blocked G4oric molecules among a large population of blocked DNA template. These synthesis results using the G4oric template hybridized with the oligonucleotide in the pRNA transcribed DNA sequence suggested that primase can catalyze the synthesis of RNA by covalent attachment of ribonucleotide to the 3′-end of oligodeoxynucleotide that is hydrogen bonded to the DNA template. It seems that primed RNA synthesis on G4oric template is terminated at the same sites as for pRNA synthesis de novo. Two other oligonucleotides complementary to the G4oric 3′-sequence were then used to repeat the previous experiments. They were 17 and 23 nt long and had the same 3′-end as the 20-nt oligonucleotide. Under limited synthesis conditions with ddCTP terminator, both oligonucleotides generated a strong, large product which was equal in length to the original 17- or 23-nt oligonucleotide plus 4 ribonucleotides, in addition to small amount of the 9-nt de novo product (Fig. 2 A). These results were consistent with the results obtained from the 20-nt oligonucleotide. When 5′-32P-end labeled 17- or 23-nt oligonucleotide and nonradioactive precursor rNTP instead of nonradioactive primers and [α-32P]GTP were used in the limited synthesis reaction, the large species became 32P-labeled but the 9-nt species did not (Fig. 2 B). This result provided direct evidence that the larger species was a synthesis product primed from the oligonucleotide primer and the 9-nt species was a de novopRNA. To map the ribonucleotide sequence added to the 3′-end of oligonucleotides, we used a dideoxy sequencing protocol (Fig. 2 C). The 3′-terminal nucleotide of the oligonucleotides is complementary to the site C+5 for pRNA transcription on G4oric DNA template (5′–GTCCC+5TACT+1G–3′). When only ddGTP and [α-32P]ATP substrates were used in the reaction with 17- or 23-nt primers, no product larger than the oligonucleotide could been seen (lanes 2 and 7). When the reaction was supplemented by [α-32P]GTP and ddATP, a species 3-nt larger than the oligonucleotide appeared (lanes 3 and8). When [α-32P] GTP, ATP, and ddCTP were added in the reaction, one more ribonucleotide (total 4-nt) was incorporated into the product (lanes 4 and 9). As the 5′-GTCC-3′ sequence does not appear in other regions of the 278-nt G4oric, this mapping result confirmed the conclusion of primed RNA synthesized by primase from the 3′ terminus of oligonucleotides annealed to the G4oric. Moreover, it demonstrated that this reaction is a DNA template-directed RNA synthesis. All oligonucleotides used in the synthesis experiments had a 3′-hydroxyl terminus. If priming of RNA synthesis by primase requires a 3′-OH group in the primer, a modification to the 3′-terminal group should destroy this reaction. As expected, the 17- and 23-nt oligonucleotides modified with a 3′-terminal phosphate were unable to be extended for RNA synthesis (Fig. 3). However, like the reaction with unmodified oligonucleotides, a small amount of 9-nt de novopRNA appeared in these reactions. If the primed synthesis product is a DNA-RNA hybrid polynucleotide chain, it should be cleaved either by deoxyribonuclease in its DNA region or by ribonuclease in its RNA region. DNase I that cleaves double-stranded DNA (35Moore S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 14A. Academic Press, San Diego1981: 281-298Google Scholar) and RNase H that only digests RNA in DNA-RNA duplexes (36Berkower L. Leis J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5914-5921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were employed to cleave the primed synthesis product when it remained hybridized with G4oric ssDNA template. The target to be cleaved was a primed product generated from the 17-nt oligonucleotide primer annealed to f1R199/G4oric template under limited synthesis conditions, so that it should consist of 17-nt DNA proportion on the 5′ part and 4-nt newly synthesized RNA on the 3′ part. DNase I and RNase H cleavages were performed immediately following RNA synthesis reaction, then the digests were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The results are shown in Fig. 4; in which the starting primed RNA was 5′-32P-end labeled with radioactive oligonucleotide shown in the left part and was 32P-uniformly labeled in the 3′-RNA region by using nonradioactive oligonucleotide and [α-32P]GTP shown in the right part. When the 5′-32P-end labeled primed product (lane 4) was treated with DNase I, it was degraded into a series of many smaller fragments, accompanied with degradation of excess of the unused 5′-32P-oligonucleotide (compare lane 6 withlane 4). This suggested that DNase I cleaved in the 5′ 17-nt DNA region of the primed product. In contrast, the de novo9-nt pRNA remained intact under DNase I treatment (compare lanes 5 and 3). When cleaved with RNase H, the 5′-32P-end labeled primed species was only reduced in size by one or a few nucleotides (lane 8), which indicted that the cleavage occurred in the 3′ 4-nt RNA region. (The free oligonucleotide in this reaction (lane 8), like the oligonucleotide in the absence of G4oric DNA (lane 7), was slightly digested with RNase H (compare with the no cleavage control in lane 2), which might be due to traces of deoxyribonuclease contamination in the RNase H preparation.) The same cleavage results were obtained from the primed product 32P uniformly labeled in the 3′-RNA region. Compared with uncut control (lane 10), the product was degraded by DNase I into a series of smaller fragments (lane 12) and by RNase H cleavage into a few slight shorter fragments (lane 14). The 9-nt de novo pRNA (lane 9) was degraded by RNase H as well (lane 13). These nuclease cleavage results proved that the primed product synthesized by primase was a DNA-RNA hybrid polynucleotide. The efficiency of extending RNA chains on the oligonucleotide primer by primase appeared to be similar to the efficiency of pRNA synthesis de novowhen estimated from the relative intensity of product bands in polyacrylamide gels. For example, in the complete synthesis reaction in Fig. 1 B, the amounts of the two products judged from the density of the radioactive bands were similar; under limited synthesis conditions in Figs. 1 C and 2 A, the amounts of primed product seemed to decrease to about half of the nascent pRNA, which corresponded with 2 [α-32P]GMP molecules that would be incorporated in one extended RNA chain and 4 [α-32P]GMP incorporated into one de novopRNA molecule (see Fig. 1 A). Quantitation by PhosphorImager (Table I) of the two types of RNA yielded from increasing incubation times (1–30 min) showed that the efficiency of primed synthesis was always 80–90% of the efficiency of pRNA synthesis de novo (the 9-nt species). As there was a background of approximately 5–10% G4oric DNA molecules that were unbound by the oligonucleotide in these experiments (which was calculated from 9-nt pRNA synthesized in the priming reaction compared with that in the normal synthesis reaction), the efficiency of primed synthesis and de novo synthesis were very close. Both primed and de novo syntheses reached a plateau of the maximum after a 10-min reaction (Table I).Table IEfficiency of primed RNA synthesis and de novo pRNA synthesisRNA and templatesValue of [32P]GMP incorporated in RNA1 min5 min10 min15 min20 min30 minPrimed RNA (G4oric + 17-nt oligo)3502,53212,0849,58211,01010,132de novo RNA (G4oricalone)4833,30915,50210,53612,37112,916Ratio of value (%)727778918978 Primed: de novo RNARNA was synthesized from templates of G4oric 278 nt alone or annealed by the 17-nt oligonucleotide under the limited conditions with ddCTP terminator and uniformly labeled with [α-32P]GTP.

As 2 molecules of [α-32P]GMP were incorporated into one primed RNA chain and 4 molecules of [α-32P]GMP incorporated into one 9-nt nascent pRNA (see Fig. 1 A), the values of primed products have been doubled in this table. Open table in a new tab RNA was synthesized from templates of G4oric 278 nt alone or annealed by the 17-nt oligonucleotide under the limited conditions with ddCTP terminator and uniformly labeled with [α-32P]GTP. RNA synthesis reactions were incubated from 1 to 30 min. The products were separated in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The value of each radioactive product was quantitated by a PhosphorImager. As 2 molecules of [α-32P]GMP were incorporated into one primed RNA chain and 4 molecules of [α-32P]GMP incorporated into one 9-nt nascent pRNA (see Fig. 1 A), the values of primed products have been doubled in this table. We have so far shown that the oligonucleotide-primed synthesis of RNA by primase on G4oric DNA took place immediately downstream of the pRNA initiation site. We had found, in fact, that only weak primed RNA synthesis occurred if oligonucleotides were hybridized outside of the DNA sequence for pRNA transcription on G4oric. Fig. 5 shows some results of primed synthesis using oligonucleotides that were complementary to the 5′-sequence flanking the core stem-loop structures of G4oric. In order to eliminate a background of RNA synthesized de novo from the initiation site, we used ddNTP terminators to limit chain extension. When 278-nt G4oricannealed with a 20-nt 5′-complementary oligonucleotide was used for RNA synthesis in the presence of UTP and ddGTP (Fig. 5 B, lane 3) or UTP, GTP, and ddATP (lane 4), it yielded a very small amount of a primed product that was 2-nt longer than the starting oligonucleotide. This species did not appear in a control reaction with unannealed G4oric (lane 5). A similar result was obtained from a 15-nt 5′-complementary oligonucleotide with shorter 3′-sequence. Only a trace of the primed product (adding 2-nt) was generated in a reaction containing GTP and ddATP (lane 7) and a trace of primed products (adding 2, 5, and 6 nt) were generated in a reaction containing GTP, ATP, UTP, and ddCTP (lane 8). In the latter reaction, the 9-nt nascent pRNA was synthesized normally from the initiation site as well, like that from a unannealed template (lane 9). Later, we tested the primed synthesis of RNA on a number of oligonucleotides that hybridized beyond (upstream and downstream) the pRNA transcribed sequence on G4oric and obtained the same results (data to be published). These results show that primed synthesis on G4oric outside of the pRNA transcribed sequence is much poorer than that within this sequence as described before. The specificity of DNA sequence required by primase for the primed RNA synthesis, therefore, seems in agreement with that for de novo RNA synthesis in the primase/SSB/G4oric system. The oligonucleotide-primed synthesis of RNA by primase was also examined in the primase/DnaB/ssDNA general priming system since this system contains many pRNA initiation sites (16Arai K.-I.
