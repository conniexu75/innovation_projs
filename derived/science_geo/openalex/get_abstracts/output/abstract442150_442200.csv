https://openalex.org/W2112303826,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis resides and replicates within host phagocytes by modulating host microbicidal responses. In addition, it suppresses the production of host protective cytokines to prevent activation of and antigen presentation by M. tuberculosis-infected cells, causing dysregulation of host protective adaptive immune responses. Many cytokines are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), a newly discovered class of small noncoding RNAs, which have been implicated in modulating host immune responses in many bacterial and viral diseases. Here, we show that miRNA-99b (miR-99b), an orphan miRNA, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection. We found that miR-99b expression was highly up-regulated in M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv-infected dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Blockade of miR-99b expression by antagomirs resulted in significantly reduced bacterial growth in DCs. Interestingly, knockdown of miR-99b in DCs significantly up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1β. Furthermore, mRNA and membrane-bound protein data indicated that inhibition of miR-99b augments TNF-α and TNFRSF-4 production. Thus, miR-99b targets TNF-α and TNFRSF-4 receptor genes. Treatment of anti-miR-99b-transfected DCs with anti-TNF-α antibody resulted in increased bacterial burden. Thus, our findings unveil a novel host evasion mechanism adopted by M. tuberculosis via miR-99b, which may open up new avenues for designing miRNA-based vaccines and therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2002768720,"Breast cancer is often fatal during its metastatic dissemination. To unravel the role of microRNAs (miRs) during malignancy, we analyzed miR expression in 77 primary breast carcinomas and identified 16 relapse-associated miRs that correlate with survival and/or distinguish tumor subtypes in different datasets. Among them, miR-148b, down-regulated in aggressive breast tumors, was found to be a major coordinator of malignancy. In fact, it is able to oppose various steps of tumor progression when overexpressed in cell lines by influencing invasion, survival to anoikis, extravasation, lung metastasis formation, and chemotherapy response. miR-148b controls malignancy by coordinating a novel pathway involving over 130 genes and, in particular, it directly targets players of the integrin signaling, such as ITGA5, ROCK1, PIK3CA/p110α, and NRAS, as well as CSF1, a growth factor for stroma cells. Our findings reveal the importance of the identified 16 miRs for disease outcome predictions and suggest a critical role for miR-148b in the control of breast cancer progression.—Cimino, D., De Pittà, C., Orso, F., Zampini, M., Casara, C., Penna, E., Quaglino, E., Forni, M., Damasco, C., Pinatel, E., Ponzone, R., Romualdi, C., Brisken, C., De Bortoli, M., Biglia, N., Provero, P., Lanfranchi, G., Taverna, D. miR148b is a major coordinator of breast cancer progression in a relapse-associated microRNA signature by targeting ITGA5, ROCK1, PIK3CA, NRAS, and CSF1.

https://openalex.org/W2079711015,"Plants must deal effectively with unfavorable growth conditions that necessitate a coordinated response to integrate cellular signals with mitochondrial retrograde signals. A genetic screen was carried out to identify regulators of alternative oxidase (rao mutants), using AOX1a expression as a model system to study retrograde signaling in plants. Two independent rao1 mutant alleles identified CDKE1 as a central nuclear component integrating mitochondrial retrograde signals with energy signals under stress. CDKE1 is also necessary for responses to general cellular stresses, such as H(2)O(2) and cold that act, at least in part, via anterograde pathways, and integrates signals from central energy/stress sensing kinase signal transduction pathways within the nucleus. Together, these results place CDKE1 as a central kinase integrating diverse cellular signals and shed light on a mechanism by which plants can effectively switch between growth and stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W1991194120,"Plant species with physical seed dormancy are common in mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems. Because fire breaks seed dormancy and enhances the recruitment of many species, this trait might be considered adaptive in fire-prone environments. However, to what extent the temperature thresholds that break physical seed dormancy have been shaped by fire (i.e., for post-fire recruitment) or by summer temperatures in the bare soil (i.e., for recruitment in fire-independent gaps) remains unknown. Our hypothesis is that the temperature thresholds that break physical seed dormancy have been shaped by fire and thus we predict higher dormancy lost in response to fire than in response to summer temperatures. We tested this hypothesis in six woody species with physical seed dormancy occurring in fire-prone areas across the Mediterranean Basin. Seeds from different populations of each species were subject to heat treatments simulating fire (i.e., a single high temperature peak of 100°C, 120°C or 150°C for 5 minutes) and heat treatments simulating summer (i.e., temperature fluctuations; 30 daily cycles of 3 hours at 31°C, 4 hours at 43°C, 3 hours at 33°C and 14 hours at 18°C). Fire treatments broke dormancy and stimulated germination in all populations of all species. In contrast, summer treatments had no effect over the seed dormancy for most species and only enhanced the germination in Ulex parviflorus, although less than the fire treatments. Our results suggest that in Mediterranean species with physical dormancy, the temperature thresholds necessary to trigger seed germination are better explained as a response to fire than as a response to summer temperatures. The high level of dormancy release by the heat produced by fire might enforce most recruitment to be capitalized into a single post-fire pulse when the most favorable conditions occur. This supports the important role of fire in shaping seed traits."
https://openalex.org/W2124792307,"Objective Single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to monitor changes in brain inflammation and neuronal integrity associated with HIV infection and its treatments. We used MRS to measure brain changes during the first weeks following HIV infection and in response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods Brain metabolite levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (tCHO), creatine (CR), myoinositol (MI), and glutamate and glutamine (GLX) were measured in acute HIV subjects (n = 31) and compared to chronic HIV+individuals (n = 26) and HIV negative control subjects (n = 10) from Bangkok, Thailand. Metabolites were measured in frontal gray matter (FGM), frontal white matter (FWM), occipital gray matter (OGM), and basal ganglia (BG). Repeat measures were obtained in 17 acute subjects 1, 3 and 6 months following initiation of ART. Results After adjustment for age we identified elevated BG tCHO/CR in acute HIV cases at baseline (median 14 days after HIV infection) compared to control (p = 0.0014), as well as chronic subjects (p = 0.0023). A similar tCHO/CR elevation was noted in OGM; no other metabolite abnormalities were seen between acute and control subjects. Mixed longitudinal models revealed resolution of BG tCHO/CR elevation after ART (p = 0.022) with tCHO/CR similar to control subjects at 6 months. Interpretation We detected cellular inflammation in the absence of measurable neuronal injury within the first month of HIV infection, and normalization of this inflammation following acutely administered ART. Our findings suggest that early ART may be neuroprotective in HIV infection by mitigating processes leading to CNS injury."
https://openalex.org/W2155723403,"Embryo implantation requires extensive angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface. Hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG-H), a trophoblast invasive signal produced by extravillous cytotrophoblasts and by choriocarcinoma, was evaluated for its angiogenic role. hCG-H was purified by HPLC from choriocarcinoma supernatant, and the glycosylation pattern was determined by 2D gel analysis. Angiogenesis models used were aortic ring assay with wild-type and LHCGR-knockout mice, endothelial and mural cell proliferation, and migration assays. The TGF-β signaling pathway was studied by coimmunoprecipitation, competitive binding, TGF-β reporter gene assays, and Smad immunoblotting. hCG-H displayed a potent angiogenic effect [3.2-fold increase of number of vessel intersections in wild-type aortic rings (11.406 to 36.964)]. hCG-H-induced angiostimulation was independent of the classic hCG signaling pathway since it persisted in LHCGR-knockout mice [4.73-fold increase of number of vessel intersections (10.826 to 51.288)]. Using TGF-β signaling inhibitors, Tβ-RII was identified as the hCG-H receptor responsible for its angiogenic switch. hCG-H exposure enhanced phosphorylation of Smad 2 in endothelial and mural cells and genomic activation of Smad-responsive elements. Interaction between hCG-H and Tβ-RII was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and binding competition with (125)I-TGF-β. This new paracrine interaction between trophoblast and endothelial cells through the hCG-H and the TGF-β receptor complex plays a key role in angiogenesis associated with placental development and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008714599,"Genetic variants in the fatty acid (FA) translocase FAT/CD36 associate with abnormal postprandial lipids and influence risk for the metabolic syndrome. CD36 is abundant on apical enterocyte membranes in the proximal small intestine, where it facilitates FA uptake and FA-initiated signaling. We explored whether CD36 signaling influences FA-mediated secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin, peptides released by enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the duodenum/jejunum, which regulate events important for fat digestion and homeostasis. CD36 was immunodetected on apical membranes of secretin- and CCK-positive EECs and colocalized with cytosolic granules. Intragastric lipid administration to CD36 mice released less secretin (-60%) and CCK (-50%) compared with wild-type mice. Likewise, diminished secretin and CCK responses to FA were observed with CD36 intestinal segments in vitro, arguing against influence of alterations in fat absorption. Signaling mechanisms underlying peptide release were examined in STC-1 cells stably expressing human CD36 or a signaling-impaired mutant (CD36K/A). FA stimulation of cells expressing CD36 (vs. vector or CD36K/A) released more secretin (3.5- to 4-fold) and CCK (2- to 3-fold), generated more cAMP (2- to 2.5-fold), and enhanced protein kinase A activation. Protein kinase A inhibition (H-89) blunted secretin (80%) but not CCK release, which was reduced (50%) by blocking of calmodulin kinase II (KN-62). Coculture of STC-1 cells with Caco-2 cells stably expressing CD36 did not alter secretin or CCK release, consistent with a minimal effect of adjacent enterocytes. In summary, CD36 is a major mediator of FA-induced release of CCK and secretin. These peptides contribute to the role of CD36 in fat absorption and to its pleiotropic metabolic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2091221679,"Peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) is a common clinical technique known to induce changes in corticomotor excitability; PES applied to induce a tetanic motor contraction increases, and PES at sub-motor threshold (sensory) intensities decreases, corticomotor excitability. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying these opposite changes in corticomotor excitability remains elusive. Modulation of primary sensory cortex (S1) excitability could underlie altered corticomotor excitability with PES. Here we examined whether changes in primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex excitability follow the same time-course when PES is applied using identical stimulus parameters. Corticomotor excitability was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and sensory cortex excitability using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) before and after 30 min of PES to right abductor pollicis brevis (APB). Two PES paradigms were tested in separate sessions; PES sufficient to induce a tetanic motor contraction (30–50 Hz; strong motor intensity) and PES at sub motor-threshold intensity (100 Hz). PES applied to induce strong activation of APB increased the size of the N20-P25 component, thought to reflect sensory processing at cortical level, and increased corticomotor excitability. PES at sensory intensity decreased the size of the P25-N33 component and reduced corticomotor excitability. A positive correlation was observed between the changes in amplitude of the cortical SEP components and corticomotor excitability following sensory and motor PES. Sensory PES also increased the sub-cortical P14-N20 SEP component. These findings provide evidence that PES results in co-modulation of S1 and M1 excitability, possibly due to cortico-cortical projections between S1 and M1. This mechanism may underpin changes in corticomotor excitability in response to afferent input generated by PES."
https://openalex.org/W2066472475,"The ubiquitin-like molecule ISG15 (UCRP) and protein modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) are strongly induced by interferon, genotoxic stress, and pathogen infection, suggesting that ISG15 plays an important role in innate immune responses. However, how ISGylation contributes to innate immune responses is not clear. The dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) inhibits translation by phosphorylating eIF2α to exert its anti-viral effect. ISG15 and PKR are induced by interferon, suggesting that a relationship exists between ISGylation and translational regulation. Here, we report that PKR is ISGylated at lysines 69 and 159. ISG15-modified PKR is active in the absence of virus infection and phosphorylates eIF2α to down-regulate protein translation. The present study describes a novel pathway for the activation of PKR and the regulation of protein translation."
https://openalex.org/W2119751810,"Mutation of PHF6, which results in the X-linked mental retardation disorder Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, is also present in about 38% of adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 3% of adult acute myeloid leukemias. However, it remains to be determined exactly how PHF6 acts in vivo and what functions of PHF6 may be associated with its putative tumor suppressor function. Here, we demonstrate that PHF6 is a nucleolus, ribosomal RNA promoter-associated protein. PHF6 directly interacts with upstream binding factor (UBF) through its PHD1 domain and suppresses ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription by affecting the protein level of UBF. Knockdown of PHF6 impairs cell proliferation and arrests cells at G(2)/M phase, which is accompanied by an increased level of phosphorylated H2AX, indicating that PHF6 deficiency leads to the accumulation of DNA damage in the cell. We found that increased DNA damage occurs at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus in PHF6-deficient cells. This effect could be reversed by knocking down UBF or overexpressing RNASE1, which removes RNA-DNA hybrids, suggesting that there is a functional link between rRNA synthesis and genomic stability at the rDNA locus. Together, these results reveal that the key function of PHF6 is involved in regulating rRNA synthesis, which may contribute to its roles in cell cycle control, genomic maintenance, and tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2050115187,"The gene encoding the liver-specific peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT, EC. 2.6.1.44) exists as two common polymorphic variants termed the “major” and “minor” alleles. The P11L amino acid replacement encoded by the minor allele creates a hidden N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, the unmasking of which occurs in the hereditary calcium oxalate kidney stone disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). This unmasking is due to the additional presence of a common disease-specific G170R mutation, which is encoded by about one third of PH1 alleles. The P11L and G170R replacements interact synergistically to reroute AGT to the mitochondria where it cannot fulfill its metabolic role (i.e. glyoxylate detoxification) effectively. In the present study, we have reinvestigated the consequences of the interaction between P11L and G170R in stably transformed CHO cells and have studied for the first time whether a similar synergism exists between P11L and three other mutations that segregate with the minor allele (i.e. I244T, F152I, and G41R). Our investigations show that the latter three mutants are all able to unmask the cryptic P11L-generated mitochondrial targeting sequence and, as a result, all are mistargeted to the mitochondria. However, whereas the G170R, I244T, and F152I mutants are able to form dimers and are catalytically active, the G41R mutant aggregates and is inactive.

https://openalex.org/W2083749456,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) binds G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P(1-5)) to regulate a multitude of physiological effects, especially those in the vascular and immune systems. S1P receptors in the vascular system have been characterized primarily in mammals. Here, we report that the S1P receptors and metabolic enzymes are conserved in the genome of zebrafish Danio rerio. Bioinformatic analysis identified seven S1P receptor-like sequences in the zebrafish genome, including duplicated orthologs of receptors 3 and 5. Sphingolipidomic analysis detected erythrocyte and plasma S1P as well as high plasma ceramides and sphingosine. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of s1pr1 causes global and pericardial edema, loss of blood circulation, and vascular defects characterized by both reduced vascularization in intersegmental vessels, decreased proliferation of intersegmental and axial vessels, and hypersprouting in the caudal vein plexus. The s1pr2 gene was previously characterized as a regulator of cell migration and heart development, but its role in angiogenesis is not known. However, when expression of both s1pr1 and s1pr2 is suppressed, severely reduced vascular development of the intersegmental vessels was observed with doses of the s1pr1 morpholino that alone did not cause any discernible vascular defects, suggesting that s1pr1 and s1pr2 function cooperatively to regulate vascular development in zebrafish. Similarly, the S1P transporter, spns2, also cooperated with s1pr1. We propose that extracellular S1P acts through vascular S1P receptors to regulate vascular development."
https://openalex.org/W2017123814,"Caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is the most favorable candidate for chromatin degradation during apoptosis. Ca(2+)-dependent endonucleases are equally important in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (INDF), including the PARP-1-regulated DNAS1L3. Despite the elaborate work on these endonucleases, the question of whether these enzymes cooperate during INDF was not addressed. Here, we show a lack of correlation between INDF and CAD expression levels and inactivation by cleavage of its inhibitor (ICAD) during apoptosis. The cells that failed to induce INDF accumulated large amounts of 50-kb breaks, which is suggestive of incomplete chromatin processing. Similarly, INDF was blocked by Ca(2+) chelation without a block in ICAD cleavage or caspase-3 activation, which is consistent with the involvement of CAD in 50-kb DNA fragmentation and its Ca(2+) independence. However, DNAS1L3 expression in INDF-deficient cells promoted INDF during apoptosis and was blocked by Ca(2+) chelation. Interestingly, expression of DNAS1L3 in ICAD-deficient cells failed to promote tumor necrosis factor α-induced INDF but required the coexpression of ICAD. These results suggest a cooperative activity between CAD and DNAS1L3 to accomplish INDF. In HT-29 cells, endogenous DNAS1L3 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and translocated to the nucleus upon apoptosis induction but prior to INDF manifestation, making it the first reported Ca(2+)-dependent endonuclease to migrate from the ER to the nucleus. The nuclear accumulation of DNAS1L3, but not its exit out of the ER, required the activity of cysteine and serine proteases. Interestingly, the endonuclease accumulated in the cytosol upon inhibition of serine, but not cysteine, proteases. These results exemplify the complexity of chromatin degradation during apoptosis."

Because the enzymatic proteolysis of a hyaluronan and versican-rich matrix by ADAMTS versicanases is required for developmental morphogenesis, we hypothesized that the clearance of versican may facilitate the fusion of myoblasts during myogenesis. Here, we used transgenic mice and an in vitro model of myoblast fusion, C2C12 cells, to determine a potential role for ADAMTS versicanases. Versican processing was observed during in vivo myogenesis at the time when myoblasts were fusing to form multinucleated myotubes.

It does so by stabilizing contracting muscle fibers via the membrane dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and by contributing the collagen-rich force transmitting matrix that fuses with tendons (1Grounds M.D. Sorokin L. White J. Strength at the extracellular matrix-muscle interface.Scand. J. Med. Sci. Sports. 2005; 15: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).

Myogenesis is a dynamic process in which proliferating myoblasts align and merge via membrane-membrane fusion to form multinucleated contractile muscle fibers (3Horsley V. Pavlath G.K.

Lessons from flies and mice.Development. 2012; 139: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The efficient fusion of myoblasts into muscle fibers and their correct attachment to a highly specialized ECM surrounding those fibers are critical determinants of correct muscle formation, growth, regeneration, and contractile function (1Grounds M.D. Sorokin L.

Thus, myoblast interactions with the ECM and their synthesis of ECM components are important for normal skeletal muscle development and regeneration (5Melo F. Carey D.J. Brandan E. Extracellular matrix is required for skeletal muscle differentiation but not myogenin expression.J. Cell Biochem. 1996; 62: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and as such the ECM needs to be coordinately remodeled during myoblast proliferation and fusion (6Calve S. Simon H.G.

Most embryonic cells and many adult cells have a surrounding matrix named the pericellular matrix, which is rich in hyaluronan (HA) and a HA-bound large proteoglycan, such as aggrecan in cartilage, and versican in most other connective tissue/mesenchymal cells (7Landolt R.M.

This aggregating complex binds to cell surface receptors such as CD44, and contributes to formation of a hydrated pericellular matrix with the ability to exclude particulate matter. Functionally, such a matrix can be considered as a transitional matrix, a dynamic entity that is readily remodeled by new matrix synthesis and specific enzymes (9Knudson C.B. Toole B.P. Hyaluronate-cell interactions during differentiation of chick embryo limb mesoderm.Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Such enzymes include hyaluronidases and proteinases capable of clipping the versican core protein. Emerging evidence in the literature suggests that myoblasts may also express a pericellular matrix rich in versican (10Snow H.E. Riccio L.M. Mjaatvedt C.H. Hoffman S. Capehart A.A.

However, the role of versican and its remodeling is poorly defined, even though it may be an important driver in myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration. Four splice variants of versican are known, and are derived from inclusion (or not) of alternative chondroitin sulfate-rich domains named GAG-α or GAG-β. The isoforms V1 (containing GAG-β) and V0 (GAG-α or GAG-β) are the most abundant in non-neural tissues.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the significance of myoblast pericellular matrix and its clearance by ADAMTS proteinases during myotube formation. In particular, we focused on the potential role of ADAMTS5 in remodeling versican, because it is strongly expressed in developing skeletal muscle and cleaves both aggrecan and versican (15McCulloch D.R.

ADAMTS5 is a major target for arthritis therapy because cartilage aggrecan degradation is not seen in mice lacking ADAMTS5 following experimentally induced inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis (18Glasson S.S.

However, ADAMTS5 also has important functions in physiology, particularly during embryonic development. Thus a thorough understanding of its biological function(s) in skeletal muscle is paramount, given arthritis patients are also likely to present with muscle wasting due to the immobilizing nature of the disease. This current study exemplifies the importance of ADAMTS5 and the related versicanase, ADAMTS15, in the process of myoblast fusion leading to mature muscle fiber formation. Mouse experiments were carried out in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for the care and use of animals in research under the approval of the Animal Welfare Committee, Deakin University. Some experiments were done under an IACUC-approved protocol at the Cleveland Clinic. Six-week-old C57/Bl6J (Animal Resources Centre, WA, Australia) mice were mated after 1700 h and conception was confirmed before 0900 h the next morning by observation of vaginal mucous. The morning of conception was designated as gestational age 0.5 days post-coitus (E0.5). Proximal hind limbs of embryonic ages E12.5 through E14.5, or proximal hind limb muscles of older embryos (dissected away from osseous tissue) were collected and stored in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Mulgrave, Australia) at −80 °C for mRNA analyses or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunostaining.

For time course analysis of differentiation, cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/cm2 and collected 24 (proliferation) and 48 h later (when confluent), after which differentiation medium (DMEM + 2% horse serum) was added. For the first 48 h of differentiation, the medium contained 10 μm Ara-C (Sigma) to stimulate cell cycle withdrawal. The time points were 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 4 days, and 6 days (differentiation). Media was changed every 24 h. Cells were harvested in triplicate wells, collected in TRIzol, and stored at −80 °C. For siRNA transfection, C2C12 myoblasts were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 16,000 cells/cm2 and grown to 60–70% confluence.

After 5 h, the transfection media were replaced with growth media. Differentiation was induced the following day when the cells reached ∼90% confluence by changing to differentiation media. For the first 48 h of differentiation, 10 μm Ara-C was included to stimulate cell cycle withdrawal. The differentiation medium was changed every 24 h. For the rescue experiments, conditioned medium from HEK293T cells transfected with cDNA expression constructs (see below) was used at a dilution of 1:4 in differentiation media from 24 h differentiation until the experimental end-point (72 h differentiation) when the fusion index was calculated.

The secondary antibodies used were FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). For desmin staining, myotubes were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated in 1/200 dilution of either rabbit anti-desmin polyclonal primary antibody (Abcam) or mouse monoclonal anti-desmin in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS (Sigma). Cells were then incubated with either FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG or Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG (1:25 dilution) in 1% BSA/PBS. Nuclei were counterstained with either TO-PRO-3 iodide or DAPI (Invitrogen). For each experimental treatment, 15 digital images were captured with either an IX81 or IX71 Olympus inverted fluorescence microscope and a CC12 or an XM10 camera (Olympus). A well formed myotube was identified and an image of the founder myotube was captured, followed by two random images in the immediate vicinity (within 2 fields of view). This process was repeated for a total of five times, yielding 15 images per experimental group per experiment. To determine the fusion index, nuclei were counted and designated as either fused or unfused, using the Count tool in Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended (Version 12.0) software. Fusion index was calculated as the percentage of fused nuclei as a proportion of total nuclei. Myoblasts were considered to be unfused if the cell contained only one or two nuclei; myotubes with three nuclei per cell were considered to be nascent myotubes for the purpose of calculating fusion index. Three independent experiments, performed in duplicate, were used for the determination of fusion index and ∼2,000–2500 nuclei were counted per experimental condition, per experiment. To assess the effect of Adamt5 siRNA treatment on nascent myotube formation and maturation, the total number of myotubes per field of view was counted whereby myotubes containing 2–4 nuclei were designated as nascent and 5–9 nuclei or 10+ nuclei were designated as mature (24Horsley V.

Approximately 520–570 myotubes were counted per control or siRNA-treated groups across 6 independent experiments each performed in duplicate. Cells were lysed with 150 μl of lysis buffer containing 40 mm MES buffer, 50 mm Trizma (Tris base), 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was used for analysis of creatine kinase activity. Three technical replicates for each sample were performed in a 96-well plate using creatine kinase-NAC (Thermo Scientific). Creatine kinase activity was measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm over 3 min (20-s intervals) at 37 °C. Units per liter (units/liter) was calculated using the following formula: Ik = (TV × 1000)/(A × SV × P), where TV is the total reaction volume (0.210 ml), A is the millimolar absorption coefficient of NADH at 340 nm (6.3), SV is the sample volume (0.010 ml), and P is the unique path length of light in the 96-well plate (determined to be 0.533 cm by spectrophotometric comparison of absorbance with known path lengths). Total levels of TGF-β were measured in 40-μl aliquots of media collected from C2C12 cell cultures by an ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h differentiation, dead cells were collected and adherent cells were trypsinized and collected into the same FACS tube. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.2% BSA/PBS containing 7-aminoactinomycin D. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 1% formaldehyde containing 2% FBS and 2 μg/ml of actinomycin. The percentage of viable cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis using CELLQuest software. Cell number and viability was also determined using trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion staining and manual cell counts on a hemocytometer. The assay was done essentially as previously described by Hattori et al. (27Hattori N. Carrino D.A. Lauer M.E. Vasanji A. Wylie J.D. Nelson C.M. Apte S.S.

https://openalex.org/W2070933064,"Early-onset preeclampsia (EPE) is a severe form of preeclampsia that involves life-threatening neurological complications. However, the underlying mechanism by which EPE affects the maternal brain is not known. We hypothesized that plasma from women with EPE increases blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability vs. plasma from women with late-onset preeclampsia (LPE) or normal pregnancy (NP) and investigated its underlying mechanism by perfusing cerebral veins from nonpregnant rats (n=6–7/group) with human plasma from women with EPE, LPE, or NP and measuring permeability. We show that plasma from women with EPE significantly increased BBB permeability vs. plasma from women with LPE or NP (P<0.001). BBB disruption in response to EPE plasma was due to a 260% increase of circulating oxidized LDL (oxLDL) binding to its receptor, LOX-1, and subsequent generation of peroxynitrite (P<0.001). A rat model with pathologically high lipid levels in pregnancy showed symptoms of preeclampsia, including elevated blood pressure, growth-restricted fetuses, and LOX-1-dependent BBB disruption, similar to EPE (P<0.05). Thus, we have identified LOX-1 activation by oxLDL and subsequent peroxynitrite generation as a novel mechanism by which disruption of the BBB occurs in EPE. As increased BBB permeability is a primary means by which seizure and other neurological symptoms ensue, our findings highlight oxLDL, LOX-1, and peroxynitrite as important therapeutic targets in EPE.—Schreurs, M.

https://openalex.org/W1983659347,"Hsp100 chaperones cooperate with the Hsp70 chaperone system to disaggregate and reactivate heat-denatured aggregated proteins to promote cell survival after heat stress. The homology models of Hsp100 disaggregases suggest the presence of a conserved network of ionic interactions between the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) and the coiled-coil middle subdomain, the signature domain of disaggregating chaperones. Mutations intended to disrupt the putative ionic interactions in yeast Hsp104 and bacterial ClpB disaggregases resulted in remarkable changes of their biochemical properties. These included an increase in ATPase activity, a significant increase in the rate of in vitro substrate renaturation, and partial independence from the Hsp70 chaperone in disaggregation. Paradoxically, the increased activities resulted in serious growth impediments in yeast and bacterial cells instead of improvement of their thermotolerance. Our results suggest that this toxic activity is due to the ability of the mutated disaggregases to unfold independently from Hsp70, native folded proteins. Complementary changes that restore particular salt bridges within the suggested network suppressed the toxic effects. We propose a novel structural aspect of Hsp100 chaperones crucial for specificity and efficiency of the disaggregation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1984221986,"Studies of misfolded protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) have largely focused on glycoproteins, which include the bulk of the secretory proteins. Mechanisms of targeting of nonglycosylated proteins are less clear. Here, we studied three nonglycosylated proteins and analyzed their use of known glycoprotein quality control and ERAD components. Similar to an established glycosylated ERAD substrate, the uncleaved precursor of asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a, its nonglycosylated mutant, makes use of calnexin, EDEM1, and HRD1, but only glycosylated H2a is a substrate for the cytosolic SCF(Fbs2) E3 ubiquitin ligase with lectin activity. Two nonglycosylated BiP substrates, NS-1κ light chain and truncated Igγ heavy chain, interact with the ERAD complex lectins OS-9 and XTP3-B and require EDEM1 for degradation. EDEM1 associates through a region outside of its mannosidase-like domain with the nonglycosylated proteins. Similar to glycosylated substrates, proteasomal inhibition induced accumulation of the nonglycosylated proteins and ERAD machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum-derived quality control compartment. Our results suggest a shared ERAD pathway for glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins composed of luminal lectin machinery components also capable of protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1994591251,"In Escherichia coli, the cell division protein FtsZ is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by the action of the bitopic membrane protein ZipA and the cytoplasmic protein FtsA. Although the presence of both ZipA and FtsA is strictly indispensable for cell division, an FtsA gain-of-function mutant FtsA* (R286W) can bypass the ZipA requirement for cell division. This observation casts doubts on the role of ZipA and its need for cell division. Maxicells are nucleoid-free bacterial cells used as a whole cell in vitro system to probe protein-protein interactions without the need of protein purification. We show that ZipA protects FtsZ from the ClpXP-directed degradation observed in E. coli maxicells and that ZipA-stabilized FtsZ forms membrane-attached spiral-like structures in the bacterial cytoplasm. The overproduction of the FtsZ-binding ZipA domain is sufficient to protect FtsZ from degradation, whereas other C-terminal ZipA partial deletions lacking it are not. Individual overproduction of the proto-ring component FtsA or its gain-of-function mutant FtsA* does not result in FtsZ protection. Overproduction of FtsA or FtsA* together with ZipA does not interfere with the FtsZ protection. Moreover, neither FtsA nor FtsA* protects FtsZ when overproduced together with ZipA mutants lacking the FZB domain. We propose that ZipA protects FtsZ from degradation by ClpP by making the FtsZ site of interaction unavailable to the ClpX moiety of the ClpXP protease. This role cannot be replaced by either FtsA or FtsA*, suggesting a unique function for ZipA in proto-ring stability.Background: ZipA attaches FtsZ to the E. coli inner membrane, its action can be bypassed by FtsA* gain-of-function mutants.Results: FtsZ levels, decreased by ClpP in maxicells, are maintained by an excess of ZipA, but not FtsA+ or FtsA*.Conclusion: ZipA may protect FtsZ from ClpP degradation by preventing recognition by ClpX.Significance: ZipA cannot be fully replaced by the other proto-ring proteins.

ZipA is an Escherichia coli bitopic cytoplasmic membrane protein with a short periplasmic N-terminal region, a single transmembrane segment, and a large cytosolic C-terminal part (1Hale C.A. de Boer P.A.

Together with FtsA, it helps to anchor the cytoplasmic FtsZ to the membrane forming a proto-ring at an early phase of divisome formation at midcell (revised in Refs. 3Vicente M. Rico A.I.

The order of the ring: assembly of Escherichia coli cell division components.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although an FtsZ-ring can assemble at midcell either in the presence of FtsA or ZipA, its long term stability depends on the simultaneous presence of both proteins (5Addinall S.G. Bi E. Lutkenhaus J.

Unique and overlapping roles for ZipA and FtsA in septal ring assembly in Escherichia coli.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The largely flexible cytoplasmic region of ZipA contains three domains: the Map-Tau repeat, the proline-glutamine-enriched region (P/Q domain) 5The abbreviations used are: P/Q domainproline-glutamine-enriched regionFZBFtsZ-bindingIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosidePDBProtein Data Bank. and the globular domain at the C terminus. Structural data show that the globular domain (also named FtsZ-binding domain, FZB) interacts directly with FtsZ (8Mosyak L. Zhang Y. Glasfeld E. Haney S. Stahl M. Seehra J. Somers W.S. The bacterial cell division protein ZipA and its interaction with an FtsZ fragment revealed by x-ray crystallography.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3179-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The ZipA-FtsZ interaction seems to be limited to this region because the P/Q domain most likely folds as a long extended unstructured arm linking the bound FtsZ molecule to the cytoplasmic membrane. No function in FtsZ binding has been assigned to the Map-Tau repeat because topologically it is located near the membrane surface, thus being far away from the FZB domain (2RayChaudhuri D.

Löwe J. Crystal structure of the cell division protein FtsA from Thermotoga maritima.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5300-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The structural features of the region of FtsA-FtsZ interaction have been determined for the crystallized Thermotoga maritima FtsA in the presence of the T. maritima FtsZ C-terminal peptide (13Szwedziak P. Wang Q. Freund S.M. Löwe J. FtsA forms actin-like protofilaments.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2249-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Whether the binding of the FtsZ-ring to the membrane occurs alternatively via ZipA or FtsA or whether both proteins are needed simultaneously is still unresolved. Several FtsA gain-of-function mutants have been isolated and described to bypass the need for ZipA (14Geissler B. Elraheb D. Margolin W. A gain-of-function mutation in ftsA bypasses the requirement for the essential cell division gene zipA in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microbiol. 2012; 83: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among the best characterized, FtsA* contains a single amino acid substitution of arginine to tryptophan at position 286 (14Geissler B. Elraheb D. Margolin W. A gain-of-function mutation in ftsA bypasses the requirement for the essential cell division gene zipA in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This mutant can bypass the ZipA requirement for assembling a division ring and also suppress the cell division inhibitory effect produced by an excess of ZipA (14Geissler B. Elraheb D. Margolin W. A gain-of-function mutation in ftsA bypasses the requirement for the essential cell division gene zipA in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). FtsA* has a stronger effect on the stabilization of the FtsZ-ring (14Geissler B. Elraheb D. Margolin W. A gain-of-function mutation in ftsA bypasses the requirement for the essential cell division gene zipA in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As the role of ZipA can be partially bypassed by FtsA* and as the zipA gene has only been identified in γ-proteobacteria (16Margolin W. Vicente M. Tamames J. Valencia A. Mingorance J.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the role of ZipA in cell division has been proposed to be accessory. proline-glutamine-enriched region FtsZ-binding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside Protein Data Bank. We have studied the ability of different forms of ZipA to stabilize the FtsZ protein in the presence of different amounts of FtsA or FtsA* in E. coli. As a convenient system to analyze it we have used maxicells, which do not contain nucleoids but can sustain expression of individual genes introduced in suitable plasmids (18Sancar A. Hack A.M. Rupp W.D. Simple method for identification of plasmid-coded proteins.J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 692-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results contribute to define the role of ZipA in bacterial division. E. coli CSR603 maxicells were prepared, with minor modifications, as reported by Sancar et al. (18Sancar A. Hack A.M. Rupp W.D. Simple method for identification of plasmid-coded proteins.J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 692-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the E. coli strain CSR603 (F-, thr-1, araC14, leuB6(Am), Δ(gpt-proA)62, lacY1, tsx-33, glnV44(AS), phr-1, galK2(Oc), λ−, Rac-0, gyrA98(NalR), recA1, rpsL31(strR), kdgK51, xylA5, mtl-1, argE3(Oc), thi-1, uvrA6) (19Sancar A. Rupert C.S. Cloning of the phr gene and amplification of photolyase in Escherichia coli.Gene. 1978; 4: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was grown overnight in a shaker at 37 °C in LB supplemented with antibiotic-dependent-carrying plasmid (supplemental Table S1). Next day, 20 ml of fresh LB, supplemented with antibiotics if necessary, was inoculated 1:100 with the grown overnight cell culture and incubated in a shaker at 37 °C until the cell culture reached a cell number of 1 × 108 cells/ml. 10 ml of the bacterial suspension was irradiated in complete darkness with ultraviolet light (UV) (UV dose at 254 nm: 105.98 joules/m2) and incubated for 3 h in a shaker at 37 °C in complete darkness to induce the degradation of UV-damaged chromosomal DNA (18Sancar A. Hack A.M. Rupp W.D. Simple method for identification of plasmid-coded proteins.J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 692-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3 h after UV irradiation, d-cycloserine at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml was added to the culture, and it was left for additional 16 h in a shaker at 37 °C in complete darkness. d-Cycloserine inhibits the condensation of the pentapeptide peptidoglycan precursors during peptidoglycan synthesis and therefore lyses actively dividing bacterial cells that escaped UV damage (20Lovering A.L.

The obtained maxicells were processed directly for phase-contrast, immunofluorescence microscopy, SDS-PAGE, or Western blotting.

Pyrococcus wosei (Pwo) DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and a primer annealing temperature of 55 °C was used for standard PCR (21Sambrook J. Russel D.

The obtained transductant were screened on LB plates supplemented with 0.2% citrate together with 10 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml nalidixic acid and incubated at 37 °C.

For phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy, cells were spotted on an agarose-padded microscope slide and imaged with an Olympus DP70 camera coupled to a wide-field motorized Olympus BX61 microscope, equipped with a 100× immersion oil lens, an Olympus HQ:CY3 filter (excitation band, 530–545 nm; emission band, 610–675 nm; beam splitter, 565LP) for phase-contrast optics, an Olympus U-MNU2 filter (excitation filter, 360–370 nm; emission filter, 420 nm; dichromatic filter, 400 nm) to visualize 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescence and an Olympus U-MWIY2 filter (excitation filter, 545–580 nm; emission filter, 610 nm; dichromatic filter, 600 nm) to visualize the Alexa Fluor 594-labeled rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). The images were captured with the analySIS imaging software (Olympus) and further processed with Adobe Photoshop CS and the Huygens professional deconvolution software package (Scientific Volume Imaging bv, Hilversum, The Netherlands). Three-dimensional reconstruction are composed of individual optical sections (n = 55) that were deconvoluted using the Huygens Professional software package and reconstructed with the Bitplane Imaris Software package (Bitplane, Saint Paul, MN). The elongation along the z axis introduced by the optical system was corrected in the deconvoluted stacks by multiplying the vertical scale by 0.42 (the correction factor calculated from the measurement of control spherical particles). Cells for immunolabeling were prepared as described by Addinall et al. (5Addinall S.G. Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. FtsZ ring formation in fts mutants.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), using primary antibodies MVC2, MVM1, or polyclonal antiserum MVC1 to specifically detect FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA, respectively, and the fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, as secondary antibody. The coverslip was mounted together with the addition of Vectashield Mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and DAPI on a microscope slide and sealed with transparent nail polish to protect sample from drying during microscopy. SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis (26Towbin H.

For SDS-PAGE, the pelleted bacterial cells were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Unless stated otherwise, cells corresponding to A600 of 0.1 were loaded per lane on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For Western blot analysis, the polyclonal antibodies MVC2 (FtsZ) and MVM1 (FtsA) (11Sánchez M. Valencia A. Ferrándiz M.J. Sander C. Vicente M.

Monoclonal Anti-polyhistidine Peroxidase Conjugate Clone HIS-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for detection of histidine-tagged ZipA and its mutant variants. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A (Bio-Rad), the BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (POD; Roche Applied Science), and Kodak Biomax XAR films (Sigma) were used to develop the PVDF (Millipore) or Nitrocellulose (Roche Applied Science) membrane-blotted proteins.

Wang Q. Freund S.M. Löwe J.

To study the formation of the proto-ring in vitro we used E. coli maxicells, chromosome-less bacterial cells that retain complex cellular activities as protein synthesis and protein targeting (18Sancar A. Hack A.M. Rupp W.D. Simple method for identification of plasmid-coded proteins.J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 692-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28de Veaux L.C. Clevenson D.S. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. Identification of the btuCED polypeptides and evidence for their role in vitamin B12 transport in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 920-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maxicells were obtained by low dose UV irradiation of a recA mutant strain to induce chromosome degradation (18Sancar A. Hack A.M. Rupp W.D. Simple method for identification of plasmid-coded proteins.J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 692-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first determined the levels of the wild type FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA proteins at the different stages during maxicell production. No change in the levels of FtsA or ZipA was observed at any stage (Fig. 1). The FtsZ levels also remained largely unchanged at 3 h after UV irradiation relative to those in the non–UV-irradiated cells, but they dropped to a low residual amount in maxicells (Fig. 1). In growing E. coli cells the ClpXP protease complex has been reported to be responsible for FtsZ degradation (29Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. ClpXP protease degrades the cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ, and modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. The interplay of ClpXP with the cell division machinery in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein degradation by ClpXP is directed by the presence of a ClpX recognition signal on the target protein (31Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proteomic discovery of cellular substrates of the ClpXP protease reveals five classes of ClpX-recognition signals.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although the exact recognition motif on FtsZ needs to be identified, Camberg et al. limited its position to the last 18 amino acids of the FtsZ C terminus (29Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. ClpXP protease degrades the cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ, and modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon ATP hydrolysis, the ClpX moiety unfolds and transfers FtsZ to ClpP, the protease moiety (32Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. ClpXP, an ATP-powered unfolding and protein-degradation machine.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), where it will be degraded (29Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. ClpXP protease degrades the cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ, and modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FtsA or ZipA has not shown to possess a ClpX recognition motif. To check whether FtsZ degradation in maxicells depends on the action of ClpXP, strains VIP978 (clpP::aph) and VIP979 (clpX::aph) were constructed by insertional inactivation of clpX or clpP in strain CSR603 (Fig. 1). Maxicells obtained from VIP978 showed no degradation of FtsZ relative to the non–UV-irradiated control, indicating that the protease moiety ClpP is required for degradation. Surprisingly, the absence of ClpX in VIP979 had no effect on preventing the FtsZ degradation in VIP979 maxicells. We cannot exclude that a different recognition unfoldase, as ClpA (33Hoskins J.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S.

Furthermore, ClpP has been reported to be able to produce some limited proteolysis independently of ClpX or ClpA (36Weichart D. Querfurth N. Dreger M. Hengge-Aronis R. Global role for ClpP-containing proteases in stationary-phase adaptation of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Jennings L.D. Lun D.S.

We have checked the effect of the two other proto-ring components, FtsA and ZipA, on the stability of FtsZ. For this purpose we have induced the production of different forms of ZipA at the time of d-cycloserine addition and measured their effect on the amount of FtsZ present after 16 h in maxicells. Results shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1 indicate that the overproduction of His-ZipA reduced FtsZ degradation. Production of a His-ZipA3 mutant, a C-terminal truncate of His-ZipA that lacks most of its FZB domain (from amino acids 114 to 272, Fig. 3A), showed no stabilization of the FtsZ levels because it also occurred in maxicells carrying an empty vector as a control (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). The fact that maxicells retain a basal level of ZipA, even when they contain no plasmid-encoded copy of zipA, could contribute to maintain the low residual amount of FtsZ found after the d-cycloserine treatment. The FZB domain has been described to interact directly with the C terminus of FtsZ (8Mosyak L. Zhang Y. Glasfeld E. Haney S. Stahl M. Seehra J. Somers W.S. The bacterial cell division protein ZipA and its interaction with an FtsZ fragment revealed by x-ray crystallography.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3179-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); this is the same FtsZ domain recognized by ClpX (29Camberg J.L. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. ClpXP protease degrades the cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ, and modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ClpX is an unfoldase that facilitates the access of ClpP to the substrate, although other unfoldases such as ClpA may be also active. Our results could be due to an steric hindrance from the excess of ZipA blocking the access of ClpX to the recognition signal present at the C terminus of FtsZ. In the presence of ZipA the accessibility of the ClpP protease to FtsZ would be reduced, and degradation would then proceed at a lower rate. Nevertheless, FtsZ would never be fully protected from degradation by ClpP because the other unfoldases together with the intrinsic protease activity of ClpP may remain active.FIGURE 3FtsZ-protective properties of different ZipA mutants.

We recently discovered that the residues Met626 and Thr627 preceding the pocket-binding domain of the C peptide adopt a unique M-T hook structure that is crucial for the design of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. In this study, we first presented a proof-of-concept prototype that the M-T hook residues can dramatically improve the antiviral activity and thermostability of a short C peptide. We then generated a 24-mer peptide termed MT-SC22EK by incorporating the M-T hook structure to the N terminus of the poorly active short C peptide SC22EK. Amazingly, MT-SC22EK inhibited HIV-1-mediated cell fusion and infection at a level comparable to C34, T1249, SC29EK, and sifuvirtide, and it was highly active against diverse HIV-1 subtypes and variants, including those T20 (enfuvirtide) and SC29EK-resistant viruses. The high-resolution crystal structure of MT-SC22EK reveals the N-terminal M-T hook conformation folded by incorporated Met626 and Thr627 and identifies the C-terminal boundary critical for the anti-HIV activity. Collectively, our studies provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 fusion and its inhibition.—Chong, H., Yao, X., Qiu, Z., Sun, J., Zhang, M., Waltersperger, S., Wang, M., Liu, S.-L., Cui, S., and He, Y.

https://openalex.org/W1987261387,"Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by a generalized increase in gene expression that is commensurate with the increase in myocyte size and mass, on which is superimposed more robust changes in the expression of specialized genes. Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms play fundamental roles in these processes; however, genome-wide characterization of the transcriptional changes has not been investigated. Our goal was to identify the extent and modes, RNA polymerase II (pol II) pausing versus recruitment, of transcriptional regulation underlying cardiac hypertrophy. We used anti-pol II and anti-histone H3K9-acetyl (H3K9ac) chromatin immunoprecipitation-deep sequencing to determine the extent of pol II recruitment and pausing, and the underlying epigenetic modifications, respectively, during cardiac growth. The data uniquely reveal two mutually exclusive modes of transcriptional regulation. One involves an incremental increase (30-50%) in the elongational activity of preassembled, promoter-paused, pol II, and encompasses ∼25% of expressed genes that are essential/housekeeping genes (e.g. RNA synthesis and splicing). Another involves a more robust activation via de novo pol II recruitment, encompassing ∼5% of specialized genes (e.g. contractile and extracellular matrix). Moreover, the latter subset has relatively shorter 3'-UTRs with fewer predicted targeting miRNA, whereas most miRNA targets fall in the former category, underscoring the significance of posttranscriptional regulation by miRNA. The results, for the first time, demonstrate that promoter-paused pol II plays a role in incrementally increasing housekeeping genes, proportionate to the increase in heart size. Additionally, the data distinguish between the roles of posttranscriptional versus transcriptional regulation of specific genes."

Various studies have demonstrated that activation of TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase 1) is an essential step in TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation pathways. In this study, we identified a member of the dual-specificity phosphatase family, DUSP14, as a negative regulator of TNF- and IL-1-triggered NF-κB activation by expression screens. We found that DUSP14 interacted with TAK1 and that this interaction was enhanced by TNF or IL-1 stimulation. Overexpression of DUSP14 dephosphorylated TAK1 at Thr-187, a residue in the activation loop critically involved in TAK1 activation. Knockdown of DUSP14 increased basal as well as TNF- and IL-1-induced TAK1 phosphorylation at Thr-187.

In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitory proteins, which are members of the IκB family. Stimulation of various cell surface receptors, including receptors for proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, Toll-like receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors, results in phosphorylation and subsequently rapid ubiquitination and degradation of IκB proteins. Degradation of the IκB proteins liberates NF-κB and allows its translocation to the nucleus, where it controls the expression of downstream target genes (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

Reversible protein phosphorylation, mediated by a plethora of protein kinases and phosphatases, is an important regulatory mechanism in a wide variety of biological processes such as cell development, differentiation, and transformation in higher eukaryotes (17Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-κB activity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critically involved in regulation of several key components of the TNF- or IL-1-triggered NF-κB signaling pathways (17Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-κB activity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar, 18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. Activation of NF-κB in vivo is regulated by multiple phosphorylations.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Dual-specificity phosphatases are a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases that participate in the regulation of divergent biological and pathological processes. This group of phosphatases can remove phosphate groups from critical phosphothreonine, phosphoserine, and phosphotyrosine residues on kinases, which generally leads to their deactivation. The phosphate-binding pocket of the DUSP family is formed by a loop containing the active-site motif HCXXGXXRS(T), where X is a variable residue, and catalysis is initiated by a conserved cysteine (19Patterson K.I. Brummer T. O'Brien P.M. Daly R.J. Dual-specificity phosphatases: critical regulators with diverse cellular targets.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). DUSP14 is a member of the DUSP family; it is 198 amino acid residues in length and is composed of a single catalytic phosphatase domain. The phosphate-binding loop in DUSP14 is composed of the sequence H110CAAGVSR117, in which cysteine 111 is the catalytic site. Previous studies suggest that conversion of cysteine 111 to serine (C111S) abrogates the ability of DUSP14 to dephosphorylate its substrates (19Patterson K.I. Brummer T. O'Brien P.M. Daly R.J. Dual-specificity phosphatases: critical regulators with diverse cellular targets.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 20Lountos G.T. Tropea J.E. Cherry S.

Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified DUSP14 as an inhibitor of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation pathways by expression screens. We also found that DUSP14 dephosphorylated TAK1 at Thr-187 within its kinase activation loop. Our findings suggest that DUSP14 acts as a TAK1 phosphatase to negatively regulate TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. Recombinant TNF-α and IL-1β (R&D Systems); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific); mouse monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), HA (OriGene), β-actin (Sigma), and Thr-187-phosphorylated TAK1, phospho-IκBα, phospho-IKKα/β, and phospho-TBK1 (Cell Signaling); and rabbit polyclonal antibody against DUSP14 (Abcam) were purchased from the indicated companies. Mouse antisera against TAK1 and IκBα were raised against the respective recombinant human full-length proteins. The 293 and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Transfection of 293 cells was carried out by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. NF-κB- and IFN-β promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids and mammalian expression plasmids for HA-tagged TAK1, TBL1–TBL3, IKKα/β/γ, TRAF2, and TRAF6 were described previously (21Li Q. Yan J. Mao A.P. Li C. Ran Y. Shu H.-B. Wang Y.Y. Tripartite motif 8 (TRIM8) modulates TNFα- and IL-1β-triggered NF-κB activation by targeting TAK1 for K63-linked polyubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 19341-19346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged DUSP14 was constructed by standard molecular biology techniques. Mammalian expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged DUSP14(C111S) was constructed by standard site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA expression clones encoding 3000 mouse proteins were obtained from OriGene. The clones were transfected together with the NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid into 293 cells. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) or IL-1 (10 ng/ml) or left untreated for 8 h. The clones that inhibited TNF- or IL-1-triggered NF-κB activation were identified for further study. The 293 or HeLa cells (1 × 105) were seeded on 24-well plates and transfected 16 h later. In these experiments, empty control plasmid was added to ensure that the same amount of total DNA was transfected into each well. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.05 μg of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. Luciferase assays were performed using a Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized basal on Renilla luciferase activities. For transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (1 × 106) were transfected for 24 h. The transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.9-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated antibody and 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were analyzed by standard immunoblot analysis. For endogenous immunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (5 × 107) were stimulated with TNF (10 ng/ml) or IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times or left untreated. The subsequent procedures were carried out as described above. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the target sequences were cloned into the pSUPER.retro RNAi plasmid (Oligoengine). The following sequences were targeted for human DUSP14 mRNA: 1) 5′-CCATTGAGATCCCTAATTT-3′; 2) 5′-CCATTGGACTGTACTTTGA-3; and 3) 5′-GATTTCCGAGGGAGACATA-3. The 293 cells were transfected with two packaging plasmids (pGag-Pol and pVSV-G) and the GFP control RNAi or DUSP14 RNAi plasmid at a ratio of 3:1:3 by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were washed 12 h after transfection, and new medium without antibiotics was added. After 48 h, the recombinant virus-containing medium was filtered and used to infect HeLa cells in the presence of Polybrene (4 μg/ml). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with complete medium. The infected HeLa cells were selected using puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) before additional experiments were performed. TNF and IL-1 are critically involved in inflammation by activating the transcription factor NF-κB. To better understand how TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation pathways are regulated at the molecular level, we screened a mouse cDNA library containing 3000 individual expression clones using NF-κB reporter assays. In the screening experiments, TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation was markedly inhibited by overexpression of DUSP14 (clone 103C09) (Fig. 1A). The ability of DUSP14 to inhibit TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation was dose-dependent in reporter assays in 293 cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the phosphatase activity of DUSP14 is required for its ability to inhibit TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB signaling, we examined the effects of the DUSP14 enzyme-inactive mutant C111S on TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 1C, DUSP14(C111S) lost the ability to inhibit TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation compared with wild-type DUSP14. Similarly, DUSP14, but not DUSP14(C111S), also inhibited TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). In reporter assays, DUSP14 did not inhibit Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of NF-κB and the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that DUSP14 specifically down-regulates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. To determine whether DUSP14 regulates TNF- and IL-1-induced signaling under physiological conditions, we investigated the effects of knockdown of DUSP14 on TNF- and IL-1-triggered NF-κB activation. We constructed three human RNAi plasmids that target different sites of DUSP14 mRNA. Immunoblot analysis indicated that DUSP14 RNAi plasmid 1 markedly inhibited the expression of transfected and endogenous DUSP14 in 293 cells, whereas DUSP14 RNAi plasmids 2 and 3 had weak or no marked inhibitory effects on DUSP14 expression (Fig. 2A). In reporter assays, knockdown of DUSP14 expression potentiated TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B). The degrees of potentiation correlated with the efficiencies of knockdown of DUSP14 by each RNAi plasmid (Fig. 2, A and B). We chose DUSP14 RNAi plasmid 1 for additional experiments. In reporter assays, DUSP14 RNAi potentiated TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner in both 293 and HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). However, knockdown of DUSP14 did not potentiate SeV-induced activation of NF-κB or the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results suggest that DUSP14 is a negative regulator of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of DUSP14 in TNF- and IL-1-induced signaling, we examined the ability of DUSP14 to interact with known components in the TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation pathways. Transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that DUSP14 interacted strongly with TAK1 and weakly with TRAF6, but not with the other examined components in the TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation pathways, such as TBL1–TBL3 and IKKα/β/γ (Fig. 3A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also indicated that DUSP14 did not interact with some other members of the TRAF family, such as TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 (Fig. 3A). Compared with the DUSP14-TAK1 interaction, the DUSP1-TRAF6 interaction is much weaker. It is possible that DUSP14 interacts with TRAF6 indirectly via TAK1. The interaction between DUSP14 and TAK1 does not depend on the enzymatic activity of DUSP14 because DUSP14(C111S) was still able to interact with TAK1 (Fig. 3A). In untransfected cells, endogenous DUSP14 interacted with TAK1 weakly, and this interaction was increased upon TNF and IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that DUSP14 interacts with TAK1 and that their interaction is enhanced following TNF or IL-1 stimulation. Because DUSP14 interacts with TAK1 and negatively regulates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation, we reasoned that DUSP14 functions by dephosphorylating TAK1. Previously, it was reported that TBL1 is an activation subunit of TAK1 by enhancing phosphorylation of TAK1 at the activation loop and that overexpression of TBL1 enables TAK1 to activate NF-κB (9Shibuya H.

As shown in Fig. 4A, wild-type DUSP14, but not the phosphatase-deficient mutant DUSP14(C111S), inhibited TAK1-mediated and TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. Because phosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop of TAK1 is essential for the activation of TAK1 by TNF and IL-1, we examined whether DUSP14 dephosphorylates TAK1 at Thr-187. When overexpressed, TAK1 was phosphorylated at Thr-187 as detected by a phosphoamino acid-specific antibody and its slower migration (Fig. 4B). TNF or IL-1 stimulation further enhanced the phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187. Overexpression of DUSP14 diminished basal and TNF- or IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187 (Fig. 4B). In similar experiments, the phosphatase-deficient mutant DUSP14(C111S) lost the ability to dephosphorylate TAK1 (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that DUSP14 dephosphorylates TAK1 at Thr-187 and that this activity is required for its inhibition of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. To determine whether DUSP14 plays a physiological role in dephosphorylating TAK1, we examined the effects of DUSP14 knockdown on TAK1 phosphorylation. We found that knockdown of DUSP14 enhanced basal and TNF- or IL-1-induced phosphorylation of endogenous TAK1 at Thr-187 in 293 cells (Fig. 5A) and HeLa cells (Fig. 6). Knockdown of DUSP14 consistently potentiated TNF- and IL-1-induced phosphorylation of IKK and IκBα and degradation of IκBα in HeLa cells (Fig. 6), which are hallmarks of TNF- and IL-1-induced downstream activation. In these experiments, knockdown of DUSP14 had no marked effect on TBK1 phosphorylation. These results suggest that DUSP14 specifically regulates TAK1 activation.FIGURE 6Effects of DUSP14 knockdown on phosphorylation of TAK1, IKKα/β, and IκBα and degradation of IκBα in HeLa cells. HeLa cells stably transduced with control or DUSP14 RNAi plasmid were either left untreated or treated with TNF (10 ng/ml; A) or IL-1 (10 ng/ml; B) for the indicated times and then subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transcription factor NF-κB plays critical roles in a broad range of physiological and pathological processes such as cell proliferation, immune regulation, inflammation, and anti-apoptosis (1Siebenlist U.

We show that RrgA, an ancillary pilus subunit devoid of a lipidation motif, particularly when presented as part of an oligomer, is a TLR2 agonist. The surface-exposed domain III, and in particular a 49-amino acid sequence (P3), of the protein is responsible for the TLR2 activity of RrgA. A pneumococcal mutant carrying RrgA with a deletion of the P3 region was significantly reduced in its ability to activate TLR2 and induce TNF-α responses after mouse intraperitoneal infection, whereas no such difference could be noted when TLR2(-/-) mice were challenged, further implicating this region in recognition by TLR2. Thus, we conclude that the type 1 pneumococcal pilus can activate cells via TLR2, and the ancillary pilus subunit RrgA is a key component of this activation."
https://openalex.org/W2011123905,"Activation of Wnt signalling due to inability to degrade β-catenin is found in >85% of colorectal cancers. Approximately half of colon cancers express a constitutively active KRAS protein. A significant fraction of patients show both abnormalities. We previously reported that simultaneous down-regulation of both β-catenin and KRAS was necessary to induce significant cell death and tumor growth inhibition of colorectal cancer cells. Although attractive, an RNAi-based therapeutic approach is still far from being employed in the clinical setting. Therefore, we sought to recapitulate our previous findings by the use of small-molecule inhibitors of β-catenin and KRAS. We show here that the β-catenin inhibitors PKF115-584 and pyrvinium pamoate block β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity and synergize with the KRAS inhibitor S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS, salirasib) in colon cancer cells driven by Wnt and KRAS oncogenic signals, but not in cells carrying BRAF mutations. The combined use of these compounds was superior to the use of any drug alone in inducing cell growth arrest, cell death, MYC and survivin down-modulation, and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth. Expression analysis of selected cancer-relevant genes revealed down-regulation of CD44 as a common response to the combined treatments. These data provide a proof of principle for a combination therapeutic strategy in colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1964343326,"Plant biomass is central to the carbon cycle and to environmentally sustainable industries exemplified by the biofuel sector. Plant cell wall degrading enzymes generally contain noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that fulfil a targeting function, which enhances catalysis. CBMs that bind β-glucan chains often display broad specificity recognizing β1,4-glucans (cellulose), β1,3-β1,4-mixed linked glucans and xyloglucan, a β1,4-glucan decorated with α1,6-xylose residues, by targeting structures common to the three polysaccharides. Thus, CBMs that recognize xyloglucan target the β1,4-glucan backbone and only accommodate the xylose decorations. Here we show that two closely related CBMs, CBM65A and CBM65B, derived from EcCel5A, a Eubacterium cellulosolvens endoglucanase, bind to a range of β-glucans but, uniquely, display significant preference for xyloglucan. The structures of the two CBMs reveal a β-sandwich fold. The ligand binding site comprises the β-sheet that forms the concave surface of the proteins. Binding to the backbone chains of β-glucans is mediated primarily by five aromatic residues that also make hydrophobic interactions with the xylose side chains of xyloglucan, conferring the distinctive specificity of the CBMs for the decorated polysaccharide. Significantly, and in contrast to other CBMs that recognize β-glucans, CBM65A utilizes different polar residues to bind cellulose and mixed linked glucans. Thus, Gln(106) is central to cellulose recognition, but is not required for binding to mixed linked glucans. This report reveals the mechanism by which β-glucan-specific CBMs can distinguish between linear and mixed linked glucans, and show how these CBMs can exploit an extensive hydrophobic platform to target the side chains of decorated β-glucans."

Here, we examined the effects of the G26R point mutation in apoA-I (apoA-I(Iowa)) on the structure, stability, and aggregation propensity to form amyloid fibril of full-length apoA-I and the N-terminal fragment of apoA-I. Circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the G26R mutation destabilizes the N-terminal helix bundle domain of full-length protein, leading to increased hydrophobic surface exposure, whereas it has no effect on the initial structure of the N-terminal 1-83 fragment, which is predominantly a random coil structure. Upon incubation for extended periods at neutral pH, the N-terminal 1-83 variants undergo a conformational change to β-sheet-rich structure with a great increase in thioflavin T fluorescence, whereas no structural change is observed in full-length proteins. Comparison of fibril-forming propensity among substituted mutants at Gly-26 position of 1-83 fragments demonstrated that the G26R mutation enhances the nucleation step of fibril formation, whereas G26K and G26E mutations have small or inhibiting effects on the formation of fibrils. These fibrils of the 1-83 variants have long and straight morphology as revealed by atomic force microscopy and exhibited significant toxicity with HEK293 cells. Our results indicate dual critical roles of the arginine residue at position 26 in apoA-I(Iowa): destabilization of the N-terminal helix bundle structure in full-length protein and enhancement of amyloid fibril formation by the N-terminal 1-83 fragment."
https://openalex.org/W2111981713,"The brain is the most cholesterol-enriched tissue in the body. During brain development, desmosterol, an immediate precursor of cholesterol, transiently accumulates up to 30% of total brain sterols. This massive desmosterol deposition appears to be present in all mammalian species reported so far, including humans, but how it is achieved is not well understood. Here, we propose that desmosterol accumulation in the developing brain may be primarily caused by post-transcriptional repression of 3β-hydroxysterol 24-reductase (DHCR24) by progesterone. Furthermore, distinct properties of desmosterol may serve to increase the membrane active pool of sterols in the brain: desmosterol cannot be hydroxylated to generate 24S-hydroxycholesterol, a brain derived secretory sterol, desmosterol has a reduced propensity to be esterified as compared to cholesterol, and desmosterol may activate LXR to stimulate astrocyte sterol secretion. This regulated accumulation of desmosterol by progesterone-induced suppression of DHCR24 may facilitate the rapid enrichment and distribution of membrane sterols in the developing brain.—Jansen, M., Wang, W., Greco, D., Bellenchi, G.

We previously showed that the enzyme neprilysin reduces islet amyloid deposition and thereby reduces β-cell apoptosis, by inhibiting fibril formation. Two other enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, are extracellular gelatinases capable of degrading another amyloidogenic peptide, Aβ, the constituent of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease. We therefore investigated whether MMP-2 and MMP-9 play a role in reducing islet amyloid deposition. MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA were present in mouse islets but only MMP-9 activity was detectable. In an islet culture model where human IAPP (hIAPP) transgenic mouse islets develop amyloid but nontransgenic islets do not, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor (GM6001) and an MMP-2/9 inhibitor increased amyloid formation and the resultant β-cell apoptosis. In contrast, a specific MMP-2 inhibitor had no effect on either amyloid deposition or β-cell apoptosis. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that MMP-9 degraded amyloidogenic hIAPP but not nonamyloidogenic mouse IAPP. Thus, MMP-9 constitutes an endogenous islet protease that limits islet amyloid deposition and its toxic effects via degradation of hIAPP. Because islet MMP-9 mRNA levels are decreased in type 2 diabetic subjects, islet MMP-9 activity may also be decreased in human type 2 diabetes, thereby contributing to increased islet amyloid deposition and β-cell loss.

In many cases, it has severe life-long consequences for the health and neurological development of the newborn child. More than 50% of all preterm births are spontaneous, and currently there is no effective prevention. Several studies suggest that genetic factors play a role in spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). However, its genetic background is insufficiently characterized. The aim of the present study was to perform a linkage analysis of X chromosomal markers in SPTB in large northern Finnish families with recurrent SPTBs. We found a significant linkage signal (HLOD = 3.72) on chromosome locus Xq13.1 when the studied phenotype was being born preterm. There were no significant linkage signals when the studied phenotype was giving preterm deliveries. Two functional candidate genes, those encoding the androgen receptor (AR) and the interleukin-2 receptor gamma subunit (IL2RG), located near this locus were analyzed as candidates for SPTB in subsequent case-control association analyses. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes and an AR exon-1 CAG repeat, which was previously demonstrated to be functionally significant, were analyzed in mothers with preterm delivery (n = 272) and their offspring (n = 269), and in mothers with exclusively term deliveries (n = 201) and their offspring (n = 199), all originating from northern Finland. A replication study population consisting of individuals born preterm (n = 111) and term (n = 197) from southern Finland was also analyzed. Long AR CAG repeats (≥ 26) were overrepresented and short repeats (≤ 19) underrepresented in individuals born preterm compared to those born at term. Thus, our linkage and association results emphasize the role of the fetal genome in genetic predisposition to SPTB and implicate AR as a potential novel fetal susceptibility gene for SPTB."
https://openalex.org/W2021628982,"Expression of G6PD is controlled by changes in the degree of splicing of the G6PD mRNA in response to nutrients in the diet. This regulation involves an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) in exon 12 of the mRNA. Using the G6PD model, we demonstrate that nutrients and hormones control the activity of serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins, a family of splicing co-activators, and thereby regulate the splicing of G6PD mRNA. In primary rat hepatocyte cultures, insulin increased the amount of phosphorylated SR proteins, and this effect was counteracted by arachidonic acid. The results of RNA affinity analysis with nuclear extracts from intact liver demonstrated that the SR splicing factor proteins SRSF3 and SRSF4 bound to the G6PD ESE. Consequently, siRNA-mediated depletion of SRSF3, but not SRSF4, in liver cells inhibited accumulation of both mRNA expressed from a minigene containing exon 12 and the endogenous G6PD mRNA. Consistent with the functional role of SRSF3 in regulating splicing, SRSF3 was observed to bind to the ESE in both intact cells and in animals using RNA immunoprecipitation analysis. Furthermore, refeeding significantly increased the binding of SRSF3 coincident with increased splicing and expression of G6PD. Together, these data establish that nutritional regulation of SRSF3 activity is involved in the differential splicing of the G6PD transcript in response to nutrients. Nutritional regulation of other SR proteins presents a regulatory mechanism that could cause widespread changes in mRNA splicing. Nutrients are therefore novel regulators of mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1980411820,"DNA polymerase δ consists of four subunits, one of which, p12, is degraded in response to DNA damage through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the identities of the ubiquitin ligase(s) that are responsible for the proximal biochemical events in triggering proteasomal degradation of p12 are unknown. We employed a classical approach to identifying a ubiquitin ligase that is involved in p12 degradation. Using UbcH5c as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, a ubiquitin ligase activity that polyubiquitinates p12 was purified from HeLa cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that RNF8, a RING finger ubiquitin ligase that plays an important role in the DNA damage response, was the only ubiquitin ligase present in the purified preparation. In vivo, DNA damage-induced p12 degradation was significantly reduced by shRNA knockdown of RNF8 in cultured human cells and in RNF8(-/-) mouse epithelial cells. These studies provide the first identification of a ubiquitin ligase activity that is involved in the DNA damage-induced destruction of p12. The identification of RNF8 allows new insights into the integration of the control of p12 degradation by different DNA damage signaling pathways."

LHX6 and the PITX2 homeodomain transcription factor have overlapping expression patterns during tooth and craniofacial development, and in this report, we demonstrate new transcriptional mechanisms for these factors. PITX2 and LHX6 are co-expressed in the oral and dental epithelium and epithelial cell lines. Lhx6 expression is increased in Pitx2c transgenic mice and decreased in Pitx2 null mice. PITX2 activates endogenous Lhx6 expression and the Lhx6 promoter, whereas LHX6 represses its promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal endogenous PITX2 binding to the Lhx6 promoter. LHX6 directly interacts with PITX2 to inhibit PITX2 transcriptional activities and activation of multiple promoters. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays reveal an LHX6·PITX2 nuclear interaction in living cells. LHX6 has a dominant repressive effect on the PITX2 synergistic activation with LEF-1 and β-catenin co-factors. Thus, LHX6 acts as a transcriptional repressor and represses the expression of several genes involved in odontogenesis. We have identified specific defects in incisor, molar, mandible, bone, and root development and late stage enamel formation in Lhx6 null mice. Amelogenin and ameloblastin expression is reduced and/or delayed in the Lhx6 null mice, potentially resulting from defects in dentin deposition and ameloblast differentiation. Our results demonstrate that LHX6 regulates cell proliferation in the cervical loop and promotes cell differentiation in the anterior region of the incisor. We demonstrate new molecular mechanisms for LHX6 and an interaction with PITX2 for normal craniofacial and tooth development."

We aimed to determine whether this increased preference could be attributed to changes in μ-opioid receptor expression within the mesolimbic reward pathway. We report here that mRNA expression of the μ-opioid receptor in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) at weaning was 1.4-fold (males) and 1.9-fold (females) lower in offspring of junk-food (JF)-fed rat dams than in offspring of dams fed a standard rodent diet (control) (P<0.05). Administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone to offspring given a palatable diet postweaning significantly reduced fat intake in control offspring (males: 7.7±0.7 vs. 5.4±0.6 g/kg/d; females: 6.9±0.3 vs. 3.9±0.5g/kg/d; P<0.05), but not in male JF offspring (8.6±0.6 vs. 7.1±0.5g/kg/d) and was less effective at reducing fat intake in JF females (42.2±6.0 vs. 23.1 ±4.1% reduction, P<0.05). Similar findings were observed for total energy intake. Naloxone treatment did not affect intake of standard rodent feed in control or JF offspring. These findings suggest that exposure to a maternal junk-food diet results in early desensitization of the opioid system which may explain the increased preference for junk food in these offspring.—Gugusheff, J.

Approximately 90% of cases are caused by spontaneous mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Girls with RTT suffer from severe motor, respiratory, cognitive and social abnomalities attributed to early deficits in synaptic connectivity which manifest in the adult as a myriad of physiological and anatomical abnormalities including, but not limited to, dimished dendritic complexity. Supplementation with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), an acetyl group donor, ameliorates motor and cognitive deficits in other disease models through a variety of mechanisms including altering patterns of histone acetylation resulting in changes in gene expression, and stimulating biosynthetic pathways such as acetylcholine. We hypothesized ALC treatment during critical periods in cortical development would promote normal synaptic maturation, and continuing treatment would improve behavioral deficits in the Mecp21lox mouse model of RTT. In this study, wildtype and Mecp21lox mutant mice received daily injections of ALC from birth until death (postnatal day 47). General health, motor, respiratory, and cognitive functions were assessed at several time points during symptom progression. ALC improved weight gain, grip strength, activity levels, prevented metabolic abnormalities and modestly improved cognitive function in Mecp2 null mice early in the course of treatment, but did not significantly improve motor or cognitive functions assessed later in life. ALC treatment from birth was associated with an almost complete rescue of hippocampal dendritic morphology abnormalities with no discernable side effects in the mutant mice. Therefore, ALC appears to be a promising therapeutic approach to treating early RTT symptoms and may be useful in combination with other therapies."

The novel compound NS3861 and cytisine are agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and both bind with high affinity to heteromeric α3β4 and α4β2 nAChRs. However, initial data revealed that the activation patterns of the two compounds show very distinct maximal efficacy readouts at various heteromeric nAChRs. To investigate the molecular determinants behind these observations, we performed in-depth patch clamp electrophysiological measurements of efficacy levels at heteromeric combinations of α3- and α4-, with β2- and β4-subunits, and various chimeric constructs thereof. Compared with cytisine, which selectively activates receptors containing β4- but not β2-subunits, NS3861 displays the opposite β-subunit preference and a complete lack of activation at α4-containing receptors. The maximal efficacy of NS3861 appeared solely dependent on the nature of the ligand-binding domain, whereas efficacy of cytisine was additionally affected by the nature of the β-subunit transmembrane domain. Molecular docking to nAChR subtype homology models suggests agonist specific interactions to two different residues on the complementary subunits as responsible for the β-subunit preference of both compounds. Furthermore, a principal subunit serine to threonine substitution may explain the lack of NS3861 activation at α4-containing receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2036846545,"Ethanol exposure during pregnancy can cause structural and functional changes in the brain that can impair cognitive capacity. The hippocampal formation, an area of the brain strongly linked with learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of ethanol. In the present experiments we sought to determine if the functional effects of developmental ethanol exposure could be linked to ethanol exposure during any single trimester-equivalent. Ethanol exposure during the 1(st) or 3(rd) trimester-equivalent produced only minor changes in synaptic plasticity in adult offspring. In contrast, ethanol exposure during the 2(nd) trimester equivalent resulted in a pronounced decrease in long-term potentiation, indicating that the timing of exposure influences the severity of the deficit. Together, the results from these experiments demonstrate long-lasting alterations in synaptic plasticity as the result of developmental ethanol exposure and dependent on the timing of exposure. Furthermore, these results allude to neural circuit malfunction within the hippocampal formation, perhaps relating to the learning and memory deficits observed in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders."

One mechanism by which it achieves this is through regulation of gene expression. In a screen for activity-induced genes, we identified somatostatin (SST), a neuropeptide secreted by the SST subtype of interneurons. Using real time quantitative PCR and ELISA, we showed that persistent elevation of neuronal activity increased both the gene expression and protein secretion of SST over a relatively prolonged time course of 48 h. Using primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, we found that SST treatment for 1 day significantly reduced the density of dendritic spines, the morphological bases of excitatory synapses. Furthermore, the density of pre- and postsynaptic markers of excitatory synapses was significantly lowered following SST treatment, whereas that of inhibitory synapses was not affected. Consistently, SST treatment reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, without affecting inhibition. Finally, lowering the endogenous level of SST receptor subtype 4 in individual hippocampal pyramidal neurons significantly blocked the effect of SST in reducing spine density and excitatory synaptic transmission in a cell autonomous fashion, suggesting that the effect of SST in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission is mainly mediated by SST receptor subtype 4.

https://openalex.org/W2118411935,"Objective Metabolic syndrome has emerged as a novel risk factor in cardiovascular disease due to its potential for predicting stroke in population-based studies. We investigated the relationship of metabolic syndrome with stroke recurrence. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of Chinese patients enrolled in the prospective Abnormal gluCose Regulation in patients with acute strOke acroSS China (ACROSS-China) study after their first ischemic stroke. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Vascular risk factors were assessed. Outcome was defined as recurrence of stroke within one year after the index ischemic stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify potential predictors of stroke recurrence. Results The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among 2639 ischemic stroke patients was 51.35%. During the one-year follow-up, 195 strokes (7.4%) recurred. The multivariate hazard ratio (95% CI) of stroke recurrence was 1.94 (1.39–2.73) for metabolic syndrome. After adjustment for components, metabolic syndrome lost its association with stroke recurrence; in this model, high fasting plasma glucose (IDF definition) was a predictor for stroke recurrence. Conclusion Metabolic syndrome may not be predictive for stroke recurrence beyond its component individual factors for Chinese ischemic stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2022582397,"Inherited dentin defects are classified into three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) and two types of dentin dysplasia (DD). The genetic etiology of DD-I is unknown. Defects in dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) cause DD type II and DGI types II and III. DGI type I is the oral manifestation of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a systemic disease typically caused by defects in COL1A1 or COL1A2. Mutations in MSX1, PAX9, AXIN2, EDA and WNT10A can cause non-syndromic familial tooth agenesis. In this study a simplex pattern of clinical dentinogenesis imperfecta juxtaposed with a dominant pattern of hypodontia (mild tooth agenesis) was evaluated, and available family members were recruited. Mutational analyses of the candidate genes for DGI and hypodontia were performed and the results validated. A spontaneous novel mutation in COL1A2 (c.1171G>A; p.Gly391Ser) causing only dentin defects and a novel mutation in PAX9 (c.43T>A; p.Phe15Ile) causing hypodontia were identified and correlated with the phenotypic presentations in the family. Bone radiographs of the proband's dominant leg and foot were within normal limits. We conclude that when no DSPP mutation is identified in clinically determined isolated DGI cases, COL1A1 and COL1A2 should be considered as candidate genes. PAX9 mutation p.Phe15Ile within the N-terminal β-hairpin structure of the PAX9 paired domain causes tooth agenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2044398739,"A spectrin-based cytoskeleton is associated with endomembranes, including the Golgi complex and cytoplasmic vesicles, but its role remains poorly understood. Using new generated antibodies to specific peptide sequences of the human βIII spectrin, we here show its distribution in the Golgi complex, where it is enriched in the trans-Golgi and trans-Golgi network. The use of a drug-inducible enzymatic assay that depletes the Golgi-associated pool of PI4P as well as the expression of PH domains of Golgi proteins that specifically recognize this phosphoinositide both displaced βIII spectrin from the Golgi. However, the interference with actin dynamics using actin toxins did not affect the localization of βIII spectrin to Golgi membranes. Depletion of βIII spectrin using siRNA technology and the microinjection of anti-βIII spectrin antibodies into the cytoplasm lead to the fragmentation of the Golgi. At ultrastructural level, Golgi fragments showed swollen distal Golgi cisternae and vesicular structures. Using a variety of protein transport assays, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi and post-Golgi protein transports were impaired in βIII spectrin-depleted cells. However, the internalization of the Shiga toxin subunit B to the endoplasmic reticulum was unaffected. We state that βIII spectrin constitutes a major skeletal component of distal Golgi compartments, where it is necessary to maintain its structural integrity and secretory activity, and unlike actin, PI4P appears to be highly relevant for the association of βIII spectrin the Golgi complex."
https://openalex.org/W2094042817,"Oxygen deprivation is accompanied by the coordinated expression of numerous hypoxia-responsive genes, many of which are controlled by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). However, the cellular response to hypoxia is not likely to be mediated by HIF-1 alone, and little is known about HIF-1-independent hypoxia responses. To better establish the molecular mechanisms of HIF-1-independent hypoxia responses, we sought to characterize the molecular basis of the hypoxia response of the hsp-16.1 gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans; this gene has been shown to be induced by hypoxia independently of hif-1. Using affinity purification followed by LC-MS/MS, we identified HMG-1.2 as a protein that binds to a specific promoter region under hypoxic conditions. By systematic prediction followed by validation of these interactions through RNAi, we identified the chromatin modifiers isw-1 and hda-1, histone H4, and NURF-1 chromatin-remodeling factors as new components of the hif-1-independent hypoxia response. These data suggest that the modulation of nucleosome positioning at the hsp-16.1 promoter may be important for the hypoxia response. In addition, we found that calcineurin acts independently of hif-1 to modulate the cellular response to hypoxia and that calcium ions are necessary for the induction of hsp-16.1 under hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2029321003,"A genetic program that in sunflower seeds is activated by Heat Shock transcription Factor A9 (HaHSFA9) has been analyzed in transgenic tobacco seedlings. The ectopic overexpression of the HSFA9 program protected photosynthetic membranes, which resisted extreme dehydration and oxidative stress conditions. In contrast, heat acclimation of seedlings induced thermotolerance but not resistance to the harsh stress conditions employed. The HSFA9 program was found to include the expression of plastidial small Heat Shock Proteins that accumulate only at lower abundance in heat-stressed vegetative organs. Photosystem II (PSII) maximum quantum yield was higher for transgenic seedlings than for non-transgenic seedlings, after either stress treatment. Furthermore, protection of both PSII and Photosystem I (PSI) membrane protein complexes was observed in the transgenic seedlings, leading to their survival after the stress treatments. It was also shown that the plastidial D1 protein, a labile component of the PSII reaction center, and the PSI core protein PsaB were shielded from oxidative damage and degradation. We infer that natural expression of the HSFA9 program during embryogenesis may protect seed pro-plastids from developmental desiccation."
https://openalex.org/W2140449146,"Complement is a network of interacting circulatory and cell surface proteins that recognizes, marks, and facilitates clearance of microbial invaders. To evade complement attack, the pathogenic organism Staphylococcus aureus expresses a number of secreted proteins that interfere with activation and regulation of the complement cascade. Staphylococcal complement inhibitors (SCINs) are one important class of these immunomodulators and consist of three active members (SCIN-A/-B/-C). SCINs inhibit a critical enzymatic complex, the alternative pathway C3 convertase, by targeting a functional ""hot spot"" on the central opsonin of complement, C3b. Although N-terminal truncation mutants of SCINs retain complement inhibitory properties, they are significantly weaker binders of C3b. To provide a structural basis for this observation, we undertook a series of crystallographic and NMR dynamics studies on full-length SCINs. This work reveals that N-terminal SCIN domains are characterized by a conformationally dynamic helical motif. C3b binding and functional experiments further demonstrate that this sequence-divergent N-terminal region of SCINs is both functionally important and context-dependent. Finally, surface plasmon resonance data provide evidence for the formation of inhibitor·enzyme·substrate complexes ((SCIN·C3bBb)·C3). Similar to the (SCIN·C3bBb)(2) pseudodimeric complexes, ((SCIN·C3bBb)·C3) interferes with the interaction of complement receptors and C3b. This activity provides an additional mechanism by which SCIN couples convertase inhibition to direct blocking of phagocytosis. Together, these data suggest that tethering multi-host protein complexes by small modular bacterial inhibitors may be a global strategy of immune evasion used by S. aureus. The work presented here provides detailed structure-activity relationships and improves our understanding of how S. aureus circumvents human innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2008146663,"In mammals, the receptor of the neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHR) is unique among the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family because it lacks the carboxyl-terminal tail involved in GPCR desensitization. Therefore, mechanisms involved in the regulation of GnRHR signaling are currently poorly known. Here, using immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments, we demonstrated that SET interacts with GnRHR and targets the first and third intracellular loops. We delineated, by site-directed mutagenesis, SET binding sites to the basic amino acids (66)KRKK(69) and (246)RK(247), located next to sequences required for receptor signaling. The impact of SET on GnRHR signaling was assessed by decreasing endogenous expression of SET with siRNA in gonadotrope cells. Using cAMP and calcium biosensors in gonadotrope living cells, we showed that SET knockdown specifically decreases GnRHR-mediated mobilization of intracellular cAMP, whereas it increases its intracellular calcium signaling. This suggests that SET influences signal transfer between GnRHR and G proteins to enhance GnRHR signaling to cAMP. Accordingly, complexing endogenous SET by introduction of the first intracellular loop of GnRHR in αT3-1 cells significantly reduced GnRHR activation of the cAMP pathway. Furthermore, decreasing SET expression prevented cAMP-mediated GnRH stimulation of Gnrhr promoter activity, highlighting a role of SET in gonadotropin-releasing hormone regulation of gene expression. In conclusion, we identified SET as the first direct interacting partner of mammalian GnRHR and showed that SET contributes to a switch of GnRHR signaling toward the cAMP pathway."

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the formation of inflammation microenvironment. We sought to characterize the role of TAMs in coal tar pitch extract (CTPE)-induced tumorigenic transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells and the underlying mechanisms.The expression of TAMs-specific CD68 in lung cancer tissues and paired adjacent tissues from cancer patients was determined using immunostaining. Co-culture of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and macrophage-like THP-1 cells were conducted to evaluate the promotive effect of macrophages on CTPE-induced tumorigenic transformation of BEAS-2B cells. BEAS-2B cells were first treated with 2.4 µg/mL CTPE for 72 hours. After removal of CTPE, the cells were continuously cultured either with or without THP-1 cells and passaged using trypsin-EDTA. Alterations of cell cycle, karyotype, colony formation in soft agar and tumor xenograft growth in nude mice of BEAS-2B cells at passages 10, 20 and 30, indicative of tumorigenecity, were determined, respectively. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of NF-κB in BEAS-2B cells were measured with RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. B(a)P was used as the positive control.The over-expression of TAMs-specific CD68 around lung tumor tissues was detected and associated with lung cancer progression. The tumorigenic alterations of BEAS-2B cells including increase in cell growth rate, number of cells with aneuploidy, clonogenicity in soft agar, and tumor size in nude mice in vivo occurred at passage 10, becoming significant at passages 20 and 30 of the co-culture following CTPE removal in compared to BEAS-2B cells alone. In addition, the expression levels of NF-κB in BEAS-2B cells were positively correlated to the malignancy of BEAS-2B cells under different conditions of treatment.The presence of macrophages facilitated CTPE-induced tumorigenic transformation of BEAS-2B cells, which may be mediated by NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2109943700,"Dynein light chain 8 (DLC8) is a ubiquitous eukaryotic protein regulating diverse cellular functions. We show that the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii harbors 4 DLC8 proteins (TgDLC8a–d), of which only TgDLC8a clusters in the mainstream LC8 class. TgDLC8b–d proteins form a divergent and alveolate-specific clade. TgDLC8b–d proteins are largely cytosolic, whereas TgDLC8a resides in the conoid at the apical end of T. gondii The apical location of TgDLC8a is also not shared by its nearly identical Eimeria (EtDLC8a), Plasmodium (PfDLC8), or human (HsDLC8) orthologs. Notwithstanding an exclusive conoid targeting, TgDLC8a exhibits a classical LC8 structure. It forms a homodimer by swapping of the β2 strands that interact with the antiparallel β1′ strands of the opposing monomers. The TgDLC8a dimer contains two identical binding grooves and appears to be adapted for multitarget recognition. By contrast, the previously reported PfDLC8 homodimer is shaped by binding of the β0 strand with the parallel β2′ strand and lacks such a distinct binding interface. Our comparisons suggest an unexpected structural and functional divergence of the two otherwise conserved proteins from apicomplexan parasites. Finally, we demonstrate that a phosphomimetic S88E mutation renders the TgDLC8a-S88E mutant monomeric and cytosolic in T. gondii, and its overexpression inhibits the parasite growth in human fibroblasts.—Qureshi, B.

https://openalex.org/W1968198781,"The objective of this study was to examine the relation between the 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and behaviors related to attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in individuals with myelomeningocele. The rationale for the study was twofold: folate metabolizing genes, (e.g. MTHFR), are important not only in the etiology of neural tube defects but are also critical to cognitive function; and individuals with myelomeningocele have an elevated incidence of ADHD. Here, we tested 478 individuals with myelomeningocele for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behavior using the Swanson Nolan Achenbach Pelham-IV ADHD rating scale. Myelomeningocele participants in this group for whom DNAs were available were genotyped for seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MTHFR gene. The SNPs were evaluated for an association with manifestation of the ADHD phenotype in children with myelomeningocele. The data show that 28.7% of myelomeningocele participants exhibit rating scale elevations consistent with ADHD; of these 70.1% had scores consistent with the predominantly inattentive subtype. In addition, we also show a positive association between the SNP rs4846049 in the 3′-untranslated region of the MTHFR gene and the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder phenotype in myelomeningocele participants. These results lend further support to the finding that behavior related to ADHD is more prevalent in patients with myelomeningocele than in the general population. These data also indicate the potential importance of the MTHFR gene in the etiology of the ADHD phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2018779890,"The type three secretion system is a large and complex protein nano-machine that many Gram-negative pathogens employ to infect host cells. A key structure of this machine is a proteinaceous pore that inserts into the target membrane and forms a channel for bacterial toxins to flow from bacteria into the host cell. The pore is mainly formed from two large membrane proteins called ""translocators."" Importantly, effective secretion and thus pore formation of the translocators depend on their binding to and being transported by small specialized chaperones after synthesis in the bacterial cytosol. Recent crystal structures have shown these chaperones are formed from modular tetratricopeptide repeats. However, each crystal structure produced different homodimeric structures, suggesting flexibility in their topology that may be of importance to function. Given the crucial role of the translocator chaperones, we investigated the conformational stability of the chaperone LcrH (Yersinia pestis). Mutational analysis coupled with analytical ultracentrifugation and equilibrium denaturations showed that LcrH is a weak and thermodynamically unstable dimer (K(D) ≈15 μm, ΔG(H(2)O) = 7.4 kcal mol(-1)). The modular tetratricopeptide repeat structure of the dimer allows it to readily unfold in a noncooperative manner to a one-third unfolded dimeric intermediate (ΔG(H(2)O) = 1.7 kcal mol(-1)), before cooperatively unfolding to a monomeric denatured state (ΔG(H(2)O) = 5.7 kcal mol(-1)). Thus, under physiological conditions, the chaperone is able to populate C-terminally unraveled partially folded states, while being held together by its dimeric interface. Such ability suggests a ""fly-casting"" mechanism as a route to binding their far larger translocator cargo."
https://openalex.org/W2139000057,"Voltage-gated K(+) channels of the Shaw family (also known as the KCNC or Kv3 family) play pivotal roles in mammalian brains, and genetic or pharmacological disruption of their activities in mice results in a spectrum of behavioral defects. We have used the model system of Caenorhabditis elegans to elucidate conserved molecular mechanisms that regulate these channels. We have now found that the C. elegans Shaw channel KHT-1, and its mammalian homologue, murine Kv3.1b, are both modulated by acid phosphatases. Thus, the C. elegans phosphatase ACP-2 is stably associated with KHT-1, while its mammalian homolog, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP; also known as ACPP-201) stably associates with murine Kv3.1b K(+) channels in vitro and in vivo. In biochemical experiments both phosphatases were able to reverse phosphorylation of their associated channel. The effect of phosphorylation on both channels is to produce a decrease in current amplitude and electrophysiological analyses demonstrated that dephosphorylation reversed the effects of phosphorylation on the magnitude of the macroscopic currents. ACP-2 and KHT-1 were colocalized in the nervous system of C. elegans and, in the mouse nervous system, PAP and Kv3.1b were colocalized in subsets of neurons, including in the brain stem and the ventricular zone. Taken together, this body of evidence suggests that acid phosphatases are general regulatory partners of Shaw-like K(+) channels."
