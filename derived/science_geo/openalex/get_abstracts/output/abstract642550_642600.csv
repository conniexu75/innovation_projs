However, this phase is unstable, and the additives normally used to stabilize this phase at ambient temperature—such as methylammonium, caesium, and bromine—widen its bandgap. Min et al. show that doping of the α-FAPbI 3 phase with methylenediammonium dichloride enabled power conversion efficiencies of 23.7%, which were maintained after 600 hours of operation. Unencapsulated devices had high thermal stability and retained &gt;90% efficiency even after annealing for 20 hours at 150°C in air. Science , this issue p. 749"

Some attempts at blocking glutamine metabolism in cancer patients resulted in toxicity, prompting Leone et al. to develop an innovative approach to reduce general side effects. They designed a prodrug form (JHU083) of the glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo- l -norleucine (DON), which is administered in an inert state but then preferentially activated by enzymes enriched in the tumor microenvironment. JHU083 simultaneously shut down glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in mouse cancer cells while enhancing T cell oxidative phosphorylation and anticancer immune responses.

https://openalex.org/W2987148655,"A cross-kingdom tale of drug resistance Physicians who treat bacterial infections and those who treat cancer often face a common challenge: the development of drug resistance. It is well known that when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, they temporarily increase their mutation rate, thus increasing the chance that a descendant antibiotic-resistant cell will arise. Russo et al. now provide evidence that cancer cells exploit a similar mechanism to ensure their survival after drug exposure (see the Perspective by Gerlinger). They found that human colorectal cancer cells treated with certain targeted therapies display a transient up-regulation of errorprone DNA polymerases and a reduction in their ability to repair DNA damage. Thus, like bacteria, cancer cells can adapt to therapeutic pressure by enhancing their mutability. Science , this issue p. 1473 ; see also p. 1458"
https://openalex.org/W2982786587,"Seeing double can be a good thing Many human breast cancers harbor activating mutations in PIK3CA , the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in cancer patients. Vasan et al. found unexpectedly that a subset of breast cancers harbor not one—but two— PIK3CA mutations, and the mutations occur on the same allele (see the Perspective by Toker). In model systems, the double mutations hyperactivate PI3K signaling and enhance tumor growth. Preliminary analysis of clinical trial data suggests that breast cancers with double mutations are more responsive to PI3K inhibitors than those with a single mutation. PIK3CA mutational status could help identify the breast cancer patients most likely to benefit from these drugs. Science , this issue p. 714 ; see also p. 685"
https://openalex.org/W2988620928,"Functional diversity of the highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) genes underlies successful immunologic control of both infectious disease and cancer. The divergent allele advantage hypothesis dictates that an HLA-I genotype with two alleles with sequences that are more divergent enables presentation of more diverse immunopeptidomes1-3. However, the effect of sequence divergence between HLA-I alleles-a quantifiable measure of HLA-I evolution-on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment for cancer remains unknown. In the present study the germline HLA-I evolutionary divergence (HED) of patients with cancer treated with ICIs was determined by quantifying the physiochemical sequence divergence between HLA-I alleles of each patient's genotype. HED was a strong determinant of survival after treatment with ICIs. Even among patients fully heterozygous at HLA-I, patients with an HED in the upper quartile respond better to ICIs than patients with a low HED. Furthermore, HED strongly impacts the diversity of tumor, viral and self-immunopeptidomes and intratumoral T cell receptor clonality. Similar to tumor mutation burden, HED is a fundamental metric of diversity at the major histocompatibility complex-peptide complex, which dictates ICI efficacy. The data link divergent HLA allele advantage to immunotherapy efficacy and unveil how ICI response relies on the evolved efficiency of HLA-mediated immunity."

However, it is often difficult to create intact sheets over large areas that can be transferred onto substrates. Zhong et al. polymerized derivatized porphyrin molecules during laminar flow at a sharp pentane-water interface to form sheets that are 5 centimeters in diameter (see the Perspective by MacLean and Rosei). The authors used electron microscopy and spectroscopy to confirm that they had produced intact monolayers. These films were then transferred onto monolayer sheets of molybdenum disulfide to form superlattices for use as capacitors. Science , this issue p. 1379 ; see also p. 1308"
https://openalex.org/W2987760949,"Probiotics are routinely administered to hospitalized patients for many potential indications1 but have been associated with adverse effects that may outweigh their potential benefits2–7. It is particularly alarming that probiotic strains can cause bacteremia8,9, yet direct evidence for an ancestral link between blood isolates and administered probiotics is lacking. Here we report a markedly higher risk of Lactobacillus bacteremia for intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated with probiotics compared to those not treated, and provide genomics data that support the idea of direct clonal transmission of probiotics to the bloodstream. Whole-genome-based phylogeny showed that Lactobacilli isolated from treated patients’ blood were phylogenetically inseparable from Lactobacilli isolated from the associated probiotic product. Indeed, the minute genetic diversity among the blood isolates mostly mirrored pre-existing genetic heterogeneity found in the probiotic product. Some blood isolates also contained de novo mutations, including a non-synonymous SNP conferring antibiotic resistance in one patient. Our findings support that probiotic strains can directly cause bacteremia and adaptively evolve within ICU patients. Patients in intensive care units administered a bacterial probiotic had an elevated risk of bloodstream infection due to the probiotic strain."
https://openalex.org/W2988194888,"Chronic kidney disease is common in the general population and associated with excess cardiovascular disease (CVD), but kidney function does not feature in current CVD risk-prediction models. We tested three formulae for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to determine which was the most clinically informative for predicting CVD and mortality. Using data from 440,526 participants from UK Biobank, eGFR was calculated using serum creatinine, cystatin C (eGFRcys) and creatinine-cystatin C. Associations of each eGFR with CVD outcome and mortality were compared using Cox models and adjusting for atherosclerotic risk factors (per relevant risk scores), and the predictive utility was determined by the C-statistic and categorical net reclassification index. We show that eGFRcys is most strongly associated with CVD and mortality, and, along with albuminuria, adds predictive discrimination to current CVD risk scores, whilst traditional creatinine-based measures are weakly associated with risk. Clinicians should consider measuring eGFRcys as part of cardiovascular risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2982848656,"A sedentary lifestyle, chronic inflammation and leukocytosis increase atherosclerosis; however, it remains unclear whether regular physical activity influences leukocyte production. Here we show that voluntary running decreases hematopoietic activity in mice. Exercise protects mice and humans with atherosclerosis from chronic leukocytosis but does not compromise emergency hematopoiesis in mice. Mechanistically, exercise diminishes leptin production in adipose tissue, augmenting quiescence-promoting hematopoietic niche factors in leptin-receptor-positive stromal bone marrow cells. Induced deletion of the leptin receptor in Prrx1-creERT2; Leprfl/fl mice reveals that leptin's effect on bone marrow niche cells regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and leukocyte production, as well as cardiovascular inflammation and outcomes. Whereas running wheel withdrawal quickly reverses leptin levels, the impact of exercise on leukocyte production and on the HSPC epigenome and transcriptome persists for several weeks. Together, these data show that physical activity alters HSPCs via modulation of their niche, reducing hematopoietic output of inflammatory leukocytes."

Those abundances depend not only on NO x production rates but also on their lifetimes. Laughner and Cohen report that NO x lifetimes can be measured directly from satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide. They used data on 49 North American cities to show how NO x lifetimes there changed between 2005 and 2014. Accounting for this change in lifetime should help to reconcile conflicting trends between bottom-up and top-down emissions estimates. Science , this issue p. 723"

Unfortunately, these polymers also tend to be overly brittle for many applications. Tang et al. report that a molecular lanthanide catalyst can sequentially polymerize chiral and then achiral diastereomers to form polyhydroxyalkanoate varieties that are substantially more ductile. The catalyst selectively produces these copolymers directly from diastereomeric mixtures of monomers, obviating the need for a wasteful separation process ahead of time. Science , this issue p. 754"
https://openalex.org/W2985194635,"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and a gradual loss of pancreatic beta cell mass and function1,2. Currently, there are no therapies proven to prevent beta cell loss and some, namely insulin secretagogues, have been linked to accelerated beta cell failure, thereby limiting their use in type 2 diabetes3,4. The adipokine adipsin/complement factor D controls the alternative complement pathway and generation of complement component C3a, which acts to augment beta cell insulin secretion5. In contrast to other insulin secretagogues, we show that chronic replenishment of adipsin in diabetic db/db mice ameliorates hyperglycemia and increases insulin levels while preserving beta cells by blocking dedifferentiation and death. Mechanistically, we find that adipsin/C3a decreases the phosphatase Dusp26; forced expression of Dusp26 in beta cells decreases expression of core beta cell identity genes and sensitizes to cell death. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of DUSP26 improves hyperglycemia in diabetic mice and protects human islet cells from cell death. Pertaining to human health, we show that higher concentrations of circulating adipsin are associated with a significantly lower risk of developing future diabetes among middle-aged adults after adjusting for body mass index (BMI). Collectively, these data suggest that adipsin/C3a and DUSP26-directed therapies may represent a novel approach to achieve beta cell health to treat and prevent type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2984655381,"Inducing optical spin-orbit coupling The coupling of the spin-orbit interactions in solid-state systems can give rise to a wide range of exotic electronic transport effects. But solid-state systems tend to be somewhat limited in their flexibility because the spin-orbit coupling is fixed. By contrast, optical systems have recently been shown to mimic complex solid-state systems, with flexibility in design providing the ability to control and manipulate the system properties. Using a liquid crystal–filled photonic cavity, Rechcińska et al. emulated an artificial Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in a photonic system and showed control of an artificial Zeeman splitting. The results illustrate a powerful approach of engineering synthetic Hamiltonians with photons for the simulation of nontrivial condensed matter and quantum phenomena. Science , this issue p. 727"
https://openalex.org/W3099566590,"Atom interferometers are powerful tools for both measurements in fundamental physics and inertial sensing applications. Their performance, however, has been limited by the available interrogation time of freely falling atoms in a gravitational field. We realize an unprecedented interrogation time of 20 seconds by suspending the spatially-separated atomic wavepackets in a lattice formed by the mode of an optical cavity. Unlike traditional atom interferometers, this approach allows potentials to be measured by holding, rather than dropping, atoms. After seconds of hold time, gravitational potential energy differences from as little as microns of vertical separation generate megaradians of interferometer phase. This trapped geometry suppresses the phase sensitivity to vibrations by 3-4 orders of magnitude, overcoming the dominant noise source in atom-interferometric gravimeters. Finally, we study the wavefunction dynamics driven by gravitational potential gradients across neighboring lattice sites."

Part of the challenge is in understanding how modules interact and hand off intermediates. Reimer et al. determined crystal structures of portions of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, including a full dimodule. Module positioning differed between these structures even when the same intermediate was attached to the enzyme. The authors used small-angle x-ray scattering to confirm that large conformational changes are possible during biosynthesis and handoff between modules. Science , this issue p. eaaw4388"

https://openalex.org/W2982746393,"Abstract Ovarian cancer (OVCA) is the most lethal gynecological cancer, due predominantly to late presentation, high recurrence rate and common chemoresistance development. The expression of the actin-associated protein cytosolic gelsolin (GSN) regulates the gynecological cancer cell fate resulting in dysregulation in chemosensitivity. In this study, we report that elevated expression of plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a secreted isoform of GSN and expressed from the same GSN gene, correlates with poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival in patients with OVCA. In addition, it is highly expressed and secreted in chemoresistant OVCA cells than its chemosensitive counterparts. pGSN, secreted and transported via exosomes (Ex-pGSN), upregulates HIF1α–mediated pGSN expression in chemoresistant OVCA cells in an autocrine manner as well as confers cisplatin resistance in otherwise chemosensitive OVCA cells. These findings support our hypothesis that exosomal pGSN promotes OVCA cell survival through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms that transform chemosensitive cells to resistant counterparts. Specifically, pGSN transported via exosomes is a determinant of chemoresistance in OVCA."

https://openalex.org/W2985832396,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cause severe respiratory diseases in infants and elderly adults1. No vaccine or effective antiviral therapy currently exists to control RSV or HMPV infections. During viral genome replication and transcription, the tetrameric phosphoprotein P serves as a crucial adaptor between the ribonucleoprotein template and the L protein, which has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase and cap-specific methyltransferase activities2,3. How P interacts with L and mediates the association with the free form of N and with the ribonucleoprotein is not clear for HMPV or other major human pathogens, including the viruses that cause measles, Ebola and rabies. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction that shows the ring-shaped structure of the polymerase and capping domains of HMPV-L bound to a tetramer of P. The connector and methyltransferase domains of L are mobile with respect to the core. The putative priming loop that is important for the initiation of RNA synthesis is fully retracted, which leaves space in the active-site cavity for RNA elongation. P interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of L, burying more than 4,016 Å2 of the molecular surface area in the interface. Two of the four helices that form the coiled-coil tetramerization domain of P, and long C-terminal extensions projecting from these two helices, wrap around the L protein in a manner similar to tentacles. The structural versatility of the four P protomers—which are largely disordered in their free state—demonstrates an example of a ‘folding-upon-partner-binding’ mechanism for carrying out P adaptor functions. The structure shows that P has the potential to modulate multiple functions of L and these results should accelerate the design of specific antiviral drugs. A cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction shows the ring-shaped structure of the polymerase and capping domains of the L protein bound to a tetramer of phosphoprotein P of the human metapneumovirus."
https://openalex.org/W2984871252,"Millions of people worldwide with incurable end-stage lung disease die because of inadequate treatment options and limited availability of donor organs for lung transplantation1. Current bioengineering strategies to regenerate the lung have not been able to replicate its extraordinary cellular diversity and complex three-dimensional arrangement, which are indispensable for life-sustaining gas exchange2,3. Here we report the successful generation of functional lungs in mice through a conditional blastocyst complementation (CBC) approach that vacates a specific niche in chimeric hosts and allows for initiation of organogenesis by donor mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). We show that wild-type donor PSCs rescued lung formation in genetically defective recipient mouse embryos unable to specify (due to Ctnnb1cnull mutation) or expand (due to Fgfr2cnull mutation) early respiratory endodermal progenitors. Rescued neonates survived into adulthood and had lungs functionally indistinguishable from those of wild-type littermates. Efficient chimera formation and lung complementation required newly developed culture conditions that maintained the developmental potential of the donor PSCs and were associated with global DNA hypomethylation and increased H4 histone acetylation. These results pave the way for the development of new strategies for generating lungs in large animals to enable modeling of human lung disease as well as cell-based therapeutic interventions4-6."

The more notable among these are the nonacetyl histone lysine acylation modifications such as crotonylation, butyrylation, and succinylation. However, the biological relevance of these PTMs is not fully understood because their regulation is largely unknown. Here, we set out to investigate whether the main histone acetyltransferases in budding yeast, Gcn5 and Esa1, possess crotonyltransferase activity. In vitro studies revealed that the Gcn5-Ada2-Ada3 (ADA) and Esa1-Yng2-Epl1 (Piccolo NuA4) histone acetyltransferase complexes have the capacity to crotonylate histones. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that ADA and Piccolo NuA4 crotonylate lysines in the N-terminal tails of histone H3 and H4, respectively. Functionally, we show that crotonylation selectively affects gene transcription in vivo in a manner dependent on Gcn5 and Esa1.

Here, we reveal both the in vitro and in vivo activities of the Gcn5-Ada2-Ada3 (ADA) and Esa1-Yng2-Epl1 (Piccolo NuA4) complexes, thereby identifying these complexes as writers of histone H3 and H4 crotonylation, respectively. Moreover, we show that crotonate treatment triggers a transcription response that depends on Gcn5- and Esa1-dependent histone crotonylation. Thus, the ADA and Piccolo NuA4 complexes exhibit crotonyltransferase activity toward chromatin and are regulators of crotonylation-dependent transcription. Because a role for Gcn5 and Esa1 in crotonylation had not been properly described, we examined whether Gcn5 and Esa1 are bona fide writers of this modification in budding yeast. To this end, we first purified Gcn5 from Escherichia coli (Fig. S1A), and tested whether it can directly crotonylate chromatin in vitro using a histone acylation transferase assay. Acetyl-CoA (positive control) and crotonyl-CoA were used as acyl-donors in this assay. The outcome of the reactions was analyzed by Western blot analysis using different pan-K-acyl-specific antibodies. Gcn5 alone, in contrast to the core ADA complex consisting of Gcn5, Ada2, and Ada3, displays weak acetylation activity toward nucleosomes (22Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E.

In addition, we also did not observe crotonylation activity (Fig. S2B). We therefore purified the core ADA (Gcn5, Ada2, and Ada2) complex from E. coli (Fig. S1, B and C) and tested its activity on histone octamers and on in vitro reconstituted mononucleosomes (Fig. S1D) (24Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

As previously shown, the core ADA complex displayed robust acetylation activity mainly toward histone H3 in both histone octamers and nucleosomes (Fig. 1A, Fig. S3A). This activity depended on the catalytic glutamic acid residue on position 173 in Gcn5, because changing it to histidine (Gcn5-E173H) abrogated acetylation, agreeing with previous reports (Fig. 1A) (22Grant P.A.

Importantly, the ADA complex also exhibited crotonyltransferase activity toward histone octamers and nucleosomes in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. S3B). Thus, we identified the ADA complex as a writer of histone crotonylation in vitro. We then sought to confirm the presence of crotonyl modifications on histone H3 and investigate which lysines in histone H3 are targeted for crotonylation by Gcn5. We therefore performed in vitro crotonyltransferase assays using mononucleosomes, separated the reaction products on SDS-PAGE and stained the gel by Coomassie. Bands corresponding to H3 were cut out and samples were analyzed by MS. This revealed that Gcn5 acetylates lysine residues at positions 9, 14, 18, 23, and 27 in histone H3 (Fig. 1, C–E, and Fig. S4). Likewise, Gcn5 targeted the same residues for crotonylation (Fig. 1E), all of which were known to be acetylated (25Cieniewicz A.M. Moreland L. Ringel A.E. Mackintosh S.G. Raman A. Gilbert T.M.

These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis of the in vitro reaction products using site-specific antibodies for H3 lysine 9, 14, and 18 (Fig. S5). Of note, two bands were detected, likely representing differently modified H3 species (Fig. S5). We validated these antibodies by Western blot analysis using extracts from yeast cells expressing H3K9A, K3K14A, and H3K18A substitutions. The signal observed in the WT strain was lost in the substitution mutants (Fig. S6, A–C), whereas expression of histone H3 was not affected in any of these mutants (Fig. S6D) indicating site-specificity of these antibodies. Thus, the ADA complex is capable of directly modifying chromatin by acetylation, as well as crotonylation, targeting the same residues in histone H3. Esa1, similar to Gcn5, is unable to acetylate chromatin substrates in the absence of its members in the NuA4 complex (26Berndsen C.E. Selleck W. McBryant S.J. Hansen J.C. Tan S. Denu J.M.

In addition, Esa1 alone does not possess any crotonyltransferase activity (20Liu X. Wei W. Liu Y. Yang X. Wu J. Zhang Y. Zhang Q. Shi T. Du J.X. Zhao Y. Lei M. Zhou J.Q. Li J. Wong J.

As expected, the Piccolo NuA4 complex displayed robust acetylation activity mainly toward histone H4 (Fig. 2A) (23Barrios A. Selleck W. Hnatkovich B. Kramer R. Sermwittayawong D. Tan S.

This activity depended on the catalytic glutamic acid residue on position 338 in Esa1, because changing it to glutamine (Esa1-E338Q) abrogated acetylation, agreeing with previous reports (Fig. 2A) (29Decker P.V.

The Piccolo NuA4 complex, similar to the ADA complex, also exhibited crotonyltransferase activity toward nucleosomes in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity (Fig. 2B). Thus, we identified the Piccolo NuA4 complex as a writer of histone crotonylation in vitro. To ascertain the presence of crotonyl modifications on histone H4 and identify the lysines in histone H4 that are crotonylated by Esa1, we examined reaction products from the acyltransferase assay by MS. Similar to the approach for Gcn5, we cut out H4 bands from SDS-PAGE gels and examined the samples by MS. This revealed that Esa1 acetylates lysine residues at positions 5, 8, 12, and 16 in histone H4 for acetylation (Fig. S8), which is in agreement with previous reports (26Berndsen C.E. Selleck W. McBryant S.J. Hansen J.C. Tan S. Denu J.M. Nucleosome recognition by the Piccolo NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (17274630): 2091-209910.1021/bi602366nCrossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Boudreault A.A.

Importantly, Esa1 also targeted the same residues for crotonylation (Fig. 2, D and E, Fig. S8). Therefore, the Piccolo NuA4 complex is capable of directly modifying chromatin by acetylation, as well as crotonylation, targeting the same residues in histone H4. Following our in vitro studies on the role of Gcn5 and Esa1 in crotonylation, we sought to address the relevance of these Gcn5-dependent and Esa1-dependent modifications in vivo. To this end, we added external sodium crotonate to the yeast medium. This compound can be ligated into the corresponding acyl-CoAs, as previously shown in human cells (11Sabari B.R. Tang Z. Huang H. Yong-Gonzalez V. Molina H. Kong H.E. Dai L. Shimada M. Cross J.R. Zhao Y. Roeder R.G. Allis C.D. Intracellular crotonyl-CoA stimulates transcription through p300-catalyzed histone crotonylation.Mol.

Indeed, crotonate addition increased crotonylation on histone H3 (Fig. 3A) and this was largely dependent on the presence of the yeast acetyl-CoA synthetase enzymes Acs1 and Acs2 (Fig. 3A). To further study these crotonate-induced changes, we performed Western blot analysis of H3K9cr H3K14cr and H3K18cr in yeast chromatin following crotonate treatment (Fig. S6). Importantly, whereas the signals for these marks moderately increased following crotonate treatment of WT cells, the H3K9cr, H3K14cr and H3K18cr signals were lost in yeast cells expressing the H3K9A, H3K14A and H3K18A substitutions (Fig. S6). This finding suggests site-specific crotonyl recognition of these antibodies under increased crotonate conditions. To corroborate these findings, we also examined crotonylation in chromatin from WT yeast cells by MS. As a control, we included chromatin from HeLa cells, in which the relative abundances of H3K14ac and H3K14cr was around 8 and 0.02%, respectively (31Klein B.J. Simithy J. Wang X. Ahn J. Andrews F.H. Zhang Y. Côté J. Shi X. Garcia B.A. Kutateladze T.G. Recognition of histone H3K14 acylation by MORF.Structure. 2017; 25 (28286003): 650-654.e210.1016/j.str.2017.02.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In WT yeast that were treated with crotonate or left untreated, we did not detect crotonylation on the histone tails of H4, indicative of low abundance of this modification. In accordance with these findings, crotonylation could also not be detected on the histone tails of H4 from HeLa cells (17Simithy J. Sidoli S. Yuan Z.F. Coradin M. Bhanu N.V. Marchione D.M. Klein B.J. Bazilevsky G.A. McCullough C.E. Magin R.S. Kutateladze T.G. Snyder N.W. Marmorstein R. Garcia B.A. Characterization of histone acylations links chromatin modifications with metabolism.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (29070843)1141 10.1038/s41467-017-01384-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, we identified crotonylation on the N-terminal tail of H3 in chromatin from crotonate-treated WT yeast cells. Specifically, we found lysine 9, 14, and 23 to be crotonylated (Fig. 3, B–F). These lysines were among the residues targeted by Gcn5 crotonylation in vitro (Fig. 1, Fig. S4), indicating a Gcn5-dependent crotonate response that involves H3 crotonylation in vivo. To examine whether Gcn5 and Esa1 are responsible for crotonylation in vivo, we examined crotonate-induced crotonylation in the absence of these enzymes. We observed a dose-dependent increase in histone crotonylation, which was reduced in the absence of Gcn5 (Fig. 3G, Fig. S9). Because Esa1 is an essential gene, we employed the anchor-away technique to rapidly deplete FRB-tagged Esa1 from the nucleus following rapamycin treatment (32Haruki H. Nishikawa J. Laemmli U.K. The anchor-away technique: rapid, conditional establishment of yeast mutant phenotypes.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31 (18922474): 925-93210.1016/j.molcel.2008.07.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). As expected, rapamycin treatment severely reduced histone acetylation, although levels in the nontagged/no-FRB strain remained unaffected (Fig. S10). Importantly, crotonate-induced histone crotonylation was also reduced in the rapamycin-treated Esa1-N-FRB strain (Fig. 3I, Fig. S9). We did not observe cross-talk between crotonylation and acetylation because crotonylation was not affected by the addition of acetate (Fig. 3, G and I), which is known to affect acetylation (33Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D. Nucleocytosolic acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase is required for histone acetylation and global transcription.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23 (16857587): 207-21710.1016/j.molcel.2006.05.040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Likewise, adding crotonate to the medium did not lead to a change in the acetylation levels (Fig. 3, H and J). Similarly, changes in the abundance of succinyl-CoA did not affect acetylation levels (19Wang Y. Guo Y.R. Liu K. Yin Z. Liu R. Xia Y. Tan L. Yang P. Lee J.H. Li X.J. Hawke D. Zheng Y. Qian X. Lyu J. He J. et al.KAT2A coupled with the α-KGDH complex acts as a histone H3 succinyltransferase.Nature. 2017; 552 (29211711): 273-27710.1038/nature25003Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that histone crotonylation responds to metabolic changes in crotonyl-CoA abundance in a manner dependent on Gcn5 and Esa1. To investigate the relevance of metabolic regulation of crotonylation, we decided to study its effect on transcription. WT cells were grown in the absence or presence of crotonate for 3.5 h and mRNA was isolated and deep-sequenced (Fig. 4A). We identified 880 transcripts that were differentially expressed following crotonate treatment (p < 0.05). In contrast to a previous report suggesting that crotonylation has a stimulatory effect on transcription (11Sabari B.R. Tang Z. Huang H. Yong-Gonzalez V. Molina H. Kong H.E. Dai L. Shimada M.

Although some MRAP2 mutations have been described in people with obesity1–3, their functional consequences on adiposity remain elusive. Using large-scale sequencing of MRAP2 in 9,418 people, we identified 23 rare heterozygous variants associated with increased obesity risk in both adults and children. Functional assessment of each variant shows that loss-of-function MRAP2 variants are pathogenic for monogenic hyperphagic obesity, hyperglycemia and hypertension. This contrasts with other monogenic forms of obesity characterized by excessive hunger, including melanocortin-4 receptor deficiency, that present with low blood pressure and normal glucose tolerance4. The pleiotropic metabolic effect of loss-of-function mutations in MRAP2 might be due to the failure of different MRAP2-regulated G-protein-coupled receptors in various tissues including pancreatic islets. Large-scale sequencing of coding exons of MRAP2 in 9,418 adults and adolescents identifies loss-of-function mutations that are associated with monogenic obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia."

They result in loss of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and high out-of-pocket expenditure. However, there is little evidence on the economic burden of injuries in India. We undertook this study to report out-of-pocket expenditure and the prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure for injuries related hospitalizations in public sector hospitals in North India. Further, we also evaluate the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure.A prospective observational study was conducted. Participants were recruited from three hospitals for all injury cases. Data were collected via face-to-face baseline interviews and follow-up interviews over the phone at 1, 2, 4 and 12 months post-injury. Prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure (more than 30% of consumption expenditure) and impoverishment (International dollar 1.90) were estimated.Road traffic injuries (57%) were the leading cause of injury. Direct out-of-pocket expenditure for hospitalizations was INR 16,768 (USD 263) while indirect productivity loss was INR 8,164 (USD 128). The prevalence of catastrophic expenditure was 22.2% with 12.2% slipping below poverty line. Prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment was higher and significantly associated with poorest quintile, tertiary care hospital and increased duration of hospitalization (p< 0.001).The economic impact of injuries is notably high both in terms of out-of-pocket expenditure and productivity loss. A high proportion of households experienced catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment following an injury, highlighting need for programs to prevent injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2989389674,"Proinflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment can promote tumor growth, yet their value as therapeutic targets remains underexploited. We validated the functional significance of the cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1)-ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) signaling axis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and generated a high-affinity soluble receptor (eCNTFR-Fc) that sequesters CLCF1, thereby inhibiting its oncogenic effects. eCNTFR-Fc inhibits tumor growth in multiple xenograft models and in an autochthonous, highly aggressive genetically engineered mouse model of LUAD, driven by activation of oncogenic Kras and loss of Trp53. Abrogation of CLCF1 through eCNTFR-Fc appears most effective in tumors driven by oncogenic KRAS. We observed a correlation between the effectiveness of eCNTFR-Fc and the presence of KRAS mutations that retain the intrinsic capacity to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate, suggesting that the mechanism of action may be related to altered guanosine triphosphate loading. Overall, we nominate blockade of CLCF1-CNTFR signaling as a novel therapeutic opportunity for LUAD and potentially for other tumor types in which CLCF1 is present in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2987944969,"Excessive collagen deposition by myofibroblasts during adverse cardiac remodeling leads to myocardial fibrosis that can compromise cardiac function. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying collagen gene expression in cardiac myofibroblasts is therefore an important clinical goal. The collagen receptors, discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), a collagen-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, and integrin-β1, are reported to mediate tissue fibrosis. Here, we probed the role of DDR2–integrin-β1 cross-talk in the regulation of collagen α1(I) gene expression in angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. Results from gene silencing/overexpression approaches, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and ChIP revealed that DDR2 acts via extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2 MAPK)-dependent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling to activate activator protein-1 (AP-1) that in turn transcriptionally enhances the expression of collagen-binding integrin-β1 in Ang II–stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. The DDR2–integrin-β1 link was also evident in spontaneously hypertensive rats and DDR2-knockout mice. Further, DDR2 acted via integrin-β1 to regulate α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I expression in Ang II–exposed cardiac fibroblasts. Downstream of the DDR2–integrin-β1 axis, α-SMA was found to regulate collagen α1(I) gene expression via the Ca2+ channel, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 6 (TRPC6), and the profibrotic transcription factor, Yes-associated protein (YAP). This finding indicated that fibroblast-to-myofibroblast conversion is mechanistically coupled to collagen expression. The observation that collagen receptor cross-talk underlies α-SMA–dependent collagen type I expression in cardiac fibroblasts expands our understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in collagen gene expression in the heart and may be relevant to cardiac fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2988565300,"Tau is an intrinsically disordered, microtubule-associated protein that has a role in regulating microtubule dynamics. Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms of Tau-mediated microtubule polymerization are poorly understood. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence to investigate the role of Tau's N-terminal domain (NTD) and proline-rich region (PRR) in regulating interactions of Tau with soluble tubulin. We assayed both full-length Tau isoforms and truncated variants for their ability to bind soluble tubulin and stimulate microtubule polymerization. We found that Tau's PRR is an independent tubulin-binding domain that has tubulin polymerization capacity. In contrast to the relatively weak interactions with tubulin mediated by sites distributed throughout Tau's microtubule-binding region (MTBR), resulting in heterogeneous Tau: tubulin complexes, the PRR bound tubulin tightly and stoichiometrically. Moreover, we demonstrate that interactions between the PRR and MTBR are reduced by the NTD through a conserved conformational ensemble. On the basis of these results, we propose that Tau's PRR can serve as a core tubulin-binding domain, whereas the MTBR enhances polymerization capacity by increasing the local tubulin concentration. Moreover, the NTD appears to negatively regulate tubulin-binding interactions of both of these domains. The findings of our study draw attention to a central role of the PRR in Tau function and provide mechanistic insight into Tau-mediated polymerization of tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2985327318,"The SecYEG translocon constitutes the major protein transport channel in bacteria and transfers an enormous variety of different secretory and inner-membrane proteins. The minimal core of the SecYEG translocon consists of three inner-membrane proteins, SecY, SecE, and SecG, which, together with appropriate targeting factors, are sufficient for protein transport in vitro. However, in vivo the SecYEG translocon has been shown to associate with multiple partner proteins, likely allowing the SecYEG translocon to process its diverse substrates. To obtain a global view on SecYEG plasticity in Escherichia coli, here we performed a quantitative interaction proteomic analysis, which identified several known SecYEG-interacting proteins, verified the interaction of SecYEG with quality-control proteins, and revealed several previously unknown putative SecYEG-interacting proteins. Surprisingly, we found that the chaperone complex PpiD/YfgM is the most prominent interaction partner of SecYEG. Detailed analyses of the PpiD–SecY interaction by site-directed cross-linking revealed that PpiD and the established SecY partner protein YidC use almost completely-overlapping binding sites on SecY. Both PpiD and YidC contacted the lateral gate, the plug domain, and the periplasmic cavity of SecY. However, quantitative MS and cross-linking analyses revealed that despite having almost identical binding sites, their binding to SecY is noncompetitive. This observation suggests that the SecYEG translocon forms different substrate-independent subassemblies in which SecYEG either associates with YidC or with the PpiD/YfgM complex. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the PpiD/YfgM chaperone complex is a primary interaction partner of the SecYEG translocon."
https://openalex.org/W2985281618,"High amounts of aerial pollutants like dust and microorganisms can pose serious health hazards to animals and humans. The aim of the current study therefore was, to assess the efficiency of UVC irradiation combined to air filtration in reducing airborne microorganisms at laboratory scale. In a second part, a UVC-combined recirculating air filtration module (UVC module) was implemented in a small animal facility in order to assess its improvement of air quality with regard to airborne bacteria and dust. Tests at laboratory scale were performed using aerosols of Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, porcine parvovirus (PPV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. We varied relative humidity (RH) to evaluate its effect on UVC irradiation efficiency. In addition, viability of pathogens inside the filter material was determined over up to six months. UVC-combined air filtration resulted in a more than 99% reduction of viral and bacterial particles. RH had no influence on UVC efficiency. Viability in the filter matter varied depending on the pathogen used and RH with S. aureus and PPV being most resistant. In our small pig facility consisting of two separated barns, weekly air measurements were conducted over a period of 13 weeks (10 piglets) and 16 weeks (11 piglets), respectively. Airborne bacterial numbers were significantly lower in the barn equipped with the UVC module compared to the reference barn. On average a reduction to 37% of reference values could be achieved for bacteria, whereas the amount of total dust was reduced to a much lesser extent (i.e. to 78% of reference values). Measures taken in front of and behind the UVC module revealed a reduction of 99.4% for airborne bacteria and 95.0% for total dust. To conclude, recirculating air filtration combined to UVC provided efficient reduction of pathogens at laboratory and experimental scale. The implementation of such devices might improve the overall environmental quality in animal facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2986089950,"Anthracyclines are a highly effective component of curative breast cancer chemotherapy but are associated with substantial morbidity1,2. Because anthracyclines work in part by inhibiting topoisomerase-II (TOP2) on accessible DNA3,4, we hypothesized that chromatin regulatory genes (CRGs) that mediate DNA accessibility might predict anthracycline response. We studied the role of CRGs in anthracycline sensitivity in breast cancer through integrative analysis of patient and cell line data. We identified a consensus set of 38 CRGs associated with anthracycline response across ten cell line datasets. By evaluating the interaction between expression and treatment in predicting survival in a metacohort of 1006 patients with early-stage breast cancer, we identified 54 CRGs whose expression levels dictate anthracycline benefit across the clinical subgroups; of these CRGs, 12 overlapped with those identified in vitro. CRGs that promote DNA accessibility, including Trithorax complex members, were associated with anthracycline sensitivity when highly expressed, whereas CRGs that reduce accessibility, such as Polycomb complex proteins, were associated with decreased anthracycline sensitivity. We show that KDM4B modulates TOP2 accessibility to chromatin, elucidating a mechanism of TOP2 inhibitor sensitivity. These findings indicate that CRGs mediate anthracycline benefit by altering DNA accessibility, with implications for the stratification of patients with breast cancer and treatment decision making. Epigenetic regulators modulating chromatin accessibility dictate sensitivity to anthracycline-based therapy in early breast cancer and represent potential biomarkers for patient stratification."

https://openalex.org/W2983075146,"Manganese supports numerous neuronal functions but in excess is neurotoxic. Consequently, regulation of manganese flux at the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is critical to brain homeostasis. However, the molecular pathways supporting the transcellular trafficking of divalent manganese ions within the microvascular capillary endothelial cells (BMVECs) that constitute the BBB have not been examined. In this study, we have determined that ZIP8 and ZIP14 (Zrt- and Irt-like proteins 8 and 14) support Mn2+ uptake by BMVECs and that neither DMT1 nor an endocytosis-dependent pathway play any significant role in Mn2+ uptake. Specifically, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZIP8 and ZIP14 coincided with a decrease in manganese uptake, and kinetic analyses revealed that manganese uptake depends on pH and bicarbonate and is up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide, all biochemical markers of ZIP8 or ZIP14 activity. Mn2+ uptake also was associated with cell-surface membrane presentation of ZIP8 and ZIP14, as indicated by membrane protein biotinylation. Importantly, surface ZIP8 and ZIP14 biotinylation and Mn2+-uptake experiments together revealed that these transporters support manganese uptake at both the apical, blood and basal, brain sides of BMVECs. This indicated that in the BMVECs of the BBB, these two transporters support a bidirectional Mn2+ flux. We conclude that BMVECs play a critical role in controlling manganese homeostasis in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2983981002,"Many Gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to inject virulence effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. The T3SS apparatus (T3SA) is structurally conserved among diverse bacterial pathogens and consists of a cytoplasmic sorting platform, an envelope-spanning basal body, and an extracellular needle with tip complex. The sorting platform is essential for effector recognition and powering secretion. Studies using bacterial “minicells” have revealed an unprecedented level of structural detail of the sorting platform; however, many of the structure-function relationships within this complex remain enigmatic. Here, we report on improved cryo-electron tomographic approaches to enhance the resolution of the Shigella T3SA sorting platform (at ≤2 nm resolution) done in concert with biochemical and genetic methods to define the sorting platform interactome and interactions with the T3SA inner membrane ring (IR). We observed that the sorting platform consists of “pods” with 6-fold symmetry that interact with the Spa47 ATPase via radial extensions comprising MxiN. Most importantly, MxiK maintained an interaction with the IR via specific interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of the IR protein MxiG (MxiGC), which is a noncanonical forkhead-associated domain, and MxiK has an elongated structure that interacts with the IR via MxiGC. T4 lysozyme-mediated insertional mutagenesis of MxiK revealed its orientation within the sorting platform and enabled disruption of interactions with its binding partners, which abolished sorting platform assembly. Finally, a comparison with the homologous interactions in the Salmonella T3SS sorting platform revealed clear differences in their IR-sorting platform interfaces that have possible mechanistic implications.

https://openalex.org/W2986789828,"Background Cationic arginine-rich peptides (CARPs) have demonstrated neuroprotective and/or behavioural efficacy in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury models. Therefore, in this study we investigated the safety and neuroprotective efficacy of the CARPs poly-arginine-18 (R18; 18-mer of arginine) and its D-enantiomer R18D given in the acute bleeding phase in an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model. Methods One hundred and fifty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats received collagenase-induced ICH. Study 1 examined various doses of R18D (30, 100, 300, or 1000 nmol/kg) or R18 (100, 300, 1000 nmol/kg) administered intravenously 30 minutes post-collagenase injection on hemorrhage volume 24 hours after ICH. Study 2 examined R18D (single intravenous dose) or R18 (single intravenous dose, plus 6 daily intraperitoneal doses) at 300 or 1000 nmol/kg commencing 30 minutes post-collagenase injection on behavioural outcomes (Montoya staircase test, and horizontal ladder test) in the chronic post-ICH period. A histological assessment of tissue loss was assessed using a Nissl stain at 28 days after ICH. Results When administered during ongoing bleeding, neither R18 or R18D exacerbated hematoma volume or worsened functional deficits. Lesion volume assessment at 28 days post-ICH was not reduced by the peptides; however, animals treated with the lower R18D 300 nmol/kg dose, but not with the higher 1000 nmol/kg dose, demonstrated a statistically increased lesion size compared to saline treated animals. Conclusion Overall, both R18 and R18D appeared to be safe when administered during a period of ongoing bleeding following ICH. Neither peptide appears to have any statistically significant effect in reducing lesion volume or improving functional recovery after ICH. Additional studies are required to further assess dose efficacy and safety in pre-clinical ICH studies."
https://openalex.org/W2985132963,"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly used as an animal model for biomedical research; however, gastrointestinal diseases causing significant morbidity are endemic in many captive marmoset colonies. Establishing gut microbiome patterns in a marmoset colony may aid in clinical decision-making and model reproducibility. A standardized method of sample collection and storage is essential for proper interpretation of microbiome data. While microbiome studies commonly utilize fecal samples, the goal of this study was to determine whether the microbiome profile from a rectal swab performed on a sedated animal was comparable to the microbiome profile from a fecal sample. During routine physical exams, paired fecal and rectal swab samples were collected from each of 23 marmosets. DNA was extracted from all fecal and rectal swab samples and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences were amplified and analyzed. Initial comparison of the relative abundance of bacterial phyla between paired samples had a r2 value of 0.70 with S of 0.08 with no significant differences in α and β diversity metrics between fecal and rectal samples. Initial analysis however, revealed 5 discordant fecal-rectal pairs which corresponded only with the 5 rectal swabs that were classified as free of visible fecal matter during collection. Exclusion of these 5 pairs resulted in an optimized fit of the data as evidenced by a r2 value of 0.91 with S of 0.05. These results demonstrate that rectal swabs are a reliable method for profiling the fecal microbiome in the marmoset since the bacterial composition from a rectal swab with visible fecal contents correlated well with the bacterial composition from a fecal sample from the same marmoset. This study highlights the importance of standardized sample collection methods and exclusion of inappropriate samples."
https://openalex.org/W2988149848,"The surface area of the human cerebral cortex undergoes dramatic expansion during late fetal development, leading to cortical folding, an evolutionary feature not present in rodents. Microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by an abnormally small brain, and many gene mutations have been found to be associated with primary microcephaly. However, mouse models generated by ablating primary microcephaly-associated genes often fail to recapitulate the severe loss of cortical surface area observed in individuals with this pathology. Here, we show that a mouse model with deficient expression of high-mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 2 (HMGN2) manifests microcephaly with reduced cortical surface area and almost normal radial corticogenesis, with a pattern of incomplete penetrance. We revealed that altered cleavage plane and mitotic delay of ventricular radial glia may explain the rising ratio of intermediate progenitor cells to radial glia and the displacement of neural progenitor cells in microcephalic mutant mice. These led to decreased self-renewal of the radial glia and reduction in lateral expansion. Furthermore, we found that HMGN2 protected corticogenesis by maintaining global chromatin accessibility mainly at promoter regions, thereby ensuring the correct regulation of the transcriptome. Our findings underscore the importance of the regulation of chromatin structure in cortical development and highlight a mouse model with critical insights into the etiology of microcephaly.

https://openalex.org/W2983212947,"Objective To examine the interaction between APOE genotypes and both treated and untreated hypertension on cognitive function in an updated analysis of Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) data. Design At baseline (1995–2001) and 3 biennial follow-up assessments over ~6 years, cognitive function was assessed. Setting and participants 8300 NHS participants aged 70+ years underwent a cognitive battery, which comprised 6 tests including the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and tests of verbal memory, category fluency, and working memory. Measures We estimated the mean differences in average cognitive scores across up to 4 assessments using multiple linear regression. We also tested for interaction between APOE e4 allele carrier status and hypertension overall, as well as for apparently untreated and treated hypertension. Results We confirmed that, compared with those with APOE e3/3 genotype, APOE e4 allele carriers scored lower by 0.55 units on the average TICS score (95%CI:-0.67,-0.43). We also observed a significantly worse average TICS score among women with untreated hypertension compared with women without hypertension (difference = -0.23, 95%CI:-0.37,-0.09), while no significant difference was observed for women with treated hypertension. Significant interaction was detected between the APOE e4 allele and untreated hypertension (p-int = 0.02 for the TICS; p-int = 0.045 for global score), but not with treated hypertension. Specifically, compared with normotensive women with the APOE e3/3 genotype, APOE e4 allele carriers with treated hypertension scored lower by 0.50 units (95%CI:-0.69,-0.31); however, the APOE e4 allele carriers with untreated hypertension scored lower by 1.02 units on the TICS score (95%CI:-1.29, -0.76). This interaction of APOE e4 and untreated hypertension was also consistently observed for the global score. Conclusions Women with hypertension and at least one APOE e4 allele had worse average cognitive function compared with women without hypertension with the e3/3 genotype; this difference was amplified among APOE e4 allele carriers with untreated hypertension."

When cultivated under different conditions, Euglena produces different bioactive nutrients. Interestingly, Euglena is the only known microorganism whose chloroplasts are easy to lose under stress and become permanently bleached. We applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the metabolomes of wild-type (WT) Euglena gracilis and its bleached mutant OflB2 under light stimulation. We found a significant metabolic difference between WT and OflB2 cells in response to light. An increase of membrane components (phospholipids and acylamides) was observed in WT, while a decrease of some stimulant metabolites was detected in OflB2. These metabolomic changes after light stimulation are of great significance to the development of Euglena chloroplasts and their communications with the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2986921121,"Anila began to work on her poster 1 week before the conference. The quality didn't matter that much, she thought. After all, hers would be one in a sea of other boring posters, each nervously guarded by a grad student. “No one is even going to look at it,” she told herself. Anila—a third-year graduate student at the time—considered presenting a poster an obligation, merely what she had to do to secure entry to the conference. She scanned her computer for last year's template, replaced the old content with some new text and figures, and called it done. She was much more interested in scouring the conference schedule for cool talks by famous scientists, anyway.

> “Presenting a poster … is a great opportunity—if you put in the time to prepare.” 

Fast-forward 1 week. The poster session was winding down when two scientists approached. Anila gave them her research synopsis and paused for questions. “Why didn't you cut the electrodes to a different size?” one asked. The other nodded and looked at Anila expectantly. Unlike previous visitors, they didn't seem satisfied with her broad-stroke responses and continued to ask probing questions. Anila hadn't expected anyone to take her research this seriously, and she wasn't prepared to defend the finer points of her work.

The visitors began to talk with each other, swapping ideas and discussing ways to improve the methods, while Anila—embarrassed—stood on the sidelines. She couldn't help but think that if she had been better prepared, she could have been an active participant in the discussion rather than a passive listener. When she relayed her story to her friend Oliver—a grad student in a different field—she realized that her experience wasn't unique: He, too, had walked away from poster presentations feeling embarrassed.

Those experiences eventually set us on a new path. We wanted not only to mitigate future poster session misery, but also to get as much as possible out of presenting posters. We put more thought and time into our posters, and we quickly started to see the benefits. People engaged more deeply with our work, often resulting in meaningful, satisfying conversations that have helped shape the next steps in our research and prepared us for peer review. We've even received the occasional job or collaboration offer.

Now, as postdocs who have presented dozens of posters at conferences around the world, we know that there is a lot to be gained from a poster session. Here are some tips we picked up along the way.

TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. Presenting a poster may seem less prestigious than giving a talk, but it is a great opportunity—if you put in the time to prepare. Poster sessions leave more room for interaction and feedback, often in a more relaxed environment that's conducive to friendly advice. Don't brush it off. Practice your poster presentation in front of colleagues, friends, and family so that you feel comfortable describing the intricacies of your work and answering questions about it.

PUT CONTENT FIRST. Don't stress over making your poster a visual stunner. Instead, focus on including information that is essential to understanding your methods, results, and conclusions. Your poster should complement your verbal presentation, so when you're making it, ask yourself, “What information can I describe verbally, and what do I need to depict?” Put the latter on your poster using large, clear figures and brief bullet-pointed text. This will allow visitors to quickly evaluate your work and engage you in discussion.

BE CONFIDENT. Show pride in your work, keeping in mind that your poster presentation doesn't have to be flawless. Conference attendees will understand if you don't have publication-ready data. There's also no shame in saying “I don't know” in response to questions; in fact, acknowledging uncertainty can open doors for discussion.

DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. We've both been disappointed when our posters didn't draw as big a crowd as we were hoping—and equally taken aback when a visitor was overly critical. You might not get the type of engagement you hoped for, but that doesn't mean your work isn't valuable.
