https://openalex.org/W2072489106,"GADD45 is a ubiquitously expressed mammalian gene that is induced by DNA damage and certain other stresses. Like another p53-regulated gene, p21WAF1/CIP1, whose product binds to cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk's) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), GADD45 has been associated with growth suppression. Gadd45 was found to bind to PCNA, a normal component of Cdk complexes and a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. Gadd45 stimulated DNA excision repair in vitro and inhibited entry of cells into S phase. These results establish GADD45 as a link between the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1964120116,"In this study, the cytokine-producing profile of progenitor T cells (pro-T cells) was determined. During screening of a complementary DNA library generated from activated mouse pro-T cells, a cytokine designated lymphotactin was discovered. Lymphotactin is similar to members of both the Cys-Cys and Cys-X-Cys chemokine families but lacks two of the four cysteine residues that are characteristic of the chemokines. Lymphotactin is also expressed in activated CD8+ T cells and CD4-CD8- T cell receptor alpha beta + thymocytes. It has chemotactic activity for lymphocytes but not for monocytes or neutrophils. The gene encoding lymphotactin maps to chromosome one. Taken together, these observations suggest that lymphotactin represents a novel addition to the chemokine superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2063700930,"The role played in immune surveillance by gamma delta T cells residing in various epithelia has not been clear. It is shown here that activated gamma delta T cells obtained from skin and intestine express the epithelial cell mitogen keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). In contrast, intraepithelial alpha beta T cells, as well as all lymphoid alpha beta and gamma delta T cell populations tested, did not produce KGF or promote the growth of cultured epithelial cells. These results suggest that intraepithelial gamma delta T cells function in surveillance and in repair of damaged epithelial tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2075227748,"The development of retroviral vectors that target specific cell types could have important implications for the design of gene therapy strategies. A chimeric protein containing the polypeptide hormone erythropoietin and part of the env protein of ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus was engineered into the virus. This murine virus became several times more infectious for murine cells bearing the erythropoietin receptor, and it also became infectious for human cells bearing the erythropoietin receptor. This type of tissue-specific targeting by means of ligand-receptor interactions may have broad applications to a variety of gene delivery systems."
https://openalex.org/W2080809922,"The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) β chain regulates early T cell development in the absence of the TCRα chain. The developmentally controlled gene described here encodes the pre-TCRα (pTα) chain, which covalently associates with TCRβ and with the CD3 proteins forms a pre-TCR complex that transduces signals in immature thymocytes. Unlike the λ5 pre-B cell receptor protein, the pTα chain is a type I transmembrane protein whose cytoplasmic tail contains two potential phosphorylation sites and a Src homology 3 (SH3)-domain binding sequence. Pre-TCRα transfection experiments indicated that surface expression of the pre-TCR is controlled by additional developmentally regulated proteins. Identification of the pTα gene represents an essential step in the structure-function analysis of the pre-TCR complex."
https://openalex.org/W2090725059,"Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed on 12 natural isolates of Escherichia coli in four loci located in close proximity on the chromosome. A comparison of gene genealogies indicated that three recombination events have occurred in a subset of the strains (ECOR group A) in the time since their divergence from a common ancestor, while during the same time, no mutational divergence has occurred. The common ancestor of this subset existed no more than 2400 years ago, and recombination was shown to occur at a rate of 5.0 x 10(-9) changes per nucleotide per generation--50-fold higher than the mutation rate. Thus, recombination has been the dominant force driving the clonal divergence of the ECOR group A strains and must be considered a significant factor in structuring E. coli populations."

https://openalex.org/W1963684521,"A diverse set of circadian clock mutants was isolated in a cyanobacterial strain that carries a bacterial luciferase reporter gene attached to a clock-controlled promoter. Among 150,000 clones of chemically mutagenized bioluminescent cells, 12 mutants were isolated that exhibit a broad spectrum of periods (between 16 and 60 hours), and 5 mutants were found that show a variety of unusual patterns, including arrhythmia. These mutations appear to be clock-specific. Moreover, it was demonstrated that in this cyanobacterium it is possible to clone mutant genes by complementation, which provides a means to genetically dissect the circadian mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1984188958,"The entry of segments of preproteins of defined lengths into the matrix space of mitochondria was studied. The mitochondrial chaperone Hsp70 (mtHsp70) interacted with proteins emerging from the protein import channel and stabilized translocation intermediates across the membranes in an adenosine triphosphate-dependent fashion. The chaperone bound to the presequence and mature parts of preproteins. In the absence of mtHsp70 binding, preproteins with less than 30 to 40 residues in the matrix diffused out of mitochondria. Thus, protein translocation was reversible up to a late stage. The import channels in both mitochondrial membranes constitute a passive pore that interacts weakly with polypeptide chains entering the matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1914120156,"Cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cGMP are second messengers subserving various signaling pathways. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a recently discovered member of the family, is derived from NAD+ and is a mediator of Ca2+ mobilization in various cellular systems. The synthesis and degradation of cADPR are, respectively, catalyzed by ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase. CD38, a differentiation antigen of B lymphocytes, has recently been shown to be a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both the formation and hydrolysis of cADPR. The overall reaction catalyzed by CD38 is the formation of ADP-ribose and nicotinamide from NAD+, identical to that catalyzed by NADase. The difficulties in detecting the formation of cADPR have led to frequent identification of CD38 as a classical NADase. In this study, we show that both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and CD38, but not NADase, can cyclize nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD+) producing a new nucleotide. Analyses by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy indicate the product is cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR) with a structure similar to cADPR except with guanine replacing adenine. Compared to cADPR, cGDPR is a more stable compound showing 2.8 times more resistance to heat-induced hydrolysis. These results are consistent with a catalytic scheme for CD38 where the cyclization of the substrate precedes the hydrolytic reaction. Spectroscopic analyses show that cGDPR is fluorescent and has an absorption spectrum different from both NGD+ and GDPR, providing a very convenient way for monitoring its enzymatic formation. The use of NGD+ as substrate for assaying the cyclization reaction was found to be applicable to pure enzymes as well as crude tissue extracts making it a useful diagnostic tool for distinguishing CD38-like enzymes from degradative NADases."
https://openalex.org/W2051258900,"Muscle enhancer factor-2A (MEF2A), a member of the MADS family, induced myogenic development when ectopically expressed in clones of nonmuscle cells of human clones, a function previously limited to the muscle basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. During myogenesis, MEF2A and bHLH proteins cooperatively activate skeletal muscle genes and physically interact through the MADS domain of MEF2A and the three myogenic amino acids of the muscle bHLH proteins. Thus, skeletal myogenesis is mediated by two distinct families of mutually inducible and interactive muscle transcription factors, either of which can initiate the developmental cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2005065014,"Alteration of the human mismatch repair gene hMSH2 has been linked to the microsatellite DNA instability found in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and several sporadic cancers. This microsatellite DNA instability is thought to arise from defective repair of DNA replication errors that create insertion-deletion loop-type (IDL) mismatched nucleotides. Here, it is shown that purified hMSH2 protein efficiently and specifically binds DNA containing IDL mismatches of up to 14 nucleotides. These results support a direct role for hMSH2 in mutation avoidance and microsatellite stability in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967724361,"Cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes are essential activators of cell cycle progression in all eukaryotes. In contrast to mammalian cells, in which multiple cdk's contribute to cell cycle regulation, the yeast cell cycle is largely controlled by the activity of a single cdk, CDC28. Analysis of the putative G1 cyclin PCL2 (ORFD) identified a second cyclin-cdk complex that contributes to cell cycle progression in yeast. PCL2 interacted with the cdk PHO85 in vivo and in vitro and formed a kinase complex that had G1-periodic activity. Under genetic conditions in which the Start transition was compromised, PHO85 and its associated cyclin subunits were essential for cell cycle commitment. Because PHO85 and another cyclin-like molecule, PHO80, also take part in inorganic phosphate metabolism, this cdk enzyme may integrate responses to nutritional conditions with the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1543629975,"Three major rat brain proteins were recently found to bind the SH3 domains of Grb2: synapsin I, dynamin, and a novel 145-kDa protein (p145) (McPherson, P. S., Czernik, A. J., Chilcote, T. J., Onofri, F., Benfenati, F., Greengard, P., Schlessinger, J., and De Camilli, P. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91, 6486-6490). We have now used antibodies raised against p145 which had been purified by Grb2 affinity chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to characterize this protein. p145 is neuron-specific and co-distributes with dynamin in subcellular fractions of rat brain. Both proteins are partially recovered in soluble and particulate fractions. By immunofluorescence, p145 is closely co-localized with dynamin, which we show here to be highly concentrated in nerve terminals. In contrast to synapsin I, which is highly enriched in a purified synaptic vesicle fraction, both p145 and dynamin are de-enriched in this fraction. However, both proteins are found on membranes which are immunoisolated with antibodies directed against the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin, suggesting that dynamin and p145 are localized in part on organelles which represent intermediate stages in the reformation of synapatic vesicles during recycling. Finally, we have determined that p145, like dynamin, is a phosphoprotein which undergoes dephosphorylation in response to nerve terminal depolarization. These findings suggest that p145 participates with dynamin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1548744261,"We have studied aspects of the regulatory interrelationship between the plasma membrane oxidoreductase (PMOR) system and the mitochondrial respiratory capacity of human Namalwa cells. Although the role of mitochondria in the maintenance of cellular redox and energetic states is well established, the PMOR system in comparison is a poorly characterized enzyme system whose functions, particularly in relation to cellular metabolism, have not been clearly elucidated. Therefore we compared the PMOR and mitochondrial respiratory activities of human Namalwa cells during the induction by ethidium bromide treatment of rho 0 cells, which lack a functional mitochondrial respiratory system. The plasma membrane NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity of the PMOR system was found to increase in a stepwise manner concomitant with a decline in cellular mitochondrial respiratory activity. Addition of p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid to the culture medium, at a concentration totally inhibiting the plasma membrane NADH-ferricyanide reductase in vitro, leads to cell death of rho 0 but not of rho + cells. Thus, the up-regulation of a functional PMOR system is a necessary phenomenon in maintaining the viability of mammalian rho 0 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085721192,"The events of the eukaryotic cell cycle are governed by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk's), whose activation requires association with cyclin regulatory subunits expressed at specific cell cycle stages. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cell cycle is thought to be controlled by a single cdk, CDC28. Passage through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is regulated by complexes of CDC28 and G1 cyclins (CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3). A putative G1 cyclin, HCS26, has recently been identified. In a/alpha diploid cells lacking CLN1 and CLN2, HCS26 is required for passage through G1. HCS26 does not associate with CDC28, but instead associates with PHO85, a closely related protein kinase. Thus, budding yeast, like higher eukaryotes, use multiple cdk's in the regulation of cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1599775179,"The Eph/Eck subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine kinases is currently the largest subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine kinases with a dozen members (Van der Geer, P., Hunter, T., and Lindberg, R. A. (1994) Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 10, 251-337). Using the cytoplasmic domain of Eck as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of mouse embryonic and T-cell cDNA libraries, it was discovered that the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase bound Eck. Further, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, it was found that the C-terminal src homology 2 domain of the p85 subunit specifically interacted with Eck. Additionally, Eck coimmunoprecipitated with p85 in ligand activated cells confirming their interaction in vivo. In keeping with the above observations, activation of Eck by its ligand, B61, increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. This is the first description of a signal transduction pathway initiated by any member of the Eph/Eck family."
https://openalex.org/W1525740412,"In an effort to provide a more powerful system to study the Ah receptor (AHR) signaling pathway, we expressed the AHR, its dimerization partner ARNT, and a beta-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene, driven by two dioxin-responsive enhancers, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this system, the agonists beta-naphthoflavone and alpha-naphthoflavone induced transcription of the lacZ gene, with EC50 values of 7.9 x 10(-8) and 3.0 x 10(-7) M, respectively, while the nonagonist dexamethasone was without effect. As a first application of this system, we examined the relationship between the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) and AHR function. To accomplish this in a manner that was independent of the ARNT protein, we constructed a chimeric receptor in which the DNA binding and primary dimerization domains of the AHR were swapped with analogous domains from the LexA protein. Coexpression of this AHR-LexA chimera and a lacZ reporter gene driven by eight LexA operator sites in a yeast strain with regulatable levels of hsp90, yielded pharmacology that closely mirrored that of the AHR/ARNT/dioxin-responsive enhancer system described above, but only when hsp90 levels were held near their wild type levels. When hsp90 levels were reduced to approximately 5% of normal, AHR signaling in response to agonist was completely blocked despite normal cell growth. These results provide the first genetic evidence for the role of hsp90 in AHR signaling and provide the basis for a powerful new system in which to study this pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2005302570,"The splicing of group II introns occurs in two steps involving substrates with different chemical configurations. The question of whether these two steps are catalyzed by a single or two separate active sites is a matter of debate. Here, certain bases and phosphate oxygen atoms at conserved positions in domain V of a group II self-splicing intron are shown to be required for catalysis of both splicing steps. These results show that the active sites catalyzing the two steps must, at least, share common components, ruling out the existence of two completely distinct active sites in group II introns."

https://openalex.org/W1513355023,"To further elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional initiation, we used synthetic oligonucleotides to prepare templates containing heteroduplex regions of varying size and location along the DNA of the adenovirus major late promoter. Unlike closed, linear DNA, or DNA with a downstream mismatch, DNA with a mismatch upstream of the initiation site only required the general factors TATA box-binding protein and transcription factor (TF) IIB to direct specific and accurate initiation in vitro by calf thymus RNA polymerase II. In the presence of TFIIF, initiation was possible on closed, linear DNA, but an upstream mismatch region still stimulated transcriptional initiation by more than 100-fold, leading to production of approximately 0.5 transcript/template in the absence of TFIIE, TFIIH, or ATP. The presence of a DNA mismatch was most effective in the -9 to -1 region; furthermore, stimulation by a mismatch did not require that the initiation site be included in the heteroduplex region. Efficient initiation at the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter in the presence of TATA box-binding protein and TFIIB was also achieved when a mismatch region was introduced from -9 to +3. Our results suggest that initiation by RNA polymerase II in the absence of transcriptional activation is limited by melting of the promoter DNA upstream of the initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W1606876786,"This study was to identify specific regions in kappa opioid receptors that accounted for binding selectivity of kappa ligands. Six chimeric mu/kappa receptors were constructed from cloned rat kappa and mu opioid receptors and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. All six chimeric mu/kappa receptors bound [3H] diprenorphine with high affinities, indicating that these chimeras retain opioid receptor conformation. Binding affinities of three peptide ligands (dynorphin A, alpha-neo-endorphin, and dynorphin B) and three nonpeptide ligands (norbinaltorphimine, U50,488H, and U69,593) for chimeras were determined and compared to those for mu and kappa opioid receptors. The second extracellular loop and the adjoining C-terminal portion of the fourth transmembrane helix were essential for the high affinity binding of dynorphin A, alpha-neo-endorphin, and dynorphin B to the kappa receptor. The third extracellular loop and the sixth and seventh transmembrane helices played an important role in determining the selectivity of nor-binaltorphimine for the kappa over the mu receptor. U50,488H and U69,593 appeared to require the whole kappa receptor except the second extracellular loop to attain high affinity binding. Thus, the kappa opioid receptor has differential binding domains for peptide and non-peptide ligands."

Electron and optical microscopy reveal the phase, labeled Ltv, to be composed of highly entangled tubular vesicles. In situ x-ray diffraction confirms that the tubule walls are multilamellar with the lipids in the chain-melted state. Macroscopic observations show that the Ltv phase coexists with the well-known L4 phase of spherical vesicles and a bulk L alpha phase. However, the defining characteristic of the Ltv phase is the Weissenberg rod climbing effect under shear, which results from its polymer-like entangled microstructure."
https://openalex.org/W1579781544,"The primary specificity of papain-like proteinases is largely determined by S2-P2 site interactions. According to the three-dimensional structure of a papain-inhibitor complex, the S2 subsite is defined by residues 67, 68, 133, 157, 160, and 205, with residues 133, 157, and 205 integrated into the wall and bottom of the side chain binding cavity. The S2 binding site specificity of this enzyme has been altered to mimic that of cathepsin B or L by the application of site-directed mutagenesis at these latter three positions in the cathepsin S sequence. The replacement of Gly-133 in cathepsin S by an alanine residue that is normally found at this position in both cathepsin B and L results in a pattern of specificity toward hydrophobic residues in P2 that is very similar to that of cathepsin B and L. The replacement of other cathepsin S S2 subsite residues with their cathepsin L equivalents (mutants Val-157-->Leu, Phe-205-->Ala) does not significantly change the specificity of cathepsin S. Cathepsin B is distinguished from both cathepsin L and S by its ability to efficiently hydrolyze substrates containing a basic P2 residue. A single mutation in position 205 of cathepsin S (Phe-205-->Glu) results in a change of specificity toward that of cathepsin B, i.e. the second-order rate constant for the hydrolysis of the cathepsin B-specific substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-4-methyl-7-coumaryl-amide is increased 77-fold for this mutant compared with the wild-type enzyme. A cathepsin S double mutant Gly-133-->Ala/Phe-205-->Glu is characterized by somewhat improved kinetic parameters compared with the Phe-205-->Glu single mutant. The hydrolysis rate of the benzyloxy-carbonyl-Arg-Arg-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide substrate by this double mutant is 130-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. As with cathepsin B, the activities of the Phe-205-->Glu single and the Gly-133-->Ala/Phen-205-->Glu double mutants of cathepsin S toward the dibasic substrate is modulated by an additional ionizable group with a pKa of 5.7."

The identity of the isolated degranulation inhibiting protein with angiogenin was demonstrated by amino acid sequence determination, immunoblotting, and identical inhibitory activity effects on leukocyte degranulation. At concentrations in the nanomolar range, the protein inhibited spontaneous degranulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) to 40%. The protein discharge of cells, which were preincubated with nanomolar concentrations of angiogenin and then stimulated with the chemotactic peptide formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-norleucyl-tyrosyl-leucine (FNLPNTL), was inhibited by 70%. Cellular functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the oxidative respiratory burst were not obviously affected by angiogenin. A polyclonal antibody to human recombinant angiogenin abolished the inhibitory effect of the isolated protein upon PMNL. The same but reduced effect was induced by the disulfide C39-C92 containing tryptic angiogenin fragment L-H-G-G-S-P-W-P-P-C92-Q-Y-R-G-L-T-S-P-C39-K, indicating a new, so far unknown biologically active site of angiogenin which is different from the sites responsible for angiogenic or ribonucleolytic activity. Two synthetic peptides containing residues 83-95, one with S92 instead of C92, revealed the same inhibitory effect on the protein degranulation of PMNL as the entire tryptic fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1559441662,"We have previously shown that NF-kappa B/Rel family members are physically associated phosphoproteins, and p105 and p50 are hyperphosphorylated after NF-kappa B activation. In this report, we further studied the phosphorylation involved in NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat T cells responding to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin. Immediately following stimulation, p50 is hyperphosphorylated, and a phosphorylated form of p50 (pp50) is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The kinetics of this nuclear translocation paralleled that of the appearance of an active kappa B DNA-binding complex. An at least 30-fold higher level of kappa B DNA binding was detected in pp50 than p50. The enhanced binding could be attributed to a much greater stability detected in the complex consisting of kappa B DNA and pp50, but not p50. These results suggest that phosphorylation of p50, and perhaps other family members as well, may be involved in the activation of NF-kappa B/Rel family transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1590947463,"A novel strategy combining peptide fingerprinting of single neurons by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, molecular cloning, peptide chemistry, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to study the intricate processing pattern of a preprohormone expressed in identified neurons, the neuroendocrine light yellow cells (LYCs) of the gastropod mollusc, Lymnaea stagnalis. The cDNA encoding the precursor, named prepro-LYCP (LYCPs, light yellow cell peptides), predicts a straightforward processing into three peptides, LYCP I, II, and III, at conventional dibasic processing sites flanking the peptide domains on the precursor. However, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of single LYCs revealed trimmed variant peptides derived from LYCP I and II. The variants were much more abundant than the intact peptides, indicating that LYCP I and II serve as intermediates in a peptide-processing sequence. Using the molecular masses of the peptides as markers to guide their isolation by well established purification methods, the structural identities of the peptides could be confirmed by amino acid sequencing. Furthermore, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry could detect colocalization of a novel peptide with the LYCPs."
https://openalex.org/W1579285271,"Xenopus oocytes were used to examine the coupling of the serotonin 1c (5HT1c) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors to both endogenous and heterologously expressed G protein alpha subunits. Expression of either G protein-coupled receptor resulted in agonist-induced, Ca(2+)-activated Cl- currents that were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. 5HT-induced Cl- currents were reduced 80% by incubating the injected oocytes with pertussis toxin (PTX) and inhibited 50-65% by injection of antisense oligonucleotides to the PTX-sensitive Go alpha subunit. TRH-induced Cl- currents were reduced only 20% by PTX treatment but were inhibited 60% by injection of antisense oligonucleotides to the PTX-insensitive Gq alpha subunit. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides to a novel Xenopus phospholipase C-beta inhibited the 5HT1c (and Go)-induced Cl- current with little effect on the TRH (and Gq)-induced current. These results suggest that receptor-activated Go and Gq interact with different effectors, most likely different isoforms of phospholipase C-beta. Co-expression of each receptor with seven different mammalian G protein alpha subunit cRNAs (Goa, Gob, Gq, G11, Gs, Golf, and Gt) was also examined. Co-expression of either receptor with the first four of these G alpha subunits resulted in a maximum 4-6-fold increase in Cl- currents; the increase depended on the amount of G alpha subunit cRNA injected. This increase was blocked by PTX for G alpha oa and G alpha ob co-expression but not for G alpha q or G alpha 11 co-expression. Co-expression of either receptor with Gs, Golf, or Gt had no effect on Ca(2+)-activated Cl- currents; furthermore, co-expression with Gs or Golf also failed to reveal 5HT- or TRH-induced changes in adenylyl cyclase as assessed by activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- channel. These results indicate that in oocytes, the 5HT1c and TRH receptors do the following: 1) preferentially couple to PTX-sensitive (Go) and PTX-insensitive (Gq) G proteins and that these G proteins act on different effectors, 2) couple within the same cell type to several different heterologously expressed G protein alpha subunits to activate the oocyte's endogenous Cl- current, and 3) fail to couple to G protein alpha subunits that activate cAMP or phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1513722824,"Primary cultures of rat preadipocytes were shown to express alpha 2- and beta-adrenoreceptors when maintained in serum-deprived medium. alpha 2-Adrenoreceptor stimulation led to an increase in cell number, whereas beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation was without effect. On 3T3-F442A clones stably transfected with the human alpha 2-C10 gene and expressing a physiologically related number of alpha 2-adrenoreceptors to overexpression, the proliferative effect of alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist UK14304 was proportional to the level of alpha 2-adrenoreceptor expressed in individual clones and required alpha-2 adrenoreceptor stimulation. Analysis of the signaling pathway linked to alpha 2-adrenoreceptor activation showed that the mitogenic effect was adenylyl cyclase- and protein kinase C-independent. It was pertussis toxin-sensitive, implying the involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was increased after alpha 2-adrenoreceptor stimulation in both 3T3-F442 clones and rat preadipocytes and inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment. So, catecholamines are involved in the control of white preadipocyte proliferation through the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor activation, linked to the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1753518855,"Ligand-initiated activation of neutrophils triggers O2- generation, degranulation, phospholipid remodeling, and release of fatty acids such as arachidonate, oleate, and palmitate. Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase converts free fatty acids to acyl-CoA esters; a role for acyl-CoA esters as positive modulators of neutrophil functions is proposed. Physiologically relevant concentrations (1-10 microM) of acyl-CoA esters such as palmitoyl-CoA, enhanced O2- generation triggered by fMet-Leu-Phe or guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) but did not act as a trigger per se. Triacsin C, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthetase, inhibited fMet-Leu-Phe-elicited O2- generation and degranulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Triacsin C inhibited O2- generation elicited by fMet-Leu-Phe and GTP gamma S in electroporated neutrophils, indicating that acyl-CoA acted downstream from the receptor. Palmitoyl-CoA reversed the Triacsin C-induced inhibition of O2- generation. fMet-Leu-Phe elicited a prompt increase in total long chain acyl-CoA esters. Arachidonoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA were elevated 5 s after addition of fMet-Leu-Phe, while palmitoyl-CoA was not elevated until 60 s. Triacsin C inhibited fMet-Leu-Phe-initiated increases in arachidonoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA. These results suggest a role for acyl-CoA esters in regulating activation of O2- generation and degranulation at the G protein or subsequent step(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2044135997,"Light absorption by rhodopsin generates metarhodopsin, which activates heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in photoreceptor cells of vertebrates and invertebrates. In contrast to vertebrate metarhodopsins, most invertebrate metarhodopsins are thermally stable and regenerate rhodopsin by absorption of a second photon. In experiments with Rh1 Drosophila rhodopsin, the thermal stability of metarhodopsin was found not to be an intrinsic property of the visual pigment but a consequence of its interaction with arrestin (49 kilodaltons). The stabilization of metarhodopsin resulted in a large decrease in the efficiency of G protein activation. Light absorption by thermally stable metarhodopsin initially regenerated an inactive rhodopsin-like intermediate, which was subsequently converted in the dark to active rhodopsin. The accumulation of inactive rhodopsin at higher light levels may represent a mechanism for gain regulation in the insect visual cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1497854219,"Green pea plants respond to light stress by expression of a nuclear ELIP (early light-inducible protein) gene. Here we report that the accumulation of ELIP transcript in pea plants during light stress is enhanced by low temperature treatment. The enhanced level of ELIP transcript during combined light and cold stress was found to be due to an increased stability of ELIP messenger RNA under these conditions. This transcript is translatable in vitro. In vivo, however, the amount of accumulated protein in the thylakoids declines with the decrease in the temperature because the translational activity is strongly reduced already at 10 degrees C. Plants exposed to light stress at temperatures that do not allow accumulation of ELIP transcript respond by induction of ELIP mRNA and protein during recovery at low light intensity and ambient temperature. The amount of protein that accumulates as a result of this is, however, much lower than that which accumulates as a result of direct light stress. The memory of a perceived light stress persists in plants stored at low temperature for at least 3 h, and the stress response can be released after an increase in temperature. Prolonged cold treatment, however, has a negative effect on the translatability of the ELIP transcript that accumulates during recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1559088872,"The high affinity receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is composed of at least two subunits, an 85-kDa low affinity GM-CSF-binding protein (alpha-GMR) and a 120-kDa beta-subunit (beta-GMR) necessary for high affinity binding and signal transduction. Previous studies have shown that deletion of the intracellular domain of alpha-GMR inactivates the receptor's ability to support proliferation, but has no effect on GM-CSF binding. Using anti-alpha-GMR- and anti-beta-GMR-specific antibodies, we show that alpha-GMR and beta-GMR coprecipitate only after GM-CSF binding, suggesting that binding of GM-CSF induces stabilization or assembly of an activated receptor complex involving recruitment of beta-GMR chains. To understand the contribution of each subunit of this receptor to the generation of an activated receptor complex, we attempted to construct minimal receptors with some or all of the functions of the wild-type heterodimer. We found that a hybrid human alpha/beta-GMR molecule in which the extracellular and transmembrane segments are composed of alpha-GMR sequences and the intracellular segment is composed of beta-GMR bound GM-CSF with low affinity, but activated tyrosine kinase activity, induced receptor internalization, and supported short- and long-term proliferation of transfected Ba/F3 cells. At least 1 ng/ml human GM-CSF was required for growth stimulation, and maximal proliferation occurred at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. This was 10-100-fold more than needed to stimulate growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing both full-length human alpha-GMR and beta-GMR and 1000-fold less than needed to stimulate growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing only human alpha-GMR. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of alpha-GMR is not required to initiate a unique signaling event for proliferation in Ba/F3 cells, but can be functionally replaced by the cytoplasmic domain of beta-GMR."
https://openalex.org/W1559313897,"The accurate transcription of human rRNA genes by RNA polymerase I requires two transcription factors, upstream binding factor (UBF) and promoter selectivity factor (SL1). Human SL1 (hSL1) is a multisubunit complex, one of whose components is TATA box-binding protein (TBP). hSL1 binds to the core region of the rRNA promoter, but does so inefficiently in the absence of human UBF (hUBF). hUBF interacts with the upstream control element of the rRNA promoter and facilitates binding of hSL1. The molecular basis by which hUBF increases binding of hSL1 remains to be elucidated. In this report, we use an immobilized protein binding assay to identify and purify a 95-kDa TBP-binding polypeptide. Microsequence analysis reveals that the 95-kDa TBP-binding protein is hUBF. We show that hUBF is stably associated with TBP and is present in large TBP-containing complexes. Our results indicate that the cooperative binding of hUBF and hSL1 on the rRNA promoter is mediated by direct interaction between hUBF and TBP. We also provide evidence that hUBF associates with TFIID, a TBP-containing RNA polymerase II transcription factor."

https://openalex.org/W1575121493,"In this paper we demonstrate that in the absence of free metal ions, active oxygen species, generated by activated macrophages or xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XOD), carry out oxidative degradation of collagen fibrils type I in conjunction with proteases. The collagen degradation is completely prevented by ascorbate (AH2) but not by catalase. The free metal ion-independent collagen degradation is a two-step process: (i) oxidation of collagen and (ii) subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the oxidatively modified collagen. AH2 completely prevents collagen oxidation and thereby protects the collagen from subsequent proteolytic degradation. This is in contrast to free metal ion-catalyzed spontaneous fragmentation of collagen, which is accelerated by AH2 and inhibited by catalase (Kato, Y., Uchida, K., and Kawakishi, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23646-23651). Studies using xanthine/XOD and model polypeptides, namely, poly-L-Pro, poly-L-hydroxyproline, poly-L-Lys, and poly(Pro-Gly-Pro) indicate that although O2-. is needed along with XOD, oxidation of model polypeptides appears to be a direct function of XOD iron, which is also stimulated by cytochrome P450."
https://openalex.org/W1756059480,"The variant surface glycoprotein of African trypanosomes has a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that is unusual in that its fatty acids are exclusively myristate. We showed previously that the is added to a free GPI in a fatty acid remodeling reaction involving deacylation and reacylation, forming glycolipid A, the anchor precursor. We now demonstrate that trypanosomes have a second pathway for GPI anchor myristoylation distinct from the fatty acid remodeling pathway, which we call myristate This reaction involves exchange of into both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycolipid A, which already contain myristate. Myristoyl-CoA, the probable donor in the exchange reaction, has an apparent Km of about 6 nM. We have now identified a lyso-GPI, named theta', which has as its sole fatty acid; the kinetics of formation and utilization of theta' are consistent with it being an intermediate in exchange. Myristate exchange and fatty acid remodeling appear to occur in different subcellular compartments, and the two reactions have different sensitivities to inhibitors. The exchange reaction may be a proofreading system to ensure that the fatty acids on variant surface glycoproteins are exclusively myristate."
https://openalex.org/W1511802341,"v-Ha-Ras, an oncogenic Ras mutant, causes malignant transformation of mammalian cells by recruiting c-Raf-1, a cytosolic Ser/Thr kinase, to the plasma membranes/cytoskeleton. The kinase activity of c-Raf-1 resides in the C-terminal half, which activates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, while it is the N-terminal half of c-Raf-1 (Raf257, residues 1-257) that binds the Ras-GTP complex and can compete Ras GTPase-activating proteins such as NF1 for binding to Ras. However, it still remains to be clarified whether overexpression of Raf257 or its minimal Ras-binding fragment alone is sufficient to suppress Ras-induced malignancy. In this paper we demonstrate for the first time that the 81-amino acid fragment (Raf81, residues 51-131), the minimal Ras-binding fragment of Raf, indeed can suppress v-Ha-Ras-induced malignant phenotype. A further deletion of the first 6 amino acids causes 65% reduction in the Ras binding of Raf81. The resultant 75 amino acid fragment (Raf75, residues 57-131) consists of a single alpha-helix, five anti-paralleled beta-sheets and five loops. We have found that a further deletion of either the first beta-sheet/loop or the last two beta-sheets/loops completely abolishes Ras binding. In addition we have found that the removal of the C-terminal 35 amino acids from a Ras-binding 91-amino acid fragment of NF1 (NF91, residues 1441-1531) does not abolish its ability to suppress the Ras-induced malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2132511722,"D1/D2 chimeras were constructed that had D1 dopamine receptor sequence at the amino-terminal end and D2 dopamine receptor sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end. The chimeras with the first four, five and six transmembrane domains of the D1 receptor (CH2, CH3, CH4, respectively) bound the D1 receptor antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 with high affinity. Reciprocal chimeras constructed with D2 receptor sequence at the amino-terminal end displayed no detectable specific binding of [3H]SCH 23390, [125I]epidepride, or [3H]spiperone. CH2, CH3, and CH4 had lower affinity than either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors for the nonselective antagonists and agonists and D2-selective antagonists tested. The chimeric receptors had affinities for three D1-selective ligands and the D2-selective agonist, quinpirole, that were intermediate between D1 and D2 receptor affinities for the drugs. The substantial loss or gain of affinity for three ligands upon replacement of D1 transmembrane VII with D2 sequence (CH4) suggests an important role for this region in the selectivity of these drugs. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by D1 agonists occurred in cells expressing CH3 and CH4, both of which included the D1 third cytoplasmic loop, but not in cells expressing CH1 or CH2, both with the D2 third cytoplasmic loop. However, only CH3 was able to mediate stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by quinpirole, implying that D2 receptor transmembrane domain VI was an important determinant of the selective efficacy of quinpirole. On the other hand, transmembrane domain VII was particularly important for the selective potency of quinpirole. Inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by dopamine was seen in cells expressing D2 receptors and CH1, but not CH2, CH3, or CH4. Thus, the third cytoplasmic loop of D1 dopamine receptors was crucial for the coupling of the receptors to Gs, but inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via Gi required structural features, such as the second cytoplasmic loop of the D2 receptor, in addition to the 3rd cytoplasmic loop."
https://openalex.org/W1514979375,"Treatment of cells with interferon (IFN)-gamma or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces up-regulation of the level of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54) mRNA by stabilization of an otherwise labile mRNA. Here, we have generated various deletion mutants of ICAM-1 and stably transfected them into the murine fibroblast Ltk- cells that express no endogenous ICAM-1 or -2 (CD102) in an effort to define the regions within ICAM-1 mRNA responsive to IFN-gamma or PMA. Induction of ICAM-1 mRNA in the transfected L cells by the treatment with IFN-gamma revealed that the truncation of the region of ICAM-1 mRNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain made it non-responsive to IFN-gamma whereas all other regions were dispensable. In contrast, PMA-induced accumulation of ICAM-1 mRNA required the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). To further elucidate the role of these regions in mRNA destabilization and responsiveness to IFN-gamma and PMA, ICAM-2 mRNA that is stable and not responsive to IFN-gamma or PMA was used as a reporter gene. The putative IFN-gamma-responsive region of ICAM-1 mRNA encoding its cytoplasmic domain rendered it unstable and responsive to IFN-gamma but not PMA. Conversely, the 3'-UTR of ICAM-1 fused with ICAM-2 mRNA also made it unstable and responsive to PMA but not IFN-gamma. Half-life analysis showed that the induction of these chimeric mRNAs by IFN-gamma and PMA was due, at least in part, to the prolongation of their turnover rate. These results taken together demonstrate that two distinct regions of ICAM-1 mRNA regulate its stability, one encoding the cytoplasmic domain and responsive to IFN-gamma and the other in the 3'-UTR and responsive to PMA."

https://openalex.org/W1597874988,"Abstract Torpedo acetylcholinesterase is a disulfide-linked homodimer containing three intramolecular disulfide bonds, as well as a single free thiol on Cys-231. We report that in a state, produced by 1.5 M guanidine hydrochloride, this enzyme undergoes rapid intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchange, in the absence of reducing agents, resulting in the production of novel species. Most strikingly, this results in appearance of enzyme monomers. Chemical modification of the free thiol group prevents these changes. Unfolded acetylcholinesterase, namely in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride, also undergoes intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchange, including production of enzyme monomers, but at a much lower rate. Our data show that the molten globule state, in contrast to the native and unfolded states, is both compact and flexible, thus being especially amenable to thiol-disulfide exchange."
