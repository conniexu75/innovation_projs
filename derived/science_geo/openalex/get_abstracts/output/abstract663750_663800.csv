https://openalex.org/W3110151578,"Electrophysiological signals exhibit both periodic and aperiodic properties. Periodic oscillations have been linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral and disease states. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the aperiodic component has putative physiological interpretations and that it dynamically changes with age, task demands and cognitive states. Electrophysiological neural activity is typically analyzed using canonically defined frequency bands, without consideration of the aperiodic (1/f-like) component. We show that standard analytic approaches can conflate periodic parameters (center frequency, power, bandwidth) with aperiodic ones (offset, exponent), compromising physiological interpretations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an algorithm to parameterize neural power spectra as a combination of an aperiodic component and putative periodic oscillatory peaks. This algorithm requires no a priori specification of frequency bands. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and demonstrate how it can be used in applications ranging from analyzing age-related changes in working memory to large-scale data exploration and analysis. A method for parameterizing electrophysiological neural power spectra into periodic and aperiodic components is introduced, addressing limitations of common approaches. The method is validated in simulation and demonstrated on real data applications."
https://openalex.org/W3108604517,"Metabolomics using nontargeted tandem mass spectrometry can detect thousands of molecules in a biological sample. However, structural molecule annotation is limited to structures present in libraries or databases, restricting analysis and interpretation of experimental data. Here we describe CANOPUS (class assignment and ontology prediction using mass spectrometry), a computational tool for systematic compound class annotation. CANOPUS uses a deep neural network to predict 2,497 compound classes from fragmentation spectra, including all biologically relevant classes. CANOPUS explicitly targets compounds for which neither spectral nor structural reference data are available and predicts classes lacking tandem mass spectrometry training data. In evaluation using reference data, CANOPUS reached very high prediction performance (average accuracy of 99.7% in cross-validation) and outperformed four baseline methods. We demonstrate the broad utility of CANOPUS by investigating the effect of microbial colonization in the mouse digestive system, through analysis of the chemodiversity of different Euphorbia plants and regarding the discovery of a marine natural product, revealing biological insights at the compound class level."
https://openalex.org/W3108602813,"Existing technologies for site-specific integration of kilobase-sized DNA sequences in bacteria are limited by low efficiency, a reliance on recombination, the need for multiple vectors, and challenges in multiplexing. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a substantially improved version of our previously reported Tn7-like transposon from Vibrio cholerae, which uses a Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system for programmable, RNA-guided transposition. The optimized insertion of transposable elements by guide RNA-assisted targeting (INTEGRATE) system achieves highly accurate and marker-free DNA integration of up to 10 kilobases at ~100% efficiency in bacteria. Using multi-spacer CRISPR arrays, we achieved simultaneous multiplexed insertions in three genomic loci and facile, multi-loci deletions by combining orthogonal integrases and recombinases. Finally, we demonstrated robust function in biomedically and industrially relevant bacteria and achieved target- and species-specific integration in a complex bacterial community. This work establishes INTEGRATE as a versatile tool for multiplexed, kilobase-scale genome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3108890290,"The constituent particles of matter can arrange themselves in various ways, giving rise to emergent phenomena that can be surprisingly rich and often cannot be understood by studying only the individual constituents. Discovering and understanding the emergence of such phenomena in quantum materials-especially those in which multiple degrees of freedom or energy scales are delicately balanced-is of fundamental interest to condensed-matter research1,2. Here we report on the surprising observation of emergent ferroelectricity in graphene-based moire heterostructures. Ferroelectric materials show electrically switchable electric dipoles, which are usually formed by spatial separation between the average centres of positive and negative charge within the unit cell. On this basis, it is difficult to imagine graphene-a material composed of only carbon atoms-exhibiting ferroelectricity3. However, in this work we realize switchable ferroelectricity in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene sandwiched between two hexagonal boron nitride layers. By introducing a moire superlattice potential (via aligning bilayer graphene with the top and/or bottom boron nitride crystals), we observe prominent and robust hysteretic behaviour of the graphene resistance with an externally applied out-of-plane displacement field. Our systematic transport measurements reveal a rich and striking response as a function of displacement field and electron filling, and beyond the framework of conventional ferroelectrics. We further directly probe the ferroelectric polarization through a non-local monolayer graphene sensor. Our results suggest an unconventional, odd-parity electronic ordering in the bilayer graphene/boron nitride moire system. This emergent moire ferroelectricity may enable ultrafast, programmable and atomically thin carbon-based memory devices."
https://openalex.org/W3110344697,"When people are forced to be isolated from each other, do they crave social interactions? To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural responses evoked by food and social cues after participants (n = 40) experienced 10 h of mandated fasting or total social isolation. After isolation, people felt lonely and craved social interaction. Midbrain regions showed selective activation to food cues after fasting and to social cues after isolation; these responses were correlated with self-reported craving. By contrast, striatal and cortical regions differentiated between craving food and craving social interaction. Across deprivation sessions, we found that deprivation narrows and focuses the brain's motivational responses to the deprived target. Our results support the intuitive idea that acute isolation causes social craving, similar to the way fasting causes hunger."
https://openalex.org/W3108977719,"Inappropriate stimulation or defective negative regulation of the type I interferon response can lead to autoinflammation. In genetically uncharacterized cases of the type I interferonopathy Aicardi-Gouti√®res syndrome, we identified biallelic mutations in LSM11 and RNU7-1, which encode components of the replication-dependent histone pre-mRNA-processing complex. Mutations were associated with the misprocessing of canonical histone transcripts and a disturbance of linker histone stoichiometry. Additionally, we observed an altered distribution of nuclear cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) and enhanced interferon signaling mediated by the cGAS-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in patient-derived fibroblasts. Finally, we established that chromatin without linker histone stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) production in vitro more efficiently. We conclude that nuclear histones, as key constituents of chromatin, are essential in suppressing the immunogenicity of self-DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3109972252,"Purpose The outcomes of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 remain poorly defined. We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system. Methods Outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review. Results 1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 164 (16.0%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients were followed to definitive disposition. 70/164 patients (42.7%) had died and 94/164 (57.3%) were still alive. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p &lt;0.0001) and had a higher initial d-dimer (2.22 vs. 1.31, p = 0.005) and peak ferritin levels (2998 vs. 2077, p = 0.016) compared to survivors. 84.3% of patients over 70 years old died in the hospital. Conversely, 67.4% of patients age 70 or younger survived to hospital discharge. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status. Conclusion Mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3108618259,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the fast global spread of the disease resulted in unprecedented decline in world trade and travel. A critical priority is, therefore, to quickly develop serological diagnostic capacity and identify individuals with past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In this study serum samples obtained from 309 persons infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 324 of healthy, uninfected individuals as well as serum from 7 COVID-19 patients with 4‚Äì7 samples each ranging between 1‚Äì92 days post first positive PCR were tested by an ‚Äúin house‚Äù ELISA which detects IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity of 47%, 80% and 88% and specificity of 100%, 98% and 98% in detection of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, respectively, were observed. IgG antibody levels against the RBD were demonstrated to be up regulated between 1‚Äì7 days after COVID-19 detection, earlier than both IgM and IgA antibodies. Study of the antibody kinetics of seven COVID 19 patients revealed that while IgG levels are high and maintained for at least 3 months, IgM and IgA levels decline after a 35‚Äì50 days following infection. Altogether, these results highlight the usefulness of the RBD based ELISA, which is both easy and cheap to prepare, to identify COVID-19 patients even at the acute phase. Most importantly our results demonstrate that measuring IgG levels alone is both sufficient and necessary to diagnose past exposure to SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3109720241,"Background Despite evidence of socio-demographic disparities in outcomes of COVID-19, little is known about characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients admitted to public hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective To assess demographics, comorbid conditions, and clinical factors associated with critical illness and mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a public hospital in New York City (NYC) during the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak. Design Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to NYC Health + Hospitals / Bellevue Hospital from March 9 th to April 8 th , 2020. Results A total of 337 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Primary analyses were conducted among those requiring supplemental oxygen (n = 270); half of these patients (135) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A majority were male (67.4%) and the median age was 58 years. Approximately one-third (32.6%) of hypoxic patients managed outside the ICU required non-rebreather or non-invasive ventilation. Requirement of renal replacement therapy occurred in 42.3% of ICU patients without baseline end-stage renal disease. Overall, 30-day mortality among hypoxic patients was 28.9% (53.3% in the ICU, 4.4% outside the ICU). In adjusted analyses, risk factors associated with mortality included dementia (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 2.11 95%CI 1.50‚Äì2.96), age 65 or older (aRR 1.97, 95%CI 1.31‚Äì2.95), obesity (aRR 1.37, 95%CI 1.07‚Äì1.74), and male sex (aRR 1.32, 95%CI 1.04‚Äì1.70). Conclusion COVID-19 demonstrated severe morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Modifications in care delivery outside the ICU allowed the hospital to effectively care for a surge of critically ill and severely hypoxic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3107529328,"We performed harmonized molecular and clinical analysis on 1,048 melanomas and discovered markedly different global genomic properties among subtypes (BRAF, (N)RAS, NF1, triple wild-type (TWT)), subtype-specific preferences for secondary driver genes and active mutational processes previously unreported in melanoma. Secondary driver genes significantly enriched in specific subtypes reflected preferential dysregulation of additional pathways, such as induction of transforming growth factor-Œ≤ signaling in BRAF melanomas and inactivation of the SWI/SNF complex in (N)RAS melanomas, and select co-mutation patterns coordinated selective response to immune checkpoint blockade. We also defined the mutational landscape of TWT melanomas and revealed enrichment of DNA-repair-defect signatures in this subtype, which were associated with transcriptional downregulation of key DNA-repair genes, and may revive previously discarded or currently unconsidered therapeutic modalities for genomically stratified melanoma patient subsets. Broadly, harmonized meta-analysis of melanoma whole exomes revealed distinct molecular drivers that may point to multiple opportunities for biological and therapeutic investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3110209352,"Sensory pathways are typically studied by starting at receptor neurons and following postsynaptic neurons into the brain. However, this leads to a bias in analyses of activity toward the earliest layers of processing. Here, we present new methods for volumetric neural imaging with precise across-brain registration to characterize auditory activity throughout the entire central brain of Drosophila and make comparisons across trials, individuals and sexes. We discover that auditory activity is present in most central brain regions and in neurons responsive to other modalities. Auditory responses are temporally diverse, but the majority of activity is tuned to courtship song features. Auditory responses are stereotyped across trials and animals in early mechanosensory regions, becoming more variable at higher layers of the putative pathway, and this variability is largely independent of ongoing movements. This study highlights the power of using an unbiased, brain-wide approach for mapping the functional organization of sensory activity. Pacheco et al. present new methods for the unbiased recording and cataloging of sensory activity throughout the Drosophila brain and across trials and individuals. They find auditory activity is temporally diverse but present in neurons throughout nearly all central brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W3109465811,"We recorded neural activity in male monkeys playing a variant of the game 'chicken' in which they made decisions to cooperate or not cooperate to obtain rewards of different sizes. Neurons in the middle superior temporal sulcus (mSTS)-previously implicated in social perception-signaled strategic information, including payoffs, intentions of the other player, reward outcomes and predictions about the other player. Moreover, a subpopulation of mSTS neurons selectively signaled cooperatively obtained rewards. Neurons in the anterior cingulate gyrus, previously implicated in vicarious reinforcement and empathy, carried less information about strategic variables, especially cooperative reward. Strategic signals were not reducible to perceptual information about the other player or motor contingencies. These findings suggest that the capacity to compute models of other agents has deep roots in the strategic social behavior of primates and that the anterior cingulate gyrus and the mSTS support these computations."
https://openalex.org/W3110058853,"Severe infections are a major stress on haematopoiesis, where the consequences for haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have only recently started to emerge. HSC function critically depends on the integrity of complex bone marrow (BM) niches; however, what role the BM microenvironment plays in mediating the effects of infection on HSCs remains an open question. Here, using a murine model of malaria and combining single-cell RNA sequencing, mathematical modelling, transplantation assays and intravital microscopy, we show that haematopoiesis is reprogrammed upon infection, whereby the HSC compartment turns over substantially faster than at steady-state and HSC function is drastically affected. Interferon is found to affect both haematopoietic and mesenchymal BM cells and we specifically identify a dramatic loss of osteoblasts and alterations in endothelial cell function. Osteo-active parathyroid hormone treatment abolishes infection-triggered HSC proliferation and-coupled with reactive oxygen species quenching-enables partial rescuing of HSC function."
https://openalex.org/W3108400392,"Genome-wide association studies identify genomic variants associated with human traits and diseases. Most trait-associated variants are located within cell-type-specific enhancers, but the molecular mechanisms governing phenotypic variation are less well understood. Here, we show that many enhancer variants associated with red blood cell (RBC) traits map to enhancers that are co-bound by lineage-specific master transcription factors (MTFs) and signaling transcription factors (STFs) responsive to extracellular signals. The majority of enhancer variants reside on STF and not MTF motifs, perturbing DNA binding by various STFs (BMP/TGF-Œ≤-directed SMADs or WNT-induced TCFs) and affecting target gene expression. Analyses of engineered human blood cells and expression quantitative trait loci verify that disrupted STF binding leads to altered gene expression. Our results propose that the majority of the RBC-trait-associated variants that reside on transcription-factor-binding sequences fall in STF target sequences, suggesting that the phenotypic variation of RBC traits could stem from altered responsiveness to extracellular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3107976781,"Purpose The use of Virtual Reality (VR) in health professions education has increased dramatically in recent years, yet there is limited evidence of its impact on educational outcomes. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of VR anatomy instruction on the ultrasound competency of novice learners participating in a ultrasonography workshop. Method We designed a VR-enhanced ultrasonography training program and utilized a plane transection tool to interact with a three-dimensional (3D) VR model of the human body which facilitated the 3D conceptualization of the spatial relationship of anatomical structures, leading to faster and better development of ultrasonographic competency. This was a randomized control study which enrolled third-year medical students (n = 101) without previous exposure to formal or informal ultrasonography training. The participants were randomly divided into an intervention and control group. We assessed participants‚Äô competency through ultrasound performance stations on live subjects, we also measured anatomical and ultrasound image identification ability using multiple choice tests. Result Participants in the intervention group (median = 16; interquartile 13 to 19) had significantly higher scores in ultrasonography task performance tests than the control group (median = 10; interquartile 7 to 14; Mann-Whitney U = 595; P &lt; 0.01). In sub-group analysis, the intervention group performed significantly better in the six out of ten ultrasound tasks. Participants in the intervention group also had greater improvement in ultrasonographic image identification MCQ tests than the control group (Mann-Whitney U = 914; P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion This study suggests that VR-enhanced anatomical training could be of significant benefit in ultrasonography training by promoting a better understanding of the spatial relationships of anatomical structures and the development of early psychomotor skills transferable to the handling of ultrasonographic probes."
https://openalex.org/W3108866966,"Non-invasive, repeated interrogation of the same wound is necessary to understand the tissue repair continuum. In this work, we sought to test the significance of non-invasive high-frequency high-resolution ultrasound technology for such interrogation. High-frequency high-resolution ultrasound imaging was employed to investigate wound healing under fetal and adult conditions. Quantitative tissue cellularity and elastic strain was obtained for visualization of unresolved inflammation using Vevo strain software. Hemodynamic properties of the blood flow in the artery supplying the wound-site were studied using color Doppler flow imaging. Non-invasive monitoring of fetal and adult wound healing provided unprecedented biomechanical and functional insight. Fetal wounds showed highly accelerated closure with transient perturbation of wound tissue cellularity. Fetal hemodynamics was unique in that sharp fall in arterial pulse pressure (APP) which was rapidly restored within 48h post-wounding. In adults, APP transiently increased post-wounding before returning to the pre-wounding levels by d10 post-wounding. The pattern of change in the elasticity of wound-edge tissue of diabetics was strikingly different. Severe strain acquired during the early inflammatory phase persisted with a slower recovery of elasticity compared to that of the non-diabetic group. Wound bed of adult diabetic mice (db/db) showed persistent hypercellularity compared to littermate controls (db/+) indicative of prolonged inflammation. Normal skin strain of db/+ and db/db were asynchronous. In db/db, severe strain acquired during the early inflammatory phase persisted with a slower recovery of elasticity compared to that of non-diabetics. This study showcases a versatile clinically relevant imaging platform suitable for real-time analyses of functional wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W3107271395,"Background Workplace violence in healthcare professionals has become a worldwide public health problem and has been the focus of numerous publications; however, currently, no macroscopic overviews of this research based on bibliometric analysis have been carried out. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to analyse the research trends focusing on workplace violence in healthcare personnel over the last 27 years. Materials and methods A bibliometric study was conducted from 1992 to 2019 in the field of workplace violence in healthcare personnel using the Scopus database. The author co-citation analysis was carried out using VOSviewer software. A worldwide map was created with Mapchart and word cloud image was created using Wordart. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. Findings 1791 records were analysed, 1376 of which (76.83%) were articles, with ‚Äú Medicine ‚Äù the most frequent subject category (58.91%). English was the predominant language (93.41%). From 2004 onwards, there was an exponential rise in the number of publications (R 2 coefficient = 0.89; p &lt; 0.0001) and the number of annual citations gradually increased from 1995 (R 2 coefficient = 0.73; p &lt; 0.0001). The University of Cincinnati (United States) was the institution (and country) with the highest number of publications (n = 30; n = 549), with D. M. Gates leading the ranking of the most productive authors (n = 21). Journal of Nursing Management was the most active journal publishing on the topic (n = 34) and the commonest keyword was ‚Äú human / s ‚Äù (16.43%). Conclusion From 1992 to 2019, worldwide research into the published literature on workplace violence in healthcare personnel has grown steadily year by year, both in the number of documents and the number of citations. United States and their institutions and researchers dominates this research output."

https://openalex.org/W3109797216,"Obesity has emerged as a major risk factor for insulin resistance leading to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The condition is characterized by high circulating levels of the adipose-derived hormone leptin and a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Pro-inflammatory signaling in the hypothalamus is associated with a decrease of central leptin- and insulin action leading to impaired systemic glucose tolerance. Intriguingly, leptin not only regulates body weight and glucose homeostasis but also acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Here we demonstrate that increasing leptin levels (62,5¬†¬µg/kg/d, PEGylated leptin) in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exacerbated body weight gain and aggravated hypothalamic micro- as well as astrogliosis. In contrast, administration of a predetermined dose of a long-acting leptin antagonist (100 ¬µg/kg/d, PESLAN) chosen to block excessive leptin signaling during diet-induced obesity (DIO) showed the opposite effect and significantly improved glucose tolerance as well as decreased the total number of microglia and astrocytes in the hypothalamus of mice fed HFD. These results suggest that high levels of leptin, such as in obesity, worsen HFD-induced micro-and astrogliosis, whereas the partial reduction of hyperleptinemia in DIO mice may have beneficial metabolic effects and improves hypothalamic gliosis."
https://openalex.org/W3107007614,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) metastasizes to the locoregional lymph nodes at high rates and is related to poor clinical outcomes. However, the mechanism by which cancer cells migrate to the lymph nodes is unclear. To address this, we established a conditioned medium culture system for HNSCC cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and investigated their crosstalk. Stimulation with tumor-conditioned medium (TCM) activated LECs, resulting in a robust increase in cell proliferation to induce lymphatic hyperplasia. Further, stimulation of HNSCC cells with activated LEC Conditioned media (TCM-LEC CM) induced cell invasion. Among various chemokines, CXCL5 promoted the invasion of TCM-LEC CM-treated HNSCC cells. The level of CXCL5 protein was higher in cancer tissues than those in normal tissues from HNSCC patients. Furthermore, treatment with SB225002, a CXCR2 (CXCL5 receptor) inhibitor, resulted in decreased lymph node metastasis in vivo. In conclusion, inhibition of CXCL5-CXCR2 signaling between cancer cells and LECs suppresses cancer cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. This novel therapeutic strategy might be a practical approach to the clinical management of HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3110589841,"In the vertebrate retina, the location of a neuron's receptive field in visual space closely corresponds to the physical location of synaptic input onto its dendrites, a relationship called the retinotopic map. We report the discovery of a systematic spatial offset between the ON and OFF receptive subfields in F-mini-ON retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Surprisingly, this property does not come from spatially offset ON and OFF layer dendrites, but instead arises from a network of electrical synapses via gap junctions to RGCs of a different type, the F-mini-OFF. We show that the asymmetric morphology and connectivity of these RGCs can explain their receptive field offset, and we use a multicell model to explore the effects of receptive field offset on the precision of edge-location representation in a population. This RGC network forms a new electrical channel combining the ON and OFF feedforward pathways within the output layer of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W3110244309,"Activin A promotes human trophoblast invasion during the first trimester of pregnancy and is associated with preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PE/PIH) in naturally conceived pregnancies. However, whether integrin Œ≤1 mediates activin A-increased trophoblast invasion remains unknown and the evidence is limited regarding the predictive value of activin A for PE/PIH in women receiving in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Here, we studied the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of integrin Œ≤1 in activin A-promoted invasion in immortalized (HTR8/SVneo) and primary human extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. A nest case-control study was designed to investigate the predictive/diagnostic value of activin A in IVF pregnancies. Results showed that integrin Œ≤1 expression increased after activin A treatment and knockdown of integrin Œ≤1 significantly decreased both basal and activin A-increased HTR8/SVneo cell invasion. SB431542 (TGF-Œ≤ type I receptors inhibitor) abolished activin A-induced SMAD2/SMAD3 phosphorylation and integrin Œ≤1 overexpression. Activin A-upregulated integrin Œ≤1 expression was attenuated after the depletion of ALK4 or SMAD4 in both HTR8/SVneo and primary EVT cells. Furthermore, we found similar first-trimester activin A levels in IVF patients with or without subsequent PE/PIH. These results reveal that integrin Œ≤1 mediates activin A-promoted trophoblast invasion through ALK4-activated SMAD2/3-SMAD4 pathway, and the predictive/diagnostic value of first-trimester maternal serum activin A for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy might be different in IVF population."
https://openalex.org/W3108415905,"Background Despite a growing body of evidence suggesting that short sleep duration may be linked to adverse metabolic outcomes, how these associations differ between age groups remains unclear. We use eight years of data from the UK National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS) (2008‚Äì2016) to analyse cross-sectional relationships between sleep duration and metabolic risk in participants aged 11‚Äì70 years. Methods Participants (n = 2008) who provided both metabolic risk and sleep duration data were included. Self-reported sleep duration was standardised by age, to account for differences in age-related sleep requirements. A standardised metabolic risk score was constructed, comprising: waist circumference, blood pressure, serum triglycerides, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose. Regression models were constructed across four age groups from adolescents to older adults. Results Overall, decreased sleep duration (hrs) was associated with an increased metabolic risk (standard deviations) with significant quadratic (B:0.028 [95%CI: 0.007, 0.050]) and linear (B:-0.061 [95%CI: -0.111, -0.011]) sleep duration coefficients. When separated by age group, stronger associations were seen among mid-aged adults (36-50y) (quadratic coefficient: 0.038 [95%CI: 0.002, 0.074]) compared to other age groups (e.g. adolescents (11-18y), quadratic coefficient: -0.009 [95%CI: -0.042, 0.025]). An increased difference between weekend and weekday sleep was only associated with increased metabolic risk in adults aged 51‚Äì70 years (B:0.18 [95%CI: 0.005, 0.348]). Conclusions Our results indicate that sleep duration is linked to adverse metabolic risk and suggest heterogeneity between age groups. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are required to explore long-term effects of abnormal sleep and potential remedial benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3109006526,"With the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the question of society‚Äôs capability to deal with an acute health crisis is, once again, brought to the forefront. In the core is the need to broaden the perspective on the determinants of a country‚Äôs ability to cope with the spread of the virus. This paper is about bringing together diverse aspects of readiness and initial reaction to a COVID-19 outbreak. We proposed an integrated evaluation framework which encapsulates six dimensions of readiness and initial reaction. Using a specific multi-level outranking method, we analysed how these dimensions affect the relative positioning of European countries in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The results revealed that the order of countries based on our six-dimensional assessment framework is significantly reminiscent of the actual positioning of countries in terms of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the initial phase of the pandemic. Our findings confirm that only when a country‚Äôs readiness is complemented by an appropriate societal reaction we can expect a less severe outcome. Moreover, our study revealed different patterns of performance between former communist Eastern European and Western European countries."

https://openalex.org/W3108507330,"Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been the focus of developmental and regenerative studies, yet our understanding of the signalling events regulating their specification remains incomplete. We demonstrate that supt16h, a component of the Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, is required for HSPC formation. Zebrafish supt16h mutants express reduced levels of Notch-signalling components, genes essential for HSPC development, due to abrogated transcription. Whereas global chromatin accessibility in supt16h mutants is not substantially altered, we observe a specific increase in p53 accessibility, causing an accumulation of p53. We further demonstrate that p53 influences expression of the Polycomb-group protein PHC1, which functions as a transcriptional repressor of Notch genes. Suppression of phc1 or its upstream regulator, p53, rescues the loss of both Notch and HSPC phenotypes in supt16h mutants. Our results highlight a relationship between supt16h, p53 and phc1 to specify HSPCs via modulation of Notch signalling."
https://openalex.org/W3109074883,"Background The perinatal mortality rate in Ethiopia is among the highest in Sub Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to identify the spatial patterns and determinants of perinatal mortality in the country using a national representative 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. Methods The analysis was completed utilizing data from 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. This data captured the information of 5 years preceding the survey period. A total of 7230 women who at delivered at seven or more months gestational age nested within 622 enumeration areas (EAs) were used. Statistical analysis was performed by using STATA version 14.1, by considering the hierarchical nature of the data. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to identify community and individual-level factors associated with perinatal mortality. ArcGIS version 10.1 was used for spatial analysis. Moran‚Äôs, I statistics fitted to identify global autocorrelation and local autocorrelation was identified using SatSCan version 9.6. Results The spatial distribution of perinatal mortality in Ethiopia revealed a clustering pattern. The global Moran‚Äôs I value was 0.047 with p-value &lt;0.001. Perinatal mortality was positively associated with the maternal age, being from rural residence, history of terminating a pregnancy, and place of delivery, while negatively associated with partners‚Äô educational level, higher wealth index, longer birth interval, female being head of household and the number of antenatal care (ANC) follow up. Conclusions In Ethiopia, the perinatal mortality is high and had spatial variations across the country. Strengthening partner‚Äôs education, family planning for longer birth interval, ANC, and delivery services are essential to reduce perinatal mortality and achieve sustainable development goals in Ethiopia. Disparities in perinatal mortality rates should be addressed alongside efforts to address inequities in maternal and neonatal healthcare services all over the country."
https://openalex.org/W3106650970,"For gene duplication to be maintained, particularly in the small genomes of RNA viruses, this should offer some advantages. We have investigated the functions of a small protein termed VPg or 3B, which acts as a primer in the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Many related picornaviruses encode a single copy but uniquely the FMDV genome includes three (nonidentical) copies of the 3B coding region. Using sub-genomic replicons incorporating nonfunctional 3Bs and 3B fusion products in competition and complementation assays, we investigated the contributions of individual 3Bs to replication and the structural requirements for functionality. We showed that a free N-terminus is required for 3B to function as a primer and although a single 3B can support genome replication, additional copies provide a competitive advantage. However, a fourth copy confers no further advantage. Furthermore, we find that a minimum of two 3Bs is necessary for trans replication of FMDV replicons, which is unlike other picornaviruses where a single 3B can be used for both cis and trans replication. Our data are consistent with a model in which 3B copy number expansion within the FMDV genome has allowed evolution of separate cis and trans acting functions, providing selective pressure to maintain multiple copies of 3B."

Therefore, we aimed to identify the key genes associated with leaf coloration and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the color changes in P . setaceum ‚ÄòRubrum‚Äô leaves. We performed transcriptome sequencing of P . setaceum ‚ÄòRubrum‚Äô leaves before and after shading. A total of 19,043 differentially expressed genes were identified, and the numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes at T1 stage, when compared with their expression at the T0 stage, were 10,761 and 8,642, respectively. The possible pathways that determine P . setaceum ‚ÄòRubrum‚Äô leaf color included flavonoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, and carotenoid biosynthesis. There were 31 differentially expressed genes related to chlorophyll metabolism, of which 21 were related to chlorophyll biosynthesis and 10 to chlorophyll degradation, as well as three transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of chlorophyll degradation. There were 31 key enzyme genes involved in anthocyanin synthesis and accumulation in P . setaceum ‚ÄòRubrum‚Äô leaves, with four transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of anthocyanin metabolism. The transcriptome data were verified and confirmed reliable by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis. These findings provide a genetic basis for improving leaf color in P . setaceum ‚ÄòRubrum.‚Äô"

Eighty lambs with an average body weight of 20.6 kg, with 04 months of age, were distributed in a completely randomized design, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The factors were represented by two cottonseed processing method (whole or ground) and two levels of chitosan (0 and 136 mg/kg BW). The association of cottonseed processing method with chitosan in the lamb diet did not affect (P&gt;0.05) carcasses traits. The pH, color, cooking losses, shear force, and proximate composition of meat were also not affected (P&gt;0.05) by the processing method of cottonseed or its association with chitosan in the lamb diets. There was an increase in palmitoleic ( c 9-C16:1; P = 0.01) and conjugated linoleic (P = 0.02) fatty acids when ground cottonseed was associated with chitosan. Ground cottonseed associated with chitosan increases the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids in the meat of feedlot lambs."
https://openalex.org/W3109446956,"Collaboration among logistics facilities in a multicenter logistics delivery network can significantly improve the utilization of logistics resources through resource sharing including logistics facilities, vehicles, and customer services. This study proposes and tests different resource sharing schemes to solve the optimization problem of a collaborative multicenter logistics delivery network based on resource sharing (CMCLDN-RS). The CMCLDN-RS problem aims to establish a collaborative mechanism of allocating logistics resources in a manner that improves the operational efficiency of a logistics network. A bi-objective optimization model is proposed with consideration of various resource sharing schemes in multiple service periods to minimize the total cost and number of vehicles. An adaptive grid particle swarm optimization (AGPSO) algorithm based on customer clustering is devised to solve the CMCLDN-RS problem and find Pareto optimal solutions. An effective elite iteration and selective endowment mechanism is designed for the algorithm to combine global and local search to improve search capabilities. The solution of CMCLDN-RS guarantees that cost savings are fairly allocated to the collaborative participants through a suitable profit allocation model. Compared with the computation performance of the existing nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, AGPSO is more computationally efficient. An empirical case study in Chengdu, China suggests that the proposed collaborative mechanism with resource sharing can effectively reduce total operational costs and number of vehicles, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency of the logistics network."
https://openalex.org/W3109816289,"Eyes and hand movements are known to be coordinated during a variety of tasks. While steering a vehicle, gaze was observed to be tightly linked with steering wheel angle changes over time, with the eyes leading the hands. In this experiment, participants were asked to drive a winding road composed of bends with systematically manipulated radii of curvature, under regular and automatic steering conditions. With automatic steering, the vehicle followed the road, but the steering wheel and participants hands did not move. Despite the absence of physical eye-hand coordination in that condition, the eye and [what the hands should have done] to produce the action on the steering wheel were found to be coordinated, as under regular steering. This result brings a convincing piece of evidence that eye movements do more than just guiding the hands. In addition, eye-hand coordination was also found to be intermittent, context and person-dependant."
https://openalex.org/W3109817910,"The single-cell green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii possesses two Œ±-tubulin genes ( tua1 and tua2 ) and two Œ≤-tubulin genes ( tub1 and tub2 ), with the two genes in each pair encoding identical amino acid sequences. Here, we screened an insertional library to establish eight disruptants with defective tua2 , tub1 , or tub2 expression. Most of the disruptants did not exhibit major defects in cell growth, flagellar length, or flagellar regeneration after amputation. Because few tubulin mutants of C . reinhardtii have been reported to date, we then used our disruptants, together with a tua1 disruptant obtained from the Chlamydomonas Library Project (CLiP), to isolate tubulin-mutants resistant to the anti-tubulin agents propyzamide (pronamide) or oryzalin. As a result of several trials, we obtained 8 strains bearing 7 different Œ±-tubulin mutations and 12 strains bearing 7 different Œ≤-tubulin mutations. One of the mutations is at a residue similar to that of a mutation site known to confer drug resistance in human cancer cells. Some strains had the same amino acid substitutions as those reported previously in C . reinhardtii ; however, the mutants with single tubulin genes showed slightly stronger drug-resistance than the previous mutants that express the mutated tubulin in addition to the wild-type tubulin. Such increased drug-resistance may have facilitated sensitive detection of tubulin mutation. Single-tubulin-gene disruptants are thus an efficient background of generating tubulin mutants for the study of the structure‚Äìfunction relationship of tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W3107283639,"High-altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH) is a severe and progressive disease caused by chronic hypoxia and subsequent pulmonary vascular remodeling. No cure is currently available owing to an incomplete understanding about vascular remodeling. It is believed that hypoxia-induced diseases can be prevented by treating hypoxia. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether daily short-duration reoxygenation at sea level attenuates pulmonary hypertension under high-altitude hypoxia. To this end, a simulated 5000-m hypoxia rat model and hypoxic cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were used to evaluate the effect of short-duration reoxygenation. Results show that intermittent, not continuous, short-duration reoxygenation effectively attenuates hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. The mechanisms underlining the protective effects involved that intermittent, short-duration reoxygenation prevented functional and structural remodeling of pulmonary arteries and proliferation, migration, and phenotypic conversion of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells under hypoxia. The specific genes or potential molecular pathways responsible for mediating the protective effects were also characterised by RNA sequencing. Further, the frequency and the total time of intermittent reoxygenation affected its preventive effect of HAPH, which was likely attributable to augmented oxidative stress. Hence, daily intermittent, not continuous, short-duration reoxygenation partially prevented pulmonary hypertension induced by 5000-m hypoxia in rats. This study is novel in revealing a new potential method in preventing HAPH. It gives insights into the selection and optimisation of oxygen supply schemes in high-altitude areas."
https://openalex.org/W3108270799,"Bacterial efflux pumps are an important pathogenicity trait because they extrude a variety of xenobiotics. Our laboratory previously identified in silico Burkholderia collagen-like protein 8 (Bucl8) in the hazardous pathogens Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei . We hypothesize that Bucl8, which contains two predicted tandem outer membrane efflux pump domains, is a component of a putative efflux pump. Unique to Bucl8, as compared to other outer membrane proteins, is the presence of an extended extracellular region containing a collagen-like (CL) domain and a non-collagenous C-terminus (Ct). Molecular modeling and circular dichroism spectroscopy with a recombinant protein, corresponding to this extracellular CL-Ct portion of Bucl8, demonstrated that it adopts a collagen triple helix, whereas functional assays screening for Bucl8 ligands identified binding to fibrinogen. Bioinformatic analysis of the bucl8 gene locus revealed it resembles a classical efflux-pump operon. The bucl8 gene is co-localized with downstream fusCDE genes encoding fusaric acid (FA) resistance, and with an upstream gene, designated as fusR , encoding a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. Using reverse transcriptase (RT)-qPCR, we defined the boundaries and transcriptional organization of the fusR-bucl8-fusCDE operon. We found exogenous FA induced bucl8 transcription over 80-fold in B . pseudomallei , while deletion of the entire bucl8 locus decreased the minimum inhibitory concentration of FA 4-fold in its isogenic mutant. We furthermore showed that the putative Bucl8-associated pump expressed in the heterologous Escherichia coli host confers FA resistance. On the contrary, the Bucl8-associated pump did not confer resistance to a panel of clinically-relevant antimicrobials in Burkholderia and E . coli . We finally demonstrated that deletion of the bucl8 -locus drastically affects the growth of the mutant in L-broth. We determined that Bucl8 is a component of a novel tetrapartite efflux pump, which confers FA resistance, fibrinogen binding, and optimal growth."

CD8 T cell responses likely play an important role in the control of HRV infection but, surprisingly, HRV-specific CD8 T cell epitopes remain yet to be identified. Here, we approached the discovery and characterization of conserved HRV-specific CD8 T cell epitopes from species A (HRV A) and C (HRV C), the most frequent subtypes in the clinics of various pulmonary diseases. We found IFNŒ≥-ELISPOT positive responses to 23 conserved HRV-specific peptides on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 14 HLA I typed subjects. Peptide-specific IFNŒ≥ production by CD8 T cells and binding to the relevant HLA I were confirmed for six HRV A-specific and three HRV C-specific CD8 T cell epitopes. In addition, we validated A*02:01-restricted epitopes by DimerX staining and found out that these peptides mediated cytotoxicity. All these A*02:01-restricted epitopes were 9-mers but, interestingly, we also identified and validated an unusually long 16-mer epitope peptide restricted by A*02:01, HRVC1791-1806 (GLEPLDLNTSAGFPYV). HRV-specific CD8 T cell epitopes describe here are expected to elicit CD8 T cell responses in up to 87% of the population and could be key for developing an HRV vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W3106739344,"Solanum lycopersicoides is a wild nightshade relative of tomato with known resistance to a wide range of pests and pathogens, as well as tolerance to cold, drought and salt stress. To effectively utilize S . lycopersicoides as a genetic resource in breeding for tomato improvement, the underlying basis of observable traits in the species needs to be understood. Molecular markers are important tools that can unlock the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic variation in wild crop relatives. Unfortunately, DNA markers that are specific to S . lycopersicoides are limited in number, distribution and polymorphism rate. In this study, we developed a suite of S . lycopersicoides -specific SSR and indel markers by sequencing, building and analyzing a draft assembly of the wild nightshade genome. Mapping of a total of 1.45 Gb of S . lycopersicoides contigs against the tomato reference genome assembled a moderate number of contiguous reads into longer scaffolds. Interrogation of the obtained draft yielded SSR information for more than 55,000 loci in S . lycopersicoides for which more than 35,000 primers pairs were designed. Additionally, indel markers were developed based on sequence alignments between S . lycopersicoides and tomato. Synthesis and experimental validation of 345 primer sets resulted in the amplification of single and multilocus targets in S . lycopersicoides and polymorphic loci between S . lycopersicoides and tomato. Cross-species amplification of the 345 markers in tomato, eggplant, silverleaf nightshade and pepper resulted in varying degrees of transferability that ranged from 55 to 83%. The markers reported in this study significantly expands the genetic marker resource for S . lycopersicoides , as well as for related Solanum spp . for applications in genetics and breeding studies."

https://openalex.org/W3107925278,"Background In efforts to control malaria infection, the Democratic Republic of Congo has implemented several strategies. Studies assessing their efficiency mainly involved at-risk groups, especially children under five years of age. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and identify the risk factors associated with Plasmodium spp. infection. Methods From October 2014 to March 2015, individuals aged at least 15 years were selected randomly and enrolled in a cross-sectional study conducted throughout the country. Microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were used for the detection of Plasmodium ssp. Results From 2286 individuals recruited, 1870 with valid laboratory results were included in the study for further analysis. The prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection assessed by microscopy (355/ 1870 (19%) was lower than that estimated by PCR (580/1870 (31%). In addition, the difference between the two results was statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.0001). The most prevalent Plasmodium species was P . falciparum , either as mono-infection (96.3%; 95% C.I. 93.9‚Äì98.1) or combined with P . malariae (3.7%; 95% C.I. 2.8‚Äì5.9). The mean parasite density was 3272739 trophozoites/ŒºL of blood. Women had higher risks of being infected than men (OR 2.03, 95% C.I.: 1.96. 2.62, P = 0.041)]. Conclusion In this study, the molecular detection and species identification of Plasmodium spp. showed that, despite all efforts for malaria control, malaria remains a public health problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The high prevalence and parasite density of Plasmodium spp. in adults make this age group a potential parasitic infectious reservoir for the at-risk groups and supports the need to include this age group in further programs for malaria control."
https://openalex.org/W3107437203,"Changing rules to promote scoring through more ‚Äòhigh-risk‚Äô play has become common in team sports. Australia‚Äôs national netball league (i.e. Suncorp Super Netball) has recently taken this approach‚Äìintroducing a two-point shooting rule. Teams will be awarded two-points for shots made from an ‚Äòouter circle‚Äô 3.0m-4.9m from the goal in the final five minutes of quarters. We sought to answer a series of questions regarding the implementation and potential strategies surrounding the two-point rule in Suncorp Super Netball. We used video coded data from the 2018 Suncorp Super Netball season to identify the total number of made and missed shots from different distances across the season. We also used shooting statistics from recent Fast5 Netball World Series (a competition with a two-point shooting rule already in place) as a comparator. The reward of two-points is relatively well-aligned to the relative risk of missing shots from the proposed outer versus inner circle (2.22 [1.98, 2.48 95% CIs]) based on existing shooting data from Suncorp Super Netball teams. We found that the relative risk of missing shots from ‚Äòlong-‚Äô (i.e. 3.5m-4.0m) versus ‚Äòmid-range‚Äô (i.e. 3.0‚Äì3.5m) was only slightly elevated (1.52 [1.21, 1.86 95% CIs])‚Äìsuggesting teams should favour long- over mid-range shots when the two-point shot is available. Based on the typical number of shots a team receives in a five-minute period, we found that teams may be able to score ~3.51 extra points per quarter when taking all versus no-shots from the two-point outer circle. Analysis of the Fast5 versus Suncorp Super Netball data did, however, reveal that shooting accuracy from long-range may decrease when a two-point shot is available. Teams may need to consider situational factors (e.g. altered opposition defensive strategies) when developing their shooting strategy for taking advantage of the two-point shot."
https://openalex.org/W3110587938,"The animal-human relationship is essential for farm animal welfare and production. Generally, gentle tactile and vocal interactions improve the animal-human relationship in cattle. However, cows that are fearful of humans avoid their close presence and touch; thus, the animal-human relationship first has to be improved to a point where the animals accept stroking before their perception of the interactions and consequently the animal-human relationship can become positive. We tested whether the animal-human relationship of cows fearful of humans is improved more effectively by gentle interactions during restraint, allowing physical contact from the beginning, or if the gentle interactions are offered while the animals are free to move, giving them more control over the situation and thus probably a higher level of agency and a more positive perception of the interactions. Thirty-six dairy cows (median avoidance distance 1.6 m) were assigned to three treatments (each n = 12): gentle vocal and tactile interactions during restraint in the feeding rack (LOCK); gentle vocal and, if possible, tactile interactions while free in the barn (FREE); routine management without additional interactions (CON). Treatments were applied for 3 min per cow on 10 d per fortnight for 6 weeks (i.e., three periods). Avoidance and approach behaviour towards humans was tested before the start of the treatment period, and then at 2-week intervals. The recorded variables were reduced to one score by Principal Component Analysis. The resulting relationship score (higher values implying a better relationship with humans) increased in all groups; the increase was stronger in FREE than in CON, with the increase in LOCK being not significantly different from the other treatment groups. Thus, we recommend that gentle interactions with cows should take place while they are unrestrained, if possible."

During hunting periods, cervids such as elk ( Cervus canadensis ) typically select for areas further from roads and closer to tree cover, while altering the timing of their daily activities to avoid hunters. Our objective was to determine the habitat characteristics most influential in predicting harvest risk of elk. We captured 373 female elk between January 2015 and March 2017 in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest and surrounding area of central Utah, USA. We determined habitat selection during the hunting season using a resource selection function (RSF) for 255 adult cow elk. Additionally, we used a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate risk of harvest based on habitat use within home ranges (3 rd order selection) as well as the location of the home range on the landscape to evaluate vulnerability on a broader scale. Female elk selected for areas that reduced hunter access (rugged terrain, within tree cover, on private land). Age, elevation and distance to roads within a home range were most influential in predicting harvest risk (top model accounted for 36.2% of AIC weight). Elevation and distance to trees were most influential in predicting risk when evaluating the location of the home range (top model accounted for 42.1% of AIC weight). Vulnerability to harvest was associated with proximity to roads. Additionally, survival in our landscape decreased with age of femaleelk."

Stomach ulcerations are one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Impaired stomach function in peptic ulcer disease suggests changes in autonomic nerve reflexes controlled by the inferior vagal ganglion, resulting in stomach dysfunction. In this paper, changes in the galaninergic response of inferior vagal neurons to gastric ulceration in a pig model of the disease were analyzed based on the authors‚Äô previous studies. The study was performed on 24 animals (12 control and 12 experimental). Gastric ulcers were induced by submucosal injections of 40% acetic acid solution into stomach submucosa and bilateral inferior vagal ganglia were collected one week afterwards. The number of galanin-immunoreactive perikarya in each ganglion was counted to determine fold-changes between both groups of animals and Q-PCR was applied to verify the changes in relative expression level of mRNA encoding both galanin and its receptor subtypes: GalR1, GalR2, GalR3. The results revealed a 2.72-fold increase in the number of galanin-immunoreactive perikarya compared with the controls. Q-PCR revealed that all studied genes were expressed in examined ganglia in both groups of animals. Statistical analysis revealed a 4.63-fold increase in galanin and a 1.45-fold increase in GalR3 mRNA as compared with the controls. No differences were observed between the groups for GalR1 or GalR2. The current study confirmed changes in the galaninergic inferior vagal ganglion response to stomach ulcerations and demonstrated, for the first time, the expression of mRNA encoding all galanin receptor subtypes in the porcine inferior vagal ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W3109127736,"Sensorineural hearing loss is one of the most common disabilities worldwide. Such prevalence necessitates effective tools for studying the molecular workings of cochlear cells. One prominent and effective vector for expressing genes of interest in research models is adeno-associated virus (AAV). However, AAV efficacy in transducing cochlear cells can vary for a number of reasons including serotype, species, and methodology, and oftentimes requires high multiplicity of infection which can damage the sensory cells. Reports in other systems suggest multiple approaches can be used to enhance AAV transduction including self-complementary vector design and pharmacological inhibition of degradation. Here we produced AAV to drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in explanted neonatal mouse cochleae. Treatment with eeyarestatin I, tyrphostin 23, or lipofectamine 2000 did not result in increased transduction, however, self-complementary vector design resulted in significantly more GFP positive cells when compared to single-stranded controls. Similarly, self-complementary AAV2 vectors demonstrated enhanced transduction efficiency compared to single stranded AAV2 when injected via the posterior semicircular canal, in vivo . Self-complementary vectors for AAV1, 8, and 9 serotypes also demonstrated robust GFP transduction in cochlear cells in vivo , though these were not directly compared to single stranded vectors. These findings suggest that second-strand synthesis may be a rate limiting step in AAV transduction of cochlear tissues and that self-complementary AAV can be used to effectively target large numbers of cochlear cells in vitro and in vivo ."

In the current study, we examined whether the temporal experience of W affects subsequent experience related to the action. Specifically, we tested whether W influenced the perception of difficulty in a decision-making task, hypothesizing that temporal awareness of W might influence the sense of difficulty. Consistent with our predictions, when W was perceived as early or late, participants subsequently rated the decision difficulty to be easy or difficult, respectively (Exp.1). Further investigation showed that perceived difficulty, however, did not influence W (Exp.2). Together, our findings suggest a unidirectional relationship such that W plays a role in the metacognition of difficulty evaluation.
