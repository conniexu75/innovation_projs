https://openalex.org/W2942875482,"The behavior of solar cells and modules under various operational conditions can be determined effectively when their intrinsic parameters are accurately estimated and used to simulate the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. This work proposed a new computational approach based on approximation and correction technique (ACT) for simple and efficient extraction of solar cells and modules parameters from the single-diode model. In this technique, an approximated value of series resistance (Rs) was first derived and used to determine the initial value of parallel resistance (Rp). Later, the final corrected values of Rs and Rp were obtained by resubstituting their approximated values in a five-loop iteration using the manipulated equations. For rapid evaluation and validation of the proposed technique, a software application was also created using MATLAB program. The correctness and robustness of the proposed technique was validated on five types of solar cells and modules operated at varied temperatures and irradiances. The lowest RMSE value was achieved for RTC France (7.78937E-4) and PVM 752 GaAs (2.10497E-4) solar cell. The legitimacy of ACT extracted parameters was established using a simple yet competitive implementation approach wherein the performance of the developed technique was compared with several state-of-the-art methods recently reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2942708475,"Introduction Historical and current stigmatizing and discriminatory experiences drive sexual and gender minority (SGM) people away from health care and clinical research. Being medically underserved, they face numerous disparities that make them vulnerable to poor health outcomes. Effective methods to engage and recruit SGM people into clinical research studies are needed. Objectives To promote health equity and understand SGM health needs, we sought to design an online, national, longitudinal cohort study entitled The PRIDE (Population Research in Identity and Disparities for Equality) Study that enabled SGM people to safely participate, provide demographic and health data, and generate SGM health-related research ideas. Methods We developed an iPhone mobile application (“app”) to engage and recruit SGM people to The PRIDE Study–Phase 1. Participants completed demographic and health surveys and joined in asynchronous discussions about SGM health-related topics important to them for future study. Results The PRIDE Study–Phase 1 consented 18,099 participants. Of them, 16,394 provided data. More than 98% identified as a sexual minority, and more than 15% identified as a gender minority. The sample was diverse in terms of sexual orientation, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, geographic location, education, and individual income. Participants completed 24,022 surveys, provided 3,544 health topics important to them, and cast 60,522 votes indicating their opinion of a particular health topic. Conclusions We developed an iPhone app that recruited SGM adults and collected demographic and health data for a new national online cohort study. Digital engagement features empowered participants to become committed stakeholders in the research development process. We believe this is the first time that a mobile app has been used to specifically engage and recruit large numbers of an underrepresented population for clinical research. Similar approaches may be successful, convenient, and cost-effective at engaging and recruiting other vulnerable populations into clinical research studies."
https://openalex.org/W2943066531,"Background and aims Malnutrition and inflammation are closely linked to vascular calcification (VC), the severity of which correlate with adverse outcome. However, there were few studies on the interplay between malnutrition, inflammation and VC progression, rather than VC presence per se. We aimed to determine the relationship of malnutrition, inflammation, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) progression with survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods Malnutrition and inflammation were defined as low serum albumin (< 40 g/L) and high hs-CRP (≥ 28.57 nmol/L), respectively. We defined AAC progression as an increase in AAC score using lateral lumbar radiography at both baseline and one year later. Patients were followed up to investigate the impact of AAC progression on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Results AAC progressed in 54.6% of 97 patients (mean age 58.2±11.7 years, 41.2% men) at 1-year follow-up. Hypoalbuminemia (Odds ratio 3.296; 95% confidence interval 1.178–9.222), hs-CRP (1.561; 1.038–2.348), low LDL-cholesterol (0.976; 0.955–0.996), and the presence of baseline AAC (10.136; 3.173–32.386) were significant risk factors for AAC progression. During the mean follow-up period of 5.9 years, 38(39.2%) patients died and 27(71.0%) of them died of cardiovascular disease. Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for old age, diabetes, cardiovascular history, and hypoalbuminemia determined that AAC progression was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (2.294; 1.054–4.994). Conclusions Malnutrition and inflammation were significantly associated with AAC progression. AAC progression is more informative than AAC presence at a given time-point as a predictor of all-cause mortality in patients on maintenance HD."
https://openalex.org/W2942956625,"Using data from the UN World Population Prospects, we document global trends in lifespan inequality from 1950 until 2015. Our findings indicate that (i) there has been a sustained decline in overall lifespan inequality, (ii) adult lifespan variability has also declined, but some plateaus and trend reversals have been identified, (iii) lifespan inequality among the elderly has increased virtually everywhere, and (iv) most of the world variability in age-at-death can be attributed to within-country variability. Such changes have occurred against a backdrop of generalized longevity increases. Our analyses suggest that the world is facing a new challenge: the emergence of diverging trends in longevity and age-at-death inequality among the elderly around the globe—particularly in high-income areas. As larger fractions of the world population survive to more advanced ages, it will be necessary for national and international health planners to recognize the growing heterogeneity that characterizes older populations."
https://openalex.org/W2917816601,"Pore-forming proteins (PFPs) represent a functionally important protein family, that are found in organisms from viruses to humans. As a major branch of PFPs, bacteria pore-forming toxins (PFTs) permeabilize membranes and usually cause the death of target cells. E. coli hemolysin ClyA is the first member with the pore complex structure solved among α-PFTs, employing α-helices as transmembrane elements. ClyA is proposed to form pores composed of various numbers of protomers. With high-resolution cryo-EM structures, we observe that ClyA pore complexes can exist as newly confirmed oligomers of a tridecamer and a tetradecamer, at estimated resolutions of 3.2 Å and 4.3 Å, respectively. The 2.8 Å cryo-EM structure of a dodecamer dramatically improves the existing structural model. Structural analysis indicates that protomers from distinct oligomers resemble each other and neighboring protomers adopt a conserved interaction mode. We also show a stabilized intermediate state of ClyA during the transition process from soluble monomers to pore complexes. Unexpectedly, even without the formation of mature pore complexes, ClyA can permeabilize membranes and allow leakage of particles less than ~400 Daltons. In addition, we are the first to show that ClyA forms pore complexes in the presence of cholesterol within artificial liposomes. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the dynamic process of pore assembly for the prototypical α-PFT ClyA."
https://openalex.org/W2942983660,"Somatization processes are usually associated with a lack of insight or with emotional unawareness, especially in adolescents where the ability for self-reflection is beginning to mature. However, the extent to which different levels of insight explain variations in somatization remains understudied. This study aimed to evaluate whether high-level emotional awareness (comprehension) but not low-level awareness (only attention) is needed to psychologically cope with suffering, thus leading to lower somatization. Specific predictions were: 1) High attention along with High comprehension will be associated with significantly lower frequency of somatic complaints than other combinations (Low attention and Low comprehension, or High attention but Low comprehension); 2) In absence of comprehension, no attention will be more optimal than attention only, because only-attention might work as an amplificatory of suffering without the possibility of processing it. Self-reports of meta-cognitive processes, somatization, and control variables were obtained from 264 adolescents from a non-clinical population (54.5% female; aged 12–18, M = 14.7, SD = 1.7). In line with expectations, results revealed significant differences in the effects of insight positions on somatization: Attention+Comprehension (M = 4.9, SE = 0.9) < Nothing (M = 7.1, SE = 0.3) < Only attention (M = 8.9, SE = 0.7). Compared to Nothing, Attention+comprehension was associated with significantly reduced somatic complaints (B = -2.2, p = 0.03, 95% CI -4,1 to 0.2). However, Only attention was associated with increased somatic complaints compared to the other two conditions (B = 1.8, p = 0.03, 95% CI 0.2 to 3.4; B = 4, CI 95% 1.6–6.3, p = 0.001, respectively). This highlights the role of higher-order awareness (i.e., comprehension or clarity) in the processing of suffering and stresses its value in the adaptive coping of emotional distress."
https://openalex.org/W2942922891,"Mothers are recommended to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of their lives. Also, after the sixth month, breastfeeding should continue with added complementary foods to the diets of children. Studies designed to sought the views of mothers on breastfeeding practices are limited. The aim of this study was to explore challenges to breastfeeding practices by considering spatial, societal and maternal characteristics in Ghana. Twenty mothers aged 15-49 years were interviewed purposively in selected communities within two regions of the country. Thematic content analytical procedures were applied to interpret and present findings. Challenges (to both exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding) spanned across spatial (home and work places), societal, and maternal characteristics. Key themes identified were in relation to household chores, work schedules, family influence, low breast milk production, swollen breasts or sore nipples, access to food items and preparation or giving foods. Addressing these challenges would require co-creation of supportive environments between couples and significant others as well as tackling institutional barriers that obstruct adequate breastfeeding among mothers. On complementary feeding, there is the need to form community health volunteers help educate mothers more on how to appropriately use local foods to feed their children."
https://openalex.org/W2949520834,"Many parameters treated as constants in traditional physiologically based pharmacokinetic models must be formulated as time-varying quantities when modeling pregnancy and gestation due to the dramatic physiological and anatomical changes that occur during this period. While several collections of empirical models for such parameters have been published, each has shortcomings. We sought to create a repository of empirical models for tissue volumes, blood flow rates, and other quantities that undergo substantial changes in a human mother and her fetus during the time between conception and birth, and to address deficiencies with similar, previously published repositories. We used maximum likelihood estimation to calibrate various models for the time-varying quantities of interest, and then used the Akaike information criterion to select an optimal model for each quantity. For quantities of interest for which time-course data were not available, we constructed composite models using percentages and/or models describing related quantities. In this way, we developed a comprehensive collection of formulae describing parameters essential for constructing a PBPK model of a human mother and her fetus throughout the approximately 40 weeks of pregnancy and gestation. We included models describing blood flow rates through various fetal blood routes that have no counterparts in adults. Our repository of mathematical models for anatomical and physiological quantities of interest provides a basis for PBPK models of human pregnancy and gestation, and as such, it can ultimately be used to support decision-making with respect to optimal pharmacological dosing and risk assessment for pregnant women and their developing fetuses.

https://openalex.org/W2806383795,"After years of hypothetical surveys and simulator studies, automated vehicles (AVs) are now being tested in realistic traffic environments adding validity to knowledge about their acceptance. We present data from a pilot test with participants (n = 125) after experiencing a ride in an electric AV on a large clinic area in Berlin, Germany. As a first contribution, we bridge the gap between missing definitions of key constructs, confusion about their operationalisations, and a rigorous test of their statistical properties and data structure by examining scales on acceptance, trust, perceived safety, intention to use, and—for the first time applied to AVs—the emotions amusement, fear, surprise, and boredom. Tests of reliability and normality were satisfying for almost all constructs (Cronbach’s alphas ≥ .69; six of eight scales normally distributed). The vehicles were accepted (M = 1.22; SD = 0.70; range -2 to 2), trusted (M = 3.29; SD = 0.81; range 1 to 5), and perceived as safe (M = 3.29; SD = 1.03; range 1 to 5). However, factor analyses did not reflect the hypothesised data structure, and validity concerns question the suitability of some constructs for attitude assessment of electric AVs. Our open item for comments added valuable insights in qualitative aspects of user attitudes towards electric AVs regarding driving style, technical features, and (unsettling) audio-visual feedback. We thus argue for broader conceptualisations of key constructs based on interdisciplinary exchange and multi-methodical study designs."
https://openalex.org/W2943764673,"Water polo is a contact sport that is gaining popularity in the United States and carries a risk of repeated head impacts and concussion. The frequency and magnitude of sport-related head impacts have not been described for water polo. We aimed to compare patterns of empirically measured head impact exposure of male collegiate water polo players to patterns previously reported by a survey of current and former water polo athletes. Participants wore water polo caps instrumented with head impact sensors during three seasons of collegiate water polo. Peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak rotational acceleration (PRA) were recorded for head impacts. Athlete positions were recorded by research staff at the occurrence of each head impact. Head impacts were sustained by athletes in offensive positions more frequently than in defensive and transition positions (246, 59.9% vs. 93, 22.6% vs. 72, 17.5%). 37% of all head impacts during gameplay were sustained by athletes playing the offensive center position. Impact magnitude (means ± SD: PLA = 36.1±12.3g, PRA = 5.0±2.9 krads/sec2) did not differ between position or game scenario. Among goalies, impact frequency and magnitude were similar between games (means ± SD: 0.54±.51 hits/game, PLA = 36.9±14.2g, PRA = 4.3±4.2 krads/sec2) and practices (means ± SD: 0.96±1.11 hits/practice, PLA = 43.7±14.5g, PRA = 3.9±2.5 krads/sec2). We report that collegiate water polo athletes are at risk for sport-related head impacts and impact frequency is dependent on game scenario and player position. In contrast, magnitude does not differ between scenarios or across positions."
https://openalex.org/W2942886053,"Purpose Blood vessels of the retina provide an easily-accessible, representative window into the condition of microvasculature. We investigated how retinal vessel structure captured in fundus photographs changes with age, and how this may reflect features related to patient health, including blood pressure. Results We used two approaches. In the first approach, we segmented the retinal vasculature from fundus photographs and then we correlated 25 parameterized aspects (""traits"")—comprising 15 measures of tortuosity, 7 fractal ranges of self-similarity, and 3 measures of junction numbers—with participant age and blood pressure. In the second approach, we examined entire fundus photographs with a set of algorithmic CHARM features. We studied 2,280 Sardinians, ages 20–28, and an U.S. based population from the AREDS study in 1,178 participants, ages 59–84. Three traits (relating to tortuosity, vessel bifurcation number, and vessel endpoint number) showed significant changes with age in both cohorts, and one additional trait (relating to fractal number) showed a correlation in the Sardinian cohort only. When using second approach, we found significant correlations of particular CHARM features with age and blood pressure, which were stronger than those detected when using parameterized traits, reflecting a greater signal from the entire photographs than was captured in the segmented microvasculature. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that automated quantitative image analysis of fundus images can reveal general measures of patient health status."
https://openalex.org/W2942739590,"Increasing complexity and multidisciplinarity make collaboration essential for modern science. This, however, raises the question of how to assign accountability for scientific misconduct among larger teams of authors. Biomedical societies and science associations have put forward various sets of guidelines. Some state that all authors are jointly accountable for the integrity of the work. Others stipulate that authors are only accountable for their own contribution. Alternatively, there are guarantor type models that assign accountability to a single author. We contribute to this debate by analyzing the outcomes of 80 scientific misconduct investigations of biomedical scholars conducted by the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI). We show that the position of authors on the byline of 184 publications involved in misconduct cases correlates with responsibility for the misconduct. Based on a series of binary regression models, we show that first authors are 38% more likely to be responsible for scientific misconduct than authors listed in the middle of the byline (p<0.01). Corresponding authors are 14% more likely (p<0.05). These findings suggest that a guarantor-like model where first authors are ex-ante accountable for misconduct is highly likely to not miss catching the author responsible, while not afflicting too many bystanders."
https://openalex.org/W2943248186,"To diagnose ≥90% HIV-infected residents (diagnostic coverage), the Bukoba Combination Prevention Evaluation (BCPE) implemented provider-initiated (PITC), home- (HBHTC), and venue-based (VBHTC) HIV testing and counseling (HTC) intervention in Bukoba Municipal Council, a mixed urban and rural lake zone community of 150,000 residents in Tanzania. This paper describes the methods, outcomes, and incremental costs of these HTC interventions. PITC was implemented in outpatient department clinics in all eight public and three faith-based health facilities. In clinics, lay counselors routinely screened and referred eligible patients for HIV testing conducted by HTC-dedicated healthcare workers. In all 14 wards, community teams offered HTC to eligible persons encountered at 31,293 home visits and at 79 male- and youth-frequented venues. HTC was recommended for persons who were not in HIV care or had not tested in the prior 90 days. BCPE conducted 133,695 HIV tests during the 2.5 year intervention (PITC: 88,813, 66%; HBHTC: 27,407, 21%; VBHTC: 17,475, 13%). Compared with other strategies, PITC conducted proportionally more tests among females (65%), and VBHTC conducted proportionally more tests among males (69%) and young-adults aged 15–24 years (42%). Of 5,550 (4.2% of all tests) HIV-positive tests, 4,143 (75%) clients were newly HIV diagnosed, including 1,583 males and 881 young adults aged 15–24 years. Of HIV tests conducted 3.7%, 1.8%, and 2.1% of PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC clients, respectively, were newly HIV diagnosed; PITC accounted for 79% of all new diagnoses. Cost per test (per new diagnosis) was $4.55 ($123.66), $6.45 ($354.44), and $7.98 ($372.67) for PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC, respectively. In a task-shifting analysis in which lay counselors replaced healthcare workers, estimated costs per test (per new diagnosis) would have been $3.06 ($83.15), $ 4.81 ($264.04), and $5.45 ($254.52), for PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC, respectively. BCPE models reached different target groups, including men and young adults, two groups with consistently low coverage. Implementation of multiple models is likely necessary to achieve ≥90% diagnostic coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2942606924,"Vineyards and grape musts harbor complex locally specific microbial communities, among which yeast species can be responsible of spontaneous alcoholic fermentation. Although relying on indigenous yeast can be a risk for winemaking, local yeast diversity is associated with complexity and stronger identity of the wine produced, compared to inoculated alcoholic fermentation with commercial yeast strains. In this context, the main yeast species present on grapes, leaves and soils of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in the hot semi-arid climate of the Texas High Plains area were investigated, as well as the presence and dynamics of yeast species during spontaneous fermentations of Tempranillo grapes from the same vineyards. Molecular characterization of yeast species was performed using culture-dependent 5.8S-ITS restriction fragment length polymorphism method and sequencing. Yeast species recovered from grapes, leaves, and soils were mainly dominated by Aureobasidium pullulans, Cryptococcus species, Filobasidium species and Naganishia species, typical members of the vineyard environment. One isolate of potential enological interest, Lachancea thermotolerans, a fermenting yeast with potential in must acidification, was recovered from the vineyard environment. However, spontaneous alcoholic fermentations revealed the presence of fermenting yeast species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lachancea thermotolerans and Hanseniaspora species. The presence of the three aforementioned species is of extreme interest for winemaking in the Texas High Plains area. Indeed, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the model for alcoholic fermentation, Hanseniaspora species have been shown to improve palatability of wines, and Lachancea thermotolerans has become of increasing interest due to its potential to acidify musts and palatability. One of the main characteristics of grapes grown in the Texas High Plains area being the lack of acidity, focusing on these three yeast species could promote the development of locally oriented started cultures for the production of wines with a stronger local identity."
https://openalex.org/W2943472118,"Background Guangxi is one of the provinces having the highest notification rate of tuberculosis in China. However, spatial and temporal patterns and the association between environmental diversity and tuberculosis notification are still unclear. Objective To detect the spatiotemporal pattern of tuberculosis notification rates from 2010 to 2016 and its potential association with ecological environmental factors in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, China. Methods We performed a spatiotemporal analysis with prediction using time series analysis, Moran’s I global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and space-time scan statistics to detect temporal and spatial clusters of tuberculosis notifications in Guangxi between 2010 and 2016. Spatial panel models were employed to identify potential associating factors. Results The number of reported cases peaked in spring and summer and decreased in autumn and winter. The predicted number of reported cases was 49,946 in 2017. Moran's I global statistics were greater than 0 (0.363–0.536) during the study period. The most significant hot spots were mainly located in the central area. The eastern area exhibited a low-low relation. By the space-time scanning, the clusters identified were similar to those of the local autocorrelation statistics, and were clustered toward the early part of 2016. Duration of sunshine, per capita gross domestic product, the treatment success rate of tuberculosis and participation rate of the new cooperative medical care insurance scheme in rural areas had a significant negative association with tuberculosis notification rates. Conclusion The notification rate of tuberculosis in Guangxi remains high, with the highest notification cluster located in the central region. The notification rate is associated with economic level, treatment success rate and participation in the new cooperative medical care insurance scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2943468543,"Introduction HIV self-testing (HIVST) offers a useful addition to HIV testing services and enables individuals to test privately. Despite recommendations to the contrary, repeat HIV testing is frequent among people already on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and there are concerns that oral self-testing might lead to false negative results. A study was conducted in Khayelitsha, South Africa, to assess feasibility and uptake of HIVST and linkage-to-care following HIVST. Methods Participants were recruited at two health facilities from 1 March 2016 to 31 March 2017. People under 18 years, or with self-reported previously-diagnosed HIV infection, were excluded. Participants received an OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody kit, and reported their HIVST results by pre-paid text message (SMS) or by returning to the facility. Those not reporting within 7 days were contacted by phone. Electronic and paper-based clinical and laboratory records were retrospectively examined for all participants to identify known HIV outcomes, after matching for name, date of birth, and sex. These findings were compared with self-reported HIVST results where available. Results Of 639 participants, 401 (62.8%) self-reported a negative HIVST result, 27 (4.2%) a positive result, and 211 (33.0%) did not report. The record search identified that of the 401 participants self-reporting a negative HIVST result, 19 (4.7%) were already known to be HIV positive; of the 27 self-reporting positive, 12 (44%) were known HIV positive. Overall, records showed 57/639 (8.9%) were HIV positive of whom 39/57 (68.4%) had previously-diagnosed infection and 18/57 (31.6%) newly-diagnosed infection. Of the 428 participants who self-reported a result, 366 (85.5%) reported by SMS. Conclusions HIVST can improve HIV testing uptake and linkage to care. SMS is acceptable for reporting HIVST results but negative self-reports by participants may be unreliable. Use of HIVST by individuals on ART is frequent despite recommendations to the contrary and its implications need further consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2951809217,"A better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in retinal hydro-mineral homeostasis imbalance during diabetic macular edema (DME) is needed to gain insights into retinal (patho-)physiology that will help elaborate innovative therapies with lower health care costs. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily vanilloid member 4 (TRPV4) plays an intricate role in homeostatic processes that needs to be deciphered in normal and diabetic retina. Based on previous findings showing that TRPV4 antagonists resolve blood-retina barrier (BRB) breakdown in diabetic rats, we evaluated whether TRPV4 channel inhibition prevents and reverts retinal edema in streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic mice. We assessed retinal edema using common metrics, including retinal morphology/thickness (histology) and BRB integrity (albumin-associated tracer), and also by quantifying water mobility through apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measures. ADC was measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), acquired ex vivo at 4 weeks after STZ injection in diabetes and control groups. DWI images were also used to assess retinal thickness. TRPV4 was genetically ablated or pharmacologically inhibited as follows: left eyes were used as vehicle control and right eyes were intravitreally injected with TRPV4-selective antagonist GSK2193874, 24 h before the end of the 4 weeks of diabetes. Histological data show that retinal thickness was similar in nondiabetic and diabetic wt groups but increased in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. In contrast, DWI shows retinal thinning in diabetic wt mice that was absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Disorganized outer nuclear layer was observed in diabetic wt but not in diabetic Trpv4-/- retinas. We further demonstrate increased water diffusion, increased distances between photoreceptor nuclei, reduced nuclear area in all nuclear layers, and BRB hyperpermeability, in diabetic wt mice, effects that were absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Retinas of diabetic mice treated with PBS showed increased water diffusion that was not normalized by GSK2193874. ADC maps in nondiabetic Trpv4-/- mouse retinas showed restricted diffusion. Our data provide evidence that water diffusion is increased in diabetic mouse retinas and that TRPV4 function contributes to retinal hydro-mineral homeostasis and structure under control conditions, and to the development of BRB breakdown and increased water diffusion in the retina under diabetes conditions. A single intravitreous injection of TRPV4 antagonist is however not sufficient to revert these alterations in diabetic mouse retinas."
https://openalex.org/W2942712440,"Background Both 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are routinely used in the evaluation of memory clinic patients. Hybrid PET/MR systems now allow simultaneous PET and MRI imaging within the duration of the PET emission scan. Purpose To compare the diagnostic yield of PET/MRI using an abbreviated MR protocol with that of separate PET and CT in a mixed memory clinic population, and the propagated influences on clinical diagnosis and patient management. Material and methods Consecutive memory clinic patients (n = 78) undergoing both CT and hybrid FDG PET/MRI scans were identified retrospectively. MRI and CT were separately evaluated for vascular and structural pathology. PET scans were classified according to the presence of neurodegenerative or vascular disease using CT or MRI, respectively, for anatomical guiding. A memory clinic expert assessed the clinical impact of the additional findings and/or change of PET classification achieved by MRI anatomical guiding as compared to CT guiding. Results MRI lead to significantly higher Fazekas scores, higher medial temporal and global cortical atrophy scores, and identified more patients with infarcts (28 vs 8, p<0.001) compared to CT. MRI changed PET classification in 13 (17%) patients. Addition of MRI to CT had minor clinical impact in 4/78 (5%) and major clinical impact in 13/78 (17%) of patients. Conclusion The study demonstrates the capabilities of PET/MRI systems for routine clinical imaging of memory clinic patients, and that even an abbreviated hybrid PET/MRI protocol provides significant additional information influencing clinical diagnosis and patient management in a substantial fraction of patients when compared to separate PET and CT."
https://openalex.org/W2943464207,"In the present study we use an unprecedented database of 5,535 distributional records to infer the diversity, ecological preferences and spatial distribution of the 60 species of terrestrial reptiles of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and use the 57 native species to test the effectiveness of the protected areas’ network in conserving this unique vertebrate fauna. We infer a time-calibrated phylogeny with 146 species of squamates and 15 genes including all UAE terrestrial reptile species to determine the phylogenetic diversity (PD) and evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) of the native species and to compare it with the distribution of the hotspots of native species richness. The results of this study indicate that the sampling effort is remarkable, covering 75% of the country’s territory representing nearly the entire climatic space of the UAE defined by the mean annual temperature and the total annual precipitation, as well as the multivariate climatic space defined by a principal component analysis (PCA). Species richness is highest in the northeast of the country, in a transitional area from sandy desert to the mountainous terrain of the Hajar Mountains. The highest PD of a single square cell of 10 arc-minutes grid is of 2,430 million years (my) of accumulated evolutionary history and the strong correlation between PD and species richness suggests that the raw number of species is a good surrogate to quantify the evolutionary history (i.e., PD). The species with the highest values of ED are those in families represented by only one species in the UAE. Finally, the assessment of the UAE protected areas shows that, despite their relevance in protecting the terrestrial reptiles, they do not offer adequate protection for some threatened species. Therefore, a reassessment of some of the protected areas or the creation of species specific conservation action plans are recommended in order to ensure the preservation of the unique diversity of UAE terrestrial reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2942975277,"Introduction Women’s awareness of fetal movements is important as perception of decreased fetal movements can be a sign of a compromised fetus. We aimed to study rate of labor induction in relation to number of times women seek care due to decreased or altered fetal movements during their pregnancy compared to women not seeking such care. Further, we investigated the indication of induction. Material and methods A prospective population-based cohort study including all obstetric clinics in Stockholm, Sweden. Questionnaires were distributed to women who sought care due to decreased or altered fetal movements ≥ 28 week’s gestation in 2014, women for whom an examination did not indicate a compromised fetus that required induction of labor or cesarean section when they sought care. Women who gave birth at ≥ 28 weeks’ gestation in 2014 in Stockholm comprises the reference group. Results Labor was induced more often among the 2683 women who had sought care due to decreased or altered fetal movements (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3–1.5). In women who presented with decreased or altered fetal movements induction of labor occurred more frequently for fetal indication than those with induction of labor and no prior fetal movement presentation (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4–1.8). The rate of induction increased with number of times a woman sought care, RR 1.3 for single presentation to 3.2 for five or more. Conclusions We studied women seeking care for decreased or altered fetal movements and for whom pregnancy was not terminated with induction or caesarean section. Subsequent (median 20 days), induction of labor and induction for fetal indications were more frequent in this group compared to the group of women with no fetal movement presentations. Among women seeking care for altered or decreased fetal movements, the likelihood of induction of labor increased with frequency of presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2943540368,"Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are ligand-gated chloride channels mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain stem and spinal cord. They function as pentamers composed of alpha and beta subunits for which 5 genes have been identified in human (GLRA1, GLRA2, GLRA3, GLRA4, GLRB). Several in vitro studies showed that the pentameric subtype composition as well as its stoichiometry influence the distribution and the molecular function of the receptor. Moreover, mutations in some of these genes are involved in different human conditions ranging from tinnitus to epilepsy and hyperekplexia, suggesting distinct functions of the different subunits. Although the beta subunit is essential for synaptic clustering of the receptor, the specific role of each alpha subtype is still puzzling in vivo. The zebrafish genome encodes for five glycine receptor alpha subunits (glra1, glra2, glra3, glra4a, glra4b) thus offering a model of choice to investigate the respective role of each subtype on general motor behaviour. After establishing a phylogeny of GlyR subunit evolution between human and zebrafish, we checked the temporal expression pattern of these transcripts during embryo development. Interestingly, we found that glra1 is the only maternally transmitted alpha subunit. We also showed that the expression of the different GlyR subunits starts at different time points during development. Lastly, in order to decipher the role of each alpha subunit on the general motor behaviour of the fish, we knocked out individually each alpha subunit by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis. Surprisingly, we found that knocking out any of the alpha2, 3, a4a or a4b subunit did not lead to any obvious developmental or motor phenotype. However, glra1-/- (hitch) embryos depicted a strong motor dysfunction from 3 days, making them incapable to swim and thus leading to their premature death. Our results infer a strong functional redundancy between alpha subunits and confirm the central role played by glra1 for proper inhibitory neurotransmission controlling locomotion. The genetic tools we developed here will be of general interest for further studies aiming at dissecting the role of GlyRs in glycinergic transmission in vivo and the hitch mutant (hic) is of specific relevance as a new model of hyperekplexia."
https://openalex.org/W2943253401,"The number of cancer-related emergency presentations and admissions has been steadily increasing in the UK. Drivers of this phenomenon are complex, multifactorial and interlinked. The main objective of this study was to understand the complexity of emergency hospital use in cancer patients. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 42 senior clinicians (20 doctors, 22 nurses) with diverse expertise and experience in caring for acutely ill cancer patients in the secondary care setting. Data analysis included thematic analysis and purposive text analysis to develop Causal Loop Diagrams. Our Causal Loop Diagrams represent an integrated understanding of the complex factors (13) influencing emergency hospital use in cancer patients. Eight factors formed five reinforcing feedback loops and therefore were high-leverage influences: Ability of patients and carers to self-care and cope; Effective and timely management of ambulatory care sensitive conditions by primary and community care; Sufficient and effective social care for patients and carers; Avoidable emergency hospital use; Bed capacity; Patients accessing timely appropriate specialist inpatient or ambulatory care; Prompt and effective management and prevention of acute episode; Timely and safe discharge with appropriate support. The loops show that reduction of avoidable hospital use helps relieve hospital bed pressure; improved bed capacity then has a decisive, positive influence on patient pathway and thus outcome and experience in the hospital; in turn, better in-hospital care and discharge help patients and carers self-care and cope better back home with better support from community-based health and social care services, which then reduces their future emergency hospital use. To optimise acute and emergency cancer care, it is also essential that patients, carers and other clinicians caring for cancer patients have prompt access to senior cancer specialists for advice, assessment, clinical decision and other support. The findings provide a useful framework and focus for service planners aiming to optimise care."
https://openalex.org/W2943711574,"Background Disclosure of HIV status is a critical gateway to HIV prevention. Despite many studies on this topic, there is a gap in knowledge regarding HIV status disclosure and risky sexual behavior in HIV-infected female migrant workers. The current study addressed this research gap, and focused on HIV-infected Shan female migrant workers in Northern Thailand. Methods This study conducted in-depth interviews with 18 HIV-infected Shan female migrants (aged between 23–54 years old) and 29 healthcare workers in district hospitals in Chiang Mai. Content analysis was employed to identify particular themes related to HIV status disclosure, sexual risk behavior, and ART adherence. Results We found that non-disclosure to husbands/partners was mostly related to fear of marital conflict and of losing social and financial support. Non-disclosure prevented Shan female migrant workers from negotiating condom use with their partners. Reasons for not disclosing to friends, family and other community members were mostly related to feared rejection and discrimination due to HIV-related stigma. Accounts of condomless sex in the context of HIV status disclosure suggest that gender norms and male dominance over women influenced decision-making for safe sex. Lastly, some female migrant workers perceived low risk of HIV transmission with good adherence to the ART. Conclusions This study highlighted the complex challenges of HIV status disclosure among HIV-positive Shan female migrant workers and the link between disclosure/non-disclosure and condom use. There is a pressing need to create realistic disclosure mechanisms that take into account the socio-cultural barriers to disclosure including marital conflicts, stigma, and gender norms. Messages to encourage condom use should be delivered carefully so that knowledge of the HIV transmission reduction qualities of good ART adherence does not serve as a barrier to condom use."
https://openalex.org/W2942695590,"Senecavirus A (SVA) is a critical pathogen causing vesicular lesions in sows and acute death of newborn piglets, resulting in very large economic losses in the pig industry. To restrict the transmission of SVA, an establishment of an effective diagnostic method is crucial for the prevention and control of the disease. However, traditional detection methods often have many drawbacks. In this study, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) to detect SVA. The resulting RT-LAMP-LFD assay was performed at 60°C for 50 min and then directly judged on an LFD visualization strip. This method shows high specificity and sensitivity to SVA. The detection limit of RT-LAMP was 4.56x10-8 ng/μL RNA, approximately 11 copies/μL RNA, and it was 10 times more sensitive than RT-PCR. This detection method’s positive rate for clinical samples is comparable to that of RT-PCR. This method is time saving and highly efficient and is thus expected to be used to diagnose SVA infections in this field."
https://openalex.org/W2942989492,"Barnacle settlement involves sensing of a variety of exogenous cues. A pair of antennules is the main sensory organ that the cyprid larva uses to explore the surface. Antennules are equipped with a number of setae that have both chemo- and mechanosensing function. The current study explores the repertoire of sensory receptors in Balanus improvisus cyprid antennules with the goal to better understand sensory systems involved in the settling behavior of this species. We carried out transcriptome sequencing of dissected B. improvisus cyprid antennules. The generated transcriptome assembly was used to search for sensory receptors using HMM models. Among potential chemosensory genes, we identified the ionotropic receptors IR25a, IR8a and IR93a, and several divergent IR candidates to be expressed in the cyprid antennules. We found one gustatory-like receptor but no odorant receptors, chemosensory or odorant-binding proteins. Apart from chemosensory receptors, we also identified 13 potential mechanosensory genes represented by several transient receptor potential channels (TRP) subfamilies. Furthermore, we analyzed changes in expression profiles of IRs and TRPs during the B. improvisus settling process. Several of the sensory genes were differentially expressed during the course of larval settlement. This study gives expanded knowledge about the sensory systems present in barnacles, a taxonomic group for which only limited information about receptors is currently available. It furthermore serves as a starting point for more in depth studies of how sensory signaling affects settling behavior in barnacles with implications for preventing biofouling."
https://openalex.org/W2943091270,"We introduce a simple and universal cloning plasmid system for gene expression in prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and mammalian cells. This novel system has two expression modes: the (subcloning) prokaryotic and mammalian modes. This system streamlines the process of producing mammalian gene expression plasmids with desired genes. The plasmid (prokaryotic mode) has an efficient selection system for DNA insertion, multiple component genes with rare restriction sites at both ends (termed “units”), and a simple transformation to mammalian expression mode utilizing rare restriction enzymes and re-ligation (deletion step). The new plasmid contains the lac promoter and operator followed by a blunt-end EcoRV recognition site, and a DNA topoisomerase II toxin-originated gene for effective selection with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction. This system is highly efficient for the subcloning of blunt-end fragments, including PCR products. After the insertion of the desired gene, protein encoded by the desired gene can be detected in E. coli with IPTG induction. Then, the lac promoter and operator are readily deleted with 8-nucleotide rare-cutter blunt-end enzymes (deletion step). Following re-ligation and transformation, the plasmid is ready for mammalian expression analysis (mammalian mode). This idea (conversion from prokaryotic to mammalian mode) can be widely adapted. The pgMAX system overwhelmingly simplifies prokaryotic and mammalian gene expression analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2943794273,"The use of Xenopus laevis as a model for vertebrate developmental biology is limited by a lack of antibodies specific for embryonic antigens. This study evaluated the use of immune and non-immune phage display libraries for the isolation of single domain antibodies, or nanobodies, with specificities for Xenopus embryonic antigens. The immune nanobody library was derived from peripheral blood lymphocyte RNA obtained from a llama immunized with Xenopus gastrula homogenates. Screening this library by immunostaining of embryonic tissues with pooled periplasmic material and sib-selection led to the isolation of several monoclonal phages reactive with the cytoplasm and nuclei of gastrula cells. One antigen recognized by a group of nanobodies was identified using a reverse proteomics approach as nucleoplasmin, an abundant histone chaperone. As an alternative strategy, a semi-synthetic non-immune llama nanobody phage display library was panned on highly purified Xenopus proteins. This proof-of-principle approach isolated monoclonal nanobodies that specifically bind Nuclear distribution element-like 1 (Ndel1) in multiple immunoassays. Our results suggest that immune and non-immune phage display screens on crude and purified embryonic antigens can efficiently identify nanobodies useful to the Xenopus developmental biology community."
https://openalex.org/W2951793895,"Current strategies for cartilage cell therapy are mostly based on the use of autologous chondrocytes. However, these cells have limitations of a small number of cells available and of low chondrogenic ability, respectively. Many studies now suggest that fetal stem cells are more plastic than adult stem cells and can therefore more efficiently differentiate into target tissues. This study introduces, efficiency chondrogenic differentiation of fetal cartilage-derived progenitor cells (FCPCs) to adult cells can be achieved using a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture method based on silica nanopatterning techniques. In evaluating the issue of silica nano-particle size (Diameter of 300, 750, 1200 nm), each particle size was coated into the well of a 6-well tissue culture plate. FCPCs (2 x 105 cells/well in 6-well plate) were seeded in each well with chondrogenic medium. In this study, the 300 nm substrate that formed multi-spheroids and the 1200 nm substrate that showed spreading were due to the cell-cell adhesion force(via N-cadherin) and cell-substrate(via Integrin) force, the 750 nm substrate that formed the mass-aggregation can be interpreted as the result of cell monolayer formation through cell-substrate force followed by cell-cell contact force contraction. We conclude that our 3D spheroid culture system contributes to an optimization for efficient differentiation of FCPC, offers insight into the mechanism of efficient differentiation of engineered 3D culture system, and has promise for wide applications in regeneration medicine and drug discovery fields."
https://openalex.org/W2942562430,"Alpine wetlands are important ecosystems, but an increased availability of soil nutrients may affect their soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and key enzyme activities. We undertook a 3-year experiment of observing nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) addition to alpine wetland soils of the Tibetan Plateau, China, with measurements made of soil extracellular enzyme activities and soil N2O fluxes. Our study showed that soil N2O flux was significantly increased by 72% and 102% following N and N+P additions, respectively. N addition significantly increased acid phosphatase (AP) and β-1, 4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities by 32% and 26%, respectively. P addition alone exerted a neutral effect on soil AP activities, while increasing NAG activities. We inferred that microbes produce enzymes based on ‘resource allocation theory’, but that a series of constitutive enzymes or the treatment duration interfere with this response. Our findings suggest that N addition increases N- and P-cycling enzyme activities and soil N2O flux, whereas P addition exerts a neutral effect on P-cycling enzyme activities and N2O flux after 3 years of nutrient applications to an alpine wetland."
https://openalex.org/W2942849255,"Although T cells play important roles in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, the dynamics of T cells remains unclear. In cancer, polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) contribute to the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment by suppressing T cells. However, the presence of these cells has never been examined in ischemic brain. Therefore, we examined the temporal and spatial profiles of PMN-MDSCs, which are defined as the CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells with higher expression levels of Nox2 and C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP) mRNA than normal neutrophil. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that the count of CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells was increased in the ischemic hemisphere and bone marrow at 72 hours, as well as in the spleen 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. In contrast, the contralateral hemisphere, normal bone marrow, and normal spleen contained few CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells sorted from brain and spleen 72 hours after ischemia had greater expression of Nox2 and CHOP mRNA than neutrophils in bone marrow, suggesting that these cells constitute PMN-MDSCs. Immunohistochemistry showed that CD11b+Ly6G+ cells were located in the ischemic core and border zone, indicating that PMN-MDSCs might be endemic to these regions. Although neutrophils are believed to invade infarct regions 48-72 hours after ischemia, the present study suggested that some of these cells are in fact PMN-MDSCs. Further studies on the function of PMN-MDSCs might unveil the unknown mechanisms of T cell activation and recruitment in ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2943344615,"Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to improve dynamic walking stability, affect postural responses, enhance balance in healthy subjects, and influence motor performance in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Although the studies to fully characterize the effect of nGVS are still ongoing, stochastic resonance theory which states that the addition of noisy signal may enhance a weak sensory input signals transmission in a non-linear system may provide a possible explanation for the observed positive effects of nGVS. This study explores the effect of nGVS on fine tracking behavior in healthy subjects. Ten healthy participants performed a computer-based visuomotor task by controlling an object with a joystick to follow an amplitude-modulated signal path while simultaneously receiving a sham or pink noise nGVS. The stimulation was generated to have a zero-mean, linearly detrended 1/f-type power spectrum, Gaussian distribution within 0.1-10 Hz range, and a standard deviation (SD) set to 90% based on each participant's cutaneous threshold value. Results show that simultaneous nGVS delivery statistically improved the tracking performance with a decreased root-mean-squared error of 5.71±6.20% (mean±SD), a decreased time delay of 11.88±9.66% (mean±SD), and an increased signal-to-noise ratio of 2.93% (median, interquartile range (IQR) 3.31%). This study showed evidence that nGVS may be beneficial in improving sensorimotor performance during a fine motor tracking task requiring fine wrist movement in healthy subjects. Further research with a more comprehensive subset of tasks is required to fully characterize the effects of nGVS on fine motor skills."
https://openalex.org/W2943808534,"Acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) is a global public health priority that often disproportionately effects Indigenous populations. While previous research examines the association between meteorological conditions and AGI, little is known about how socio-cultural factors may modify this relationship. This present study seeks to address this research gap by comparing AGI prevalence and determinants between an Indigenous and non-Indigenous population in Uganda. We estimate the 14-day self-reported prevalence of AGI among adults in an Indigenous Batwa population and their non-Indigenous neighbours using cross-sectional panel data collected over four periods spanning typically rainy and dry seasons (January 2013 to April 2014). The independent associations between Indigenous status, precipitation, and AGI are examined with multivariable multi-level logistic regression models, controlling for relative wealth status and clustering at the community level. Estimated prevalence of AGI among the Indigenous Batwa was greater than among the non-Indigenous Bakiga. Our models indicate that both Indigenous identity and decreased levels of precipitation in the weeks preceding the survey period were significantly associated with increased AGI, after adjusting for confounders. Multivariable models stratified by Indigenous identity suggest that Indigenous identity may not modify the association between precipitation and AGI in this context. Our results suggest that short-term changes in precipitation affect both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations similarly, though from different baseline AGI prevalences, maintaining rather than exacerbating this socially patterned health disparity. In the context of climate change, these results may challenge the assumption that changing weather patterns will necessarily exacerbate existing socially patterned health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2943524982,"Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by pain, motor and inflammatory symptoms usually affecting one limb. Cognitive difficulties have been reported to affect patients’ ability to represent, perceive and use their affected limb. It is debated whether these difficulties result from deficits in controlling goal-directed movements in space or from a learned strategy to protect the affected limb. In order to dissociate the two hypotheses, patients with upper-limb CRPS were asked to move with their unaffected hand towards visual targets projected at different positions on a horizontal semi-reflexive mirror. By means of a robotic handle placed below the screen, they were asked to move a cursor, to reach and cross lines at their estimated midpoint. In some of the stimulation series, the affected hand was placed below the mirror so that some lines appeared projected onto that hand. Vision of the hands and the robotic handle was preserved or prevented by opening or closing a shutter below the mirror. Lines were displayed on the mirror according to which part of the body was affected (ispi- vs. contralateral) and the actual position of the affected hand (inside vs. outside the workspace). Comparatively to control participants, CRPS patients generally biased their estimation by bisecting the lines towards their left side, irrelative of which part of the body was affected and the position of the affected hand, both in ipsi- and contralateral space, with only a few exceptions. Our results are in line with previous studies having described a visuospatial deficit in CRPS patients and discard the explanation of observed symptoms in terms of learned nonuse strategies, as only the unaffected hand was used to perform the task. It is suggested that CRPS patients can display difficulties to perform tasks requesting visuo-motor coordination, reflecting the complex cortical reorganization occurring in CRPS."
https://openalex.org/W2942541667,"Anti-citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies (ACPAs) are the most specific serological biomarkers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They have both diagnostic and prognostic value, and are related to more aggressive joint disease in RA. However, a single biomarker cannot differentiate RA subtypes. So, simultaneous analysis of target citrullinated peptides, using a multiplex array based on chimeric peptides composed of several domains of human proteins, could be useful. In this work, eight chimeric peptides and the corresponding native arginine-containing control peptides were obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The study included RA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients attending the Rheumatology Unit of the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, as well as healthy blood donors (BD) at the same hospital. Our main aim was to explore the diagnostic value of the novel multiplex array compared to a commercial ELISA-based ACPA assay in a serum-saving way. Using the combination of the eight chimeric peptide antigens in the multiplex array, 61.4% of the RA cohort were positive for 3 or more peptides; while, the healthy BD and PsA cohorts did not show any reactivity with the tested peptides. These results indicate that we have developed a highly specific multiplex assay based of chimeric citrullinated peptides derived from filaggrin, fibrin, vimentin and human enolase proteins for the detection of ACPAs in a serum-saving way."
https://openalex.org/W2942933849,"Actinotrichia are the first exoskeletal elements formed during zebrafish fin development. These rigid fibrils serve as skeletal support for the fin fold and as substrates for mesenchymal cell migration. In the adult intact fins, actinotrichia are restricted to the distal domain of the fin. Following fin amputation, actinotrichia also reform during regeneration. The actinodin gene family codes for structural proteins of actinotrichia. We have previously identified cis-acting regulatory elements in a 2kb genomic region upstream of the first exon of actinodin1, termed 2P, required for tissue-specific expression in the fin fold ectoderm and mesenchyme during embryonic development. Indeed, 2P contains an ectodermal enhancer in a 150bp region named epi. Deletion of epi from 2P results in loss of ectodermal-specific activity. In the present study, we sought to further characterize the activity of these regulatory sequences throughout fin development and during adult fin regeneration. Using a reporter transgenic approach, we show that a site within the epi region, termed epi3, contains an early mesenchymal-specific repressor. We also show that the larval fin fold ectodermal enhancer within epi3 remains functional in the basal epithelial layer during fin regeneration. We show that the first non-coding exon and first intron of actinodin1 contains a transcriptional enhancer and an alternative promoter that are necessary for the persistence of reporter expression reminiscent of actinodin1 expression during adulthood. Altogether, we have identified cis-acting regulatory elements that are required for tissue-specific expression as well as full recapitulation of actinodin1 expression during adulthood. Furthermore, the characterization of these elements provides us with useful molecular tools for the enhancement of transgene expression in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2942975331,"Prior to goal-directed actions, somatosensory target positions can be localized using either an exteroceptive or an interoceptive body representation. The goal of the present study was to investigate if the body representation selected to plan reaches to somatosensory targets is influenced by the sensory modality of the cue indicating the target's location. In the first experiment, participants reached to somatosensory targets prompted by either an auditory or a vibrotactile cue. As a baseline condition, participants also performed reaches to visual targets prompted by an auditory cue. Gaze-dependent reaching errors were measured to determine the contribution of the exteroceptive representation to motor planning processes. The results showed that reaches to both auditory-cued somatosensory targets and auditory-cued visual targets exhibited larger gaze-dependent reaching errors than reaches to vibrotactile-cued somatosensory targets. Thus, an exteroceptive body representation was likely used to plan reaches to auditory-cued somatosensory targets but not to vibrotactile-cued somatosensory targets. The second experiment examined the influence of using an exteroceptive body representation to plan movements to somatosensory targets on pre-movement neural activations. Cortical responses to a task-irrelevant visual flash were measured as participants planned movements to either auditory-cued somatosensory or auditory-cued visual targets. Larger responses (i.e., visual-evoked potentials) were found when participants planned movements to somatosensory vs. visual targets, and source analyses revealed that these activities were localized to the left occipital and left posterior parietal areas. These results suggest that visual and visuomotor processing networks were more engaged when using the exteroceptive body representation to plan movements to somatosensory targets, than when planning movements to external visual targets."
https://openalex.org/W2943224769,"Genotype-to-phenotype correlation studies in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) have been confounded by the age-dependent, tissue-specific and expansion-biased features of somatic mosaicism of the expanded CTG repeat. Previously, we showed that by controlling for the confounding effects of somatic instability to estimate the progenitor allele CTG length in blood DNA, age at onset correlations could be significantly improved. To determine the suitability of saliva DNA as a source for genotyping, we used small pool-PCR to perform a detailed quantitative study of the somatic mutational dynamics of the CTG repeat in saliva and blood DNA from 40 DM1 patients. Notably, the modal allele length in saliva was only moderately higher in saliva and not as large as previously observed in most other tissues. The lower boundary of the allele distribution was also slightly higher in saliva than it was in blood DNA. However, the progenitor allele length estimated in blood explained more of the variation in age at onset than that estimated from saliva. Interestingly, although the modal allele length was slightly higher in saliva, the overall degree of somatic variation was typically lower than in blood DNA, revealing new insights into the tissue-specific dynamics of somatic mosaicism. These data indicate that saliva constitutes an accessible, non-invasive and suitable DNA sample source for performing genetic studies in DM1."
https://openalex.org/W2943646784,"Aggression in chickens is a serious economic and animal welfare issue in poultry farming. Pigmentation traits have been documented to be associated with animal behaviour. Chicken pecking behaviour has been found to be related to feather colour, with premelanosome protein 17 (PMEL17) being one of the candidate genes. In the present study, we performed a genotypic and phenotypic association analysis between chicken plumage colour (red and white) and aggressive behaviour in an F1 hybrid group generated by crossing the autosomal dominant white-feathered breed White Leghorn (WL) and the red-feathered breed Rhode Island Red (RIR). In genetic theory, all the progeny should have white feathers because WL is homozygous autosomal dominant for white feathers. However, we found a few red-feathered female chickens. We compared the aggressiveness between the red and white females to determine whether the feather colour alone affected the behaviour, given that the genetic background should be the same except for feather colour. The aggressiveness was recorded 5 days after sexual maturity at 26 weeks. Generally, white plumage hens showed significantly higher aggressiveness compared to the red ones in chasing, attacking, pecking, and threatening behaviour traits. We assessed three candidate feather colour genes—PMEL17, solute carrier family 45 member 2 (SLC45A2), and SRY-box 10 (SOX10)—to determine the genetic basis for the red and white feather colour in our hybrid population; there was no association between the three loci and feather colour. The distinct behavioural findings observed herein provide clues to the mechanisms underlying the association between phenotype and behaviour in chickens. We suggest that mixing red and white chickens together might reduce the occurrence of aggressive behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2942780680,"In structural neuroimaging studies, reduced cerebral cortical thickness in orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions is frequently interpreted as reflecting an impaired ability to downregulate neuronal activity in the amygdalae. Unfortunately, little research has been conducted in order to test this conjecture. We examine the extent to which amygdalar reactivity is associated with cortical thickness in a population-based sample of adolescents. Data were obtained from the IMAGEN study, which includes 2,223 adolescents. While undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants passively viewed video clips of a face that started from a neutral expression and progressively turned angry, or, instead, turned to a second neutral expression. Left and right amygdala ROIs were used to extract mean BOLD signal change for the angry minus neutral face contrast for all subjects. T1-weighted images were processed through the CIVET pipeline (version 2.1.0). In variable-centered analyses, local cortical thickness was regressed against amygdalar reactivity using first and second-order linear models. In a follow-up person-centered analysis, we defined a ""high reactive"" group of participants based on mean amygdalar BOLD signal change for the angry minus neutral face contrast. Between-group differences in cortical thickness were examined (""high reactive"" versus all other participants). A significant association was revealed between the continuous measure of amygdalar reactivity and bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortical thickness in a second-order linear model (p < 0.05, corrected). The ""high reactive"" group, in comparison to all other participants, possessed reduced cortical thickness in bilateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, bilateral anterior temporal cortices, left caudal middle temporal gyrus, and the left inferior and middle frontal gyri (p < 0.05, corrected). Results are consistent with non-human primate studies, and provide empirical support for an association between reduced prefrontal cortical thickness and amygdalar reactivity. Future research will likely benefit from investigating the degree to which psychopathology qualifies relations between prefrontal cortical structure and amygdalar reactivity."

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) designated ~170 km2 of shelf area for wind energy development off the coast of Maryland, USA. In order to understand potential environmental impacts of wind turbine installation on the benthic ecosystem within the designated area, we conducted a study to visually characterize bottom habitats and epibenthic communities in the Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf blocks of the Maryland wind energy area. Seven 5 km long transects were sampled using a towed camera sled with a downward-facing digital camera that captured images at 5 frames·s-1s. Additional small-mesh beam trawling was also conducted at selected locations complementary for species identification. Image data were analyzed using two image selection methods, random and systematic (i.e. video frames were selected at various intervals). For both methods, estimates of community diversity (Hill's N2) stabilized with sample sizes ranging from 316 to 398 frames. Our results allowed us to define distinct epibenthic communities and bottom habitats that are associated with offshore wind energy sites and to develop a sampling technique for digital images that can be applied to other research programs."

We analyzed the status and effects of secondary prevention after coronary revascularization in Taiwan.This national population-based cohort study was conducted by analyzing the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients who underwent CABG or PCI from 2004 to 2009 were included in the analysis. The baseline characteristics of the patients and ACC/AHA class I medication use at 12 months were analyzed. The primary endpoints were a composite of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.A total of 5544 patients comprising 895 CABG and 4649 PCI patients were evaluated. CABG patients had more comorbidities and a higher rate of major adverse event during the follow-up period. However, use of antiplatelet agents and RASB at 12 months was significantly lower in CABG patients than in PCI patients (44.2% vs. 50.9% and 38.6% vs. 48.9%, both p < 0.01). Age, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were independent risk factors while statin use was a protective factor for the primary endpoints in both PCI and CABG groups.There is still much room to improve class I medication use in secondary prevention for patients after revascularization in Taiwan. Statin could be an effective treatment to improve the outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2943544415,"Objective To assess which factors, including maternal, lifestyle, pregnancy- and delivery-related, fetal and neonatal factors adjusted for socio-economic status, are related to emotional and behavioral problems in moderately-late preterm born children (MLPs; gestational age 32.0–35.9 weeks) at 4 years of age. MLPs are at greater risk of emotional and behavioral problems than full-term born children. Especially for MLPs, knowledge about factors that increase or decrease the risk of emotional and behavioral problems is scarce. Design and setting We assessed emotional and behavioral problems in 809 MLPs between ages 41 and 49 months from the prospective community-based Longitudinal Preterm Outcome Project (LOLLIPOP), using the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We collected potential risk factors from hospital records and parental questionnaires. Univariable and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied. Main outcome measures (Sub)clinical CBCL scores. Results Perinatal infection increased the risk of CBCL total problem scores with an OR 2.22 (p<0.01). Perinatal infection, maternal smoking, and male gender increased the risk of CBCL externalizing problem scores with ORs between 1.64 and 2.46 (all p<0.05). Multiple birth decreased the risk of CBCL internalizing problem scores with an OR 0.63 (p<0.05). Conclusions Risk factors for behavioral problems in MLPs are male gender, perinatal infection and maternal smoking, the latter two being potentially modifiable. Multiple birth is a protective factor for emotional problems in MLPs. These results suggest potential factors for targeting preventive intervention in MLPs, comprising the large majority of all preterm born children."
https://openalex.org/W2943612327,"Background Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are representative methods for promoting the standardization of healthcare and improvement of its quality. Few studies have investigated changes in the quality of CPGs published in a country over time. Our aim was to investigate changes in the quality of CPGs over time in the context of the available infrastructure for CPG development, public interest in healthcare quality, and healthcare providers’ responses to this interest. Methods All CPGs pertaining to evidence-based medicine (EBM) issued between 2000 and 2014 in Japan (n = 373) were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) I. Additionally, time trends in quality were analyzed. Using a cut-off point based on the publication year of CPG development literature, the evaluated CPGs were classified into those published until 2008 (pre-2008) and those published since 2009 (post-2008). Subsequently, we compared these groups in terms of 1) first edition CPGs and its second editions, and 2) patients’ version of CPGs. Results Scores on all six domains of AGREE I improved each year. A comparison of the first- and second-edition of CPGs (n = 64) showed that scores on all domains improved significantly after revision. Significant improvement was observed in three domains (#2 stakeholder involvement, #3 rigor of development, and #4 clarity of presentation) in the pre-2008 group and in all domains in the post-2008 group. The comparison between the pre- and post-2008 groups in terms of CPGs for patients showed that the score increased in only one domain (#1 scope and purpose). Conclusions The number of published CPGs has been increasing and the quality of CPGs, as assessed using the AGREE I instrument, has been improving. These changes seem to be influenced by improvements in social infrastructure, such as the publication of CPG development procedures, availability of CPG preparation methodology training, and increase in CPG-related skills."
https://openalex.org/W2942889786,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the positions of femoral bone sockets and tibial bone tunnels made with the rectangular retro-dilator (RRD), which we manufactured for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with a bone-patella tendon-bone (BPTB) graft which is fixed into the rectangular bone socket and tunnel made at anatomical ACL insertion sites.42 patients who had undergone ACLR with BPTB using the RRD were evaluated to assess bone socket and tunnel positions by the quadrant method and Magnussen classification using three-dimensional (3-D) CT. Intra-operative complications were also investigated in all patients.3-D CT of the operated knee joints using the RRD showed that the bone socket and tunnel were placed in anatomical positions. In the quadrant method, the mean position of the femoral bone socket aperture was located at 22.0 ± 4.2% along the Blumensaat's line, and 37.4 ± 7.2% across the posterior condylar rim. The mean positions of the tibial bone tunnel aperture were 37.7 ± 5.2% and 46.1 ± 2.2% antero-posteriorly and medio-laterally, respectively. In addition, according to the Magnussen classification, 39 cases were evaluated as type 1, and almost all were located behind the lateral intercondylar ridge (also known as the resident's ridge). 3 cases were classified as type 2, which overlapped with the resident's ridge. A partial fracture of BPTB bone fragment was observed in 2 patients, but no serious complications including neurovascular injury were observed.The study indicates that the use of RRD achieves a safe anatomical reconstruction of the ACL."
https://openalex.org/W2943199436,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on the survival of brain metastases (BM) in patients with surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods We selected the patients who had developed metastatic NSCLC; analyzed the differences between brain metastases and other sites of metastases, including patient characteristics, EGFR status, and survival; and selected the patients who had BM for further investigation. We also compared the treatment effects of first-generation TKIs with those of second-/third-generation TKIs. Results A total of 785 cases of stage I-IIIa NSCLC were reviewed. Thirty-six (4.6%) patients were identified as having BM. Among them, 14 patients had a mutated EGFR status. No association between EGFR mutation and the incidence of BM was observed (p = 0.199). Patients with mutated EGFRs had significantly longer overall survival and post-recurrence survival than patients with wild-type EGFR mutation (p = 0.001 for both). However, there was no survival difference between patients with exon 19 and exon 21 mutations (p = 0.426). Furthermore, patients who received the second- and/or third-generation EGFR-TKIs had better survival than patients who only received first-generation EGFR-TKIs (p = 0.031). A multivariate analysis indicated that the next-generation TKIs (HR, 0.007; 95% CI, 0.000 to 0.556; p = 0.026) and a longer interval before BM development (HR, 0.848; 95% CI, 0.733 to 0.980; p = 0.025) were significant factors in longer survival. Conclusions EGFR-TKIs were effective in treating NSCLC patients with BM after curative pulmonary surgery, especially in those patients harboring EGFR mutations. Furthermore, the second-/third-generation EGFR-TKIs showed more promising results than the first-generation EGFR-TKIs in treating those particular patients, though larger studies needed to further prove the results."
https://openalex.org/W2942586371,"Soil is a porous, multiphase, and loose medium, which is prone to serious disturbance by the activity of biological livings, accompanied with cracks and macro pores. These phenomena greatly affect the strength of soil and the degradation of land. Two different quantifiable values from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images are usually used to define the disturbance function for soil disturbed state strength: mean density (MD value) and standard deviation (SD value). Two types of disturbance functions are investigated quantitatively by CT-triaxial testing using four samples with different macro-pore sizes (disturbed samples) and one sample without a macro-pore (undisturbed sample). It is found that the shear strength of three disturbed samples with the same macro-pore size is close to each other. As with the shear strength, the SD value and its defined disturbance function have a similar correlation with the cross-sectional area of macro-pore. However, the MD value and its defined disturbance function have no regularity with the macro-pore size. Therefore, the disturbance function expressed in terms of the SD value is deemed more reasonable and appropriate in analyzing the soil disturbed state strength using the quantitative CT morphometry. While, the disturbance function defined by the MD value has often been used to characterize a rock damage."
https://openalex.org/W2943227515,"Drug performance in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) plays a crucial role in determining release and absorption. In the present work, we assessed the in vitro digestion of two synthetic N1-aryl-2-arylthioacetamidobenzimidazoles (NAABs), NAAB-496 and NAAB-503, using bio-relevant models of the human stomach and small intestine. The activity of NAAB-496 and NAAB-503 against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) replication was also investigated. NAAB-496 was resistant to pepsin in the gastric environment, with a virtual 100% recovery, which decreased to 43.2% in the small intestine. NAAB-503 was sensitive to pepsin, with 65.7% degradation after 120 min gastric phase. 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) post in vitro digestion highlighted an alteration of NAAB-496 after the gastric phase, whereas NAAB-503 appeared comparable to the original spectral data. Both NAAB-496 and NAAB-503 revealed some antiviral activity anti-HSV-1. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of the compounds was 0.058 mg/mL for NAAB-496 and 0.066 for NAAB-503. Future studies will evaluate the behavior of NAAB-496 within pharmaceutical formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2943256907,"The effect a wind instrument has on lung function is a much-discussed topic with inconclusive data, not least because existing studies combine all wind instruments as one entity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of playing a trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn on lung function.A prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional, case-control study. Participants were recruited from wind orchestra or brass bands throughout Switzerland. Inclusion criteria: aged 16 or older, reporting at least one year of playing a trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn. Controls were members of an orchestra, who had never played a wind instrument. The primary end-point of the study was the difference in FEV1%predicted between trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn players and controls.147 subjects were included in the study. Controls (n = 48) were significantly younger, more commonly male, current smokers and had a lower body mass index compared to trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn players (n = 99). There was no significant difference in FEV1%predicted (91.9% vs 94.2%; p = 0.316) or FVC %predicted (89.4% vs 92.6%; p = 0.125) between controls and trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn players, respectively, in crude and adjusted analyses. However, there was a significant negative association between the number of years playing a trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn and FVC %predicted after adjusting for smoking status, gender, and height. Trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn players had a similar amount of respiratory symptoms to controls (questionnaire score 3.2±3.2 vs 2.8±2.4, p = 0.717).Lung function in trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn players was similar to controls. However, the number of years playing a trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn seems to have an adverse effect on forced vital capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2943259857,"Both maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy are associated with adverse birth outcomes. The role of antenatal nutrient supplements with regard to adverse birth outcomes in HIV infected women exposed to antiretroviral therapy is not well known. We assessed the association between HIV and birth outcomes and explored whether antenatal lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) modulated this association.We analysed a nested cohort of pregnant Malawian women who received daily LNS, multiple micronutrients (MMN) or iron and folic acid (IFA). Birth weight, length-for-age z-score (LAZ) and weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) were analysed as continuous outcomes and proportion of stunting and small-for-gestational age (SGA) as dichotomous outcomes.134 HIV infected (46 LNS, 39 MMN, 49 IFA) and 833 HIV uninfected (271 LNS, 287 MMN, 275 IFA) women were included. Maternal HIV infection was associated with a lower mean birth weight (-129g (-209, -48), P = 0.002); LAZ (-0.34 (-0.54, -0.13), P = 0.002) and WAZ (-0.21 (-0.40, -0.02), P = 0.041) and a higher risk of stunting (RR (95% confidence interval), 1.87 (1.24, 2.83), P = 0.003) and SGA (1.66 (1.21, 2.26), P = 0.001) in the newborn. If the women received LNS, HIV was not associated with LAZ (mean difference (95%); -0.02 (-0.35, 0.31), P = 0.918) or newborn stunting (RR (95% CI), 0.84 (0.34, 2.03), P = 0.691). However HIV tended to be associated with LAZ if the women received MMN (-0.42 (-0.80, -0.03), P = 0.053); and was significantly associated with LAZ if the women received IFA (-0.52 (-0.89, -0.14), P = 0.021) and with newborn stunting if they received MMN (2.40 (1.15, 4.98), P = 0.029) or IFA (2.40 (1.26, 4.59), P = 0.024).Further research to investigate the impact of LNS on various aspects of foetal growth in HIV infected women is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2943643086,"We theoretically study the effects of non-monotonic response curves in genetic auto-regulation by exploring the possible dynamical behaviors for such systems. Our motivation is twofold: we aim at conceiving the simplest genetic circuits for synthetic biology and at understanding the natural auto-regulation of the LrpB protein of the Sulfolobus solfataricus archaeon which exhibits non-monotonicity. We analyzed three toy models, based on mass-action kinetics, with increasing complexity and sought for oscillations and (fast) bistable switching. We performed large parameter scans and sensitivity analyses, and quantified the quality of the oscillators and switches by computing relative volumes in parameter space reproducing the sought dynamical behavior. All single gene systems need finely tuned parameters in order to oscillate, but bistable switches are more robust against parameter changes. We expected non-monotonic switches to be faster than monotonic ones, however solutions combining both auto-activation and repression in the physiological range to obtain fast switches are scarce. Our analysis shows that the Ss-LrpB system can not provide a bistable switch and that robust oscillations are unlikely. Gillespie simulations suggest that the function of the natural Ss-LrpB system is sensing via a spiking behavior, which is in line with the fact that this protein has a metabolic regulatory function and binds to a ligand."
