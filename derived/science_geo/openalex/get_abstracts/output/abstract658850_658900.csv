https://openalex.org/W3082570758,"Forty percent of all general-practitioner appointments are related to mental illness, although less than 35% of individuals have access to therapy and psychological care, indicating a pressing need for accessible and affordable therapy tools. The ubiquity of smartphones offers a delivery platform for such tools. Previous research suggests that gamification—turning intervention content into a game format—could increase engagement with prevention and early-stage mobile interventions. This study aimed to explore the effects of a gamified mobile mental health intervention on improvements in resilience, in comparison with active and inactive control conditions. Differences between conditions on changes in personal growth, anxiety and psychological wellbeing, as well as differences in attrition rates, were also assessed. The eQuoo app was developed and published on all leading mobile platforms. The app educates users about psychological concepts including emotional bids, generalization, and reciprocity through psychoeducation, storytelling, and gamification. In total, 358 participants completed in a 5-week, 3-armed (eQuoo, “treatment as usual” cognitive behavioral therapy journal app, no-intervention waitlist) randomized controlled trial. Relevant scales were administered to all participants on days 1, 17, and 35. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed statistically significant increases in resilience in the test group compared with both control groups over 5 weeks. The app also significantly increased personal growth, positive relations with others, and anxiety. With 90% adherence, eQuoo retained 21% more participants than the control or waitlist groups. Intervention delivered via eQuoo significantly raised mental well-being and decreased self-reported anxiety while enhancing adherence in comparison with the control conditions. Mobile apps using gamification can be a valuable and effective platform for well-being and mental health interventions and may enhance motivation and reduce attrition. Future research should measure eQuoo’s effect on anxiety with a more sensitive tool and examine the impact of eQuoo on a clinical population."

Despite their growing relevance, their chemical properties are poorly understood. Herein, we studied experimentally and computationally the formation, acidity, and nucleophilicity of glutathione persulfide (GSSH/GSS−), the derivative of the abundant cellular thiol glutathione (GSH). We characterized the kinetics and equilibrium of GSSH formation from glutathione disulfide and H2S. A pKa of 5.45 for GSSH was determined, which is 3.49 units below that of GSH. The reactions of GSSH with the physiologically relevant electrophiles peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide, and with the probe monobromobimane, were studied and compared with those of thiols. These reactions occurred through SN2 mechanisms. At neutral pH, GSSH reacted faster than GSH because of increased availability of the anion and, depending on the electrophile, increased reactivity. In addition, GSS− presented higher nucleophilicity with respect to a thiolate with similar basicity. This can be interpreted in terms of the so-called α effect, i.e. the increased reactivity of a nucleophile when the atom adjacent to the nucleophilic atom has high electron density. The magnitude of the α effect correlated with the Brønsted nucleophilic factor, βnuc, for the reactions with thiolates and with the ability of the leaving group. Our study constitutes the first determination of the pKa of a biological persulfide and the first examination of the α effect in sulfur nucleophiles, and sheds light on the chemical basis of the biological properties of persulfides.

The IUPAC recommended names are sulfane or dihydrogen sulfide for H2S, and sulfanide or hydrogen(sulfide)(1–) for HS−. 8The term “H2S” is used in this text for the mixture of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and hydrosulfide anion (HS–) in aqueous solution. The IUPAC recommended names are sulfane or dihydrogen sulfide for H2S, and sulfanide or hydrogen(sulfide)(1–) for HS−.. Beyond its toxicity, H2S exerts physiological effects with potential health benefits in mammals. Persulfides have been proposed to transduce these effects; the modification of critical protein thiols (RSH/RS−) to persulfides would unleash downstream effects of H2S (1Filipovic M.R. Zivanovic J.

In addition, persulfides are intermediates in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters and other cofactors (2Mueller E.G. Trafficking in persulfides: delivering sulfur in biosynthetic pathways.Nat.

These processes suggest that GSSH plays key roles in vivo; indeed, concentrations of ∼35 pmol/mg protein (∼7 μm) in mouse liver tissue have been recently reported (16Dóka É. Ida T. Dagnell M.

Hydropersulfides (RSSH) ionize in water to form deprotonated persulfides (RSS−). Compared with thiols, a higher acidity is expected for persulfides (1Filipovic M.R. Zivanovic J. Alvarez B. Banerjee R. Chemical biology of H2S signaling through persulfidation.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118 (29112440): 1253-133710.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00205Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In fact, the pKa of 2-[(3-aminopropyl)amino]ethane persulfide was estimated to be 6.2 ± 0.1, which is lower than the pKa of 7.6 ± 0.1 determined for the corresponding thiol (17Everett S.A. Folkes L.K. Wardman P. Asmus K.D. Free-radical repair by a novel perthiol: reversible hydrogen transfer and perthiyl radical formation.Free Radic. Res. 1994; 20: 387-40010.3109/10715769409145638Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The pKa of cumyl persulfide was proposed to be 7 (18Chauvin J.-P.R. Griesser M. Pratt D.A. Hydropersulfides: H-atom transfer agents par excellence.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017; 139 (28419803): 6484-649310.1021/jacs.7b02571Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas the pKa of cumyl thiol is likely to be higher than 10 according to the values for similar thiols (19Serjeant E.P. Dempsey B. Ionisation constants of organic acids in aqueous solution. Pergamon Press, New York1979Google Scholar). The pKa of cysteine persulfide was computationally estimated to be ∼4 units lower than that of the cysteine thiol (3Cuevasanta E. Lange M. Bonanata J. Coitiño E.L. Ferrer-Sueta G. Filipovic M.R. Alvarez B. Reaction of hydrogen sulfide with disulfide and sulfenic acid to form the strongly nucleophilic persulfide.J. Biol.

In contrast to thiols, which possess only nucleophilic character, persulfides also have electrophilic character when protonated. The electrophilicity can be ascribed to both sulfur atoms. If the outer sulfur is attacked by a thiolate, the sulfur is transferred and a new persulfide is formed, constituting a transpersulfidation reaction. If the inner sulfur is attacked, H2S is released and a mixed disulfide is formed. Persulfides have been proposed to be stronger nucleophiles than thiolates. Enhanced reactivities were observed for arylpersulfides compared with arylthiolates toward alkyl halides in organic solvent (20Benaïchouche M. Bosser G. Paris J. Plichon V.

The α effect was first defined as the enhancement of nucleophilicity when the atom adjacent to a nucleophile bears a lone pair of electrons (25Gold V. Glossary of terms used in physical organic chemistry.Pure Appl. Chem. 1983; 55: 1281-137110.1351/pac198355081281Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This definition is ambiguous because the α nucleophile can be compared either with a structural analog (e.g. HOO− and HO−, NH2-NH2 and NH3, and RSS− and RS−) or with a nucleophile of equal basicity, in the context that for several reactions nucleophilicity correlates with Brønsted basicity. Given that the α nucleophile is not always more reactive than the structural analog (26Garver J.M. Gronert S. Bierbaum V.M. Experimental validation of the α-effect in the gas phase.J. Am. Chem.

For this definition to be valid, the α and reference nucleophiles should react by similar mechanisms (29Um I.-H. Im L.-R. Buncel E.

Because of their dual nucleophilic and electrophilic character, persulfides decay in aqueous solution, making their preparation and quantification challenging. Many methods for persulfide determination are either indirect, slow, or unspecific (1Filipovic M.R. Zivanovic J. Alvarez B. Banerjee R. Chemical biology of H2S signaling through persulfidation.Chem.

Nevertheless, because of the reactivity of persulfides, subsequent reactions are likely to happen and affect the yield, calling for a better characterization of the mixtures. Considering that persulfides are involved in biosynthesis and catabolism, and that they play roles in cellular signaling, it is important to better understand their chemical properties. Herein, we studied the formation, acidity, and nucleophilicity of GSSH. A method to quantify GSSH was adapted and subsequently employed to characterize the reaction between GSSG and H2S, providing kinetic and equilibrium constants. The pKa of GSSH was determined, representing the first pKa report for a persulfide formed in biological systems. The nucleophilicity of GSSH toward mBrB, peroxynitrite (ONOOH/ONOO−) 9The term “peroxynitrite” is used in this text for the sum of peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−).

These electrophiles were chosen because there is information available for their reactions with thiols, enabling comparison. In addition, mBrB facilitates monitoring of the reactions by fluorescence, whereas peroxynitrite and H2O2 are biologically relevant oxidants. To understand the molecular basis of the differential reactivity, we performed hybrid quantum-classical (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, QM/MM) calculations for the model pair methanethiolate/methanepersulfide anion (MeS−/MeSS−) toward the same electrophiles. Our results provide the first quantitative study of the nucleophilicity of a persulfide and its comparison with thiols.

GSSG and H2S reacted to form GSH and GSSH, and excess mBrB was added to label H2S, GSH, and GSSH as the derivatized species B-S-B, GS-B, and GSS-B, respectively (Fig. 1A). A peak with a retention time of 7.7 min was ascribed to GSS-B because it disappeared in the presence of the reductant tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and when more mBrB was added, GS-B and B-S-B increased. The peaks corresponding to GSSG, GS-B, and B-S-B were assigned using standards (retention times of 5.8, 7.3, and 9.8 min, respectively) (Fig. 1B). The identities of the four species were confirmed by electrospray ionization MS and MS/MS; the results for GS-B and GSS-B were consistent with a mass increase of 32 Da for the latter (Fig. 1C). Calibration curves at 260 nm for GSSG and at 396 nm for GS-B and B-S-B were performed. Considering that GSS-B and GS-B have the same absorptivity at 396 nm because of the bimane moiety, the calibration curve for GS-B was used to quantify GSS-B.

Importantly, providing scientific information about the benefits of vaccines has not been effective in counteracting anti-vaccination beliefs. Considering this, better identification of those likely to be vaccine hesitant and the underlying attitudes that predict these beliefs are needed to develop more effective strategies to combat anti-vaccination movements. Focusing on parents as the key decision makers in their children’s vaccination, the aim of this study is to better understand the demographic and attitudinal predictors of parental vaccine hesitancy. We recruited 484 parents using Amazon MTurk and queried their attitudes on childhood vaccination, level of education, age, religiosity, political affiliation, trust in medicine, and disgust sensitivity. We found three main demographic predictors for parental vaccine hesitancy: younger age, lower levels of education, and greater religiosity. We also found vaccine hesitant parents to have significantly less trust in physicians and greater disgust sensitivity. These results provide a clearer picture of vaccine hesitant parents and suggest future directions for more targeted research and public health messaging."

Objective To assess the association of e-cigarettes with future abstinence from cigarette and tobacco use. Design Cohort study of US sample, with annual follow-up. Participants US adult (ages 18+) daily cigarette smokers identified at Wave 1 (W1; 2013–14) of the PATH Study, who reported a quit attempt before W2 and completed W3 (n = 2443). Exposures Use of e-cigarettes, pharmacotherapy (including nicotine replacement therapy), or no product for last quit attempt (LQA), and current daily e-cigarette use at W2. Analysis Propensity score matching (PSM) of groups using different methods to quit. Outcome measures 12+ months abstinence at W3 from cigarettes and from all tobacco (including e-cigarettes). 30+ days abstinence at W3 was a secondary outcome. Results Among daily smokers with an LQA, 23.5% used e-cigarettes, 19.3% used pharmacotherapy only (including NRT) and 57.2% used no product. Cigarette abstinence for 12+ months at W3 was ~10% in each group. Half of the cigarette abstainers in the e-cigarette group were using e-cigarettes at W3. Different methods to help quitting had statistically comparable 12+ month cigarette abstinence at W3 (e-cigarettes vs no product: Risk Difference (RD) = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.06; e-cigarettes vs pharmacotherapy: RD = 0.02, 95% CI:-0.04 to 0.09). Likewise, daily e-cigarette users at W2 did not show a cessation benefit over comparable no-e-cigarette users and this finding was robust to sensitivity analyses. Abstinence for 30+ days at W3 was also similar across products. Limitations The frequency of e-cigarette use during the LQA was not assessed, nor was it possible to assess continuous abstinence from the LQA. Conclusion Among US daily smokers who quit cigarettes in 2014–15, use of e-cigarettes in that attempt compared to approved cessation aids or no products showed similar abstinence rates 1–2 years later."

https://openalex.org/W3081936009,"The lack of new antibiotics necessitates the improvement of existing ones, many of which are limited by toxic side effects. Aminoglycosides, antibiotics with excellent activity and low bacterial resistance, are hampered by dose-dependent toxic effects in patients (nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity). High antibiotic concentrations are often required to treat dormant, non-dividing bacteria, though previous studies show that aminoglycosides can be activated against such bacteria by specific metabolites. Here, we employed this mechanism to greatly boost the activity of low concentrations of aminoglycosides against prevalent Gram-negative pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), suggesting that less toxic drug concentrations might be used effectively in patients. We go on to show that this effect improved treatment of biofilms, did not increase aminoglycoside resistance, and was due to the generation of proton-motive force (PMF). By single-cell microscopy, we demonstrate that stationary-phase cells, while non-dividing, actively maintain a growth-arrested state that is not reversed by metabolite addition. Surprisingly, within starved populations, we observed rare cells (3%) that divided without added nutrients. Additionally, we discovered that mannitol could directly protect human kidney cells from aminoglycoside cytotoxicity, independent of the metabolite's effect on bacteria. This work forwards a mechanism-based strategy to improve existing antibiotics by mitigating their toxic side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3082367746,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemics poses a particular challenge to low and middle income countries, making some of them consider the strategy of “vertical confinement”. In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (e.g. age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. Sensitivity analysis shows the 95% confidence interval brackets a order of magnitude in cases or three weeks in time. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy."

This is a cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach, in which 103 undergraduate students answered the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). There is a relationship between chronotype, quality of sleep and anxiety in the investigated population. Evening chronotype students showed higher anxiety status and have poor sleep quality when compared with morning chronotype students. The high occurrence of anxiety levels and poor sleep quality in evening students may be a consequence of high academic demand in a shift incompatible with the phase delay of the circadian timing system of these individuals."

The objective of the present study was to assess the cost effectiveness of various screening strategies for cervical cancer and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination in India. A Markov model based on societal perspective was designed to estimate the lifetime costs and consequences of screening (with either visual inspect with acetic acid (VIA), Papanicolaou test or HPV DNA test at various time intervals) in a hypothetical cohort of 30–65 years age women or vaccination among adolescent girls. Diagnostic accuracy of the screening strategies, efficacy of HPV vaccination and data on transition probabilities was based on the results of the existing meta-analyses. Primary data was collected for assessing per person cost of screening, cost of treating cervical cancer and quality of life. We found that introduction of different screening strategies leads to reduction in lifetime occurrence of cervical cancer cases caused by HPV 16/18 from 20% to 61%, and cervical cancer deaths from 28% to 70%, as compared to no screening. Among various screening strategies, screening with both VIA 5 yearly and VIA 10 yearly came out to be cost effective at 1-time per capita GDP, with VIA every 5 years providing greater health benefits as compared to VIA 10 years. Hence, screening with VIA 5 years at an incremental cost of US$ 829 (INR 54,881) per QALY gained is the recommended strategy for India. Further, with regards to HPV vaccination, it leads to 60% reduction in cancer cases and mortality caused by HPV 16/18 as compared to no vaccination. Moreover, when this vaccinated cohort of adolescent girls is also screened later in their life (with VIA every 10 years and VIA 5 years), it leads to 69%-76% reduction in cancer cases and 71%-81% reduction in cancer deaths. As compared to no vaccination and no screening, both HPV vaccination alone and vaccination plus screening (with VIA every 5 yearly and VIA 10 yearly) appears to be cost effective with ICERs in the range of US$ 86 (INR 5,693) to US$ 476 (INR 31,511) per QALY gained. In the long run, when the cohort of adolescent girls, who were immunized for HPV, reach the age of 30 years, the screening frequency using VIA should be determined based on the coverage of HPV vaccination in that cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3082103924,"The enzyme β-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2) converts carotenoids into more polar metabolites. Studies in mammals, fish, and birds revealed that BCO2 controls carotenoid homeostasis and is involved in the pathway for vitamin A production. However, it is controversial whether BCO2 function is conserved in humans, because of a 4-amino acid long insertion caused by a splice acceptor site polymorphism. We here show that human BCO2 splice variants, BCO2a and BCO2b, are expressed as pre-proteins with mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). The MTS of BCO2a directed a green fluorescent reporter protein to the mitochondria when expressed in ARPE-19 cells. Removal of the MTS increased solubility of BCO2a when expressed in Escherichia coli and rendered the recombinant protein enzymatically active. The expression of the enzymatically active recombinant human BCO2a was further improved by codon optimization and its fusion with maltose-binding protein. Introduction of the 4-amino acid insertion into mouse Bco2 did not impede the chimeric enzyme's catalytic proficiency. We further showed that the chimeric BCO2 displayed broad substrate specificity and converted carotenoids into two ionones and a central C14-apocarotendial by oxidative cleavage reactions at C9,C10 and C9‘,C10‘.

A number of potential mechanisms through which carotenoids can benefit human health have been proposed. The most commonly cited is their ability of acting as antioxidants, e.g. as free radical scavengers, in lipophilic environments such as membranes and lipoproteins (7Krinsky N.I. Johnson E.J.

Five splice variants of human BCO2 have been annotated in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (Gene code 83875) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, it was shown that all human BCO2 variants possess a GKAA insertion that is caused by the use of an alternate donor splice site during mRNA maturation (Fig. 1A) (32Li B. Vachali P.P. Gorusupudi A. Shen Z. Sharifzadeh H. Besch B.M. Nelson K. Horvath M.M. Frederick J.M. Baehr W. Bernstein P.S.

Previously, it was proposed that inactivity of the BCO2a variant results in macular pigment accumulation in the human retina (32Li B. Vachali P.P. Gorusupudi A. Shen Z. Sharifzadeh H. Besch B.M.

Biochemical analysis suggested that recombinant human BCO2 protein is enzymatically inactive when expressed in Escherichia coli (33Dela Seña C. Sun J. Narayanasamy S. Riedl K.M. Yuan Y.

A recombinant macaque BCO2 displays enzymatic activity although the corresponding gene possesses the same splice acceptor site polymorphism as the human gene (23Babino D. Palczewski G.

Additionally, expression of recombinant human BCO2 in a bacterial test system revealed enzymatic activity of recombinant human BCO2s (34Poliakov E. Soucy J. Gentleman S. Rogozin I.B. Redmond T.M.

The current claim that BCO2, a protein evolutionarily conserved because the split between jawed and jawless vertebrates (34Poliakov E. Soucy J. Gentleman S. Rogozin I.B. Redmond T.M.

This claim eliminates an important metabolic pathway for carotenoid homeostasis and vitamin A production in human physiology (25Amengual J. Lobo G.P. Golczak M. Li H.N. Klimova T. Hoppel C.L. Wyss A. Palczewski K. von Lintig J.

The question whether humans encode an enzymatically active BCO2 protein also is of clinical relevance. Many nutritionists and clinicians advocate for higher carotenoid intake because of their beneficial health effects (3Bernstein P.S. Li B. Vachali P.P. Gorusupudi A. Shyam R. Henriksen B.S. Nolan J.M.

The establishment of such recommendations is based on the relationships between carotenoid intake, blood, and tissue concentrations. This relationship is not linear and is influenced by many host and environmental factors (11von Lintig J. Moon J. Lee J. Ramkumar S. Carotenoid metabolism at the intestinal barrier.Biochim. Biophys.

Additionally, excessive accumulation of carotenoids is a risk factor for detrimental health outcomes in smokers in clinical studies (40Omenn G.S. Goodman G. Thornquist M. Grizzle J. Rosenstock L. Barnhart S. Balmes J. Cherniack M.G. Cullen M.R. Glass A. The β-carotene and retinol efficacy trial (CARET) for chemoprevention of lung cancer in high risk populations: smokers and asbestos-exposed workers.Cancer Res. 1994; 54 (8137335): 2038s-2043sPubMed Google Scholar, 41Omenn G.S.

Therefore, we here wished to scrutinize whether humans express an active BCO2 enzyme that can control tissue homeostasis of carotenoids and its metabolites. We focused on the three major splice mRNA variants, encoding, respectively, 579- (BCO2a), 545- (BCO2b), and 539- (BCO2c) amino acid long proteins (Fig. S1). Sequence alignment reveals that these proteins differ in their amino-terminal parts but otherwise share sequence identity, including conserved histidine residues for binding of the cofactor ferrous iron (Fig. S1). Additionally, BCO2c displays a 6-amino acid deletion in the coding region when compared with BCO2a and BCO2b (Fig. S1). We performed RT-PCR analysis with total RNA preparations isolated from retinas of human donor eyes with intron-spanning PCR primer sets. These primer sets were designed to specifically amplify each splice variant of the human BCO2 gene. This analysis detected PCR products for the mRNA splice variants encoding BCO2a and BCO2b in both retinas (Fig. 1A). Under the applied conditions, no PCR product for BCO2c was amplified from the RNA preparations of the retinas of the donor eyes. As controls, RT-PCR products for RHO mRNA encoding rhodopsin, GAPDH encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ACTB encoding β-actin were amplified from the same RNA preparations and resulted in products of the expected sizes (Fig. 1B). We found that mRNAs encoding BCO2a and BCO2b were expressed in the human retina. To test whether they encode functional enzymes, we took advantage of a cell-based assay (42von Lintig J. Vogt K. Filling the gap in vitamin A research: molecular identification of an enzyme cleaving β-carotene to retinal.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (10766819): 11915-1192010.1074/jbc.275.16.11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In this assay, BCO2 and other members of the CCD superfamily are expressed in an E. coli strain, which can synthesize carotenoids. This synthesis is achieved by transformation of the bacteria with plasmids harboring genes for carotenoid synthesis from Erwina uredovora (43Misawa N. Nakagawa M. Kobayashi K. Yamano S. Izawa Y. Nakamura K. Harashima K. Elucidation of the Erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthetic pathway by functional analysis of gene products expressed in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172 (2254247): 6704-671210.1128/jb.172.12.6704-6712.1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The accumulation of zeaxanthin confers a yellow color to the bacteria. Expression of an enzymatically active BCO2 leads to a discoloration of the bacteria because of the cleavage of zeaxanthin into apocarotenoids with blue-shifted spectra and lower absorption coefficient. We employed this assay for the human BCO2a and BCO2b as outlined under “Experimental procedures.” The pellets of the zeaxanthin producing bacteria expressing BCO2a showed a bright yellow color. The pellet of the bacteria expressing BCO2b had a lighter color, indicating an enzymatic turnover of zeaxanthin (Fig. 2A). Zeaxanthin turnover by the BCO2b was confirmed by HPLC analysis (Fig. 2, B and C). In bacteria extracts expressing BCO2b, amounts of β-cryptoxanthin, the direct precursor of zeaxanthin in the carotenoid synthesis pathway, and zeaxanthin were significantly reduced when compared with bacteria expressing BCO2a (Fig. 2, A and B). We previously established an in vitro enzyme assay to measure mouse BCO2 activity with apocarotenoids as substrates (37Kelly M.E. Ramkumar S. Sun W. Colon Ortiz C. Kiser P.D. Golczak M. von Lintig J. The biochemical basis of vitamin A production from the asymmetric carotenoid β-cryptoxanthin.ACS Chem. Biol. 2018; 13 (29883100): 2121-212910.1021/acschembio.8b00290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We now applied this assay to human BCO2s using 3-hydroxy-β-12'-apocarotenal as a substrate. Cleavage of the apocarotenoid by BCO2b results in the formation of 3-hydroxy-β-ionone and 12',10-diapocarotene-12',10-dial (Fig. 3A). HPLC analysis revealed that the incubation of protein extracts containing human BCO2b with this substrate yielded a product that eluted earlier (Fig. 3B, peak 1) than 3-hydroxy-β-12'-apocarotenal (Fig. 3B, peak 2) and displayed spectral characteristics of a C12-apocarotene-dialdehyde (Fig. 3B, peak 1). Additionally, we found a product that eluted later at minute 32 with spectral characteristics of the corresponding di-alcohol (Fig. 3B, peak 4). Identical products were obtained when we incubated recombinant mBCO2 with this substrate (Fig. S2). Incubation of human BCO2a with the apocarotenoid did not result in product formation (Fig. 3B). However, we observed an increase of a peak, which resembled a cis-diastereomer of 3-hydroxy-β-12'-apocarotenal. The putative cis-diastereomer was present at lower amounts when we incubated the substrate in buffer alone (Fig. 3B, peak 3). Therefore, we cannot exclude that it is formed by thermal isomerization during the incubation process. In a previous study, a single 63-kDa BCO2 protein was detected by Western blotting analysis of the human retina protein extracts, likely corresponding to the 579-amino acid long BCO2a (32Li B. Vachali P.P. Gorusupudi A. Shen Z. Sharifzadeh H. Besch B.M. Nelson K. Horvath M.M. Frederick J.M. Baehr W. Bernstein P.S.

In the mouse retina, a 60-kDa BCO2 protein was detected corresponding to the 532-amino acid long murine BCO2 protein (32Li B. Vachali P.P. Gorusupudi A. Shen Z. Sharifzadeh H. Besch B.M. Nelson K.

However, no controls were included in this study to validate the specificity of the commercial antibody. We and others previously showed that BCO2 is highly expressed in the liver (35Palczewski G. Amengual J. Hoppel C.L. von Lintig J. Evidence for compartmentalization of mammalian carotenoid metabolism.FASEB J. 2014; 28 (25002123): 4457-446910.1096/fj.14-252411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 44Lindqvist A. He Y.G.

Therefore, we used hepatic protein extracts from WT mice and mice deficient for BCO2 or its closely related BCO1 homolog to validate the commercial antibody. Surprisingly, the antibody detected a band of approximately 50 kDa, independent of the BCO2 genotype of the mouse livers (Fig. S3A). Thus, we next tested it against recombinant BCO2 protein expressed in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W3082137397,"A unilateral transfemoral amputation (TFA) has a major impact on function. A leg-length discrepancy is the primary structural change, accompanied by the loss of lower-limb muscle volume and function. Prostheses can help individuals with a TFA to regain function, but such individuals still do not reach the functional level of unimpaired peers and exhibit gait deviations. This study gives insight into the causality between residual limb strength and gait deviations in individuals with a TFA.A convenient sample of 13 male individuals with a TFA (38.0 ± 12.6y; 179.7cm ± 6.5cm; 82.9kg ± 12.4kg) was recruited for this study. One participant with TFA was excluded, as he differed from the rest of the cohort, in residual limb length and the use of walking aids. A cohort of 18 unimpaired subjects served as a reference group (REF; nine females; 44y ± 13y; 174cm ± 9cm; 71kg ± 12kg). All participants underwent a conventional clinical gait analysis using a marker based 3D motion capture system and force platforms. Kinematics and kinetics were determined utilizing standard modelling methods. All subjects underwent a strength test, using a custom-made device to determine isometric moments of the hip joint in abduction, adduction, extension, and flexion. Peak values for maximum isometric moments for each movement direction and selected kinematic and kinetic values were derived from the results. Differences between subjects with TFA and unimpaired were compared using a Mann-Whitney U Test and associations between groups by Spearman's rank correlation.The participants with a TFA showed a significantly lower maximum isometric moment for hip abduction (0.85 vs. 1.41 Nm/kg p < .001), adduction (0.87 vs. 1.37 Nm/kg p = .001) and flexion (0.93 vs. 1.63 Nm/kg p = .010) compared to the reference group. Typically reported gait deviations in people with a TFA were identified, i.e. significant lower cadence and increased step width. We further identified altered coronal plane hip and trunk kinematics, with significantly higher ranges of motion during involved side stance-phase. Gait kinetics of individuals with a TFA showed significantly lower peak values during stance for hip abduction, adduction and extension moments in comparison to the reference group. We identified a moderate negative correlation between maximum isometric moment for hip abduction and trunk obliquity range of motion (ρ = -0.45) for participants with a TFA, which was not significant (p = 0.14).We showed that there are strength deficits in individuals with TFA and, that there are moderate correlations between gait deviations, i.e. lateral trunk lean during involved side stance and isometric hip abductor moment. The relation between maximum moments during gait and the corresponding maximum isometric moment may therefore be helpful to detect strength related compensation mechanisms. However, the moderate, non-significant correlation between lateral trunk lean and isometric hip abductor moment was the only one which corresponded directly to a gait deviation. Thus results must be interpreted with care. This study suggests that gait deviations in individuals with TFA are multifactorial and cannot be exclusively explained by their strength deficits. Future studies should explore the relationship between strength with kinematics and kinetics during gait in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3081758021,"The effects of electronic media use on health has received much attention but less is known about links with academic performance. This study prospectively examines the effect of media use on academic performance in late childhood.1239 8- to 9-year-olds and their parents were recruited to take part in a prospective, longitudinal study. Academic performance was measured on a national achievement test at baseline and 10-11 years of age. Parents reported on their child's duration of electronic media use.After control for baseline reading, watching more than two hours of television per day at 8-9 years of age predicted a 12-point lower performance in reading at 10-11 years, equivalent to the loss of a third of a year in learning. Using a computer for more than one hour a day predicted a similar 12-point lower numeracy performance. Regarding cross-sectional associations (presumed to capture short-term effects) of media use on numeracy, after controlling for prior media exposure, watching more than two hours of television per day at 10-11 years was concurrently associated with a 12-point lower numeracy score and using a computer for more than one hour per day with a 13-point lower numeracy performance. There was little evidence for concurrent effects on reading. There was no evidence of short- or long-term associations between videogame use and academic performance.Cumulative television use is associated with poor reading and cumulative computer use with poorer numeracy. Beyond any links between heavy media use and health risks such as obesity, physical activity and mental health, these findings raise a possibility of additional risks of both television and computer use for learning in mid-childhood. These findings carry implications for parents, teachers and clinicians to consider the type and timing of media exposure in developing media plans for children."
https://openalex.org/W3082451570,"Water hyacinth has been progressively advanced in Lake Tana since 2011 and covered vast areas of the lakeshore. The aim of this study was to assess how the lakeshore covered by the weed mats affected the socioeconomic of the local community. The study was based on a survey of 405 households, 8 group discussions and interviews of 15 key informants conducted from January to March 2018. The results revealed that crop production, livestock feed supply, water supply, fishing, the health of local people and livestock were impacted negatively by the infestation of water hyacinth. The range of socioeconomic problems caused by the weed generally implied the real impacts on the lives of local communities and national economic development. The efforts made to control water hyacinth has costed huge labor and financial resources. The results revealed that close to 800,000 human labor dedicated to manual removal of the weed from 2012 to 2018 and above one million USD spent for procurement of harvester machines and bioagent experiments. In spite of the devotion of huge labor and spending of a lot of money, the expansion of the weed has not controlled. Poor coordination of controlling efforts, dumping of harvested dense mats of the weed in the lakeshore, lack of genuine participation of the local people are principal factors for the failure of the controlling efforts A coordination of various stakeholders thus is needed to make eradicating methods more effective. Other alternative options should also be considered to control the weed expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3082055017,"Patients with high serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels could be considered as presenting with dysutilization of iron for erythropoiesis. However, the long-term safety of iron administration in these patients has not been well established. An observational multicenter study was performed over 3 years. In 805 patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), we defined dysutilization of iron for erythropoiesis in patients with lower TSAT (<20%) and higher ferritin (≥100 ng/mL) levels. A time-dependent Cox hazard model was used for the evaluation of the association between dysutilization of iron for erythropoiesis and adverse events and survival. Patients with low TSAT levels showed an increased risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease (CCVD) and death compared to patients with normal or higher TSAT levels. Patients with low ferritin and high TSAT levels had a significantly lower risk of CCVD and death compared with patients with high ferritin and low TSAT levels. Higher TSAT levels were associated with male gender, age, the absence of diabetes, low levels of high-sensitivity CRP, and low β2 microglobulin levels, but not with intravenous iron administration or ferritin levels. Although patients with low TSAT levels had a significantly higher risk of CCVD or death, high TSAT levels were not linked with iron administration. Patients, who were suspected of dysutilization of iron for erythropoiesis, had a higher risk of CCVD and death. The administration of iron should be performed cautiously for improving TSAT levels, as iron administration could sustain TSAT levels for a short term."
https://openalex.org/W3082394056,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended during valproic acid (VPA) use, and total serum concentration has been widely adopted. However, the free form of VPA is responsible for its pharmacologic and toxic effects, and the total and free concentrations are highly discordant because of VPA's highly protein bound and saturable binding characteristics. Therefore, free VPA monitoring is increasingly advocated. Nevertheless, the correlation between free VPA concentration and associated adverse effects remains unknown.To determine the optimal safety range of free VPA concentration in adult patients.This prospective cohort study enrolled adult patients undergoing VPA therapy with TDM. Patient characteristics, VPA use, and adverse effects (thrombocytopenia, hyperammonemia, and hepatotoxicity) were recorded. A multivariate logistic regression model was applied to identify the predictors of adverse effects, and the receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to locate the cutoff point of free VPA concentration.A total of 98 free serum concentrations from 51 patients were included for final analysis. In total, 31 (31.6%), 27 (27.6%), and 4 (4.1%) episodes of hyperammonemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity were observed, respectively. Free VPA concentration was a predicting factor for thrombocytopenia but not for hyperammonemia. A free VPA concentration of >14.67 mcg/mL had the greatest discriminating power (area under the curve = 0.77) for the occurrence of thrombocytopenia.A free VPA serum concentration of 14.67 mcg/mL had the optimal discriminating power for the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. Ammonemia should be monitored even if free VPA concentration is within the safety range."
https://openalex.org/W3082588834,"Short tandemly repeated DNA sequences, termed microsatellites, are abundant in the human genome. These microsatellites exhibit length instability and susceptibility to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) due to their tendency to form stable non-B DNA structures. Replication-dependent microsatellite DSBs are linked to genome instability signatures in human developmental diseases and cancers. To probe the causes and consequences of microsatellite DSBs, we designed a dual-fluorescence reporter system to detect DSBs at expanded (CTG/CAG) n and polypurine/polypyrimidine (Pu/Py) mirror repeat structures alongside the c-myc replication origin integrated at a single ectopic chromosomal site. Restriction cleavage near the (CTG/CAG)100 microsatellite leads to homology-directed single-strand annealing between flanking AluY elements and reporter gene deletion that can be detected by flow cytometry. However, in the absence of restriction cleavage, endogenous and exogenous replication stressors induce DSBs at the (CTG/CAG)100 and Pu/Py microsatellites. DSBs map to a narrow region at the downstream edge of the (CTG)100 lagging-strand template. (CTG/CAG) n chromosome fragility is repeat length-dependent, whereas instability at the (Pu/Py) microsatellites depends on replication polarity. Strikingly, restriction-generated DSBs and replication-dependent DSBs are not repaired by the same mechanism. Knockdown of DNA damage response proteins increases (Rad18, polymerase (Pol) η, Pol κ) or decreases (Mus81) the sensitivity of the (CTG/CAG)100 microsatellites to replication stress. Replication stress and DSBs at the ectopic (CTG/CAG)100 microsatellite lead to break-induced replication and high-frequency mutagenesis at a flanking thymidine kinase gene. Our results show that non-B structure-prone microsatellites are susceptible to replication-dependent DSBs that cause genome instability."
https://openalex.org/W3081956046,"Highly exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals present a unique setting to study mechanisms of protection against HIV acquisition. As natural killer (NK) cell activation and function have been implicated as a correlate of protection in HESN individuals, we sought to better understand the features of NK cells that may confer protection. We used mass cytometry to phenotypically profile NK cells from a cohort of Beninese sex workers and healthy controls. We found that NK cells from HESN women had increased expression of NKG2A, NKp30 and LILRB1, as well as the Fc receptor CD16, and decreased expression of DNAM-1, CD94, Siglec-7, and NKp44. Using functional assessments of NK cells from healthy donors against autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, we observed that NKp30+ and Siglec-7+ cells had improved functional activity. Further, we found that NK cells from HESN women trended towards increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity; this activity correlated with increased CD16 expression. Overall, we identify features of NK cells in HESN women that may contribute to protection from HIV infection. Follow up studies with larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3082593755,"Large predators play important ecological roles, yet many are disproportionately imperiled. In marine systems, artificial reefs are often deployed to restore degraded reefs or supplement existing reefs, but it remains unknown whether these interventions benefit large predators. Comparative field surveys of thirty artificial and natural reefs across ~200 km of the North Carolina, USA coast revealed large reef-associated predators were more dense on artificial than natural reefs. This pattern was associated with higher densities of transient predators (e.g. jacks, mackerel, barracuda, sharks) on artificial reefs, but not of resident predators (e.g., grouper, snapper). Further analyses revealed that this pattern of higher transient predator densities on artificial reefs related to reef morphology, as artificial reefs composed of ships hosted higher transient predator densities than concrete reefs. The strength of the positive association between artificial reefs and transient predators increased with a fundamental habitat trait–vertical extent. Taller artificial reefs had higher densities of transient predators, even when accounting for habitat area. A global literature review of high trophic level fishes on artificial and natural habitats suggests that the overall pattern of more predators on artificial habitats is generalizable. Together, these findings provide evidence that artificial habitats, especially those like sunken ships that provide high vertical structure, may support large predators."
https://openalex.org/W3082130614,"Despite rapid macro-economic growth, one-third of the global burden of childhood stunting is contributed by India. This burden is characterized by wide-spread geographical variation within the country. This paper explores two research questions: (i) are the drivers of severe and moderate stunting similar? (ii) differential endowments or policy-effect, how do community-level nutrition and sanitary practices affect inter-state differences? Using data from Indian National Family and Health Survey 4, 2015–16, six states holding different ranks in the stunting continuum are compared to Tamil Nadu, taken as the benchmark state due to its laudable performance in the health care sector. Applying quantile regression approaches, the difference in state-level performance is decomposed into detailed covariate effects (differential endowments) and coefficient effects (differential strength of association between the drivers and outcome). The explanatory variables are not similarly associated with severe and moderate stunting. Decomposition results demonstrate a significant role of community-level sanitation practices compared to child nutrition behaviour in explaining the inter-state disparity. Coefficient effects play a dominant role in the lower tail of HAZ distribution for the poor performing states indicating that the worse outcomes of these states are due to weaker policy effects of the control variables on stunting. Multi-sectoral approach, identification and differentiation between severe and moderate stunting cases can be more instrumental in managing and reducing the scourge. This paper also advocates the potential benefits of customizing centrally-launched policies as per the state’s performance and introducing the concept coproduction in the existing nutrition and health policy framework. This will instigate a feeling of ownership of the problem of childhood stunting among the policy consumers and strengthen the influence of policies on the outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3081754359,"Postural control is the ability to maintain equilibrium and orientation in a gravitational environment. Patients with chronic subjective dizziness have some troubles with their postural stability. The present study aimed to assess the benefit of home-based vestibular rehabilitation in patients with chronic subjective dizziness using computerized dynamic posturography. Therefore, 100 subjects, between 19 to 86 years, diagnosed with dizziness were included in the study. Computerized dynamic posturography was performed to assess postural stability. Vestibular rehabilitation programs included exercises tailored to the particular needs of each patient. After vestibular rehabilitation, patients were re-examined using the same tests. Posturographic data were analyzed and compared for before and after vestibular rehabilitation findings. The mean composite scores before the intervention (58,92 ±11,64) was significantly (p<0.01) lower than the mean composite scores after vestibular rehabilitation (73,83 ± 8,26). This result is found to be statistically significant. In conclusion it could be suggested that the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation could be verified by means of computerized dynamic posturography as a concrete method."
https://openalex.org/W3082508705,"SERINC5 is a multipass intrinsic membrane protein that suppresses HIV-1 infectivity when incorporated into budding virions. The HIV-1 Nef virulence factor prevents viral incorporation of SERINC5 by triggering its down-regulation from the producer cell membrane through an AP-2–dependent endolysosomal pathway. However, the mechanistic basis for SERINC5 down-regulation by Nef remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that Nef homodimers are important for SERINC5 down-regulation, trafficking to late endosomes, and exclusion from newly synthesized viral particles. Based on previous X-ray crystal structures, we mutated three conserved residues in the Nef dimer interface (Leu<sup>112</sup>, Tyr<sup>115</sup>, and Phe<sup>121</sup>) and demonstrated attenuated homodimer formation in a cell-based fluorescence complementation assay. Point mutations at each position reduced the infectivity of HIV-1 produced from transfected 293T cells, the Jurkat TAg T-cell line, and donor mononuclear cells in a SERINC5-dependent manner. In SERINC5-transfected 293T cells, virion incorporation of SERINC5 was increased by dimerization-defective Nef mutants, whereas down-regulation of SERINC5 from the membrane of transfected Jurkat cells by these mutants was significantly reduced. Nef dimer interface mutants also failed to trigger internalization of SERINC5 and localization to Rab7<sup>+</sup> late endosomes in T cells. Importantly, fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that dimerization-defective Nef mutants retained interaction with both SERINC5 and AP-2. These results show that down-regulation of SERINC5 and subsequent enhancement of viral infectivity require Nef homodimers and support a mechanism by which the Nef dimer bridges SERINC5 to AP-2 for endocytosis. Pharmacological disruption of Nef homodimers may control HIV-1 infectivity and viral spread by enhancing virion incorporation of SERINC5."
https://openalex.org/W3081789443,"Haematological toxicities occur in patients receiving oxaliplatin. Mild anaemia (grade 1-2) is a common side effect and approximately 90% of recipients develop measurable spleen enlargement. Although generally asymptomatic, oxaliplatin-induced splenomegaly is independently associated with complications following liver resection for colorectal liver metastasis and separately with poorer patient outcomes. Here, we investigated oxaliplatin-induced haematological toxicities and splenomegaly in mice treated with escalating dosages comparable to those prescribed to colorectal cancer patients.Blood was analysed, and smears assessed using Wright-Giemsa staining. Paw coloration was quantified as a marker of anaemia. Spleen weight and morphology were assessed for abnormalities relating to splenomegaly and a flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine array assessment was performed on splenocytes. The liver was assessed for sinusoidal obstructive syndrome.Blood analysis showed dose dependent decreases in white and red blood cell counts, and significant changes in haematological indices. Front and hind paws exhibited dose dependent and dramatic discoloration indicative of anaemia. Spleen weight was significantly increased indicating splenomegaly, and red pulp tissue exhibited substantial dysplasia. Cytokines and chemokines within the spleen were significantly affected with temporal upregulation of IL-6, IL-1α and G-CSF and downregulation of IL-1β, IL-12p40, MIP-1β, IL-2 and RANTES. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated alterations in splenocyte populations, including a significant reduction in CD45+ cells. Histological staining of the liver showed no evidence of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome but there were signs suggestive of extramedullary haematopoiesis.Chronic oxaliplatin treatment dose dependently induced haematological toxicity and splenomegaly characterised by numerous physiological and morphological changes, which occurred independently of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3019127311,"When trying to identify new potential therapeutic protein targets, access to data and knowledge is increasingly important. In a field where new resources and data sources become available every day, it is crucial to be able to take a step back and look at the wider picture in order to identify potential drug targets. While this task is routinely performed by bespoke literature searches, it is often time-consuming and lacks uniformity when comparing multiple targets at one time. To address this challenge, we developed TargetDB, a tool that aggregates public information available on given target(s) (links to disease, safety, 3D structures, ligandability, novelty, etc.) and assembles it in an easy to read output ready for the researcher to analyze. In addition, we developed a target scoring system based on the desirable attributes of good therapeutic targets and machine learning classification system to categorize novel targets as having promising or challenging tractrability. In this manuscript, we present the methodology used to develop TargetDB as well as test cases."

PPIX-ED potently inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inducing reactive oxygen species production via photoactivation. Atomic force microscopy revealed that PPIX-ED-PACT induced the leakage of bacterial content by degrading the bacterial membrane and wall. As revealed using acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, PPIX-ED-PACT altered the permeability of the bacterial membrane. In addition, the antibacterial effect of PPIX-ED-PACT was demonstrated in an in vivo model of P. aeruginosa-infected wounds. PPIX-ED (100 μM) decreased the number of P. aeruginosa colony-forming units by 4.2 log10. Moreover, histological analysis illustrated that the wound healing rate was 98% on day 14 after treatment, which was 10% higher than that in the control group. According to the present findings, PPIX-ED-PACT can effectively inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro and in vivo."

However, device-based assessment of PA and sedentary time (ST) in people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has not been deeply investigated.Analysis and comparison of weekend and weekdays PA and ST using multiple accelerometers in people with AIS with different curvature severity compared to healthy controls.24 participants with AIS divided into 2 groups of 12 with Cobb angles < 40° and > 40°, along with 12 age and BMI matched healthy controls. Daily PA and ST during four consecutive days were measured using four tri-axial accelerometers. Clinical functional assessment was performed using the scoliosis research society (SRS-22) questionnaire.The combined weekend and weekdays average daily step count was found to be 22% and 29% lower in the AIS groups with Cobb angle < 40° and > 40°, respectively, compared to the controls. The average ST was also reported to be 5% and 7% higher in the AIS groups with Cobb angle < 40° and > 40°, respectively, compared to the controls. The reported differences were significant in the AIS group with higher Cobb angle (p≤0.05). No significant differences in PA or ST were reported between the AIS groups based on curvature severity.Decreased PA and increased ST observed in patients with AIS may have long term health implications and may play a role in the disease process.

https://openalex.org/W3082417523,"Background Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) have been used to assess the clinical competence of medical students for decades. Limited data are available on the factors that predict students’ performance on the OSCEs. The aim of our study was to evaluate the factors predicting performance on the pediatrics final OSCE, including the timing of students’ clerkship and their performance on the in-training OSCE and written examinations. Methods Grades in pediatrics for 3 consecutive academic years (2013–2016) were included. The average scores of the in-training OSCEs, written and final OSCEs and written exams were compared among the three years using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The correlations between performance on the final OSCEs and the in-training OSCEs, in-training written exams and final written exams were studied using Spearman’s Rho correlation test. The effect of the timing of the clerkship on the final OSCE performance was evaluated. Results A total of 286 students’ records were included. There were 115 male students and 171 female students (M:F 1:1.5). There were strong positive correlations between students’ performance on the in-training examinations (OSCE and written) and the final OSCE (correlation coefficients of 0.508 and 0.473, respectively). The final written exam scores were positively correlated with the final OSCEs (r = 0.448). There was no significant effect of the timing of the clerkship. Conclusions Students’ performance on in-training examinations might predict their final OSCE scores. Thus, it is important to provide students with the necessary intervention at an early stage to reduce failure rates. The final OSCE performance does not seem to be affected by the timing of the clerkship."

Multilevel-linear-regressions examined associations between weekend and weekday steps and Moderate to Vigorous PA (MVPA), residential built environment factors, and housing tenure status as a proxy for socio-economic position.A one-unit decrease in walkability was associated with 135 (95% CI [28; 242]) fewer steps and 1.2 (95% CI [0.3; 2.1]) fewer minutes of MVPA on weekend days, compared with little difference in steps and minutes of MVPA observed on weekdays. A 1km-increase in distance to the nearest local park was associated with 597 (95% CI [161; 1032]) more steps and 4.7 (95% CI [1.2; 8.2]) more minutes of MVPA on weekend days; 84 fewer steps (95% CI [-253;420]) and 0.3 fewer minutes of MVPA (95%CI [-2.3, 3.0]) on weekdays. Lower public transport accessibility was associated with increased steps on a weekday (767 steps, 95%CI [-13,1546]) compared with fewer steps on weekend days (608 fewer steps, 95% CI [-44, 1658]). None of the associations between built environment factors and PA on either weekend or weekdays were modified by socio-economic status. However, socio-economic differences in PA related moderately to socio-economic disparities in PA-promoting features of the residential neighbourhood.The residential built environment is associated with PA differently at weekends and on weekdays, and contributes moderately to socio-economic differences in PA."
https://openalex.org/W3081695602,"Aim Our aim was to determine if synergy weights and activations are altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and if these alterations could be linked to muscle weakness. Methods In 22 children with DMD and 22 typical developing (TD) children of a similar age, surface electromyography (sEMG) of the gluteus medius, rectus femoris (REF), medial hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius (GAS) were recorded during gait. Muscle weakness was assessed with maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC). Synergies were calculated with non-negative matrix factorization. The number of synergies explaining ≥90% of the variance in the sEMG signals (N90), were extracted and grouped with k-means cluster analysis. We verified differences in weights with a Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical non-parametric mapping (Hotelling's T2 test and two-tailed t-test) was used to assess group differences in synergy activations. We used Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and canonical correlation analysis to assess if weakness was related to modifications in weights and activations, respectively. Results For both groups, average N90 was three. In synergy one, characterized by activity at the beginning of stance, the DMDs showed an increased REF weight (p = 0.001) and decreased GAS weight (p = 0.007). Synergy activations were similar, with only a small difference detected in mid-swing in the combined activations (p<0.001). Weakness was not associated with these differences. Conclusion Despite the apparent weakness in DMD, synergy weights and activations were similar between the two groups. Our findings are in line with previous research suggesting non-neural alterations have limited influence on muscle synergies."

Two forms of DGAT, DGAT1 and DGAT2, are thought to contribute to the formation of seed oil, and previous characterizations of various DGAT2 enzymes indicate that these often are associated with the incorporation of unusual fatty acids. However, the basis of DGAT2's acyl-donor specificity is not known because of the inherent challenges of predicting structural features of integral membrane enzymes. The recent characterization of DGAT2 enzymes from Brassica napus reveals that DGAT2 enzymes with similar amino acid sequences exhibit starkly contrasting acyl-donor specificities. Here we have designed and biochemically tested a range of chimeric enzymes, substituting parts of these B. napus DGAT2 enzymes with each other, allowing us to pinpoint a region that dramatically affects the specificity toward 22:1-CoA. It may thus be possible to redesign the acyl-donor specificity of DGAT2 enzymes, potentially altering the fatty acid composition of seed oil. Further, the characterization of a DGAT2 chimera between Arabidopsis and B. napus demonstrates that the specificity regulated by this region is transferrable across species.

Oilseeds produce large quantities of triacylglycerol (TAG), which accumulates in the seed oil during seed development. The seed oil constitutes a highly condensed carbon and energy storage dedicated to the emerging seedling during seed germination (1Baud S. Lepiniec L. Physiological and developmental regulation of seed oil production.Prog. Lipid Res. 2010; 49 (20102727): 235-24910.1016/j.plipres.2010.01.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).

The Kennedy pathway outlines the assembly of a wide range of lipids, including the acyl-CoA–dependent formation of TAG. Acyltransferases in the Kennedy pathway utilize acyl-CoA substrates and are responsible for the sequential acylation of a glycerol backbone (3Kennedy E.P. Biosynthesis of complex lipids.Fed. Proc. 1961; 20 (14455159): 934-940PubMed Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is the sole enzyme committed to TAG assembly in the Kennedy pathway and catalyzes the formation of TAG from diacylglycerol (DAG) and acyl-CoA. An additional acyltransferase, phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, is involved in seed oil accumulation. Phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase catalyzes the acyl-CoA–independent formation of TAG and utilizes an acyl moiety from PC to acylate DAG into TAG (4Dahlqvist A. Ståhl U. Lenman M. Banas A.

Tung tree DGAT1 and DGAT2 have nonredundant functions in triacylglycerol biosynthesis and are localized to different subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum.Plant Cell. 2006; 18 (16920778): 2294-231310.1105/tpc.106.043695Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Enzymes of the DGAT1 isoform are generally constituted by longer polypeptide chains than DGAT2 (7Yen C.-L.E. Stone S.J. Koliwad S. Harris C. Farese Jr., R.V. Thematic review series: glycerolipids. DGAT enzymes and triacylglycerol biosynthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49 (18757836): 2283-230110.1194/jlr.R800018-JLR200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Further, predictions usually indicate that DGAT1 polypeptide sequences contain more transmembrane helices than DGAT2, between 6 and 9 compared with 1 or 2 (8Turchetto-Zolet A.C.

There is no resemblance between the DNA or amino acid sequences of DGAT1 and DGAT2 isoforms, and they are thus probably the result of convergent evolution (8Turchetto-Zolet A.C.

DGAT2, first identified in an oleaginous fungus, Mortierella ramanniana (Möller) Linnem, has since been identified in a wide range of plant species (14Lardizabal K.D. Mai J.T. Wagner N.W. Wyrick A.

Several plant DGAT2 enzymes are capable of incorporating unusual FAs into TAG as has been demonstrated with DGAT2 enzymes from, for example, castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) and the tung tree (Vernicia fordii (Hemsl.) Airy Shaw) (6Shockey J.M. Gidda S.K. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.-C. Dhanoa P.K. Bland J.M. Rothstein S.J. Mullen R.T. Dyer J.M.

Castor bean produces a seed oil rich in hydroxy FAs (HFAs). Arabidopsis seed oil is devoid of HFA, but the concurrent expression of castor bean DGAT2 and a castor bean fatty acid hydroxylase in transgenic Arabidopsis, where the hydroxylase modifies FAs into HFAs and the DGAT2 enzyme incorporates the HFAs into TAG, results in ample amounts of HFA in the seed oil, up to 30 mol%. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the hydroxylase alone produces a seed oil containing approximately half of that amount of HFA, 17 mol%, which demonstrate the significant impact DGAT2 enzymes may have on seed oil FA composition (15Burgal J. Shockey J. Lu C. Dyer J. Larson T. Graham I. Browse J. Metabolic engineering of hydroxy fatty acid production in plants: RcDGAT2 drives dramatic increases in ricinoleate levels in seed oil.Plant Biotechnol.

The substrate specificity of DGAT2 enzymes is therefore of great importance because it may significantly affect the TAG FA composition. The apparent capability of these DGAT2 to incorporate unusual FAs into TAG is of high interest because many unusual FAs are suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. The folding structure of DGAT2 is, to a large extent, yet unknown because of the huge challenges presented by purification, crystallization, and the prediction of integral proteins structure (16Little D.

To our knowledge, no prior studies have focused on sequence motifs affecting the substrate specificity in DGAT2. Functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DGAT2 orthologue, Dga1p, reveal the importance of two motifs: YFP and HPHG (depicted by their amino acid presence). Mutations in either of the two motifs abolish the DGAT enzymatic activity. EPHS substitutes the HPHG motif in plant-derived DGAT2 orthologues. Many plant-derived DGAT2 orthologues are functional when expressed in recombinant yeast despite harboring the EPHS motif, yet a substitution of HPHG with EPHS in the yeast Dga1p renders an inactive enzyme (21Liu Q.

Concepts to produce novel designed oil qualities in oil crops have often resulted in plants with impaired oil content or suboptimal levels of the desired FAs in the seed oil. Some of these discouraging attempts may be, at least in part, caused by incompatibility between the desired FAs and the substrate specificity of acyltransferases or other enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Crambe (Crambe hispanica subsp. abyssinica (Hochst. ex R.E.Fr.) Prina) seed oil contains ∼60% of erucic acid, but an even higher amount is desirable (22Li X. van Loo E.N. Gruber J. Fan J. Guan R. Frentzen M. Stymne S. Zhu L.H. Development of ultra-high erucic acid oil in the industrial oil crop Crambe abyssinica.Plant Biotechnol.

An ambitious strategy with three distinct approaches, all aiming at increasing the erucic acid content in the seed oil, resulted in less than optimal results (23Ortiz R. Geleta M. Gustafsson C. Lager I. Hofvander P. Löfstedt C. Cahoon E.B. Minina E. Bozhkov P. Stymne S. Oil crops for the future.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2020; 56 (31982290): 181-18910.1016/j.pbi.2019.12.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The strategy implemented to increase the erucic acid content in crambe includes the introduction of a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase from Limnanthes douglasii R. Br., capable of using 22:1-CoA as substrate (22Li X. van Loo E.N. Gruber J. Fan J. Guan R. Frentzen M. Stymne S. Zhu L.H.

The strategy also includes the introduction of a Brassica napus L. elongase capable of producing erucic acid from 18:1 and an RNAi targeting a Δ12 desaturase that competes with the elongase for the 18:1 precursor (22Li X. van Loo E.N. Gruber J. Fan J. Guan R. Frentzen M. Stymne S. Zhu L.H. Development of ultra-high erucic acid oil in the industrial oil crop Crambe abyssinica.Plant Biotechnol.

Transgenic crambe achieves a significant increase of di-22:1-DAG with these three components working in concert, yet additional bottlenecks seem to hamper significant increases in trierucin (24Guan R. Lager I. Li X. Stymne S. Zhu L.H. Bottlenecks in erucic acid accumulation in genetically engineered ultrahigh erucic acid Crambe abyssinica.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2014; 12 (24119222): 193-20310.1111/pbi.12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Studies of the crambe DGAT specificities indicate that these, especially the DGAT2 forms, are unsuitable for the synthesis of trierucin because of their substrate specificity (25Jeppson S. Demski K. Carlsson A.S. Zhu L.-H. Banaś A. Stymne S. Lager I. Crambe hispanica subsp. abyssinica diacylglycerol acyltransferase specificities towards diacylglycerols and acyl-CoA reveal combinatorial effects that greatly affect enzymatic activity and specificity.Front. Plant Sci. 2019; 10 (31798607): 144210.3389/fpls.2019.01442Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of acyltransferases involved in the synthesis of lipids is therefore critical and must be taken into consideration while attempting to introduce a novel FA composition in seed oil. A recent study of B. napus DGAT includes in vitro assays of Bna.DGAT2 using a broad range of acyl-CoA and di-caproyl-DAG (di-6:0-DAG) as substrates (26Demski K. Jeppson S. Lager I. Misztak A. Jasieniecka-Gazarkiewicz K. Waleron M. Stymne S. Banaś A. Isoforms of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase2 differ substantially in their specificities toward erucic acid.Plant Physiol. 2019; 181 (31619508): 1468-147910.1104/pp.19.01129Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All four investigated Bna.DGAT2 forms exhibit high specificity toward 18:3-CoA, and two of them also have a high specificity toward 22:1-CoA. The two forms that are highly specific toward 18:3-CoA, henceforth denoted as 18:3-CoA–specific, have highly similar amino acid sequences, as have the two other forms, specific to both 18:3-CoA and 22:1-CoA, henceforth denoted as 22:1-CoA–accepting. The two groups share 98% amino acid sequence identity within their respective group and 78–80% between the two groups (26Demski K. Jeppson S. Lager I. Misztak A. Jasieniecka-Gazarkiewicz K. Waleron M. Stymne S. Banaś A. Isoforms of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase2 differ substantially in their specificities toward erucic acid.Plant Physiol. 2019; 181 (31619508): 1468-147910.1104/pp.19.01129Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). B. napus is amphidiploid and contains two genomes, genome A (2n = 20) from Brassica rapa L. and C (2n = 18) from Brassica oleracea L. (27Chalhoub B. Denoeud F. Liu S. Parkin I.A.P. Tang H. Wang X.

The DGAT2 genes of B. napus are thus homoeologues (28Glover N.M. Redestig H. Dessimoz C. Homoeologs: what are they and how do we infer them?.Trends Plant Sci. 2016; 21 (27021699): 609-62110.1016/j.tplants.2016.02.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Sun F.

The B. napus genome was recently reannotated, and the DGAT2 genes are now reported to reside on four individual chromosomes A1, A3, C1, and C7 according to NCBI, whereas the previous annotation positioned all of them in A chromosomes. Each ancestral genome, A and C, harbor one DGAT2 of each specificity type: 18:3-CoA–specific and 22:1-CoA–accepting. Despite the recent reannotation, the genes and enzymes maintain the nomenclature from the previous publication to ensure consistency. The Bna.DGAT2 genes and corresponding enzymes are named according to Ref. 30Østergaard L. King G.J. Standardized gene nomenclature for the Brassica genus.Plant Methods. 2008; 4 (18492252): 1010.1186/1746-4811-4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar. The gene nomenclature within Brassica species is standardized. Genes derived from B. napus start with Bna, followed by a capital letter indicating their genomic ancestry: A, C, or X (for unknown). The terminology also includes the gene name and locus denomination. Hence, the gene BnaA.DGAT2.b is the full name for a DGAT2 gene from B. napus that resides on a chromosome from the ancestral A genome at locus b. The two groups of DGAT2 in B. napus with similar amino acid sequences and highly distinct substrate specificities provide an excellent opportunity for studies of DGAT2 acyl-CoA substrate specificity motifs. Here, a yeast strain incapable of producing TAG, H1246, is used to determine the substrate specificity of the Bna.DGAT2 using microsomal preparations of recombinant H1246 expressing the Bna.DGAT2 orthologues. We investigate the nature of acyl-donor specificity in Bna.DGAT2 through chimeric enzymes based on an enzyme of the 18:3-CoA–specific type and a member of the 22:1-CoA–accepting type. Swapping of two predicted closely situated transmembrane regions results in a changed specificity, which strongly indicates that this region is of great importance for acyl-donor specificity. Alignment and prediction of transmembrane helix occurrence in a multitude of plant DGAT2 sequences reveal a consensus in which two closely situated transmembrane helices reside close to the N terminus. Substitution of the identified region in Arabidopsis DGAT2 with the corresponding region from a 22:1-CoA–accepting B. napus DGAT2 results in altered substrate specificity. This change indicates that the importance of this region for substrate specificity is not merely confined to B. napus DGAT2 enzymes. We determined the acyl-donor specificity of BnaA.DGAT2.b and BnaA.DGAT2.d in microsomal preparations of recombinant yeast using [14C]di-6:0-DAG as an acyl-acceptor. Further, we assessed the specificities of all enzymes, both the parental wildtypes and the chimeras under the same conditions, 40 μg of microsomal protein during 30 min of incubation. We chose to prioritize the same assay conditions for all enzymes instead of measuring under linear conditions. The WT enzymes differ starkly in their specificity toward 22:1-CoA relative to 18:3-CoA, although they originate from the same plant species. Both enzymes synthesize similar amounts of TAG when provided with 18:3-CoA. BnaA.DGAT2.b exhibits a high specificity toward 18:3-CoA compared with all other acyl donors investigated. BnaA.DGAT2.d, on the other hand, produces TAG at similar levels when provided 22:1-CoA as in assays supplemented with 18:3-CoA (Fig. 1). BnaA.DGAT2.d also exhibits a broader acceptance of other tested acyl donors. We designed a range of chimeric enzymes to elucidate whether a particular region in the DGAT2 amino acid sequence affects acyl-donor specificity. These chimeric enzymes have a backbone from the 18:3-CoA–specific BnaA.DGAT2.b where large segments from the 22:1-CoA–accepting BnaA.DGAT2.d substitute the corresponding amino acid sequences. We assessed changes in the specificity of the chimeric enzyme compared with BnaA.DGAT2.b in biochemical assays containing microsomal preparations supplemented with either 18:3-CoA or 22:1-CoA and [14C]di-6:0-DAG. An increased specificity toward 22:1-CoA relative to 18:3-CoA indicates an influence on specificity by the BnaA.DGAT2.d sequence substitution. We implemented a naming convention for the chimeric enzymes based on the following rules; a colon delimits the amino acid into thirds of the entire amino acid sequence where a capital letter B or D refers to either BnaA.DGAT2.b or BnaA.DGAT2.d, respectively. Lowercase letters b or d represents subsegments of that third (where d is bold to more easily distinguish it from b). Thus, D:B:B, representing a chimera in which BnaA.DGAT2.d substitutes the first third of BnaA.DGAT2.b and dbbb:B:B, is only substituted in the first part of the first third. The screening of these chimeric enzymes specificity reveals that the specificity signature of BnaA.DGAT2.d coincides with the first third of the enzyme (Fig. 2, top three illustrations). Next step was to focus on the first third of the enzymes, which we divided into four regions: N terminus, first and second predicted transmembrane helices, and a stretch containing the YPF motif (see Fig. 2, bottom five enzymes). Only a few amino acids separate the predicted transmembrane helices in the parental WT enzymes. Iterations of the chimeric enzyme substituting either of the regions in the first third or combinations thereof in the BnaA.DGAT2.b provide further information about acyl-donor specificity. Different combinations of chimeric enzymes were constructed and expressed in yeast for characterization of their relative activity toward 18:3-CoA and 22:1-CoA (Fig. 2). Substitution of the first segment containing the N terminus in BnaA.DGAT2.b results in a chimeric enzyme that produces no detectable levels of TAG with either acyl-CoA (data not shown). It is thus difficult to draw any conclusion of the impact of this region on acyl-donor specificity. However, chimeric enzymes without substituting the N terminus of the BnaA.DGAT2.b exhibit a significantly altered acyl-CoA specificity (Fig. 2). All the iterated chimeric enzyme designs that contain the first transmembrane helix from BnaA.DGAT2.d also maintain a relatively high preference for 22:1-CoA compared with 18:3-CoA, indicating that this region is of importance for acyl-CoA specificity (Fig. 2). The chimeric enzyme bdbb:B:B, substituted only at the first transmembrane helix, has, however, a drastically reduced catalytic activity. Substitution of the second transmembrane helix alone (bbdb:B:B; Fig. 2) retains DGAT catalytic activity but does not affect the acyl acceptor specificity. The chimeric enzyme bddb:B:B, in which both transmembrane helices are substituted, maintains the ability to form TAG but with an altered specificity that more closely resembles that of BnaA.DGAT2.d instead of BnaA.DGAT2.b (Fig. 2). We further characterized the acyl-CoA specificity of two chimeric enzymes, bbdb:B:B and bddb:B:B, with 18:1-, 18:2-, 18:3-, 20:1-, and 22:1-CoA (Fig. 3). Both chimeric enzymes contain fragments of BnaA.DGAT2.d in BnaA.DGAT2.b, which substitutes either the second transmembrane helix or both, and maintain a catalytic activity with 18:3-CoA comparable with the WT parental enzymes. However, the acyl-CoA specificity of bbdb:B:B, previously perceived as unaltered during the screening process, differs from BnaA.DGAT2.b with 18:1-CoA and 18:2-CoA substrates, which are more similar to the BnaA.DGAT2.d (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3A), but, it does not gain any increased specificity toward either 20:1-CoA or 22:1-CoA. The second enzyme characterized in detail, bddb:B:B, demonstrates a clear preference for very-long-chain acyl-CoAs, and the specificity appears to approximately resemble that of BnaA.DGAT2.d (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3B). We assessed acyl-donor specificity of a chimera between AtDGAT2 and BnaA.DGAT2.d to conclude whether the identified regions impact on acyl-donor specificity confines to DGAT2 enzymes from B. napus or whether it is a universal feature of plant DGAT2 enzymes. AtDGAT2 constitutes the backbone of the chimera, substituted with a segment from the 22:1-CoA–accepting enzyme, BnaA.DGAT2.d restricted to exclusively contain the two predicted transmembrane helices, and the few amino acids in between. The acyl donor substrate specificity of the chimeric AtBna.DGAT2 enzyme differs starkly from that of the parental WT AtDGAT2 (Fig. 4). The chimera expresses a high relative activity with 22:1-CoA, whereas the native AtDGAT2 utilizes this substrate poorly. However, the chimera's catalytic activity is significantly lower when compared with the WT (Fig. 4). We aligned a range of amino acid sequences with Clustal Omega including similar DGAT2 enzymes"
https://openalex.org/W3081932249,"Custom-made implants have recently gained attention in veterinary medicine because of their ability to properly fit animal bones having a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The effect of custom-made implants on bone soundness and the regeneration process is not yet clear. We fabricated a 3D printed Ti-6Al-4V custom-made bone plate that fits the shape of the dog radius, and placed it into the radius where an osteotomy had been made. The preferential orientation of the apatite c-axis contributes to the mechanical integrity of the bone and is a reliable measure of bone quality. We determined this parameter as well as the bone shape and bone mineral density (BMD). The bone portion which lies parallel to the bone plate exhibited bone resorption, decreased BMD, and significant degradation of apatite orientation, relative to the portion outside the plate, at 7 months after the operation. This demonstrates the presence of stress shielding in which applied stress is not transmitted to bone due to the insertion of a stiff bone plate. This reduced stress condition clearly influences the bone regeneration process. The apatite orientation in the regenerated site remained different even after 7 months of regeneration, indicating insufficient mechanical function in the regenerated portion. This is the first study in which the apatite orientation and BMD of the radius were evaluated under conditions of stress shielding in dogs. Our results suggest that assessment of bone repair by radiography can indicate the degree of restoration of BMD, but not the apatite orientation."
https://openalex.org/W3082329404,"Recent proteomics studies of vertebrate striated muscle have identified lysine acetylation at several sites on actin. Acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification that neutralizes lysine's positive charge. Positively charged residues on actin, particularly Lys326 and Lys328, are predicted to form critical electrostatic interactions with tropomyosin (Tpm) that promote its binding to filamentous (F)-actin and bias Tpm to an azimuthal location where it impedes myosin attachment. The troponin (Tn) complex also influences Tpm's position along F-actin as a function of Ca2+ to regulate exposure of myosin-binding sites and, thus, myosin cross-bridge recruitment and force production. Interestingly, Lys326 and Lys328 are among the documented acetylated residues. Using an acetic anhydride-based labeling approach, we showed that excessive, nonspecific actin acetylation did not disrupt characteristic F-actin–Tpm binding. However, it significantly reduced Tpm-mediated inhibition of myosin attachment, as reflected by increased F-actin–Tpm motility that persisted in the presence of Tn and submaximal Ca2+. Furthermore, decreasing the extent of chemical acetylation, to presumptively target highly reactive Lys326 and Lys328, also resulted in less inhibited F-actin–Tpm, implying that modifying only these residues influences Tpm's location and, potentially, thin filament regulation. To unequivocally determine the residue-specific consequences of acetylation on Tn–Tpm–based regulation of actomyosin activity, we assessed the effects of K326Q and K328Q acetyl (Ac)-mimetic actin on Ca2+-dependent, in vitro motility parameters of reconstituted thin filaments (RTFs). Incorporation of K328Q actin significantly enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity of RTF activation relative to control. Together, our findings suggest that actin acetylation, especially Lys328, modulates muscle contraction via disrupting inhibitory Tpm positioning. Recent proteomics studies of vertebrate striated muscle have identified lysine acetylation at several sites on actin. Acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification that neutralizes lysine's positive charge. Positively charged residues on actin, particularly Lys326 and Lys328, are predicted to form critical electrostatic interactions with tropomyosin (Tpm) that promote its binding to filamentous (F)-actin and bias Tpm to an azimuthal location where it impedes myosin attachment. The troponin (Tn) complex also influences Tpm's position along F-actin as a function of Ca2+ to regulate exposure of myosin-binding sites and, thus, myosin cross-bridge recruitment and force production.

Incorporation of K328Q actin significantly enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity of RTF activation relative to control. Together, our findings suggest that actin acetylation, especially Lys328, modulates muscle contraction via disrupting inhibitory Tpm positioning. Muscle contraction is driven by cyclical, force-generating interactions between myosin-containing thick and actin-based thin filaments (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M.

Conversely, relaxation occurs when actomyosin binding is inhibited and/or suppressed by Tn and Tpm on thin filaments, or by the sequestration of myosin heads on thick filaments (1Gordon A.M.

Each Tn–Tpm holoregulatory complex associates with seven actin protomers of the thin filament to confer Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Regulation of contraction in striated muscle.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80 (10747208): 853-92410.1152/physrev.2000.80.2.853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 2Lehman W.

Under low Ca2+, TnI restricts Tpm to the blocked “B-state” position along F-actin where it sterically inhibits myosin binding (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Regulation of contraction in striated muscle.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80 (10747208): 853-92410.1152/physrev.2000.80.2.853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 2Lehman W.

This effect is attenuated as free intracellular Ca2+ rises and binds to TnC. Ca2+-TnC binding relieves TnI-mediated constraints on Tpm and facilitates its azimuthal movement to the closed “C-state,” partial exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin, and weak myosin binding. The transition of myosin heads from a weak to strong F-actin-bound state induces additional Tpm movement to the open “M-state,” triggering cooperative thin filament activation and force generation. Hence, contraction demands both Tn- and myosin-dependent shifts in Tpm position. Tpm is an α-helical, coiled-coil dimer consisting of seven tandem “quasi-equivalent,” pseudorepeating motifs that bind adjacent actin monomers (6Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. An Y.

Mutations that disrupt the weak, local binding of Tpm to F-actin, as suggested by distorted, computationally derived F-actin–Tpm electrostatic energy landscapes, may minimally impact F-actin–Tpm global binding affinity yet elicit significant changes in Tpm's ability to properly impede actomyosin binding and cross-bridge cycling (21Rynkiewicz M.J.

Therefore, perturbed F-actin–Tpm electrostatic interactions could affect Tpm's preferred binding position and/or its regulatory switching between the B-, C-, and M-states along F-actin and, thus, Tpm-mediated regulation of actomyosin activity.

Of those 10 residues, 5, including Lys326 and Lys328, were reported to be acetylated in both studies. Lysine acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) where the transfer of an Ac group to the residue's side-chain terminal amine neutralizes its positive charge. Because Lys326 and Lys328 on actin are likely critical for establishing favorable electrostatic interactions with Tpm, “masking” the charges could destabilize F-actin–Tpm binding and/or inhibitory positioning, resulting in increased actomyosin cross-bridge formation and enhanced force production. In fact, mimicking acetylation by replacing the charged lysines at positions 326 and 328 with uncharged glutamines in Drosophila indirect flight muscle (IFM) altered flight ability and stimulated IFM fiber destruction because of excessive, myosin-dependent force generation (30Viswanathan M.C.

For example, Hitchcock-DeGregori et al. discovered, via a competitive labeling method, that Lys326 and Lys328 on F-actin displayed a high propensity for acetylation and were preferentially modified relative to all other lysines (38Hitchcock-De Gregori S.E.

Here, we hypothesize that actin Lys326 and/or Lys328 acetylation decreases Tpm-based inhibition of myosin binding by direct disruption of F-actin–Tpm electrostatic contacts and resultant Tpm mispositioning, which ultimately manifests as enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity in regulated thin filaments. To test our hypothesis, we implemented a two-pronged approach that determined the effects of 1) indiscriminate and probabilistic, but preferential, actin lysine acetylation on global F-actin–Tpm binding and on the inherent inhibitory positioning of Tpm along F-actin in the absence and presence of Tn and 2) residue-specific pseudoacetylation of Lys326 or Lys328 on Ca2+-mediated regulation of RTFs. Our results suggest that although Lys326 and Lys328 acetylation does not affect collective F-actin–Tpm affinity, Lys328 acetylation does lessen Tpm's intrinsic ability to inhibit myosin cross-bridge binding, which contributes to enhanced thin filament Ca2+ sensitivity. According to the Behrmann et al. (41Behrmann E. Müller M. Penczek P.A. Mannherz H.G. Manstein D.J. Raunser S. Structure of the rigor actin–tropomyosin–myosin complex.Cell. 2012; 150 (22817895): 327-33810.1016/j.cell.2012.05.037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) F-actin–Tpm–myosin rigor structure, Lys328 of actin forms a salt bridge with Glu286 of myosin (Fig. 1A). Acetylation of Lys328 and masking of its positive charge would predictably disrupt this interaction, which could potentially affect myosin binding and/or cross-bridge cycling. We pan-acetylated F-actin with acetic anhydride to increase actin-normalized lysine acetylation levels ∼290-fold (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. S1) and employed in vitro motility assays to assess its gross effect on actomyosin interactions (Fig. 1D). Sliding velocities of control and acetylated F-actin did not significantly differ at any of the myosin concentrations tested, suggesting that, in general, actomyosin cross-bridge cycling is seemingly unaffected by actin acetylation. To rule out the possibility that the lack of an effect on F-actin sliding velocities was because Lys328 remained unmodified, we employed MS to confirm which lysines were acetylated following chemical treatment (Table 1). Specifically, MS detected 22 unique spectral matches to 19 unique tryptic peptide sequences. These corresponded to 12 distinct acetylation sites, most of which are common to multiple actin gene products, including cardiac, skeletal, and cytoplasmic isoforms. Lys328 acetylation was confirmed. Therefore, the absence of an acetylation-induced effect on actomyosin cycling, and specifically F-actin propulsion speeds, could not be attributed to a failure of Lys328 to be chemically modified in vitro.Table 1Chemically acetylated lysine residues on actinEntryAcetylated peptide sequenceModificationsProtein accessionsProtein nameAcetylation siteaSite numbering according to the sequence, in vivo, which excludes the first two amino acids that are cleaved post-translationally.Peptide identification probabilityAcetyl site localization probabilitybPosition of Ac moiety assessed using the A-score algorithm of Beausoleil et al.

https://openalex.org/W3082472145,"Regional resilience refers to the resilience of a country or region against the ecological environment, social economy, and other internal and external natural factors and human factors in the process of development. When this resilience is lower than a certain critical threshold, the country or region will be in a fragile state. The comprehensive embodiment of ecological resilience, social resilience, and economic resilience of a country or region is regional resilience. Due to the wide range of countries along “the Belt and Road”, differences in natural background conditions and stages of economic and social development among different countries lead to different degrees of vulnerability, and the improvement of resilience is conducive to reducing vulnerability. At the same time, the research on the measurement and differentiation characteristics of regional resilience is of considerable significance to solve the weak foundation of environmental management and the lack of ability to deal with climate change of “the Belt and Road” countries. In this study, by using entropy weighting method and multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, 24 specific indicators are selected from three different dimensions: ecology, economy, and society, to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system about “the Belt and Road” countries resilience, and to evaluate the comprehensive resilience and spatial heterogeneity characteristics of China and 64 countries along “the Belt and Road”, and use multiple linear regression analysis to identify the main influencing factors of comprehensive resilience and analyze its influencing mechanism. According to the research, the overall resilience level of “the Belt and Road” countries shows prominent differentiation characteristics of “extreme difference”, the countries with low and low recovery status account for the vast majority; and the spatial differentiation characteristics of the levels of ecological resilience, economic resilience, and social resilience of countries along “the Belt and Road” are quite different. In countries with high levels of economic development, their comprehensive resilience is significantly higher than that of countries with low levels of economic development. There is no inevitable connection between a country’s economic growth rate and its comprehensive resilience level. At the same time, the relationship between resource richness and comprehensive resilience of countries is not apparent, but for those countries that are over-dependent on resources, the level of resilience is generally below. There is a certain degree of correspondence between urbanization rate and comprehensive resilience, that is, the comprehensive resilience will increase with the increase of urbanization rate. When the urbanization rate rises to a certain level, the level of comprehensive resilience does not change much. In this study, it provides scientific guidance for enriching regional resilience and national sustainable development theory, solving the fragile ecological environment foundation of “the Belt and Road” countries, speeding up the transformation of economic growth mode and dealing with a series of social problems."
https://openalex.org/W3081750138,"Fire severity affects both ecosystem N-loss and post-fire N-balance. Climate change is altering the fire regime of interior Alaska, although the effects on Siberian alder (Alnus viridis ssp. fruticosa) annual N-fixation input (kg N ha-1 yr-1) and ecosystem N-balance are largely unknown. We established 263 study plots across two burn scars within the Yukon-Tanana Uplands ecoregion of interior Alaska. Siberian alder N-input was quantified by post-fire age, fire severity, and stand type. We modeled the components of Siberian alder N-input using environmental variables and fire severity within and across burn scars and estimated post-fire N-balance using N-loss (volatilized N) and N-gain [biological N-fixation and atmospheric deposition]. Mean nodule-level N-fixation rate was 70% higher 11-years post-fire (12.88 ± 1.18 μmol N g-1 hr-1) than 40-years post-fire (7.58 ± 0.59 μmol N g-1 hr-1). Structural equation modeling indicated that fire severity had a negative effect on Siberian alder density, but a positive effect on live nodule biomass (g nodule m-2 plant-1). Post-fire Siberian alder N-input was highest in 11-year old moderately burned deciduous stands (11.53 ± 0.22 kg N ha-1 yr-1), and lowest in 11-year old stands that converted from black spruce to deciduous dominance after severe fire (0.06 ± 0.003 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Over a 138-year fire return interval, N-gains in converted black spruce stands are estimated to offset 15% of volatilized N, whereas N-gains in burned deciduous stands likely exceed volatilized N by an order of magnitude. High Siberian alder density and nodule biomass drives N-input in burned deciduous stands, while low N-fixer density (including Siberian alder) limits N-input in high severity black spruce stands not underlain by permafrost. A severe fire regime that converts black spruce stands to deciduous dominance without alder recruitment may induce progressive N-losses which alter boreal forest ecosystem patterns and processes."

This study aimed to evaluate the frequency, active infection and load of L. infantum in the genital tract of male and female dogs seropositive for this parasite, as well as to identify histological genital alterations associated with this protozoan. We studied 45 male and 25 female L. infantum-seropositive noncastrated dogs from the same endemic area in Brazil. Tissue samples from the testis, epididymis, prostate, vulva, vagina, and uterus were examined by singleplex qPCR and parasitological tests (histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and parasitological culture). The latter were performed for the detection of active infection (parasites able to multiply and to induce lesions). Forty-four (98%) males and 25 (100%) females were positive for L. infantum in the genital tract (epididymis: 98%; vulva: 92%; vagina: 92%; testis: 91%; uterus: 84%; prostate: 66%). Active infection in the genital tract was confirmed in 69% of males and 64% of females (32% in the uterus). Parasite loads were similar in the testis, vulva, epididymis and vagina and lower in the prostate. Only the parasite load in the vagina was significantly associated with the number of clinical signs. Granulomatous inflammation predominated in all organs, except for the prostate. Only in the testis and epididymis was the inflammatory infiltrate significantly more intense among dogs with a higher parasite load in these organs. The high frequency, detection of active infection and similarity of L. infantum loads in the genital tract of infected males and females suggest the potential of venereal transmission of this parasite by both sexes and of vertical transmission by females in the area studied. Additionally, vertical transmission may be frequent since active L. infantum infection was a common observation in the uterus."

Finally, we evaluate the accuracy, robustness and time efficiency of our proposed method with the existing algorithms on the public benchmarks and the natural real motion blurred images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PSF estimation scheme not only could obtain a higher accuracy for the blur angle and blur length, but also demonstrate stronger robustness and higher time efficiency under different circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3081857459,"A large number of species in the tropics are awaiting discovery, many due to their cryptic morphology ie. lack of discernable morphological difference. We explored the presence of cryptic lineages within the frog genera, Indirana and Walkerana, which are endemic to the Western Ghats of Peninsular India. By reconstructing a phylogeny using 5 genes and robust geographic sampling, we delimited 19 lineages along a population—species continuum, using multiple criteria including haplotype clusters, genetic distance, morphological distinctness, and geographical separation. Of these 19 lineages, 14 belonged to the genus Indirana and 5 to the genus Walkerana. Divergence dating analyses revealed that the clade comprising Indirana and Walkerana began diversifying around 71 mya and the most recent common ancestor of Indirana and Walkerana split around 43 mya. We tested for the presence of cryptic lineages by examining the relationship between genetic and morphological divergence among related pairs within a pool of 15 lineages. The pairs showed strong morphological conservatism across varying levels of genetic divergence. Our results highlight the prevalence of morphologically cryptic lineages in these ancient endemic clades of the Western Ghats. This emphasizes the significance of other axes, such as geography, in species delimitation. With increasing threats to amphibian habitats, it is imperative that cryptic lineages are identified so that appropriate conservation measures can be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3082926880,"Background Significant improvements in clinical outcome can be achieved by implementing effective strategies to optimise pain management, reduce sedative exposure, and prevent and treat delirium in ICU patients. One important strategy is the monitoring of pain, agitation and delirium (PAD bundle). We hypothesised that there is no sufficient financial benefit to implement a monitoring strategy in a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)-based reimbursement system, therefore we expected better clinical and decreased economic outcome for monitored patients. Methods This is a retrospective observational study using routinely collected data. We used univariate and multiple linear analysis, machine-learning analysis and a novel correlation statistic (maximal information coefficient) to explore the association between monitoring adherence and resulting clinical and economic outcome. For univariate analysis we split patients in an adherence achieved and an adherence non-achieved group. Results In total 1,323 adult patients from two campuses of a German tertiary medical centre, who spent at least one day in the ICU between admission and discharge between 1. January 2016 and 31. December 2016. Adherence to PAD monitoring was associated with shorter hospital LoS (e.g. pain monitoring 13 vs. 10 days; p<0.001), ICU LoS, duration of mechanical ventilation shown by univariate analysis. Despite the improved clinical outcome, adherence to PAD elements was associated with a decreased case mix per day and profit per day shown by univariate analysis. Multiple linear analysis did not confirm these results. PAD monitoring is important for clinical as well as economic outcome and predicted case mix better than severity of illness shown by machine learning analysis. Conclusion Adherence to PAD bundles is also important for clinical as well as economic outcome. It is associated with improved clinical and worse economic outcome in comparison to non-adherence in univariate analysis but not confirmed by multiple linear analysis.

https://openalex.org/W3082715832,"The concept of dysphagia/aspiration-related structures (DARS) was developed against the background of severe late side effects of radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer (HNC). DARS can be delineated on CT scans, but with a better morphological discrimination on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Swallowing function was analyzed by use of patient charts and prospective investigations and questionnaires.Seventeen HNC patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) ± chemotherapy between 5/2012 - 8/2015 were included. Planning CT (computed tomography) scans and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) prior, during 40 Gray (Gy) radiotherapy and posttreatment were available and co-registered to delineate DARS. The RT dose of each DARS was calculated. Five patients were investigated posttreatment for swallowing function and assessed by means of various questionnaires for quality of life (QoL), swallowing, and voice function.By retrospective comparison of DARS volume, a significant change in four of eight DARS was detected over time. Three increased and one diminished. The risk of posttreatment dysphagia rose by every 1Gy above the mean dose (D mean) of RT to DARS. 7.5 was the risk factor for dysphagia in the first 6 months, reducing to 4.7 for months 6-12 posttreatment. For all five patients of the prospective part of swallowing investigations, a function disturbance was detected. These results were in contrast to the self-assessment of patients by questionnaires. There was neither a dose dependency of D mean DARS volume changes over time nor of dysphonia and no correlation between volume changes, dysphagia or dysphonia.Delineation of DARS on MRI co-registered to planning CT gave the opportunity to differentiate morphology better than by CT alone. Due to the small number of patients with complete MRI scans over time, we failed to detect a dose dependency of DARS and swallowing and voice disorder posttreatment."

The objective of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung in the diagnosis of lung cancer amongst patients with IPNs in addition to CT surveillance, compared to CT surveillance alone which is the current recommendation by the British Thoracic Society guidelines. A model consisting of a combination of a decision tree and Markov model was developed using the outcome measure of the quality adjusted life year (QALY). A life-time time horizon was adopted. The model was parameterized using a range of secondary sources. At £70 per test, EarlyCDT-Lung and CT surveillance was found to be cost-effective compared to CT surveillance alone with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than £2,500 depending on the test accuracy parameters used. It was also found that EarlyCDT-Lung can be priced up to £1,177 and still be cost-effective based on cost-effectiveness acceptance threshold of £20,000 / QALY. Further research to resolve parameter uncertainty, was not found to be of value. The results here demonstrate that at £70 per test the EarlyCDT-Lung will have a positive impact on patient outcomes and coupled with CT surveillance is a cost-effective approach to the management of patients with IPNs. The conclusions drawn from this analysis are robust to realistic variation in the parameters used in the model."
https://openalex.org/W3082363289,"A body of literature suggests that states with independent courts are more likely to protect human rights. A recent article challenges this notion by arguing that when both the president and his or her justice minister share the same party—i.e., they are copartisans—that state is less likely to protect human rights, as justice ministers may value their loyalty to the president over their duty to enforce court decisions. In this article, I estimate government respect for human rights accounting for both copartisan justice ministers and an independent judiciary. In the end, I find copartisan justice ministers to be negatively associated with high government respect for human rights, even after controlling for judicial independence. Many constitutions already seek to ensure an independent judiciary, but if copartisan justice ministers increase the likelihood that governments repress, then perhaps constitutional engineers should also consider options that would reduce the likelihood that both the president and his or her justice minister share the same party."

In this study we present the 3D structures of the soluble catalytic domain of CmsA/Ktr4, as determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.95 Å, as well as the enzyme and Mn2+/GDP complex to 1.90 Å resolution. The CmsA/Ktr4 protein not only contains a highly conserved binding pocket for the donor substrate, GDP-mannose, but also has a unique broad cleft structure formed by its N- and C-terminal regions and is expected to recognize the acceptor substrate, a mannan chain. Based on these crystal structures, we also present a 3D structural model of the enzyme-substrate complex generated using docking and molecular dynamics simulations with α-Man-(1→6)-α-Man-(1→2)-α-Man-OMe as the model structure for the acceptor substrate. This predicted enzyme-substrate complex structure is also supported by findings from single amino acid substitution CmsA/Ktr4 mutants expressed in ΔcmsA/ktr4 A. fumigatus cells. Taken together, these results provide basic information for developing specific α-mannan biosynthesis inhibitors for use as pharmaceuticals and/or pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W3081928474,"In this study we evaluate the convergent validity of a new graphical self-report tool (the EmojiGrid) for the affective appraisal of perceived touch events. The EmojiGrid is a square grid labeled with facial icons (emoji) showing different levels of valence and arousal. The EmojiGrid is language independent and efficient (a single click suffices to report both valence and arousal), making it a practical instrument for studies on affective appraisal. We previously showed that participants can intuitively and reliably report their affective appraisal (valence and arousal) of visual, auditory and olfactory stimuli using the EmojiGrid, even without additional (verbal) instructions. However, because touch events can be bidirectional and dynamic, these previous results cannot be generalized to the touch domain. In this study, participants reported their affective appraisal of video clips showing different interpersonal (social) and object-based touch events, using either the validated 9-point SAM (Self-Assessment Mannikin) scale or the EmojiGrid. The valence ratings obtained with the EmojiGrid and the SAM are in excellent agreement. The arousal ratings show good agreement for object-based touch and moderate agreement for social touch. For social touch and at more extreme levels of valence, the EmojiGrid appears more sensitive to arousal than the SAM. We conclude that the EmojiGrid can also serve as a valid and efficient graphical self-report instrument to measure human affective response to a wide range of tactile signals."

Previously, we showed differences in immune response-related gene expression profiles of HEV gt1 and gt3 infections using qPCR. We hypothesize that HEV gt1 and gt3 infections induce transcriptome modifications contributing to disease pathogenesis. RNAseq analysis was performed using liver biopsy samples of naïve (baseline), HEV gt1, or gt3-infected rhesus macaques, and nine anti-HEV positive rhesus macaques re-inoculated with HEV gt1. All 10 primary HEV gt1/gt3 infected animals exhibited the typical course of acute viral hepatitis and cleared the infection between 27 to 67 days after inoculation. Viremic stages of HEV infection were defined as early, peak, and decline based on HEV RNA titers in daily stool specimens. During early, peak, and decline phases of infection, HEV gt1 induced 415, 417, and 1769 differentially expressed genes, respectively, and 310, 678, and 388 genes were differentially expressed by HEV gt3, respectively (fold change ≥ 2.0, p-value ≤ 0.05). In the HEV gt1 infection, genes related to metabolic pathways were differentially expressed during the three phases of infection. In contrast, oxidative reduction (early phase), immune responses (peak phase), and T cell cytokine production (decline phase) were found to be regulated during HEV gt3 infection. In addition, FoxO and MAPK signaling pathways were differentially regulated in re-infected and protected animals against HEV gt1 reinfection, respectively. Significant differences of hepatic gene regulation exist between HEV gt1 and gt3 infections. These findings reveal a new link between molecular pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics seen in HEV gt1 and gt3 infections."

The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of hospitalization for second hip fracture and risk of mortality between AR user and non-user groups in Taiwanese women on long-term dialysis with hip fractures. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Datasets. Long-term dialysis women older than 50 years with newly diagnosed hip fractures and new to AR therapy from 2005 to 2011 were recruited. The patients were divided into AR users and non-users and matched by propensity score. We used Cox Proportional Hazards models to assess association of AR with risks of second hip fracture and mortality. Totally, 1,079 dialysis patients were included, and after matching, we were left with 74 AR users and 74 non-users. AR users did not show a significant reduction in the incidence of second hip fracture compared with non-users (adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.91, 95% CI: 0.30–2.76), and alendronate users exhibited higher risk of second hip fracture compared with raloxifene users (adjusted HR: 2.80, 95% CI: 0.42–18.79). In addition, AR users were found to have significantly lower 1- and 2-year mortality rates than the non-users (1- year: adjusted HR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.07–0.90; 2-year: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.17–0.72). AR treatment did not significantly improve the risk of second hip fracture but significantly reduce mortality in older women on dialysis.

Check-lists were used to document available sources of foods during school hours. Pupils were intercepted after making purchases during breaktime and the type, cost and sources of foods purchased documented. Energy content of foods were read from labels when available or estimated using the Ghana Food Composition database when unlabelled. Frequencies and crosstabs were used to compare food type by source and school type.Foods were purchased from school canteen, school store, private stores, and 'table-top' vendors. Meals were most frequently purchased (38%) although single purchases were sweetened drinks, savoury snacks and confectioneries. About 53% of retailers located within the schools sold relatively healthier food options. Similar foods with comparable energy content were purchased within and outside of school.Basic schools in urban Ghana provide ready access to energy dense food options, which are purchased by pupils both within and outside of school premises.

The original DEM nodes are sampled using the Maximal Poisson-disk Sampling (MPS), in which, the disk's size of each sample is computed on basis of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). MPS can generate the hyper-uniformly distributed samples and was taken to do DEM adaptive sampling by being combined with the geodesic metric. However, the geodesic distance computation is complex and the requirement for memory is high. As such, this paper proposes an extension of the classic MPS based method for selecting quasi-randomly distributed points from DEM nodes based on the distribution of eigenvalues, accounting for surface heterogeneity. To achieve this objective, uniform MPS is conducted to sample the DEM nodes by setting the related disk radius to be inversely proportional to the local terrain complexity, which is defined as an index expressing the local terrain variation. Then, the geodesic metric related parameters are implicitly contained in the defined index. As a result, more samples are concentrated in the rugged regions, and vice versa. The proposed method shows better perfermance, at least the results are comparable with the geodesic distance based Poisson disk sampling method. Meanwhile, it greatly accelerates the sampling process and reduces the memory cost."
https://openalex.org/W3082184782,"Gender-wage gaps are an important phenomenon on labor markets. They can possibly be caused by the institutional framework. This question is addressed in this paper. When only joint output can be observed in team production, individuals may submit self-reports of their contribution to a principal. In a multi-employee gift exchange experiment, we study how men and women behave differently with and without such self-reports. We cannot reject that self-reports left the overall efficiency of the gift exchange interaction unchanged, but detect notable gender differences. Women reported similar effort levels as men, but contributed significantly less. The difference in contributions led to a significant gender gap in wages, depending on gender group composition. These effects were only present when participants did not know each other’s gender, however. When instead gender was observable, the behavior of men and women converged. The results suggest that parts of wage gaps may be related to different behavior within incomplete contract and imperfect information environments, depending on details of the informational context."
