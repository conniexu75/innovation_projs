https://openalex.org/W1573981241,"Androgen receptors in crude and partially purified 105,000 X g supernatant fractions from rat testis, epididymis, and prostate were studied in vitro using a charcoal adsorption assay and sucrose gradient centrifugation. Androgen metabolism was eliminated during receptor purification allowing determination of the kinetics of [3H]-androgen-receptor complex formation. In all three tissues, receptors were found to have essentially identical capabilities to bind androgen, with the affinity for [3H] dihydrotestosterone being somewhat higher than for [3H] testosterone. Equilibrium dissociation constants for [3H] dihydrotestosterone and [3H] testosterone (KD = 2 to 5 X 10(-10) M) were estimated from independently determined rates of association (ka congruent to 6 X 10(7) M-1 h-1 for [3H] dihydrotestosterone and 2 X 10(8) M-1 h-1 for [3H] testosterone) and dissociation (t 1/2 congruent to 40 hr for [3H] dihydrotestosterone and 15 h [3H] testosterone). Evaluation of the effect of temperature on androgen receptor binding of [3H]testosterone allowed estimation of several thermodynamic parameters, including activation energies of association and dissociation (delta H congruent to 14 kcal/mol), the apparent free energy (delta G congruent to -12 kcal/mol), enthalpy (delta H congruent to -2.5 kcal/mol), and entropy (delta S congruent to 35 cal col-1 K-1). Optimum receptor binding occurred at a pH of 8. Receptor stability was greatly enhanced when bound with androgen. Receptor specificity for testosterone and dihydrotestosterone was demonstrated by competitive binding assays. The potent synthetic androgen, 7 alpha, 17 alpha-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone, inhibited binding of [3H] testosterone or [3H] dihydrotesterone nearly as well as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone while larger amounts of 5 alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17 beta-diol and nonandrogenic steroids were required. Sedimentation coefficients of androgen receptors in all unfractionated supernatants were 4 and 5 to 8 S. Differences in sedimentation coefficients were observed following (NH4)2SO4 precipitation which did not influence the binding properties of the receptors. These results, together with measurements of3alpha/beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activity in vitro, suggest that organ differences in receptor binding of [3H] dihydrotestosterone and [3H] testosterone in vivo result from relative differences in intracellular concentrations of these androgens rather than from differences in receptor affinities."

https://openalex.org/W2012583727,"By a method of overlapping the results obtained after agarose gel electrophoresis under two different sets of conditions, it has become possible to determine the number of superhelical turns in a given DNA by counting the bands present after partially relaxing the DNA (Keller and Wendel, 1974) with highly purified nicking-closing (N-C) enzyme from LA9 mouse cell nuclei. Because native supercoiled DNA is heterogeneous with respect to superhelix density, an average number of superhelical turns was determined. Virion SV40 DNA contains 26 +/- 0.5 superhelical turns, and native Minicol DNA contains 19 +/- 0.5 superhelical turns. The above are values at 0.2 M NaCl and at 37 degrees C, the condition under which the enzymatic relaxations were performed. The superhelix densities determined by the band counting method have been compared with superhelix densities determined by buoyant equilibrium in PDl-CsCl gradients. The Gray, Upholt, and Vinograd (1971) calculation procedure has been used for evaluating the superhelix densities by the latter method with the new statement, however, that relaxed DNA has zero superhelical turns. Comparison of the superhelix densities obtained by both methods permits a calculation of an unwinding angle for ethidium. The mean value from experiments with SV40 DNA is 23 +/- 3 degree. The average number of superhelical turns in SV40, 26, combined with the value, 21, obtained by both Griffith (1975) and Germond et al. (1975) for the average number of nucleosomes per SV40 genome, yields an average of 1.25 superhelical turns per 1/21 of the SV40 genome. If the regions of internucleosomal DNA are fully relaxed, 1.25 correesponds to the average number of superhelical turns with a nucleosome. When analyzed under identical conditions, the limit product generated by ligating a nicked circular substrate in the presence of 0.001 M Mg2+ at 37 degrees C (ligation conditions) is slightly more positively supercoiled than the limit product obtained when the N-C reaction is performed in 0.2 M NaCl at 37 degrees C. The difference in superhelix density as measured in gels between the two sets of limit products for both Minicol and SV40 DNAs is 0.0059 +/- 0.0005. This result indicates that the DNA duplex is overwound in the ligation solvent relative to its state in 0.2 M NaCl."
https://openalex.org/W2081605877,"IN discussing reactions involving the superoxide anion O2−, it is generally considered that the radical itself or singlet oxygen generated from O2− is harmful to molecules of biological importance1,2. Since the demonstration that singlet oxygen participates in reactions is technically difficult, conclusions about its effects are rather speculative. I show here, on thermo-dynamic grounds, in which reactions singlet oxygen can be formed from O2− and in which reactions this is improbable."
https://openalex.org/W2058735050,"Purified virions of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are capable of synthesizing two distinct types of virus-specific RNA in vitro. The first consists of several viral mRNAs which have been previously shown to contain the blocked 5′ terminal sequence GpppApApCpApGp and 3′ terminal poly(A). The second type of RNA has an unblocked 5′ terminus and does not contain poly(A) stretches long enough to bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns. It migrates in 20% polyacrylamide gels as a single homogeneous peak with an estimated chain length of 68 nucleotides. Base analysis demonstrated that this small RNA molecule is composed of 48% AMP, 20% CMP, 11% GMP, and 21% UMP. The 5′ terminal sequence of the small RNA is ppApCpGp, which appears to be complementary to the 3′ terminal sequence of the VSV genome RNA (…PypGpU). These results indicate that this small RNA molecule probably represents the initiated lead-in RNA segment which is removed during formation of VSV mRNAs by a possible processing mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1580621582,"Abstract A single injection of either isoproternol or N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) results in an inhibition in the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of differentiating cardiac muscle of the neonatal rat. This inhibition is not due to substantially altered cellular uptake or catabolism of [3H]thymidine. Inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation by isoproterenol or dibutyryl cyclic AMP is potentiated by theophylline. Maximal inhibition (95%) is observed 24 h after administration of isoproterenol, and the rate of incorporation returns to a value 80% of control by 72 h. Norepinephrine also inhibits [3H]thymidine incorporation whereas cyclic GMP, N2, 02-Dibutyryl guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic GMP), and phenylephrine have little effect. Equilibrium sedimentation analysis of cardiac muscle DNA in neutral and alkaline cesium chloride gradients using bromodeoxyuridine as a density label indicate that isoproterenol and dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA that is replicating semiconservatively. Administration of isoproterenol or dibutyryl cyclic AMP to neonatal rats inhibits by approximately 60% the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA of tissue slices of cardiac muscle prepared 16 h later. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA of tissue slices is into chains that were growing in vivo. This incorporation is linear for at least 4 h of incubation and is inhibited by isoproterenol and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Inhibition is not due to altered cellular uptake of [3H]thymidine nor is it due to a cytotoxic action. Several other compounds which elevate intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, and prostaglandin E1) also inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA or cardiac muscle tissue slices. Cyclic GMP, dibutyryl cyclic GMP, sodium butyrate, and phenylephrine have little effect. Isoproterenol administered together with theophylline to neonatal rats signficantly stimulates the in corporation of [3H]phenylalanine into total cardiac muscle protein and into myosin. This enhanced incorporation may be due in part to an increase in the cellular uptake of [3H]phenylalanine. DNA synthesis decreases progressively in differentiating cardiac muscle of the rat during postnatal development and essentially ceases by the middle of the third week (Claycomb, W. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3229-3235). In reviewing the literature it was found that this decline in synthetic activity correlates temporally with a progressive increase in tissue concentrations of norepinephrine and cyclic AMP and with the anatomical and physiological development of the adrenergic nerves in this tissue. Because of these facts and data presented in this report it is proposed that cell proliferation and cell differentiation in cardiac muscle may be controlled by adrenergic innervation with norepinephrine and cyclic AMP serving as chemical mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1481118508,"Highly purified iron superoxide dismutase was obtained from Escherichia coli B using a modification of the procedure of Yost and Jridovich (Yost, F. J., Jr., and Fridovich, I. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4905-4908). The protein contained 1.8 +/- 0.2 atoms of iron per 38,700 g of protein. We have found that cyanide does not bind to the Fe3+ ion of iron dismutase but fluoride and azide have moderately large binding constants. Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements suggested that 2 fluoride ions could associate with each iron atom with the first having an association constant of approximately 520 M-1 and the second with an estimated value of 24 M-1. Activity measurements yielded an inhibition constant for fluoride of 30 M-1. At room temperature only one azide binds to the Fe3+ (K = 760 M-1) and this does not interfere with superoxide dismutase activity. Upon freezing solutions of iron superoxide dismutase in the presence of excess azide their color changes from yellow to pink. Combined EPR and optical titrations with azide suggest the presence of two binding sites on Fe3+ with only the first being occupied at room temperature and the second binding azide only upon freezing the solution. The results suggest that each Fe3+ ion of this superoxide dismutase has two coordination positions available for interaction with solute molecules but only one is necessary for catalysis of the superoxide dismutation reaction. The EPR, optical, and circular dichroism spectra of the native protein and the various fluoride and azide complexes are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1564309614,"The content of coenzyme A-SH (CoASH) and acetyl-CoA of suspensions of rat heart mitochondria was stabilized by the addition of DL-carnitine and acetyl-DL-carnitine, in the presence of the respiratory inhibitor rotenone. The mitochondrial content of NAD+ and NADH was similarly stabilized by the addition of acetoacetate and DL-3-hydroxybutyrate, and the content of ADP and ATP was imposed by the addition of these nucleotides to the mitochondrial suspension, in the presence of uncoupling agent and oligomycin, to inhibit ATPase. Under these conditions, mitochondrial CoASH/acetyl-CoA, NAD+/ NADH, and ADP/ATP ratios could be varied independently, and the effect on the interconversion of active and inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase could be studied. Decreases in both CoASH/acetyl-CoA and NAD+/NADH ratios were shown to be inhibitory to the steady state activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, and this effect is described at three different ADP/ATP ratios and different concentrations of added MgCl2. A new steady state level of activity was achieved within 10 min of a change in either CoASH/acetyl-CoA or NAD+/NADH ratio; the rate of inactivation was much higher than the rate of reactivation under these conditions. Effects of CoASH/acetyl-CoA and NAD+/NADH may be additive but are still quantitatively lesser than the changes in activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase induced by changes in ADP/ATP ratio. The variation in activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase with ADP/ATP ratio is described in the absence of changes in the other two ratios, conditions which were not met in earlier studies which employed the oxidation of different substrates to generate changes in all three ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1633719613,"A model of the polypeptide backbone of the dimer of glycogen phosphorylase a (EC 2.4.1.1) was built from a 3 A resolution electron density map derived from x-ray diffraction analysis of native tetragonal crystals and two heavy atom isomorphous replacement derivatives. Each identical subunit of the dimer has a compact shape with overall dimensions of 85 X 75 X 55 A and is tightly associated with its 2-fold symmetry related subunit. There are three major excursions of the polypeptide chain of one monomer across the 2-fold axis to make extensive contacts with the other subunit. The active site, of which there are two per dimer, is shared between the two subunits at their interface and comprises a pocket-like region within a V-shaped framework of two alpha helices. Within this region are found the binding sites for the substrates, glucose-1-P and arsenate, a competitive inhibitor, UDP-glucose, and the allosteric effector, AMP. The site of metabolic control, Ser-14 phosphate, is hydrogen-bonded to a side chain on the outside of one of the alpha helices forming the active site and is 15 A from the AMP binding site. Maltoheptaose, a glycogen analogue and substrate for these enzymatically active crystals, binds in a second region of interest. Even at concentrations above its Km, when binding is sufficiently tight that all seven glucose moieties may be discerned, the closest of these is 25 A from the glucose-1-P binding site. We suggest that this polysaccharide binding site may represent a storage site whereby phosphorylase is bound to the glycogen particle in the muscle cell. The polypeptide chain in a third region has the same topological structure as has been observed for the nucleotide binding domains in the dehydrogenases. Adenine or adenosine (but not AMP) bind here in a position similar to the adenine ring of NAD in the dehydrogenases while glucose binds 17 A away in an interior crevice near the center of the monomer."

https://openalex.org/W1535151692,"An extract of rat liver or human platelet displayed three cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity peaks (I, II, and III) in a continuous sucrose density gradient when assayed with millimolar adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) or guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP). The three fractions obtained from each nucleotide were not superimposable. The molecular weights corresponding to the three activity peaks of cAMP phosphodiesterase in rat liver were approximately: I, 22,000; II, 75,000; and III, 140,000. In both tissues, fraction I was barely detectable when assayed with micromolar concentrations of either nucleotide, presumably because fraction I has low affinity for cAMP and cGMP. Any one of the three forms upon recentrifugation on the gradient generated the others, indicating that they were interconvertible. The multiple forms appear to represent different aggregated states of the enzyme. The ratio of the three forms of cAMP phosphodiesterase in the platelet was shifted by dibutyryl cAMP (B2cAMP) and by the enzyme concentration. B2cAMP enhanced the formation of fraction I. Low enzyme concentration favored the equilibrium towards fraction I, while high enzyme concentration favored fraction III. When phosphodiesterase activities in the extract of rat liver, human platelets, or bovine brain were examined as a function of enzyme concentration, rectilinear rates were observed with micromolar, but not with millimolar cAMP or cGMP. The specific activity with millimolar cAMP was higher with low than with high protein concentrations, suggesting that the dissociated form catalyzed the hydrolysis of cAMP faster than that of the associated form. In contrast, the specific activity with millimolar cGMP was lower with low than with high protein concentrations. Supplementing the reaction mixture with bovine serum albumin to a final constant protein concentration did not affect the activity, suggesting that the concentration of the enzyme rather than that of extraneous proteins affected the enzyme activity. A change in enzyme concentration affected the kinetic properties of phosphodiesterase. A low enzyme concentration of cAMP phosphodiesterase yielded a linear Lineweaver-Burk plot, and a Km of 1.2 X 10(-4) M (bovine), 3 X 10(-5) M (platelet), or 5 X 10(-4) M (liver), while a high enzyme concentration yielded a nonlinear plot, and apparent Km values of 1.4 X 10(-4) M and 2 X 10(-5) M (brain), 4 X 10(-5) M and 3 X 10(-6) M (platelet), or 4 X 10(-5) M and 3 X 10(-6) (liver). Since a low enzyme concentration favored fraction I, the dissociated form, whereas a high enzyme concentration favored fraction III, the associated form, these kinetic constants suggest that the dissociated form exhibits a high Km and the associated form exhibits a low Km. In contrast, a high enzyme concentration gave a linear kinetic plot for cGMP phosphodiesterase, while a low enzyme concentration gave a nonlinear plot..."

https://openalex.org/W1482318058,"Cytochrome P-450 was purified from bovine adrenal cortex mitochondria by affinity chromatography using an octylamine-substituted Sepharose column. The resulting optically clear preparation was stable at -20 degrees for months. The specific concentration of cytochrome P-450 in the preparation was about 5 nmol of heme per mg of protein. The preparations were free of adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin reductase, phospholipids, and other heme contaminations. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified cytochrome P-450 preparation treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol showed a single major band with a molecular weight of about 60,000. The optical absorption spectra of the preparation exhibited Soret maxima at 416, 416, and 448 nm for the Fe3+, Fe2+ and the C.Fe2+ complex, respectively. The EPR spectrum showed the characteristic features of the low spin form of ferric cytochrome P-450 with principal components 1.914, 2.241, and 2.415 of the g-tensor. The circular dichroism spectrum revealed two large negative ellipticities at 412 and 350 nm. Fluorescence spectra showed an excitation maximum at 285 nm and an emission maximum at 305 nm with a shoulder at 330 nm as the cytochrome P-450 molecule is excited at 285 nm, or an emission maximum at 335 nm when the cytochrome molecule is excited at 305 nm. After reconstitution with adrenodoxin and its reductase, this cytochrome P-450 was highly active for cholesterol desmolase with an NADPH-generating system as electron donor but was not active for steroid 11beta-hydroxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1569652121,"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical spectra are used as probes of the heme and its ligands in ferric and ferrous leghemoglobin. The proximal ligand to the heme iron atom of ferric soybean leghemoglobin is identified as imidazole by comparison of the EPR of leghemoglobin hydroxide, azide, and cyanide with the corresponding derivatives of human hemoglobin. Optical spectra show that ferric soybean leghemoglobin near room temperature is almost entirely in the high spin state. At 77 K the optical spectrum is that of a low spin compound, while at 1.6 K the EPR is that of a low spin form resembling bis-imidazole heme. Acetate binds to ferric leghemoglobin to form a high spin complex as judged from the optical spectrum. The EPR of this complex is that of high spin ferric heme in a nearly axial environment. The complexes of ferrous leghemoglobin with substituted pyridines exhibit optical absorption maxima near 685 nm, whose absorption maxima and extinctions are strongly dependent on the nature of the substitutents of the pyridine ring; electron withdrawing groups on the pyridine ring shift the absorption maxima to lower energy. A crystal field analysis of the EPR of nicotinate derivatives of ferric leghemoblobin demonstrates that the pyridine nitrogen is also bound to the heme iron in the ferric state. These findings lead us to picture leghemoglobin as a somewhat flexible molecule in which the transition region between the E and F helices may act as a hinge, opening a small amount at higher temperature to a stable configuration in which the protein is high spin and can accommodate exogenous ligand molecules and closing at low temperature to a second stable configuration in which the protein is low spin and in which close approach of the E helix permits the distal histidine to become the principal sixth ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2065037382,"Indirect immunofluorescence techniques were employed to determine the distribution within intestinal epithelial cells of apolipoprotein B, a protein essential for the normal transport of fat. Isolated intestinal cells were prepared from rats either during active lipid absorption or after biliary diversion. Specific immunofluorescence from an antiserum to apolipoprotein B was detected in the apical portion of epithelial cells from bile-diverted animals, demonstrating that a pool of apolipoprotein B is present in the nonabsorptive epithelial cell and may be a component of intestinal cell membranes. During lipid absorption in normal rats, an early and sustained increase in immunofluorescence was demonstrated, consistent with an increase synthesis of apolipoprotein B during lipid absorption. This study demonstrates the presence of apolipoprotein B within intestinal epithelium and provides evidence for the participation of this apoprotein in intestinal lipid transport."

https://openalex.org/W1517835101,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein synthesis to the biogenesis of cytochrome oxidase (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase EC 1.9.3.1) and rutamycin-sensitive adenosine triphosphatase (ATP phosphohydrolase EC 3.6.1.3) in cultured oocytes of the toad, Xenopus laevis. X. laevis cytochrome oxidase was purified over 23-fold with respect to specific activity and over 29-fold with respect to specific heme a content from oocyte submitochondrial particles. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate separated the enzyme into six subunits with molecular weights of 44,000, 33,000, 23,000, 17,000, 12,000 and 9,500. the synthesis of the three larger subunits is sensitive to chloramphenicol (an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis), indicating that these subunits are made on mitochondrial ribosomes; the synthesis of the three smaller subunits is sensitive to cycloheximide (an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis) and therefore occurs on cytoplasmic ribosomes. X. laevis rutamycin-sensitive ATPase, purified over 19-fold from oocyte submitochondrial pparticles, consists of 10 subunits with molecular weights of 56,000, 53,000, 41,000, 32,000, 29,000, 24,000, 21,000, 17,500 (2), and 11,500 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The 29,000, 21,000, and one of the 17,500-dalton polypeptides are synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide and are, therefore, products of mitochondrial protein synthesis; the synthesis of the remaining seven subunits occurs in the presence of chloramphenicol, indicating that these subunits are made on cytoplasmic ribosomes. The synthesis of protein by mitochondria in cultured oocytes appears to be dependent upon cytoplasmic protein synthesis. In the presence of cycloheximide, the mitoribosomal synthesis of the subunits of cytochrome oxidase and rutamycin-sensitive ATPase is detectable only after a prior inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by chloramphenicol. Oocyte mitochondrial ribosomes synthesize at least nine polypeptides after chloramphenicol treatment, three of which are components of neither cytochrome oxidase nor rutamycin-sensitive ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2063748752,"As in the mRNA from all other eucaryotic cells examined, the 5′ nucleotide in messenger RNA from Dictyostelium discoideum is linked by a 5′-5′ triphosphate bridge to the unusual nucleoside 7-methyl guanosine. In mammalian cellular mRNA, the 5′ terminal sequences have the general formula m7GpppXmpYp(m), where X and Y can be either purine or pyrimidine nucleotides and Y, as well as X, may contain a 2′0-methylated ribose. Although at least 32 5′ terminal sequences are possible in cellular mRNA, only four are present in Dictyostelium mRNA. They are (1) m7GpppAp (65%); (II) m7GpppGp (10%); (III) m7GpppAmpAp (10%); (IV) m7GpppAmpUp (10%). Sequences I and II are simpler than those previously reported for mammalian cells because they lack 2′0-methylated nucleosides. Another difference is that in all Dictyostelium mRNAs, the nucleoside X is a purine. The nucleoside 6-methyl adenosine which is found internal to the 5′ end of the mRNA of mammalian cells is not detectable in Dictyostelium mRNA. Thus neither 2′0-methylated nucleotides nor 6-methyl adenosine can represent sites for processing of a primary nuclear transcript to yield mRNA."

The type of binding in vitro of the progesterone-receptor complex to nuclei, chromatin, or DNA of hen organs is largely determined by the ionic strength of the medium. Low ionic conditions (0.01 to 0.05 molar potassium chloride) result in a nonspecific, nonsaturable binding, while high ionic conditions (0.15 to 0.20 molar potassium chloride) create a tissue-specific, saturable binding.

Also assessed was the possible in vitro effect of added insulin on the glucose sensitivity of islets from untreated diabetic animals. Insulin and glucose responsiveness of the two cell types. The rate of glucose entry islet tissue was estimated, and the effect of glucose on the tissue supply of ATP and lactate and the cyclic 3':5'-AMP level of islets was measured under the above in vitro conditions. It was demonstrated that beta-cells are more accessible to glucose than alpha-cells, that glucose entry into islet cells is not significantly modified by insulin and that glucose had no effect on ATP, lactate and cyclic 3':5'-AMP levels of islet tissue under any of the conditions investigated. High insulin in vitro elevated ATP levels of alpha-cell islets independent of extracellular glucose. Glucose caused insulin release from normal but not from diabetic islets and rapidly and efficiently suppressed stimulated glucagon secretion of the pancreas from normal and insulin treated diabetic rats. Glucose was less effective in inhibiting stimulated glucagon secretion by the pancreas from untreated diabetic rats whether insulin was added to the perfusion media or not. Therefore, profound differences of glucose responsiveness of alpha-cells fail to manifest themselves in alterations of basic parameters of glucose and energy metabolism in contrast to what had been postulated in the literature. It is however, apparent that the glucose responsiveness of alpha-cells is modified by insuling by an as yet undefined mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1590100635,"Carbohydrate uptake and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) synthesis were studied employing mutant strains of Escherichia coli in which Enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system was heat-labile. Partial loss of Enzyme I activity, which resulted from incubation of cells at the nonpermissive temperature, depressed the rate and extent of methyl alpha-glucoside uptake. Temperature inactivation of Enzyme I also rendered cyclic AMP synthesis and the uptake of several carbohydrates (glycerol, maltose, melibiose, and lactose) hypersensitive to inhibition by methyl alpha-glucoside. Protein synthesis did not appear to be required for these effects. The parental strains and revertant strains in which Enzyme I was less sensitive to temperature did not exhibit heat-enhanced regulation. Inhibition was abolished by the crr mutation. The results suggest that Enzyme I functions as a catalytic component of the regulatory system.

https://openalex.org/W1497130151,"Guinea pig and rabbit uterine nuclei bound [3H] progesterone in vitro only in the presence of cytosol from estrogen-stimulated uteri. Nuclei from unstimulated and estrogen-stimulated uteri bound progesterone equally well. Nuclei of nontarget tissues also bound progesterone, but to a lesser extent. The rate of nuclear bindins increased with temperature from 0-30 degrees. At 25 degrees nuclear binding remained stable for at least 3 h, but at temperatures of 30 degrees and greater, nuclear binding decreased rapidly after 15 min. Activation of the progesterone-cytoplasmic receptor complex (the change in the complex that enables it to bind quickly to nuclei at 0 degrees) took place slowly at temperatures from 0-5 degrees and rapidly at 10-25 degrees. Activation was facilitated by dilution of the cytosol. Some activation occurred in diluted cytosol in the absence of added progesterone. The cytoplasmic progesterone receptor had a sedimentation coefficient of 7 S when concentrated cytosol (20 mg of protein/ml) was incubated with progesterone at 0 degrees in 5 mM phosphate buffer. Diluting the cytosol and increasing the temperature to 20 degrees caused the sedimentation coefficient to decrease to 5.5 S. Gel filtration of guinea pig uterine cytosol on Sephadex G-100, in the absence of progesterone, yielded a progesterone-binding fraction in the void volume, with a sedimentation coefficient of 5.5 S. The complex of progesterone with the material in the void volume was taken up by nuclei at 0 degrees more rapidly than the complex of progesterone and crude cytosol. The nuclear uptake of progesterone was decreased in phosphate buffer of concentrations greater than 80 mM. Under conditions that favor the nuclear binding of progesterone, the sedimentation coefficient of the cytoplasmic progesterone receptor was 5.5 S. This may be the form of the preceptor which is taken up by nuclei. In decreasing order of effectiveness, unlabeled progesterone, 5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione, corticosterone 20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, testosterone, estradiol-17 beta, and cortisol competed with [3H] progesterone for binding to nuclei."

The divalent cation ionophore A23187 inhibited both basal and stimulated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx. The extent to which influx was inhibited depended on ionophore concentration, extracellular calcium concentration, and time but did not depend on extracellular magnesium. Significant inhibition could be detected at an ionophore concentration of 1 muM and maximal inhibition occurred with 6 muM A23187. A23187 increased cellular uptake of calcium and there was good agred calcium uptake and that for ionophore inhibition of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx. Incubating cells with A23187 and then adding ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid completely reversed ionophore-stimulated cellular calcum uptake but did not reverse inhibition of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx. Thus, A23187 produces irreversible inhibition of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport in dispersed rat thymocytes. Ethanol abolished insulin-stimulated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx but did not alter basal influx or that stimulated by prostaglandin E1, theophylline, or N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. Inhibition could be detected with 0.2% (v/v) ethanol and insulin-stimulated alpha-aminoisobutyric influx was abolished with 1% ethanol. The effect of ethanol occurred immediately and could be reversed completely. This ability of ethanol to inhibit selectively insulin-stimulated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx indicates that the mechanism through which insulin stimulates alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx is functionally distinct from the stimulation produced by cyclic AMP."
