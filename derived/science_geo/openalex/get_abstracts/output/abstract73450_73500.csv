https://openalex.org/W2076173229,"The sex-linked electrophoretic variants A and B of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were studied in 86 samples of myometrium and 27 leiomyomas from five heterozygous women. All but one sample of myometrium had both A and B bands in equal or nearly equal amounts. In contrast to this, all of the leiomyomas had either an A band or a B band. Both A and B tumors were found in all uteri. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that these tumors arose from single cells."

In the inner nuclear layer the fibers synapse with amacrine and displaced ganglion cells. Because of their great number and their even distribution these fibers appear to constitute a system for the localized centrifugal control of the retinal functions."

Auto-radiographic studies of RNA synthesis and protein synthesis show that long-and short-lived messenger RNA's are both present in the lens.

Erythrocytes treated with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene become permeable to Na+ and K+ but do not lyse in buffer or in water, even after extraction with lipid solvents. The difluoro compound crosslinks the membrane and increases its strength. Both reagents appear to remove the positive fixed charge responsible for the cation impermeability of the normal cell."

https://openalex.org/W1981997439,"The kinetics of photooxidation of catalase is a four-step consecutive reaction, if each of the four porphyrin moieties acts independently. The rate of enzyme inactivation is a first-order reaction, resulting from destruction of a single porphyrin. The kinetics of absorbancy is more complex, depending upon the absorption probabilities of each of the microspecies. With equal probabilities. the log of the sum of the normalized absorptivities is a linear function of time."
https://openalex.org/W2020164483,"MANY tumours induced in rodents by chemical carcinogens1 and by viruses2 are antigenic in animals of the same highly inbred strain and even in the primary autochthonous host3. It has, therefore, been suggested that an inadequacy of the immune system may be a factor in allowing the growth of an induced tumour. Much evidence has been obtained in favour of such a hypothesis. Newborn animals, which have an immature immunological system, are much more susceptible to the oncogenic effect of viruses4 and of minute doses of chemical carcinogens5 than are adult animals. Chemical carcinogens have been shown to interfere with the normal immunological defences of the host6. Thymectomy of neonatal mice7, rats8 and hamsters9 leads to some impairment of immunological function, particularly homograft reactivity, and renders animals more susceptible to the oncogenic effects of polyoma virus10 and 3,4-benzopyrene11. The experiments reported here were performed to test the oncogenic activity of another chemical carcinogen, 20-methylcholanthrene, in thymectomized mice. Inbred C57BL mice from the colony maintained at the Chester Beatty Research Institute were thymectomized or sham-thymectomized on the third day of life. At approximately five weeks of age 200 µg 20-methylcholanthrene (MC) in solution in 0.2 ml. tricaprylin was injected intramuscularly into the right thigh. The animals were examined weekly and sarcomata at the injection site were measured and recorded. Mice were killed once the sarcoma reached a size of 18–20 mm diameter, examined post mortem, and material was taken for histological investigation. The results are summarized in Table 1. Thymectomized mice were examined macroscopically and microscopically for thymus remnants, but the four mice in which these were found are not included in the table. All animals, except one sham-thymectomized mouse, developed sarcomata at the injection site."

This edge, as well as the full complex of normal stereoscopy, can be present in the complete absence of physical contours at the fovea to approximately +/- 3.00 degrees from fixation."

https://openalex.org/W2085514185,Partial succinylation of hemerythrin alters its electrophoretic mobility even though it remains an octameric macromolecule. Mixtures of this modified protein and unmodified hemerythrin generate species of intermediate electrophoretic mobility. Such behavior provides strong evidence that the octameric macromolecule is in mobile equilibrium with monomeric subunits.

Details of the method of measurement are given and the results are listed. A mean of 0.15 picocurie per gram has been found in New Zealand tobacco, compared with 0.49 picocurie per gram in United States tobacco. The concentration in South African tobacco was approximately the same as in United States tobacco, but the level in Rhodesian tobacco appeared to be significantly higher."

https://openalex.org/W2006768793,"When indoleacetic acid labeled with carbon-14 in the carboxyl group is fed to excised green pea-stem segments, growth is initiated, and there is a parallel progressive labeling of the RNA extracted by cold phenol. The bulk of the label is found in the 4S fraction. This fraction is more resistant to degradation by ribonuclease than a similar fraction obtained from tissue not treated with indoleacetic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2018481236,"A PRIMARY event of the acute radiation syndrome is depressed haematopoiesis and an associated accumulation of fat cells in the bone marrow cavity. My work has shown that the fatty change occurs only at bone marrow sites directly exposed to ionizing irradiation. On the basis of metabolic investigations, I have concluded that irradiation markedly stimulates the biosynthesis of triglycerides in the bone marrow. Although de novo synthesis of fatty acids by irradiated bone marrow cells is impaired1, both the uptake of lipid and the esterification of fatty acids into triglycerides by marrow cells are markedly stimulated in irradiated animals2. However, the matter of fatty acid oxidation by irradiated marrow cells has not previously been investigated. This communication conclusively demonstrates that fatty acid oxidation is severely inhibited by γ-radiation and that the effect is related to the total dose of radiation received."

https://openalex.org/W2074633295,"Starved suspension cultures of L cells exhibit a plateau phase of short duration followed by loss of key cellular constituents and rapidly decreasing viability. In contrast, regularly fed,. undiluted cultures remain stationary at a high cell density for prolonged periods without structural alterations or loss of viability. The L cells contain a single lactate dehydrogenase isozyme with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of lactate-dehydrogenase-5. High-density stationary cultures show a tenfold increase of the specific activity of this enzyme and a recurrent biphasic pattern of carbohydrate utilization with, first, production and, later, consumption of lactate."
https://openalex.org/W2080329079,"IT is well established in electroencephalography that the alpha rhythm occurs much less frequently when the eyes are open in an illuminated environment than when they are closed. Moreover, if the visual enviroment is patterned, then alpha occurrence is even less frequent. Finally, ‘paying attention’ to the pattern reduces the occurrence of alpha still further1. Although these general descriptions are valid, they can be misleading if one wrongly assumes that ‘much less frequently’ means a very low frequency of occurrence of the alpha rhythm. On the basis of such an assumption one might not attempt certain experiments concerning vision and the alpha rhythm, because the expected amount of alpha rhythm would be too little."

Looss from a Nile hippopotamus in the zoological gardens, Cairo. This hippopotamus must have been taken to Cairo from the Sudan, or possibly from Uganda, because Hippopotamus amphibius has been absent from the River Nile north of Dongola in the Sudan for at least the past 70 years2. The Sudan, or Uganda, and not Egypt, should therefore be given as the locality of the type specimen of O. hippopotami."
