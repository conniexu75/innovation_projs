https://openalex.org/W2094427369,"Tetrachloroethene is a prominent groundwater pollutant that can be reductively dechlorinated by mixed anaerobic microbial populations to the nontoxic product ethene. Strain 195, a coccoid bacterium that dechlorinates tetrachloroethene to ethene, was isolated and characterized. Growth of strain 195 with H 2 and tetrachloroethene as the electron donor and acceptor pair required extracts from mixed microbial cultures. Growth of strain 195 was resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin; its cell wall did not react with a peptidoglycan-specific lectin and its ultrastructure resembled S-layers of Archaea. Analysis of the 16 S ribosomal DNA sequence of strain 195 indicated that it is a eubacterium without close affiliation to any known groups."

https://openalex.org/W1995204178,"Structural alterations of the promoter region of the BCL-6 proto-oncogene represent the most frequent genetic alteration associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a malignancy often deriving from germinal-centre B cells. The BCL-6 gene encodes a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor normally expressed in both B cells and CD4+ T cells within germinal centres, but its precise function is unknown. We show that mice deficient in BCL-6 displayed normal B-cell, T-cell and lymphoid-organ development but have a selective defect in T-cell-dependent antibody responses. This defect included a complete lack of affinity maturation and was due to the inability of follicular B cells to proliferate and form germinal centres. In addition, BCL-6-deficient mice developed an inflammatory response in multiple organs characterized by infiltrations of eosinophils and IgE-bearing B lymphocytes typical of a Th2-mediated hyperimmune response. Thus, BCL-6 functions as a transcriptional switch that controls germinal centre formation and may also modulate specific T-cell-mediated responses. Altered expression of BCL-6 in lymphoma represents a deregulation of the pathway normally leading to B cell proliferation and germinal centre formation."
https://openalex.org/W1987966136,"Cell surface oligosaccharides can be engineered to display unusual functional groups for the selective chemical remodeling of cell surfaces. An unnatural derivative of N-acetyl-mannosamine, which has a ketone group, was converted to the corresponding sialic acid and incorporated into cell surface oligosaccharides metabolically, resulting in the cell surface display of ketone groups. The ketone group on the cell surface can then be covalently ligated under physiological conditions with molecules carrying a complementary reactive functional group such as the hydrazide. Cell surface reactions of this kind should prove useful in the introduction of new recognition epitopes, such as peptides, oligosaccharides, or small organic molecules, onto cell surfaces and in the subsequent modulation of cell-cell or cell-small molecule binding events. The versatility of this technology was demonstrated by an example of selective drug delivery. Cells were decorated with biotin through selective conjugation to ketone groups, and selectively killed in the presence of a ricin A chain-avidin conjugate."

https://openalex.org/W2076398093,"Apoptosis of Jurkat T cells induced the caspase-mediated proteolytic cleavage of p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2). Cleavage occurred between the amino-terminal regulatory domain and the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, which generated a constitutively active PAK2 fragment. Stable Jurkat cell lines that expressed a dominant-negative PAK mutant were resistant to the Fas-induced formation of apoptotic bodies, but had an enhanced externalization of phosphatidylserine at the cell surface. Thus, proteolytic activation of PAK2 represents a guanosine triphosphatase-independent mechanism of PAK regulation that allows PAK2 to regulate morphological changes that are seen in apoptotic cells."

Organic acid excretion has been correlated with aluminum tolerance in higher plants. Overproduction of citrate was shown to result in aluminum tolerance in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and papaya (Carica papaya) plants."
https://openalex.org/W2124478432,"Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) was originally identified as a member of the insulin receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that acquires transforming capability when truncated and fused to nucleophosmin (NPM) in the t(2;5) chromosomal rearrangement associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but further insights into its normal structure and function are lacking. Here, we characterize a full-length normal human ALK cDNA and its product, and determine the pattern of expression of its murine homologue in embryonic and adult tissues as a first step toward the functional assessment of the receptor. Analysis of the 6226 bp ALK cDNA identified an open reading frame encoding a 1620-amino acid (aa) protein of predicted mass ∼177 kDa that is most closely related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK), the two exhibiting 57% aa identity and 71% similarity over their region of overlap. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the ∼177 kDa ALK polypeptide core undergoes co-translational N-linked glycosylation, emerging in its mature form as a 200 kDa single chain receptor. Surface labeling studies indicated that the 200 kDa glycoprotein is exposed at the cell membrane, consistent with the prediction that ALK serves as the receptor for an unidentified ligand(s). In situ hybridization studies revealed Alk expression beginning on embryonic day 11 and persisting into the neonatal and adult periods of development. Alk transcripts were confined to the nervous system and included several thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei; the trigeminal, facial, and acoustic cranial ganglia; the anterior horns of the spinal cord in the region of the developing motor neurons; the sympathetic chain; and the ganglion cells of the gut. Thus, ALK is a novel orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that appears to play an important role in the normal development and function of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2060619702,"DNA amplification on chromosome 20q13 is commonly detected in breast cancer and correlates with poor prognosis. Definitive critical target genes on this amplicon have however, not yet been identified. We describe in this paper isolation of a novel gene named BTAK, encoding a putative member of protein serine/threonine kinase family localized on chromosome 20q13 that is amplified and overexpressed in breast tumor cell lines. BTAK maps close to the critical region of amplification defined earlier on this amplicon. Deduced amino acid sequence shows conservation of all the subdomains predicted in protein kinase super family. Translated BTAK peptide shows significant homology with previously cloned protein serine/threonine kinase encoding genes Ip11 from S cerevisae and aurora from Drosophila, both shown to be functionally involved in normal chromosome segregation process. Our findings suggest that amplification and overexpression of BTAK may be playing a critical role in oncogenic transformation of breast tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2040131430,"Pheromones are intraspecific chemical signals important for mate attraction and discrimination. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , hydrocarbons on the cuticular surface of the animal are sexually dimorphic in both their occurrence and their effects: Female-specific molecules stimulate male sexual excitation, whereas the predominant male-specific molecule tends to inhibit male excitation. Complete feminization of the pheromone mixture produced by males was induced by targeted expression of the transformer gene in adult oenocytes (subcuticular abdominal cells) or by ubiquitous expression during early imaginal life. The resulting flies generally exhibited male heterosexual orientation but elicited homosexual courtship from other males."
https://openalex.org/W2060606536,"In primary visual cortex of higher mammals neurons are grouped according to their orientation preference, forming ""pinwheels"" around ""orientation centers."" Although the general structure of orientation maps is largely resolved, the microscopic arrangement of neuronal response properties in the orientation centers has remained elusive. The tetrode technique, enabling multiple single-unit recordings, in combination with intrinsic signal imaging was used to reveal the fine-grain structure of orientation maps in these locations. The results show that orientation centers represent locations where orientation columns converge containing normal, sharply tuned neurons of different orientation preference lying in close proximity."
https://openalex.org/W1968002116,"Silencing of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has several links to DNA replication, including a role for the origin recognition complex (ORC), the DNA replication initiator, in both processes. In addition, the establishment of silencing at the HML and HMR loci requires cells to pass through the S phase of the cell cycle. Passage through S phase was required for silencing of HMR even under conditions in which ORC itself was no longer required. The requirement for ORC in silencing of HMR could be bypassed by tethering the Sir1 protein to the HMR-E silencer. However, ORC had a Sir1-independent role in transcriptional silencing at telomeres. Thus, the role of ORC in silencing was separable from its role in initiation, and the role of S phase in silencing was independent of replication initiation at the silencers."

https://openalex.org/W2089620206,"Self-incompatibility in Brassica refers to the rejection of self-related pollen and is mediated by a receptor protein kinase localized to the plasma membrane of the stigma epidermis in the flower. The recessive mutation mod eliminates self-incompatibility in the stigma. In mod mutants, self-compatibility was shown to be associated with the absence of transcripts encoded by an aquaporin-related gene. This observation suggests that a water channel is required for the self-incompatibility response of Brassica , which is consistent with the concept that regulation of water transfer from the stigma to pollen is a checkpoint in the early events of pollination in the crucifer family."

https://openalex.org/W2330808969,"In this study we describe the presence of high affinity FGF-2 binding sites in the nuclei of U251MG glioma cells (K(d)=7 pM). Immunoprecipitation of total cell extracts with FGF receptor (FGFR) 1-4 antibodies showed that U251MG glioma cells express only FGFR1. [125I]FGF-2 cross linking to nuclear extracts followed by FGFR1 immunoprecipitation showed that FGFR1 may account for the nuclear FGF-2 binding sites. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of 103, 118 kDa and small amounts of 145 kDa FGFR1 isoforms in the nuclei of glioma cells. All isoforms contain both the C- and N-terminal domains. Nuclear FGFR1 retains kinase activity. Immunocytochemistry using confocal microscopy showed specific FGFR1 immunoreactivity within the nuclear interior. In continuously proliferating glioma cells, nuclear FGFR1 is constitutively expressed, independent of cell density. In contrast, in nontransformed human astrocytes, nuclear FGFR1 levels fluctuate with the proliferative state of the cell. In quiescent, confluent astrocytes nuclear FGFR1 protein was depleted. An accumulation of nuclear FGFR1 was observed following the transition to a subconfluent, proliferating state. Transfection of a pcDNA3.1-FGFR1 expression vector into glioma cells that do not express FGFR1 resulted in the nuclear accumulation of FGFR1, increased cell proliferation, and stimulated transition from the G0/G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle. The increased proliferative rate was resistant to inhibition by the cell-impermeable FGF binding antagonist, myoinositol hexakis [dihydrogen phosphate]. Our results suggest that the constitutive nuclear presence of FGFR1 contributes to the increased proliferation of glioma cells while the transient nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 in normal astrocytes may play a role in the transition to a reactive state."

https://openalex.org/W2330922316,"The 120 kD product of the c-cbl oncogene is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated and recruited to the EGF receptor following ligand binding. Cbl's oncogenic potential is activated by a large carboxy-terminal truncation that generated v-cbl and removes the Ring finger and proline-rich SH3-binding domains. Here we show that this truncation reveals a novel and highly conserved domain that can interact directly with the EGF receptor in a phosphorylation dependent manner. Furthermore we demonstrate that the v-cbl domain is not utilized by c-cbl for recruitment to the receptor since this binding property is not evident in c-cbl constructs with proline domain deletions, and it is only revealed following deletion of the Ring finger. We also analyse a loss-of-function mutation from the C. elegans homologue, sli-1, and show that the corresponding mutation in v-cbl ablates transformation and EGF receptor association. Thus our findings provide further evidence that v-cbl possesses a novel and evolutionarily conserved phosphotyrosine binding domain and that the dual capability of EGF receptor binding by cbl involves two distinct mechanisms. In addition these findings raise the possibility that v-cbl may transform by competing with c-cbl for phosphorylated binding sites on activated receptor complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2038579579,"Increased tyrosine kinase activity of abl oncogene in Philadelphia chromosome positive-leukemic cells leads to activation of p21ras and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3-Kinase). The mechanism of activation of these signaling pathways is not understood, but numerous studies have focused on the identification and characterization of downstream substrates of BCR/abl tyrosine kinase as potential mediators of oncogenic signaling. It was recently found that the 120 kDa protein product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene is highly tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with BCR/abl in transformed hematopoietic cells. We have characterized further cbl's involvement in BCR/abl mediated tumorigenesis using growth factor independent BCR/abl transformed BaF3 cells. Our experiments show that, in contrast to other cell types, the in vivo interaction of cbl with GRB2 and p85 is significantly enhanced in BCR/abl transformed BaF3 cells and that tyrosine phosphorylation of cbl leads to a direct interaction with GRB2, p85 and abl SH2 domains. A 14-fold increase in cbl associated PI 3-kinase activity in BCR/abl transformed cells suggests that the binding of p85 SH2 domains to tyrosine phosphorylated cbl may contribute to PI 3-kinase activation. Domain analysis studies indicate that both SH3 domains of GRB2 bind to the proline rich region of cbl in quiescent BaF3 cells, whereas GRB2 SH2 domain interacts with a non-contiguous sequence of cbl in transformed cells. Although the interaction of cbl with GRB2 in transformed cells was facilitated by binding of GRB2 to BCR/abl, phosphorylation of cbl and its interaction with p190 BCR/abl remained unaltered in BaF3 cells transformed by p190Y177F BCR/abl mutant which is unable to bind GRB2. The current information and the data presented here suggest that, although cbl lacks src homology domains, it represents a novel intermediate protein which, by interaction with key SH-containing adaptor proteins, may participate in regulation of the Ras and PI 3-kinase pathways in BCR/abl transformed hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020752442,"The radiation response was investigated in two lymphoblastoid cell lines (LBC) derived from families with heterozygous germ-line missense mutations of p53 at codon 282 (LBC282) and 286 (LBC286), and compared to cells with wt/wt p53(LBC-N). By gel retardation assays, we show that p53-containing nuclear extracts from irradiated LBC282 and LBC286 markedly differ in their ability to bind to a p53 DNA consensus sequence, the former generating a shifted band whose intensity is 30 – 40% that of LBC-N, the latter generating an almost undetectable band. Unlike LBC286, which fail to arrest in G1 after irradiation, LBC282 have an apparently normal G1/S checkpoint, as they arrest in G1, like LBC-N. While in LBC-N, accumulation of p53 and transactivation of p21WAF1 increase rapidly and markedly by 3 h after exposure to γ-radiation, in LBC286 there is only a modest accumulation of p53 and a significantly delayed and quantitatively reduced transactivation of p21WAF1. Instead, in LBC282 while p53 levels rise little after irradiation, p21WAF1 levels increase rapidly and significantly as in normal LBC. Apoptotic cells present 48 h after irradiation account for 32% in LBC-N, 8 – 9% in LBC282 and 5 – 7% in LBC286, while the dose of γ-radiation required for killing 50% of cells (LD50) is 400 rads, 1190 rads and 3190 rads, respectively, hence indicating that the heterozygous mutations of p53 at codon 282 affects radioresistance and survival, but not the G1/S cell cycle control. In all LBC tested, radiation-induced apoptosis occurs in all phases of the cell cycle and appears not to directly involve changes in the levels of the apoptosis-associated proteins bcl-2, bax and mcl-1. Both basal as well as radiation-induced p53 and p21WAF1 proteins are detected by Western blotting of FACS-purified G1, S and G2/M fractions from the three cell lines. p34CDC2-Tyr15, the inactive form of p34CDC2 kinase phosphorylated on Tyr15, is found in S and G2/M fractions, but not in G1. However, 24 h after irradiation, its levels in these fractions diminish appreciably in LBC-N but not in the radioresistant LBC286 and LBC282. Concomitantly, p34CDC2 histone H1 kinase activity increases in the former, but not in the latter cell lines, hence suggesting a role for this protein in radiation-induced cell death. Altogether, this study shows that, in cells harbouring heterozygous mutations of p53, the G1 checkpoint is not necessarily disrupted, and this may be related to the endogenous p53 heterocomplexes having lost or not the capacity to bind DNA (and therefore transactivate target genes). Radiation-induced cell death is not cell cycle phase specific, does not involve the regulation of bcl-2, bax or mcl-1, but is associated with changes in the phosphorylation state and activation of p34CDC2 kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2324429237,"We have isolated and characterized the first Xenopus transmembrane Eph ligand, XLerk (Xenopus Ligand for Eph Receptor Tyrosine Kinases). While this ligand has 72% identity with the closest mammalian family member, Lerk-2, it is the cytoplasmic domain of this molecule that is the most conserved domain with 95% identity. XLerk exists as a maternally expressed mRNA, however, expression of transcripts and protein increase during gastrulation and again in the late swimming tadpole stage. In the adult, XLerk is expressed at low levels in most adult tissues with increased levels observed in the kidney, oocytes, ovary and testis. While low levels of XLerk expression are observed in the adult brain, in situ hybridization analysis demonstrates prominent expression in the developing olfactory system, retina, hindbrain, cranial ganglia, and somites. Furthermore, we have shown that XLerk transcripts are significantly elevated during mesoderm induction caused by activin and FGF, but not during noggin-induced neuralization. These results suggest a role for XLerk in the developing mesenchymal and nervous tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2331585102,"Alterations of BRCA2 result in increased susceptibility to breast cancer in both men and women (relative lifetime risks of 0.06 and 0.8 respectively). BRCA2 maps to 13q12-q13 and encodes a transcript of 10 157 bp. Other cancers that have been described in BRCA2 mutation carriers include those of the larynx. Human chromosome 13q has been shown previously by LOH studies to harbor several tumor suppressor genes for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCCs). We therefore examined the role of BRCA2 in the development of these cancers. Only 6/22 (27%) of the laryngeal cancers we examined demonstrated LOH of the BRCA2-containing region. These and 10 other HNSCCs of different origins that were demonstrated by LOH studies to have lost the region of chromosome 13 containing BRCA2 were examined for alterations in this gene. SSCP analysis failed to reveal any alterations leading us to conclude that BRCA2 alterations are not frequently involved in the pathogenesis of HNSCCs and that the observed LOH of chromosome 13 loci is due to other, as yet, unidentified tumor suppressor gene(s). Interestingly tumors with LOH in this region (proximal to D13S118) were far more likely to be derived from women than men. This is unusual since HNSCCs are usually fourfold more common in men than in women."
