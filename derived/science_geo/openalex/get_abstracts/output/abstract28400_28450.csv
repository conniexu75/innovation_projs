https://openalex.org/W1980477679,"The gene designated gamma 134.5 maps in the inverted repeats flanking the long unique sequence of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) DNA, and therefore it is present in two copies per genome. This gene is not essential for viral growth in cell culture. Four recombinant viruses were genetically engineered to test the function of this gene. These were (i) a virus from which both copies of the gene were deleted, (ii) a virus containing a stop codon in both copies of the gene, (iii) a virus containing after the first codon an insert encoding a 16-amino acid epitope known to react with a specific monoclonal antibody, and (iv) a virus in which the deleted sequences were restored. The viruses from which the gene was deleted or which carried stop codons were avirulent on intracerebral inoculation of mice. The virus with the gene tagged by the sequence encoding the epitope was moderately virulent, whereas the restored virus reacquired the phenotype of the parent virus. Significant amounts of virus were recovered only from brains of animals inoculated with virulent viruses. Inasmuch as the product of the gamma 134.5 gene extended the host range of the virus by enabling it to replicate and destroy brain cells, it is a viral neurovirulence factor."
https://openalex.org/W1966831459,"Phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) and p21ras guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP) bind to and are phosphorylated by activated growth factor receptors. Both PLC gamma 1 and GAP contain two adjacent copies of the noncatalytic Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. The SH2 domains of PLC gamma 1 synthesized individually in bacteria formed high affinity complexes with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)- or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-receptors in cell lysates, and bound synergistically to activated receptors when expressed together as one bacterial protein. In vitro complex formation was dependent on prior growth factor stimulation and was competed by intracellular PLC gamma 1. Similar results were obtained for binding of GAP SH2 domains to the PDGF-receptor. The isolated SH2 domains of other signaling proteins, such as p60src and Crk, also bound activated PDGF-receptors in vitro. SH2 domains, therefore, provide a common mechanism by which enzymatically diverse regulatory proteins can physically associate with the same activated receptors and thereby couple growth factor stimulation to intracellular signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1599556324,"The present study examined the effects of endothelin-1 on phosphoinositide hydrolysis, diacylglycerol formation, and the induction of myocardial cell hypertrophy utilizing a well characterized cultured neonatal rat myocardial cell model. In this system, a hypertrophic response can be assessed by increases in myocardial cell size, an increase in the assembly of an individual contractile protein (myosin light chain-2) into organized contractile units, accumulation of contractile proteins, the activation of a program of immediate early gene expression, and the induction of genes encoding contractile and embryonic proteins (Iwaki, K., Sukhatme, V., Shubeita, H.E., Chien, K.R., (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13809-13817). Utilizing these criteria, the present study documents that stimulation with endothelin-1 can produce myocardial cell hypertrophy, induce the expression and release of ANF in ventricular cells, and can activate the transcription of cardiac-specific genes. In addition, endothelin-1 stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the accumulation of diacylglycerol. It is proposed that endothelin-1 stimulation may represent an important paracrine mechanism for the in vivo regulation of cardiac growth and hypertrophy."

Recombinant BCRF1 protein mimics the activity of interleukin-10, suggesting that BCRF1 may have a role in the interaction of the virus with the host's immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2004829388,"Deep inflation of the lung stimulates surfactant secretion by unknown mechanisms. The hypothesis that mechanical distension directly stimulates type II cells to secrete surfactant was tested by stretching type II cells cultured on silastic membranes. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured in single cells, before and after stretching. A single stretch of alveolar type II cells caused a transient (less than 60 seconds) increase in cytosolic Ca2+ followed by a sustained (15 to 30 minutes) stimulation of surfactant secretion. Both Ca2+ mobilization and exocytosis exhibited dose-dependence to the magnitude of the stretch-stimulus. Thus, mechanical factors can trigger complex cellular events in nonneuron, nonmuscle cells and may be involved in regulating normal lung functions."
https://openalex.org/W2010762668,"Elevated free Ca2+ concentrations found in adult dystrophic muscle fibers result in enhanced protein degradation. Since the difference in concentrations may reflect differences in entry, Ca2+ leak channels in cultures of normal and Duchenne human myotubes, and normal and mdx murine myotubes, have been identified and characterized. The open probability of leak channels is markedly increased in dystrophic myotubes. Other channel properties, such as mean open times, single channel conductance, ion selectivity, and behavior in the presence of pharmacological agents, were similar among myotube types. Compared to the Ca2+ concentrations in normal human and normal mouse myotubes, intracellular resting free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in myotubes of Duchenne and mdx origin were significantly higher at a time when dystrophin is first expressed in normal tissue. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased open probability of Ca2+ leak channels contributes to the elevated free intracellular Ca2+ concentration in Duchenne human and mdx mouse myotubes."

https://openalex.org/W2045139512,"Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by episodes of muscle weakness due to depolarization of the muscle cell membrane associated with elevated serum potassium. Electrophysiological studies have implicated the adult muscle sodium channel. Here, portions of the adult muscle sodium channel alpha-subunit gene were cloned and mapped near the human growth hormone locus (GH1) on chromosome 17. In a large pedigree displaying HYPP with myotonia, these two loci showed tight linkage to the genetic defect with no recombinants detected. Thus, it is likely that the sodium channel alpha-subunit gene contains the HYPP mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2093915334,"The regulation of DNA replication during the eukaryotic cell cycle was studied in a system where cell free replication of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA was used as a model for chromosome replication. A factor, RF-S, was partially purified from human S phase cells based on its ability to activate DNA replication in extracts from G1 cells. RF-S contained a human homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe p34cdc2 kinase, and this kinase was necessary for RF-S activity. The limiting step in activation of the p34 kinase at the G1 to S transition may be its association with a cyclin since addition of cyclin A to a G1 extract was sufficient to start DNA replication. These observations suggest that the role of p34cdc2 in controlling the start of DNA synthesis has been conserved in evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2001024278,"The ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus (VMN) are important for the control of feminine mating behavior, and hormone action within these nuclei has been causally related to behavior. Estradiol induces receptors for oxytocin in the VMN and in the area lateral to these nuclei over the course of 1 to 2 days, and progesterone causes, within 30 minutes of its application, a further increase in receptor binding and an expansion of the area covered by these receptors lateral to the VMN. The rapid progesterone effect appears to be a direct and specific effect of this steroid on the receptor or membrane, because it was produced in vitro as well as in vivo and was not mimicked by a variety of other steroids. The effect of progesterone occurred in the posterior part of the VMN, where oxytocin infusion facilitated feminine mating behavior; it did not take place in the anterior part of the VMN, where oxytocin infusion had no effect on mating behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1554849134,"Ferrylhemoglobin (X-FeIV-OH, where X denotes an amino acid residue in the globin moiety) has long been suspected as a cytotoxic agent produced by the interaction of oxyhemoglobin (X-FeIIO2) or methemoglobin (X-FeIII) with H2O2 in red blood cells. To date, however, technical difficulties have prevented the identification and quantification of X-FeIV-OH. Oxyhemoglobin exposed to a continuous flux of H2O2 (generated at a rate of 120 microM/min during the glucose oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of glucose) was oxidized to (a) X-FeIV-OH when [X-FeIIO2] less than 75 microM and (b) X-FeIII when [X-FeIIO2] greater than 75 microM (the production of X-FeIII proceeded with intermediate formation of X-FeIV-OH). The reduction of the X-FeIV-OH to X-FeIII could be explained by either of two alternative mechanisms: a O2(-)-mediated X-FeIV-OH---X-FeIII transition or a comproportionation of X-FeIV-OH and X-FeIIO2 to yield X-FeIII (a process mediated by a tyrosine moiety in the hemoprotein). The low rate of X-FeIIO2 autoxidation plus the negligible decrease in the rate of X-FeIII formation in the presence of either native or heat-denatured superoxide dismutase or apoenzyme (1 microM) suggested that O2- does not contribute to the reduction of X-FeIV-OH. Moreover, the dependence of X-FeIII formation on X-FeIIO2 concentration, together with the results of O2 uptake and H2O2 consumption measurements, provide experimental evidence to support the comproportionation reaction. Comproportionation is apparently catalyzed by intermolecular electron transfer between tyrosine residues, since the reaction did not occur when tyrosine residues were blocked by acetylation. Intact red blood cells exposed to the same flow rate of H2O2 presented a spectral profile which could be explained as a transition from X-FeIIO2 to X-FeIII. The intermediate production of X-FeIV-OH was detected by adding Na2S (2 mM), which revealed a spectral profile identical with that obtained with purified X-FeIV-OH. Measurements of concentrations and relative rate constants for the reaction of various intracellular reductants (glutathione, NAD(P)H, uric acid, ascorbic acid) with X-FeIV-OH revealed that comproportionation of X-FeIV-OH with X-FeIIO2 is the favored reaction. Our results provide (to our knowledge) the first definitive evidence for X-FeIV-OH in intact red blood cells. The rapid comproportionation reaction between X-FeIV-OH and X-FeIIO2 (to produce X-FeIII) explains why X-FeIV-OH has been elusive to date.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1581967973,"In this study, we analyzed the expression of genes encoding for components of the phagocyte superoxide anion-generating system in human phagocytes treated with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Human neutrophils express high levels of the 47-kDa cytosolic factor (p47-phox), which are down-regulated after treatment with IFN-gamma, but not with LPS. On the contrary, the steady-state levels of the heavy chain subunit of cytochrome b558 (gp91-phox) were increased by IFN-gamma and LPS in human monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, whereas cytochrome b558 light chain subunit (p22-phox) mRNA was not influenced by either agent. Studies on post-transcriptional regulation at the level of mRNA stability indicate that, in neutrophils, IFN-gamma has no influence on gp91-phox and p47-phox mRNA half-lives. The content of the two cytochrome b558 subunits was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which revealed that, in neutrophils, gp91-phox levels doubled after 4 h of treatment with IFN-gamma or LPS. Monocyte/macrophage maturation was associated with a gradual decrease in gp91-phox mRNA and protein levels, which were both restored by treatment with IFN-gamma for 24-48 h. These results suggest that induction of the gp91-phox gene and protein product by IFN-gamma or LPS is an important requirement in the mechanism of the enhancement of neutrophil and macrophage oxidative metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1577261117,"A rat testicular luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor cDNA containing a 266-base pair deletion resulting in the omission of the 1st transmembrane region and truncation of the open reading frame was isolated using a rat ovarian LH receptor cDNA probe. Comparison of this clone with a restriction fragment from the LH receptor genomic DNA revealed potential alternative splice sites following the consensus sequence TTXCAG that is present at an intron acceptor splice site and also within the next exon, accounting for the specific deletion mutation observed in this cDNA. Expression of the testicular cDNA in COS1 cells resulted in synthesis and secretion of a soluble binding protein with high affinity and specificity for LH and human chorionic gonadotropin. These studies have demonstrated that the LH receptor gene contains intron(s) within the region coding for the extracellular domain of the molecule, which determine the nature and generation of LH receptor isoforms. Expression of the soluble form of the LH receptor has indicated that the amino-terminal extracellular region plays a major role in gonadotropin binding. These features of the LH receptor are distinct from those of most other G protein-coupled receptors, which are intronless and contain their binding sites within the transmembrane region rather than the extracellular domain."
https://openalex.org/W1972183015,"The Ca2+ that activates contraction in heart muscle is regulated as in skeletal muscle by processes that depend on voltage and intracellular Ca2+ and involve a positive feedback system. How the initial electrical signal is amplified in heart muscle has remained controversial, however. Analogous protein structures from skeletal muscle and heart muscle have been identified physiologically and sequenced; these include the Ca2+ channel of the sarcolemma and the Ca2+ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although the parallels found in cardiac and skeletal muscles have provoked valuable experiments in both tissues, separation of the effects of voltage and intracellular Ca2+ on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in heart muscle has been imperfect. With the use of caged Ca2+ and flash photolysis in voltage-clamped heart myocytes, effects of membrane potential in heart muscle cells on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores have been studied. Unlike the response in skeletal muscle, voltage across the sarcolemma of heart muscle does not affect the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that other regulatory processes are needed to control Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release."

https://openalex.org/W1510358804,"Neurokinin A (substance K) is a peptide neurotransmitter of the tachykinin family with potential as a major mediator in human airway and gastrointestinal tissues. Neurokinin A acts via a receptor (the NK-2 receptor) believed to be localized on smooth muscle cells and pharmacologically coupled to a GTP-binding protein. To characterize the human NK-2 receptor, we prepared a partial cDNA from human tracheal RNA using the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers derived from the bovine NK-2 receptor cDNA sequence (Masu, Y., Nakayama, K., Tamaki, H., Harada, Y., Kuno, M., Nakanishi, S. (1987) Nature 329, 836-838). This partial human NK-2 receptor cDNA was used to screen a human genomic DNA library and yielded a clone, NGNK-2, of approximately 25 kilobases. Analysis of NGNK-2 indicates that it contains the entire coding sequence of the NK-2 receptor as well as 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. The gene is organized with five exons interrupted by four introns. The complete sequence of the exons and the intron-exon junctions was determined, as were the transcription initiation site and the 3'-polyadenylation signal. Analysis of EcoRI digests of genomic DNA from human-mouse cell hybrids indicates a single gene for the human NK-2 receptor localized to chromosome 10. Sequence analysis of exons 1 and 5, where major differences occur between the human and animal species, provided information for polymerase chain reaction primers which allowed us to prepare full-length cDNA for the human NK-2 receptor. The protein predicted from the gene sequence is extended by 14 amino acids at the COOH terminus compared to the bovine and 9 residues compared to the rat molecules. The seven membrane-spanning regions are encoded by exons 1-4 and none is interrupted by introns. These regions are highly conserved among the species studied, suggesting stringent evolutionary control over these molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2024187144,"The Wilms tumor locus on chromosome 11p13 has been mapped to a region defined by overlapping, tumor-specific deletions. Complementary DNA clones representing transcripts of 2.5 (WIT-1) and 3.5 kb (WIT-2) mapping to this region were isolated from a kidney complementary DNA library. Expression of WIT-1 and WIT-2 was restricted to kidney and spleen. RNase protection revealed divergent transcription of WIT-1 and WIT-2, originating from a DNA region of less than 600 bp. Both transcripts were present at high concentrations in fetal kidney and at much reduced amounts in 5-year-old and adult kidneys. Eleven of 12 Wilms tumors classified as histopathologically heterogeneous exhibited absent or reduced expression of WIT-2, whereas only 4 of 14 histopathologically homogeneous tumors showed reduced expression. These data demonstrate a molecular basis for the pathogenetic heterogeneity in Wilms tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1555039175,"The sequence specificity of chicken mRNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase has been investigated in vivo. Localization of six new N6-methyladenosine sites on Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) virion RNA has confirmed our extended consensus sequence for methylation: RGACU, where R is usually a G (7/12). We have also observed A (2/12) and U (3/12) at the -2 position (relative to m6A at +1) but never a C. At the +3 position, the U was observed 10/12 times; an A and a C were observed once each in weakly methylated sequences. The extent of methylation varied between the different sites up to a maximum of about 90%. To test the significance of this consensus sequence, it was altered by site-specific mutagenesis, and methylation was assayed after transfection of mutated RSV DNA into chicken embryo fibroblasts. We found that changing the G at -1 or the U at +3 to any other residue inhibited methylation. However, inhibition of methylation at all four of the major sites in the RSV src gene did not detectably alter the steady-state levels of the three viral RNA species or viral infectivity. Additional mutants that inactivated the src protein kinase activity produced less virus and exhibited relatively less src mRNA in infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2031760182,"Wilms tumor is an embryonal kidney tumor involving complex pathology and genetics. The Wilms tumor locus on chromosome 11p13 is defined by the region of overlap of constitutional and tumor-associated deletions. Chromosome walking and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) cloning were used to clone and map 850 kilobases of DNA. Nine CpG islands, constituting a ""CpG island archipelago,"" were identified, including three islands that were not apparent by conventional pulsed-field mapping, and thus were at least partially methylated. Three distinct transcriptional units were found closely associated with a CpG island within the boundaries of a homozygous DNA deletion in a Wilms tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2085016362,"Deletion of chromosome 11p13 in humans produces the WAGR syndrome, consisting of aniridia (an absence or malformation of the iris), Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), genitourinary malformations, and mental retardation. An interspecies backcross between Mus musculus/domesticus and Mus spretus was made in order to map the homologous chromosomal region in the mouse genome and to define an animal model of this syndrome. Nine evolutionarily conserved DNA clones from proximal human 11p were localized on mouse chromosome 2 near Small-eyes (Sey), a semidominant mutation that is phenotypically similar to aniridia. Analysis of Dickie's Small-eye (SeyDey), a poorly viable allele that has pleiotropic effects, revealed the deletion of three clones, f3, f8, and k13, which encompass the aniridia (AN2) and Wilms tumor susceptibility genes in man. Unlike their human counterparts, SeyDey/+ mice do not develop nephroblastomas. These findings suggest that the Small-eye defect is genetically equivalent to human aniridia, but that loss of the murine homolog of the Wilms tumor gene is not sufficient for tumor initiation. A comparison among Sey alleles suggests that the AN2 gene product is required for induction of the lens and nasal placodes."
https://openalex.org/W2298026931,"To assess the functional significance of phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor at Thr654, we compared the effects of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (TPA) on ligand-induced internalization and down-regulation between wild-type and mutant receptors that contain an alanine substitution at position 654. Activation of protein kinase C with TPA blocked EGF-induced internalization and down-regulation of Thr654 receptors and inhibited in vivo tyrosine kinase activity by 80%. TPA did not inhibit transferrin receptor internalization or constitutive EGF receptor internalization, suggesting that protein kinase C activation inhibits only the ligand-induced process. Inhibition by TPA of induced internalization, down-regulation, and kinase activity required threonine at position 654 since full-length Ala654 EGF receptors were significantly resistant to TPA inhibition of these ligand-induced activities. However, C'-terminal truncation further enhanced this resistance to TPA inhibition. The EGF-dependent internalization of kinase-inactive receptors truncated at residue 1022 was also impaired by TPA in Thr654 receptors, but not in Ala654 receptors, indicating that phosphorylation at Thr654 also interferes with tyrosine kinase-independent receptor activities. We conclude that the dominant regulatory effect of protein kinase C on the EGF receptor is mediated through phosphorylation at Thr654 which effectively inactivates the receptor. The submembrane region of the EGF receptor appears to regulate transmission of conformational information from the extracellular ligand-binding site to the cytoplasmic kinase and regulatory domains."
https://openalex.org/W1553119709,"Deuteration at selected positions on the phenol ring and at the beta-methylene carbon for the YD.tyrosine radical in Photosystem II in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 was achieved by growing the organism under conditions in which it is a functional aromatic amino acid auxotroph (Barry, B. A., and Babcock, G. T. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 7099-7103). A series of model tyrosine radicals, also deuterated at specific sites on the aromatic ring and the methylene group, was generated by UV irradiation of frozen solutions. The EPR spectra of the specifically deuterated in vivo radicals confirm that YD.is a tyrosine; nevertheless its spectra differ from those of the tyrosine models. By comparing the EPR spectra of the specifically deuterated radicals with those of the fully protonated, the hyperfine couplings of the various protons of both YD.and the model compound radicals were determined. For both species, the unpaired electron spin density distribution is essentially identical and follows an odd-alternant pattern with high rho values at the carbons ortho and para to the tyrosine phenol oxygen; the meta positions have low spin densities. The differences in EPR spectral characteristics for the two radicals are rationalized as arising from variations in the conformation of the beta-methylene group with respect to the phenol head group. Considering these EPR results and those reported for other model and naturally occurring tyrosine radicals, we conclude that this situation is general; there is little deviation in this class of compounds from the odd-alternant spin density distribution; variations in EPR lineshapes arise primarily from variations in beta-methylene orientation. The conformation of the -CH2- group in biologically active tyrosine radicals deviates from that observed in the models and may be functionally significant. Because the EPR spectrum of YZ., the second redox active tyrosine radical in Photosystem II, is identical to that of YD., we conclude that the two radicals are in similar protein environments, a conclusion that is supported by the protein sequences in the vicinity of the two radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1547266858,"The Ah receptor in rat hepatic cytosol was transformed to a DNA-binding form by incubation in vitro with the ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The transformed receptor was covalently cross-linked to a bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA recognition motif by exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. Analyses of the cross-linked protein-DNA complexes by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography imply that the DNA-binding form of the liganded Ah receptor is composed of two protein components, whose molecular masses are about 110 and 100 kDa. Protease digestion studies suggest that the two components have different primary structures. Photoaffinity labeling studies imply that the smaller protein is the ligand-binding component of the receptor. These findings constitute biochemical evidence that the DNA-binding form of the Ah receptor is a heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W2060720125,"GLYCINE is an important inhibitory transmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord1,2. In the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (medullary dorsal horn) and in the spinal dorsal horn (the relaying centres for processing pain and sensory information3–5), glycine inhibits the glutamate-evoked depolarization and depresses firing of neurons6. The binding of glycine to its receptor produces a large increase in Cl− conductance, which causes membrane hyper-polarization7. The selectivity and gating properties of glycine receptor channels have been well characterized8; the glycine receptor molecules have also been purified9–11. The amino-acid sequence, deduced from complementary DNA clones encoding one of the peptides (the 48K subunit)12, shows significant homology with γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, suggesting that glycine receptors may belong to a superfamily of chemically gated channel proteins12,13. However, very little is known about the modulation of glycine receptor channels. We have investigated the regulation of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor channels by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in neurons isolated from spinal trigeminal nucleus of rat and report here that the protein kinase A dramatically increased the glycine-induced Cl− currents by increasing the probability of the channel openings. GS protein, which is sensitive to cholera toxin, was involved in the modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1575075003,"Type IV collagenase (gelatinase) readily cleaves denatured collagen into very small peptides. Large cyanogen bromide fragments (25 kDa) of type I collagen are degraded at the same rate as the complete alpha-chain. A number of the gelatinolytic cleavage sites of alpha 1(I)CB7 and alpha 1(I)CB8, representing 50% of the collagen alpha-chain, were determined by sequence analysis of product peptides. In addition to the expected cleavage between glycine and hydrophobic residues, several other cleavage sites were identified. These sites were Gly-Glu, Gly-Asn, and Gly-Ser. Basic residues were found adjacent to the cleavage site in several cases. Hexapeptides containing these unexpected cleavage sites were synthesized, and Km and kcat values were determined. All but one of the Km values were in the submillimolar range, and turnover numbers for the peptides uncharged at the carboxyl terminus were on the order of 10,000/h. Of particular significance was the finding that hydroxyproline occurs 5 residues from the cleavage site in all carboxyl-terminal product peptides and also occurs 5 residues from the cleavage site in seven of nine amino-terminal product peptides. A requirement for hydroxyproline may be of importance in determining the specificity of this enzyme for denatured collagenous substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1604164531,Two distinct tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors of 55- and 75-kDa apparent molecular masses previously identified on the cell surface by monoclonal antibodies have been solubilized with Triton X-100 from HL60 cells. A filter-based dot blot assay was developed to monitor specific 125I-TNF alpha binding during fractionation of the cell extract. By a combination of immuno- and ligand affinity chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography both receptor proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed two bands at 55 and 51 kDa for the 55-kDa TNF receptor and a major 75-kDa and a minor 65-kDa band for the 75-kDa TNF receptor. All these bands specifically bound TNF alpha and TNF beta in ligand blot experiments. The exclusive specificity of monoclonal antibodies of the utr series for the 75.65-kDa bands and of the htr series for the 55.51-kDa bands was demonstrated with the purified antigens on Western blots. Both TNF receptor types were found to contain N-linked carbohydrates. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the 55- and 51-kDa bands of the 55-kDa TNF receptor revealed identical sequences suggesting a possible truncation at the C-terminal end. Two different N-terminal sequences were determined for the 65-kDa band. One corresponded to the published sequence of ubiquitin; the other was therefore assumed to be a unique sequence of the 75-kDa TNF receptor. Additional internal sequences of this receptor were determined after proteolytic cleavage.
https://openalex.org/W2015654225,"Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane proteins of approximately 2000 amino acids and consist of four homologous domains (I through IV). In current topographical models, domains III and IV are linked by a highly conserved cytoplasmic sequence of amino acids. Disruptions of the III-IV linker by cleavage or antibody binding slow inactivation, the depolarization-induced closed state characteristic of sodium channels. This linker might be the positively charged ""ball"" that is thought to cause inactivation by occluding the open channel. Therefore, groups of two or three contiguous lysines were neutralized or a glutamate was substituted for an arginine in the III-IV linker of type III rat brain sodium channels. In all cases, inactivation occurred more rapidly rather than more slowly, contrary to predictions. Furthermore, activation was delayed in the arginine to glutamate mutation. Hence, the III-IV linker does not simply act as a charged blocker of the channel but instead influences all aspects of sodium channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2121754251,"Ligand stimulation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) results in rapid activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and, ultimately, cellular proliferation. In a previous study, we demonstrated that staurosporine, a known inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocked PDGF-induced [Ca2+]i increases in Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts by a mechanism that appeared unrelated to inhibition of protein kinase activity (Olsen, R., Melder, D., Seewald, M., Abraham, R., and Powis, G. (1990) Biochem. Pharmacol. 39, 968-972). In the present study, we report that staurosporine inhibits ligand-dependent PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activation in cell-free receptor preparations and in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. At the same concentrations (10(-8)-10(-6) M), staurosporine suppressed both the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C activity and the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides induced by PDGF stimulation of intact cells. In contrast, guanine nucleotide-binding protein-dependent phospholipase C activation induced by bradykinin or fluoroaluminate anion was relatively insensitive to staurosporine. A preferential inhibitory effect of staurosporine on signal generation by the PDGF-R was indicated by findings that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) tyrosine kinase activity and EGF-dependent phospholipase C in A-431 carcinoma cells were approximately 100-fold less sensitive to this drug. These data indicate that submicromolar concentrations of staurosporine inhibit PDGF-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization through a proximal inhibitory effect on ligand-induced activation of the PDGF-R tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1509156825,"The F1F0-ATP synthase from the alkaliphilic Bacillus firmus OF4 was purified in a reconstitutively active form, in good yield and with a high specific ATPase activity when appropriately activated. The purification procedure involved octyl glucoside extraction of washed membrane vesicles in the presence of 20% glycerol and asolectin followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The purified preparation was resolved into seven bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponding to the five F1 subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon, and to the b and c subunits of the F0. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel analysis revealed a candidate for the alpha subunit of F0. The MgATPase activity of B. firmus OF4 F1F0 was barely detectable but could be stimulated, optimally more than 100-fold, by sulfite, methanol, and octyl thioglucoside. The enzyme was inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and sodium azide, but not by aurovertin, an inhibitor of the F1 from Escherichia coli. The F1F0 reconstituted into proteoliposomes catalyzed ATPase activity, ATP-Pi exchange, and ATP-dependent delta pH and delta psi formation. ATP hydrolysis was stimulated by protonophores while the other activities were abolished by protonophores. These activities were neither dependent on added sodium ions nor significantly affected by them. F1F0 proteoliposomes made from crude octyl glucoside extracts that also contained the Na+/H+ antiporter were shown to catalyze ATP-dependent Na+ uptake that was completely sensitive to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone; Na+ uptake activity was absent in proteoliposomes containing more purified F1F0 but lacking the Na+/H+ antiporter. These data show that the F1F0 translocates protons and does not substitute Na+ for H+ in energy coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1486898082,"To elucidate the binding sites for thrombin and protein C in the six epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains of human thrombomodulin, recombinant mutant proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells. Mutant protein EGF456, which contains the fourth, fifth, and sixth EGF domains from the NH2 terminus of thrombomodulin, showed complete cofactor activity in thrombin-catalyzed protein C activation, as did intact thrombomodulin or elastase-digested thrombomodulin. EGF56, containing the fifth and sixth EGF domains, did not have cofactor activity; but EGF45, containing the fourth and fifth EGF domains, had about one-tenth of the cofactor activity of EGF456. Thrombin binding to attached recombinant thrombomodulin (D123) was inhibited by EGF45 as well as by EGF56. A synthetic peptide (ECPEGYILDDGFICTDIDE), corresponding to Glu-408 to Glu-426 in the fifth EGF domain, inhibited thrombin binding to attached thrombomodulin (D123) with an apparent Ki of 95 microM. At Ca2+ concentrations of 0.25-0.3 mM, intact protein C was maximally activated by thrombin in the presence of EGF45, EGF456, or EGF1-6, which contains the first to sixth EGF domains; but such maximum cofactor activity was not observed when gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-domainless protein C was used. These findings suggest that: 1) thrombin binds to the latter half of the fifth EGF domain; and 2) protein C binds to the fourth EGF domain of thrombomodulin through Ca2+ ions."
https://openalex.org/W1578343521,"We studied the kinetics of corticotropin (ACTH) induction of mitochondrial cytochromes P450scc and P450c11 and their electron transport proteins, adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, in bovine adrenal cortex cells in primary culture. The mRNA levels of these enzymes increase and reach a peak within 3-12 h after ACTH addition. The protein levels of adrenodoxin reductase and P450scc show an increase only nearly 24 h after ACTH addition. After ACTH addition, the intracellular level of cAMP reaches maximal levels within 5 min, and then decreases gradually over 60 min. Hence, we examined the effect of a pulse of ACTH or cAMP analogs on enzyme and mRNA levels. Exposure of the cells to ACTH for 1-2 h was sufficient for maximal induction of the enzymes and P450scc mRNA. In contrast, the induction of the enzymes and the mRNA by cAMP analogs or forskolin required the continuous presence of these agents for over 12 h. But, these agents stimulated cortisol secretion to the medium quickly, indicating that they can activate some intracellular processes while not showing any effect on enzyme induction. The absence of any effect of prolonged cAMP pulses on enzyme and mRNA levels weakens the previous hypothesis that cAMP is the sole second messenger for the ACTH induction of steroidogenic enzymes in adrenal cortex cells. The inductive ability of a brief pulse of ACTH indicates that ACTH can rapidly initiate a series of reactions that result in enzyme induction many hours later."

W., and Hirschberg, C. B. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 6935-6939). The presumed in vivo role of this enzyme is to convert GDP into GMP. GDP is a reaction product following outer-chain mannosylation of luminal proteins and a known inhibitor of mannosyltransferases. It is hypothesized that GMP then returns to the cytosol. We have purified this enzyme to apparent homogeneity. Following solubilization from a membrane pellet using a buffer containing Triton X-100, the enzyme was purified on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column followed by Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and Superose-12 FPLC columns. After treatment with endoglycosidase H, the deglycosylated active enzyme was applied to a second Mono Q FPLC column and a phenyl-Superose FPLC column. The final enzyme activity was enriched 6500-fold over that of the Triton X-100 extract. The apparant molecular mass of the deglycosylated enzyme is 47 kDa. The purified enzyme is highly specific for guanosine diphosphate, requires Ca2+ for maximal activity, and has a broad pH optimum between 7.4 and 8.2. The apparent Km for GDP is 0.1 mM; the Vmax is 4.9 mmol/min/mg of protein. An enzyme activity with similar substrate specificity has also been detected in membranes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe."
https://openalex.org/W1580441940,"Complementary DNA encoding a HepG2 cell-facilitated glucose transporter (GLUT1) was subcloned into a metal-inducible, mammalian expression vector, pLEN. Mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts transfected with this new construct, pLENGT, exhibited zinc-inducible expression of human glucose transporter mRNA, protein, and glucose transport activity, before and after differentiation into adipocytes. Both mouse host GLUT1 and expressed human GLUT1 proteins distributed about equally between 3T3-L1 adipocyte plasma membranes and low density microsomal membranes, while host skeletal muscle/adipocyte-type glucose transporter (GLUT4) was concentrated in the latter fraction. Mouse GLUT1 and GLUT4 proteins and the constitutively expressed human GLUT1 protein in pLENGT adipocytes were all redistributed from low density microsomal membrane to plasma membrane fractions in response to insulin. Insulin stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in untransfected fibroblasts about 2-fold, while untransfected adipocytes displayed a 14-fold increase in deoxyglucose uptake in response to insulin. Both the expression of human GLUT1 protein and basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 75 microM zinc-treated pLENGT fibroblasts and adipocytes were increased approximately 3-fold over untransfected cells. In such pLENGT fibroblasts expressing human GLUT1 protein, however, the absolute values for insulin-stimulated increases in sugar uptake were no different than in control fibroblasts. As was observed in pLENGT fibroblasts, the increased basal sugar uptake by pLENGT adipocytes was additive with the insulin-stimulated increase in the rate of sugar uptake and, therefore, the -fold stimulation by insulin was markedly reduced. These data indicate that: 1) the membrane distributions of a glucose transporter protein, which is not responsive to insulin in HepG2 cells, and both mouse GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporter isoforms are regulated by insulin in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and 2) the expressed human GLUT1 appears to contribute significantly to the rate of basal uptake but not to the insulin-stimulated increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1486918734,"The 28-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxycytidine (S-(dC)28) has been reported previously to be a strong inhibitor of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) DNA polymerase and HSV-2 growth in cell culture. In this study, the mechanism of action of S-(dC)28 was studied. S-(dC)28 was found to interfere with the adsorption of HSV-1 and HSV-2 to HeLa cells. HSV-2 infection, but not HSV-1, was found to potentiate the uptake of S-(dC)28 into HeLa cells. The enhanced uptake reached a plateau at 6-9 h postinfection and appeared to be dose-dependent and saturable at concentrations higher than 1 microM. The amount of S-(dC)28 accumulated in HSV-2 infected cells was found to be 50 pmol/10(6) cells at 6 h postinfection, whereas no significant drug accumulation was found in uninfected cells. S-(dC)28 binding studies suggested that there are several types of tight binding sites associated with HSV-2 virions, which could play a role in the enhancement of S-(dC)28 uptake. Subcellular distribution studies showed that intracellular S-(dC)28 was associated with both nuclei and cytoplasm and remained intact. Mechanism studies suggested three different mechanisms which could be responsible for the anti-HSV-2 action of S-(dC)28; (i) S-(dC)28 could interfere with the uptake of HSV. (ii) HSV-2 infection enhances the uptake of S-(dC)28 into cells. (iii) S-(dC)28 inhibits HSV-2 DNA synthesis, possibly, by inhibiting the viral DNA polymerase. The unique mechanisms of anti-HSV action of S-(dC)28 suggest it could be a potential new agent in anti-HSV-2 chemotherapy."

We found that MAT a ste14 mutant cells secreted a biologically inactive form of a-factor which had more hydrophilic character than the wild-type pheromone. The authentic pheromone could be metabolically labeled with [methyl-3H]methionine, and the resulting COOH-terminal methyl ester could be removed by mild alkaline hydrolysis. In contrast, a-factor secreted by ste14 mutants did not incorporate a base-labile 3H-methyl moiety. Base treatment converted the normal pheromone into a form which was biologically inactive and which comigrated with the ste14 form of the peptide upon thin-layer chromatography. These results indicate that STE14 gene function is required for COOH-terminal methylation of a-factor."
https://openalex.org/W1588716962,"The Na+/H+ antiporter is a ubiquitous transmembrane protein that plays a vital role in cell growth via regulation of intracellular Na+ and H+. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), vasoconstrictors and mitogens rapidly activate the antiporter, suggesting that both should have growth promoting effects. Indeed, angiotensin II increases VSMC protein and volume (hypertrophy), but does not increase cell number (hyperplasia). In the present work we investigated whether alterations in the steady state levels of Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA might differentiate these VSMC growth responses. Differences in function of the Na+/H+ antiporter appeared likely because exposure of growth-arrested VSMC for 24 h to 100 nM angiotensin II decreased intracellular pH from 7.08 to 6.99, while exposure to 10% calf serum caused an increase to 7.18. Simultaneous measurement of Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA levels, using the human c28 cDNA, revealed a 25-fold increase in response to serum (as well as to platelet-derived and fibroblast growth factors), but no change in response to angiotensin II. All agonists increased mRNA levels of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase approximately 3-fold. The increase in Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA induced by serum was first apparent within 2 h and peaked 24 h after treatment. These results demonstrate that expression of Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA in VSMC is dependent on growth state: hyperplastic agonists (serum, platelet-derived and fibroblast growth factor) increase the steady state levels of Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA while a hypertrophic agonist (angiotensin II) does not."
https://openalex.org/W1599622061,"Numerous antitumor and antibacterial agents inhibit type II DNA topoisomerases, yielding, in each case, a complex of enzyme covalently bound to cleaved DNA. We are investigating the mechanism of inhibitor action by using the type II DNA topoisomerase of bacteriophage T4 as a model. The T4 topoisomerase is the target of antitumor agent 4'-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) in T4-infected Escherichia coli. Two m-AMSA-resistant phage strains were previously isolated, one with a point mutation in topoisomerase subunit gene 39 and the other with a point mutation in topoisomerase subunit gene 52. We report here that the wild-type T4 topoisomerase is inhibited by six additional antitumor agents that also inhibit the mammalian type II topoisomerase: ellipticine, 9-OH-ellipticine, 2-me-9-OH-ellipticinium acetate, mitoxantrone diacetate, teniposide, and etoposide. Further, one or both of the m-AMSA-resistance mutations alters the enzyme sensitivity to each of these agents, conferring either cross-resistance or enhanced sensitivity. Finally, the gene 39 mutation confers on T4 topoisomerase a DNA gyrase-like sensitivity to the gyrase inhibitor oxolinic acid, thus establishing a direct link between the mechanism of action of the anti-bacterial quinolones and that of the antitumor agents. These results strongly suggest that diverse inhibitors of type II topoisomerases share a common binding site and a common mechanism of action, both of which are apparently conserved in the evolution of the type II DNA topoisomerases. Alterations in DNA cleavage site specificity caused by either the inhibitors or the m-AMSA-resistance mutations favor the proposal that the inhibitor binding site is composed of both protein and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1516207993,"Structure-activity studies of tetramethinemerocyanine fluorophores enabled the synthesis of novel dyes which showed spectral changes during reversible, calcium-dependent association with calmodulin. These spectral changes were greatly enhanced in dyes with a quaternary nitrogen and specifically placed hydrophobic chains. One such dye was covalently attached to calmodulin, producing a calmodulin analog with calcium-sensitive fluorescence. The analog, MeroCaM, showed a calcium-induced 3.4-fold increase in excitation ratio (608/532 nm excitation, 623 nm emission), which was fully reversed by lowering free calcium levels. MeroCaM's excitation ratio showed a half-maximal change at 300-400 nM calcium, below calcium concentrations reported to produce half-maximal saturation of calcium-calmodulin binding. However, the calcium dependence of MeroCaM's phosphodiesterase activation paralleled that of calmodulin. MeroCaM's fluorescence changes therefore appear to reflect primarily calcium binding to high affinity sites. MeroCaM's maximal phosphodiesterase activation was 30-40% that of calmodulin. In myosin light chain kinase activation, MeroCaM and calmodulin displayed indistinguishable maximal activation levels and concentration dependence of activation. Changes in MeroCaM's calcium affinity induced by magnesium, phosphodiesterase, and melittin were similar to those reported for calmodulin. Experiments with melittin revealed that target protein interaction could alter the fluorescence changes produced by calcium binding. MeroCaM showed promising brightness and photostability when imaged in individual living fibroblasts. The long excitation and emission wavelengths of MeroCaM, and the strong dependence of its excitation ratio on calcium concentrations, suit it well for use as a probe of calmodulin-dependent calcium signaling in living cells, as well as for experiments in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1544441641,"We have recently shown that the Ca.EGTA and Mg.EDTA complexes, but not free Ca2+ or Mg2+, inhibit the liver glucose-6-phosphatase (Mithieux, G., Vega, F. V., Beylot, M., and Riou, J. P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7257-7259). In this work, we report that, when complexed with Mg2+, two endogenous dicarboxylic keto acids (alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) and oxaloacetate (OAA] inhibit the glucose-6-phosphatase activity at low concentrations of substrate. This phenomenon is specific for complexes of Mg2+ with alpha-KG and OAA since 1) the complexes of Mg2+ with a number of other di- or tricarboxylic acids having high structural analogy with alpha-KG and OAA (oxalate, malate, succinate, citrate, aspartate, and glutamate) do not inhibit the glucose-6-phosphatase activity and 2) the Ca.alpha-KG and Ca.OAA chelates do not inhibit the glucose-6-phosphatase activity. In the presence of Mg.alpha-KG or Mg.OAA chelates, the enzyme displays sigmoid kinetics; the Hanes plots deviate from linearity, indicating the positive cooperative dependence of the velocity upon the substrate concentration. Hill coefficients (equal to 1 in the absence of the chelates) of 1.23 and 1.33 have been determined in the presence of Mg.alpha-KG and Mg.OAA complexes, respectively. The disruption of microsomal integrity by detergents abolishes the effect of Mg.alpha-KG and Mg.OAA, suggesting that the magnesium chelates inhibit the translocase component of the glucose-6-phosphatase system."
https://openalex.org/W1629475551,"The question of whether cytochrome c could be functionally sorted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space along a pathway was investigated using a fusion protein termed pLc1-c. pLc1-c contains 3-fold targeting information, namely, the complete bipartite presequence of the cytochrome c1 precursor joined to the amino terminus of apocytochrome c. pLc1-c could be selectively imported into the intermembrane space either directly across the outer membrane along a cytochrome c import route or along a cytochrome c1 route via the matrix. Thus, apocytochrome c could be sorted along a conservative sorting pathway; however, following reexport from the matrix, apo-Lc1-c could not be converted to its holo counterpart. Despite the apparent similarity of structure and functional location of the heme lyases and similarity of the heme binding regions in their respective apoproteins, cytochrome c heme lyase and cytochrome c1 heme lyase apparently have different and nonoverlapping substrate specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1491720712,"Each protomer of the regulatory subunit dimer of cAMP-dependent protein kinase contains two tandem and homologous cAMP-binding domains, A and B, and cooperative cAMP binding to these two sites promotes holoenzyme dissociation. Several amino acid residues in the type I regulatory subunit, predicted to lie in close proximity to each bound cyclic nucleotide based on affinity labeling and model building, were replaced using recombinant techniques. The mutations included replacement of 1) Glu-200, predicted to hydrogen bond to the 2'-OH of cAMP bound to site A, with Asp, 2) Tyr-371, the site of affinity labeling with 8-N3-cAMP in site B, with Trp, and 3) Phe-247, the position in site A that is homologous to Tyr-371 in site B, with Tyr. Each mutation caused an approximate 2-fold increase in both the Ka(cAMP) and Kd(cAMP); however, the off-rates for cAMP and the characteristic pattern of affinity labeling with 8-N3-cAMP differed markedly for each mutant protein. Furthermore, these mutations affect the cAMP binding properties not only of the site containing the mutation, but of the adjacent nonmutated site as well, thus confirming that extensive cross-communication occurs between the two cAMP-binding domains. Photoaffinity labeling of the native R-subunit results in the covalent modification of two residues, Trp-260 and Tyr-371, by 8-N3-cAMP bound to sites A and B, respectively, with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of 8-N3-cAMP incorporated per mol of R-monomer (Bubis, J., and Taylor, S. S. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 3478-3486). A stoichiometry of 1 mol of 8-N3-cAMP incorporated per R-monomer was observed for each mutant regulatory subunit as well, even when 2 mol of 8-N3-cAMP were bound per R-monomer; however, the major sites of covalent modification were altered as follows: R(Y371/W), Trp-371; R(E200/D), Tyr-371, and R(F247/Y), Tyr-371."
https://openalex.org/W1530774634,"Treatment of the canine renal Na,K-ATPase with N-(2-nitro-4-isothiocyanophenyl)-imidazole (NIPI), a new imidazole-based probe, results in irreversible loss of enzymatic activity. Inactivation of 95% of the Na,K-ATPase activity is achieved by the covalent binding of 1 molecule of [3H]NIPI to a single site on the alpha-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase. The reactivity of this site toward NIPI is about 10-fold greater when the enzyme is in the E1Na or sodium-bound form than when it is in the E2K or potassium-bound form. K+ ions prevent the enhanced reactivity associated with Na+ binding. Labeling and inactivation of the enzyme is prevented by the simultaneous presence of ATP or ADP (but not by AMP). The apparent affinity with which ATP prevents the inactivation by NIPI at pH 8.5 is increased from 30 to 3 microM by the presence of Na+ ions. This suggests that the affinity with which native enzyme binds ATP (or ADP) at this pH is enhanced by Na+ binding to the enzyme. Modification of the single sodium-responsive residue on the alpha-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase results in loss of high affinity ATP binding, without affecting phosphorylation from Pi. Modification with NIPI probably alters the adenosine binding region without affecting the region close to the phosphorylated carboxyl residue aspartate 369. Tightly bound (or occluded) Rb+ ions are not displaced by ATP (4 mM) in the inactivated enzyme. Thus modification of a single residue simultaneously blocks ATP acting with either high or low affinity on the Na,K-ATPase. These observations suggest that there is a single residue on the alpha-subunit (probably a lysine) which drastically alters its reactivity as Na+ binds to the enzyme. This lysine residue is essential for catalytic activity and is prevented from reacting with NIPI when ATP binds to the enzyme. Thus, the essential lysine residue involved may be part of the ATP binding domain of the Na,K-ATPase."

We examined the requirement of new protein synthesis and myogenin expression for muscle-specific tropomyosin expression during myogenesis of the rat muscle cell line L6E9. The results show that new protein synthesis is required for both muscle gene transcription and muscle-specific alternate RNA processing. However, once initiated, the synthesis of muscle tropomyosin mRNA continued in the presence of cycloheximide, while the expression of muscle actin, myosin heavy chain, and myogenin mRNA was abolished. These results suggest that muscle-specific processing of tropomyosin transcripts can continue to occur in the absence of myogenin expression unlike the expression of muscle actin and myosin heavy chain mRNAs. However, the transfection of myogenin cDNA into nonmuscle cells induced muscle-specific RNA processing of tropomyosin, suggesting indirect involvement of myogenic factors in the initiation of muscle-specific RNA processing pathways."

En- zyme activity was resolved free of the cytochrome b component following passage of solubilized membrane extracts through QAE-Sephadex anion exchange col- umns. Enzyme activity measured by the NBT assay appears to be that associated with the NADPH binding protein of the oxidoreductase complex. When exposed to NBT and NADPH this component of the oxidoreduc- tase generates superoxide independent of cytochrome b. The enzymology of the neutrophil NADPH:O* oxidoreduc- tase is poorly understood. Some of the properties ascribed to it are its apparent absence in resting neutrophils, its appear- ance within seconds of neutrophil stimulation, a specificity for NADPH, and its apparent association with the plasma- lemma of the cell (1, 2). Patients whose neutrophils lack oxidoreductase activity when stimulated suffer from chronic granulomatous disease, a serious genetic disease associated with recurrent life-threatening infections (3-6). The majority of patients with this rare genetic disorder have an X-linked form of the disease associated with a missing or abnormal b- type cytochrome in the plasmalemma of their cells. Charac- terization of the oxidoreductase has progressed along both genetic and biochemical lines and has led to the current view of the oxidoreductase as a multienzyme complex comprised of flavoprotein(s), lipid, cytosolic factors, and a cytochrome b component of unusually low redox potential (6-16). In order to test suspected redox components recovered from neutrophil extracts as to their role in the oxidoreductase complex an accurate assay for enzyme activity must be used. The oxidoreductase complex presents certain problems in this respect because of its multicomponent nature. Little work has"

Chem. 263, 8604-8610), we have further examined the alpha 1-adrenergic pathway in adrenalectomized and sham-operated male rats. We measured the number and affinity of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [(Ca2+]i) of hepatocytes with aequorin, inositol triphosphate (IP3) accumulation, and Ca2+ influx and efflux across the plasma membrane. We also compared the effects of vasopressin with those obtained with epinephrine. We found that the number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors was slightly depressed (-23%), but that their affinity was unchanged. However, IP3 accumulation evoked by epinephrine was decreased 50%. This is probably the main cause for the depressed peak rise in [Ca2+]i we previously observed and reported. We also found that the basal resting Ca2+ influx was increased after adrenalectomy. Experiments with the beta-blocker propranolol, which abolished the epinephrine-evoked increase in Ca2+ influx, suggest that this effect may be mediated by cAMP, at least in adrenalectomized animals. The effects of vasopressin on IP3 [Ca2+]i and Ca2+ influx and efflux were also significantly decreased after adrenalectomy, indicating that alpha 1-adrenergic-mediated and other IP3-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathways are depressed after adrenalectomy."
