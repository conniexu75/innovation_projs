https://openalex.org/W2005814409,"There are three distinct enolase isoenzymes in brain; neuron-specific enolase (NSE), formerly referred to as neuron-specific protein, which is specifically localized in neurons, a nonneuronal enolase (NNE), and a third hybrid form. Light microscopy with immunocytochemical techniques has permitted localization of non-neuronal enolase. The NNE is located in glial cells with no staining of endothelial cells or neurons. Thus, NSE and NNE can be used as specific metabolic markers for neurons and glial cells, respectively."

This study showed a peak enchancement of learning in children after being given a dose of 0.3 milligram per kilogram of body weight, and a decrement in learning in those given larger doses; social behavior showed the most improvement in children given 1.0 milligram per kilogram. These results had been hypothesized from theoretical dose-response curves which indicate different target behaviors would improve at different doses."

https://openalex.org/W1586827727,"The organization of the ribosomal DNA repeating unit from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been analyzed. A cloned ribosomal DNA repeating unit has been mapped with the restriction enzymes Xma 1, Kpn 1, HindIII, Xba 1, Bgl I + II, and EcoRI. The locations of the sequences which code for 5 S, 5.8 S, 18 S, and 25 S ribosomal RNAs have been determined by hybridization of the purified RNA species with restriction endonuclease generated fragments of the repeating unit. The position of the 5.8 S ribosomal DNA sequences within the repeat was also established by sequencing the DNA which codes for 83 nucleotides at the 5' end of 5.8 S ribosomal RNA. The polarity of the 35 S ribosomal RNA precursor has been established by a combination of hybridization analysis and DNA sequence determination and is 5'-18 S, 5.8 S, 25 S-3'."

https://openalex.org/W1636605543,"Escherichia coli omega protein is found to form a complex with single-stranded DNA. The complex is stable in buoyant CsCl or Cs2SO4 density gradients. Addition of Mg(II) to the concentrated salt solutions, however, leads to the dissociation of the complex, even in the presence of EDTA in molar excess over Mg(II). The dissociated omega retains its enzymatic activity; the DNA recovered from the dissociated complex is indistinguishable from the original DNA. Exposure of the complex to alkali results in the cleavage of the DNA. This cleavage generates a 3‘-hydroxyl DNA terminus, and the omega protein is found linked to the 5‘-terminus, presumably covalently. Pronase digestion of the complex results initially in the removal of approximately 30% of the protein. A significant fraction of the residual complex is still stable in concentrated salt solutions, and can be dissociated by Mg(II). Extensive digestion with pronase results in the removal of the protein and the cleavage of the DNA chain."
https://openalex.org/W1574880445,"Virus-like particles containing the L (P1)-species of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the translational activity of the virus-like particle-derived dsRNA was analyzed in the wheat germ cell-free system. Denaturation of the dsRNA immediately prior to in vitro translation resulted in the synthesis of one major and at least three minor polypeptides, whereas undenatured dsRNA, as expected, did not stimulate [35S]methionine incorporation into polypeptides, but actually slightly inhibited endogenous activity. The major in vitro translation product of the denatured L-dsRNA was shown to be identical with the major L-dsRNA containing virus-like particle capsid polypeptide on the basis of three criteria: co-electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, immunoprecipitation, and tryptic peptide analysis. We have therefore established that the L-dsRNA genome encodes the major virus-like particle capsid polypeptide. This result adds considerable support to the hypothesis that the L-dsRNA genome acts as a helper genome to the smaller (1.6 x 10(6) dalton) M-dsRNA genome in killer strains of yeast by providing the M-dsRNA containing virus-like particles with their major coat protein."
https://openalex.org/W1606628568,"A homopolymer system has been developed to examine the digestion strategies of DNA exonucleases. Escherichia coli exonuclease I and lambda-exonuclease, are processive enzymes. However, T7 exonuclease, spleen exonuclease, E. coli exonuclease III, the 3' leads to 5'-exonuclease of T4 DNA polymerase, and both the 3' leads to 5' and the 5' leads to 3' activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I dissociate frequently from the substrate during the course of digestion. Regions of duplex DNA are a dissociation signal for exonuclease I."

https://openalex.org/W1984675968,"To help clarify the role, in cytoplasmic microtubule function, of the proteins of high molecular weight that coassemble with tubulin in vitro, a monospecific antibody against the proteins of high molecular weight was prepared from the serum of immunized rabbits by affinity chromatography. With indirect immunofluorescence we found that the protein in both cultured neuroblastoma cells and 3T3 cells in distributed in an extensive filamentous array that originates at sites near the nucleus and extends to the cell periphery or, in neuroblastoma cells, gathers into bundles which enter neurites. No filaments were seen with nonspecific antibodies from serum taken before immunization, and prior incubation of the specific antibody with purified protein of high molecular weight (but not tubulin) prevented filament visualization. The filamentous pattern in 3T3 cells was disrupted by colchicine. This evidence indicates that the proteins of high molecular weight are found in cells in association with cytoplasmic microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1496361100,"Two inositol-requiring strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined for changes in levels of phospholipids occurring after inositol deprivation. Lack of inositol results in loss of cell viability (inositol-less death) and in very large increases in two phospholipid precursors, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol; the accumulation of other glycerophospholipids continues for a considerable time at normal rates. Phosphatidylinositol accumulation does not occur in the absence of inositol; however, the further metabolism of this lipid continues, with 80 to 90% of this lipid disappearing. This disappearance is matched by increases in the phosphoinositol containing sphingolipids and extracellular glycerophosphoinositol. These changes are not observed when growth is blocked by cycloheximide or by omission of lysine from a lysine auxotroph, most lipids continuing to accumulate long after growth stops. There appears to be no close coordination in the synthesis of the major yeast phospholipids or between protein synthesis and phospholipid synthesis. However, despite very large changes in the composition of yeast phospholipids that can be achieved by altering culture conditions, it appears that the average charge per phospholipid molecule remains fairly constant."
https://openalex.org/W1558106087,"A DNA fragment containing the structural gene for the 5 S ribosomal RNA and intergenic regions before and after the 35 S ribosomal RNA precursor gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been amplified in a bacterial plasmid and physically mapped by restriction endonuclease cleavage and hybridization to purified yeast 5 S ribosomal RNA. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragments carrying the 5 S ribosomal RNA gene and adjacent regions has been determined. The sequence unambiguously identifies the 5 S ribosomal RNA gene, determines its polarity within the ribosomal DNA repeating unit, and reveals the structure of its promoter and termination regions. Partial DNA sequence of the regions near the beginning and end of the 35 S ribosomal RNA gene has also been determined as a preliminary step in establishing the structure of promoter and termination regions for the 35 S ribosomal RNA gene."

https://openalex.org/W2024447590,"We have found that DNAase I digestion of yeast, HeLa and chicken erythrocyte nuclei produces a pattern of DNA fragments spaced 10 bases apart and extending to at least 300 bases. This ""extended ladder"" of DNA fragments is most clearly seen with yeast, and least clearly with chicken erythrocytes. The appearance of regular and discrete bands at sizes much larger than the repeat size shows that the core particles (140 bp of DNA + H2A, H2B, H3 H4) in at least some fraction of chromatin are spaced in a particular fashion, by discrete lengths of spacer DNA, and not randomly. Based on the abundance of small repeats in yeast and from experiments with nucleosome oligomers, we conclude that the extended ladder and nucleosomal phasing probably arise mainly from regions in the chromatin in which nucleosome cores are closely packed or closely spaced (140-160 bp X n). Contributions from less closely packed but still accurately phased nucleosomes, however, cannot be entirely excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2018312557,"Saccharin preparations commonly distributed as artificial sweeteners exhibited mutagenic activity in bacterial tests. When administered orally to mice, mutagenic activity was demonstrable in the urines of these animals as well as in a host-mediated assay. Highly purified saccharin was not mutagenic in the direct assay, but the urines of mice to which this material had been administered exhibited mutagenic effects on one tester strain (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Two other sweeteners, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone and xylitol, had no detectable mutagenic activity in any of these assays using his- Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 or TA98."
https://openalex.org/W1579180733,"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, an intrinsic membrane protein of Escherichia coli, catalyzes the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine, the final step in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, the principal membrane lipid of this organism. The purified enzyme lacks the absorption spectrum characteristic of pyridoxal-containing enzymes, and it has now been found to contain bound pyruvate, the carbonyl function of which is essential for catalytic activity. The decarboxylase is inactivated by treatment with a number of reagents that attack carbonyl groups, including sodium borohydride. Reduction with tritiated borohydride leads to the introduction of stably bound radioactivity, which, after acid hydrolysis, has been identified as tritiated lactate by several chromatographic procedures and by treatment with lactate dehydrogenase. The enzyme resists inactivation by cyanoborohydride in the absence of substrate, but is readily inactivated by this reagent in the presence of phosphatidylserine. Under the conditions of treatment of neutral pH, cyanoborohydride does not react with carbonyl residues at an appreciable rate, but reduces imino groups much more rapidly. This finding, together with demonstrated dependence of the enzyme upon the carbonyl residue of pyruvate for activity, strongly suggests that a Schiff base is formed by addition of the amino group of phosphatidylserine to the pyruvate residue of the enzyme as an essential step in the action of the decarboxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1525483941,"The stereochemical course of the dTDP-glucose oxidoreductase (EC 4.2.1.46) reaction was studied using enzyme partially purified from Escherichia coli and dTDP-(6R)- and (6S)-[4-2H, 6-3H]glucose as substrate. The latter was prepared enzymatically by reduction of (3R)- and (3S)-3-P-[3-3H]glycerate to the 1-deuterated 3-P-glyceraldehyde with (4S)-[4-2H]NADH, followed first by conversion to glucose-1-P with the glycolytic enzymes, and then by transformation into the dTDP derivative. The stereospecifically labeled dTDP-glucose samples were mixed with nonlabeled carrier material and converted to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, which contained a chiral methyl group as shown by chirality analysis of the acetic acid resulting from Kuhn-Roth oxidation of the sugar nucleotide. These results confirm that the hydrogen transfer from C4 to C6 is intramolecular and show that the migrating hydrogen replaces the 6-hydroxyl group with inversion of configuration. Assuming that the hydrogen transfer, since it is intramolecular, must be suprafacial, it follows that the elimination of water from C5 and C6 is formally syn, whereas the reduction of the resulting delta5,6-double bond formally involves an anti addition of H+ and H-."

https://openalex.org/W2011365768,"To assess the significance of actin associations with nuclei, we have examined Amoeba proteus nuclei for the presence of labeled actin under a variety of circumstances without (in most instances) isolating nuclei or breaking up cytoplasms prior to the extraction of proteins. We first established that: the 42,000 dalton proteins (presumed to be actin) present in cytoplasm and non-isolated nuclei are identical electrophoretically; the putative actin of amebas has the same size and almost the same isoelectric point as rat muscle actin; and the peptide “fingerprints” of putative ameba actin and rat actin are very similar after tryptic digestion. We therefore concluded that the 42,000 dalton protein of ameba is actin. We determined that: the concentrations of actin in the cytoplasm and nucleus of amebas are the same; actin is readily lost from nuclei that are released from lysed cells; shortly after a 35S-labeled nucleus is transplanted into unlabeled cytoplasm, or an unlabeled nucleus is transplanted into 35S-labeled cytoplasm, the concentration of 35S-actin in nucleus and cytoplasm is the same; and when cells containing 35S-actin are subjected to long chase periods on unlabeled food, the concentrations of 35S-actin in nucleus and cytoplasm fall in parallel. These observations taken together suggest that actin is not tightly associated with nuclei. Rather, actin may associate with nuclei for the trivial reason that the nuclear envelope is no barrier to free movement of that protein between the two compartments. We conclude that the mere presence of actin in nuclei is insufficient grounds for assuming that it has any role in nuclear functions, such as, for example, chromosome condensation."
https://openalex.org/W1602889970,"With the use of an in vitro complementation assay to measure activity, the gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 has been purified 1000-fold to yield a nearly homogeneous protein. The purified gene 4 protein is a single polypeptide having a molecular weight of 58,000. In addition to being essential for T7 DNA replication in vivo and in vitro, the gene 4 protein is required for DNA synthesis by the purified T7 DNA polymerase on duplex T7 DNA templates. In the absence of ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates, DNA synthesis by the gene 4 protein and the T7 DNA polymerase is dependent on phosphodiester bond interruptions containing 3'-hydroxyl groups (nicks) in the duplex DNA. The reaction is specific for the T7 DNA polymerase, but any duplex DNA containing nicks can serve as template. The Km for nicks in the reaction is 3 x 10(-10) M."

Acid hydrolysis of NaB3H4-reduced enzyme released 2.2 mol of tritiated lactate per mol of dimeric enzyme, indicating that a pyruvate moiety is present. Inhibition of enzymatic activity by NaBH4 reduction and by carbonyl-binding reagents indicates that this pyruvoyl residue is required for the activity of the enzyme. This is the first example reported of a eukaryotic enzyme containing a covalently linked pyruvoyl residue."
https://openalex.org/W2007176653,Diabetic mice of the C57BL/6J obob and C57BL/Ks dbdb strains show a reduction in pancreatic somatostatin concentration accompanied in the obob strain by a striking decrease in the number of somatostatin-containing cells in the islets. Somatostatin concentration is also decreased in the stomach but increased in the hypothalamus. These findings suggest different control mechanisms for somatostatin in the hypothalamus compared to the gut and pancreas and exclude a primary genetic abnormality of somatostatin cells in the mutants.

https://openalex.org/W1529024790,"RNase II of Escherichia coli (EC 3.1.4.23) has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The K+-activated diesterase activity against poly(U), which defines RNase II, cochromatographs with activity against T4 mRNA or pulse-labeled E. coli RNA successively on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite or phosphocellulose, and Sephadex G-150 columns. Activities with both substrates are selectively reduced to less than 2% of the wild type level in a newly isolated mutant strain, S296, or after thermal inactivation in a mutant strain with temperature-sensitive RNase II. RNase II releases 5'-XMP without a lag as its only detectable alcohol-soluble produce from all substrates and has an apparent molecular weight of 80,000 to 90,000 in both nondissociating and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The pure enzyme shows the standard K+ activation against poly(A), poly(U), or poly(C), but only a slight preference for K+ over Na+ ions with T4 mRNA or pulse labeled E. coli RNA as substrate. Uniformly labeled E. coli rRNA or tRNA is degraded little if at all."
https://openalex.org/W1557101688,"Abstract The allosteric effectors of aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli, CTP and ATP, associate with both the regulatory and the catalytic moieties of the enzyme. Studies with isolated, active subunits yield one binding site per regulatory dimer and one per catalytic trimer. Investigations of effector association with hybrid enzymes, containing either the three regulatory dimers or the two catalytic trimers in inactivated forms, indicate that the data obtained with isolated subunits can be used to analyze the binding patterns of these ligands to the native hexamer. Thus, the nonlinear Scatchard plots, characteristic of the binding of CTP and ATP to the native enzyme, can be interpreted in terms of three effector molecules associating with the regulatory subunits, and two binding to the catalytic moiety of the enzyme. Results with native protein in the presence of saturating concentrations of active site ligands support these assignments. The differences between the binding isotherms of CTP and ATP to the enzyme are due to their different affinities to the two types of subunits. The apparent half-of-the-site saturation of the regulatory moiety of aspartate transcarbamoylase supports the concept that this protein has a tendency to exist in an asymmetric state."

https://openalex.org/W1568279845,"The binding of ribosomal proteins L25, L18, and L5 to 5 S RNA results in a conformational change and a destabilization of the 5 S RNA molecule. The changes observed in the near ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) spectra and in the melting profiles indicate an increase in base stacking uith an accompanying increase in asymmetry of the bases and a decrease in the conformational stability of the 5 S RNA. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the binding of these proteins increases the stacking of specific single-stranded bases in 5 S RNA and aligns them in helical arrays, resulting in a conformation which facilitates base-pairing with nucleotide segment(s) of the ribosomal 23 S RNA or the transfer RNA (or both). The simple and precise difference CD method described here is potentially useful for studying subtle conformational changes of other nucleic acid-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2141431390,"A calorimetric titration method was used to study the ADP binding to the chymotryptic subfragments of myosin, heavy meromyosin (HMM) and myosin subfragment 1 (S-1), and to myosin aggregated into filaments at low ionic strength. The binding constant (K) and heat of reaction (deltaH, kiloJoules (moles of ADP bound)-1) were determined. For HMM in 0.5 M KCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.02 M Tris (pH 7.8) at 12 degrees, log K = 5.92 +/- 0.13 and deltaH = -70.9 +/- 3.6 kJ mol-1. These results agree with our previous findings for myosin in 0.5 M KCl at 12 degrees. When the KCl concentration was reduced to 0.1 M, the binding constant did not change significantly (log K = 6.09 +/- 0.06) but the binding was more exothermic (deltaH = -90.1 +/- 3.3 kJ mol-1). Similar results were obtained for myosin filaments in 0.1 M KCl and also for both the isoenzymes of S-1(S-1(A1) and S-1(A2) in 0.1 M KCl. In 0.5 M KCl, the binding curves suggest that about one ADP is bound per active site, but as 0.1 M KCl, the apparent stoichiometry drops from 0.7 to 0.75. The most probable explanation is that there is some site heterogeneity which is more evident at lower ionic strength."

https://openalex.org/W1522786321,"Bacteriophage T5-induced DNA polymerase shows an initial phase of rapid synthesis, followed by a slower steady rate for much longer periods, with short DNA primer-templates (400 to 600 nucleotides long), in vitro. On extrapolating the line of steady rate back to 0 min, an intercept is obtained on the ordinate. With large DNA primer-templates, such as denatured T5 DNA (average chain length approximately 50,000 bases), the rate of synthesis remains constant and is equal to the initial rate obtained with short primer-templates. The zero time intercept was proportional to the amount of enzyme used and independent of temperature. Polymer challenge experiments indicate that the initial phase of rapid synthesis can be attributed to the processive mode of synthesis by T5 DNA polymerase. After synthesizing a stretch of DNA processively for about 200 nucleotide residues, the enzyme apparently forms a dead-end complex with the primer-templates used and must dissociate from the primer-template in order to resume synthesis. The average size of the product made processively, during various phase of synthesis, remains invariant and is in good agreement with the size of the zero time intercept per enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1593368577,"The dimeric bifunctional enzyme aspartokinase II-homoserine dehydrogenase II (Mr = 2 X 88,000) of Escherichia coli K12 can be cleaved into two nonoverlapping fragments by limited proteolysis with subtilisin. These two fragments can be separated under nondenaturing conditions as dimeric species, which indicates that each fragment has retained some of the association areas involved in the conformation of the native protein. The smaller fragment (Mr = 2 X 24,000) is devoid of aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activity. The larger fragment (Mr = 2 X 37,000) is endowed with full homoserine dehydrogenase activity. These results show that the polypeptide chains of the native enzyme are organized in two different domains, that both domains participate in building up the native dimeric structure, and that one of these domains only is responsible for homoserine dehydrogenase activity. A model of aspartokinase II-homoserine dehydrogenase II is proposed, which accounts for the present results."
