https://openalex.org/W2553053943,"Cultured pluripotent stem cells are a cornerstone of regenerative medicine owing to their ability to give rise to all cell types of the body. Although pluripotent stem cells can be propagated indefinitely in vitro, pluripotency is paradoxically a transient state in vivo, lasting 2-3 days around the time of blastocyst implantation. The exception to this rule is embryonic diapause, a reversible state of suspended development triggered by unfavourable conditions. Diapause is a physiological reproductive strategy widely employed across the animal kingdom, including in mammals, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we report that the partial inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major nutrient sensor and promoter of growth, induces reversible pausing of mouse blastocyst development and allows their prolonged culture ex vivo. Paused blastocysts remain pluripotent and competent-able to give rise to embryonic stem (ES) cells and live, fertile mice. We show that both naturally diapaused blastocysts in vivo and paused blastocysts ex vivo display pronounced reductions in mTOR activity, translation, histone modifications associated with gene activity and transcription. Pausing can be induced directly in cultured ES cells and sustained for weeks without appreciable cell death or deviations from cell cycle distributions. We show that paused ES cells display a remarkable global suppression of transcription, maintain a gene expression signature of diapaused blastocysts and remain pluripotent. These results uncover a new pluripotent stem cell state corresponding to the epiblast of the diapaused blastocyst and indicate that mTOR regulates developmental timing at the peri-implantation stage. Our findings have implications in the fields of assisted reproduction, regenerative medicine, cancer, metabolic disorders and ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2555309594,"Estimates of global species diversity have varied widely, primarily based on variation in the numbers derived from different inventory methods of arthropods and other small invertebrates. Within vertebrates, current diversity metrics for fishes, amphibians, and reptiles are known to be poor estimators, whereas those for birds and mammals are often assumed to be relatively well established. We show that avian evolutionary diversity is significantly underestimated due to a taxonomic tradition not found in most other taxonomic groups. Using a sample of 200 species taken from a list of 9159 biological species determined primarily by morphological criteria, we applied a diagnostic, evolutionary species concept to a morphological and distributional data set that resulted in an estimate of 18,043 species of birds worldwide, with a 95% confidence interval of 15,845 to 20,470. In a second, independent analysis, we examined intraspecific genetic data from 437 traditional avian species, finding an average of 2.4 evolutionary units per species, which can be considered proxies for phylogenetic species. Comparing recent lists of species to that used in this study (based primarily on morphology) revealed that taxonomic changes in the past 25 years have led to an increase of only 9%, well below what our results predict. Therefore, our molecular and morphological results suggest that the current taxonomy of birds understimates avian species diversity by at least a factor of two. We suggest that a revised taxonomy that better captures avian species diversity will enhance the quantification and analysis of global patterns of diversity and distribution, as well as provide a more appropriate framework for understanding the evolutionary history of birds."
https://openalex.org/W2552644210,"The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the largest potential sources of rising sea levels. Over the past 40 years, glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea sector of the ice sheet have thinned at an accelerating rate, and several numerical models suggest that unstable and irreversible retreat of the grounding line-which marks the boundary between grounded ice and floating ice shelf-is underway. Understanding this recent retreat requires a detailed knowledge of grounding-line history, but the locations of the grounding line before the advent of satellite monitoring in the 1990s are poorly dated. In particular, a history of grounding-line retreat is required to understand the relative roles of contemporaneous ocean-forced change and of ongoing glacier response to an earlier perturbation in driving ice-sheet loss. Here we show that the present thinning and retreat of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica is part of a climatically forced trend that was triggered in the 1940s. Our conclusions arise from analysis of sediment cores recovered beneath the floating Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, and constrain the date at which the grounding line retreated from a prominent seafloor ridge. We find that incursion of marine water beyond the crest of this ridge, forming an ocean cavity beneath the ice shelf, occurred in 1945 (±12 years); final ungrounding of the ice shelf from the ridge occurred in 1970 (±4 years). The initial opening of this ocean cavity followed a period of strong warming of West Antarctica, associated with El Niño activity. Thus our results suggest that, even when climate forcing weakened, ice-sheet retreat continued."
https://openalex.org/W2549556358,"Background The network approach to psychopathology conceives mental disorders as sets of symptoms causally impacting on each other. The strengths of the connections between symptoms are key elements in the description of those symptom networks. Typically, the connections are analysed as linear associations (i.e., correlations or regression coefficients). However, there is insufficient awareness of the fact that differences in variance may account for differences in connection strength. Differences in variance frequently occur when subgroups are based on skewed data. An illustrative example is a study published in PLoS One (2013;8(3):e59559) that aimed to test the hypothesis that the development of psychopathology through “staging” was characterized by increasing connection strength between mental states. Three mental states (negative affect, positive affect, and paranoia) were studied in severity subgroups of a general population sample. The connection strength was found to increase with increasing severity in six of nine models. However, the method used (linear mixed modelling) is not suitable for skewed data. Methods We reanalysed the data using inverse Gaussian generalized linear mixed modelling, a method suited for positively skewed data (such as symptoms in the general population). Results The distribution of positive affect was normal, but the distributions of negative affect and paranoia were heavily skewed. The variance of the skewed variables increased with increasing severity. Reanalysis of the data did not confirm increasing connection strength, except for one of nine models. Conclusions Reanalysis of the data did not provide convincing evidence in support of staging as characterized by increasing connection strength between mental states. Network researchers should be aware that differences in connection strength between symptoms may be caused by differences in variances, in which case they should not be interpreted as differences in impact of one symptom on another symptom."
https://openalex.org/W2555746149,"Socially synchronized rhythms in shorebirds were assessed during biparental incubation under natural circumstances and were exceptionally diverse, often not following the 24-h day, whereby risk of predation, not starvation, determined some of the variation in incubation rhythms. All organisms have biorhythms, but in social species these have to be synchronized between individuals within a community. Here Martin Bulla et al. address the issue of how parents synchronize their biorhythms when both are caring for their offspring. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 species of shorebirds in which parents synchronize their schedules to achieve continuous incubation of the eggs, they show that even under similar environmental conditions and despite day-long environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of captive birds. The risk of predation, not starvation, might be a key determinant of biorhythmic diversity. The behavioural rhythms of organisms are thought to be under strong selection, influenced by the rhythmicity of the environment1,2,3,4. Such behavioural rhythms are well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions1,5, but free-living individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others, including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators6,7,8,9,10. Individuals can temporally segregate their daily activities (for example, prey avoiding predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (for example, group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for offspring)6,7,8,9,11. The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain poorly understood5,6,7,9. Here we investigate these rhythms in the context of biparental care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization12 where pair members potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 biparentally incubating shorebird species, where parents synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report remarkable within- and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between species, the median length of one parent’s incubation bout varied from 1–19 h, whereas period length—the time in which a parent’s probability to incubate cycles once between its highest and lowest value—varied from 6–43 h. The length of incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but species relying on crypsis (the ability to avoid detection by other animals) had longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or who actively protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light–dark cycle were less prevalent at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity5,6,7,9. The risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the diversity in these rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2551253757,"This pilot randomized control trial was designed to examine whether Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (RFCBT) reduces rumination and residual depressive symptoms among adolescents with a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who are at risk for relapse. We also examined whether these changes in symptoms were associated with changes in functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key node in the default mode network (DMN). Thirty-three adolescents (ages 12–18) were randomized to eight weeks of RFCBT or an assessment only (AO) control. Twenty two adolescents successfully completed fMRI scans pre- and post-intervention. Adolescents were recruited from the clinic and community and met criteria for at least one previous episode of MDD and were currently in full or partial remission. An Independent Evaluator interviewed parent and child before and after the eight-week intervention. The left PCC (-5, -50, 36) seed was used to probe resting state functional connectivity of the DMN. Adolescents who received RFCBT demonstrated reduced rumination (F = -2.76, df = 112, p < .01, 95% CI [-4.72,-0.80]) and self-report depression across eight weeks (F = -2.58, df = 113, p < .01, 95% CI [-4.21, -0.94]). Youth who received RFCBT also demonstrated significant decreases in connectivity between the left PCC and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and bilateral inferior temporal gyri (ITG). Degree of change in connectivity was correlated with changes in self-report depression and rumination. These data suggest that rumination can be reduced over eight weeks and that this reduction is associated with parallel decreases in residual depressive symptoms and decreased functional connectivity of the left PCC with cognitive control nodes. These changes may enhance the ability of vulnerable youth to stay well during the transition to adulthood. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01905267"
https://openalex.org/W2555889287,"Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is involved in anabolic metabolism in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes, but the role of mTORC1 in osteoclast biology in vivo remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that deletion of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) in osteoclasts led to an increase in bone mass with decreased bone resorption. Raptor-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibited lower mTORC1-S6K1 signaling and retarded osteoclast differentiation, as determined by the number of osteoclasts, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, and expression of osteoclast-specific genes. Enforced expression of constitutively active S6K1 rescued the impaired osteoclast differentiation in Raptor-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin could also inhibit osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast-specific gene expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that mTORC1 plays a key role in the network of catabolic bone resorption in osteoclasts and may serve as a potential pharmacological target for the regulation of osteoclast activity in bone metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2549713124,"The host protein Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) has been shown to be essential for recognition of both viral and intracellular bacterial pathogens, but its regulation remains unclear. Previously, we reported that mitochondrial membrane potential regulates STING-dependent IFN-β induction independently of ATP synthesis. Because mitochondrial membrane potential controls calcium homeostasis, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is regulated, in part, by intracellular calcium, we postulated that AMPK participates in STING activation; however, its role has yet to be been defined. Addition of an intracellular calcium chelator or an AMPK inhibitor to either mouse macrophages or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) suppressed IFN-β and TNF-α induction following stimulation with the STING-dependent ligand 5,6-dimethyl xanthnone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). These pharmacological findings were corroborated by showing that MEFs lacking AMPK activity also failed to up-regulate IFN-β and TNF-α after treatment with DMXAA or the natural STING ligand cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). As a result, AMPK-deficient MEFs exhibit impaired control of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus sensed by STING that can cause an influenza-like illness in humans. This impairment could be overcome by pretreatment of AMPK-deficient MEFs with type I IFN, illustrating that de novo production of IFN-β in response to VSV plays a key role in antiviral defense during infection. Loss of AMPK also led to dephosphorylation at Ser-555 of the known STING regulator, UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1). However, ULK1-deficient cells responded normally to DMXAA, indicating that AMPK promotes STING-dependent signaling independent of ULK1 in mouse cells.

https://openalex.org/W2552318115,"How the human brain plans, executes, and monitors continuous and fluent speech has remained largely elusive. For example, previous research has defined the cortical locations most important for different aspects of speech function, but has not yet yielded a definition of the temporal progression of involvement of those locations as speech progresses either overtly or covertly. In this paper, we uncovered the spatio-temporal evolution of neuronal population-level activity related to continuous overt speech, and identified those locations that shared activity characteristics across overt and covert speech. Specifically, we asked subjects to repeat continuous sentences aloud or silently while we recorded electrical signals directly from the surface of the brain (electrocorticography (ECoG)). We then determined the relationship between cortical activity and speech output across different areas of cortex and at sub-second timescales. The results highlight a spatio-temporal progression of cortical involvement in the continuous speech process that initiates utterances in frontal-motor areas and ends with the monitoring of auditory feedback in superior temporal gyrus. Direct comparison of cortical activity related to overt versus covert conditions revealed a common network of brain regions involved in speech that may implement orthographic and phonological processing. Our results provide one of the first characterizations of the spatiotemporal electrophysiological representations of the continuous speech process, and also highlight the common neural substrate of overt and covert speech. These results thereby contribute to a refined understanding of speech functions in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2551415529,"For most sample types, the automation of RNA and DNA sample preparation workflows enables high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation. Greater adoption of small RNA (sRNA) sequencing has been hindered by high sample input requirements and inherent ligation side products formed during library preparation. These side products, known as adapter dimer, are very similar in size to the tagged library. Most sRNA library preparation strategies thus employ a gel purification step to isolate tagged library from adapter dimer contaminants. At very low sample inputs, adapter dimer side products dominate the reaction and limit the sensitivity of this technique. Here we address the need for improved specificity of sRNA library preparation workflows with a novel library preparation approach that uses modified adapters to suppress adapter dimer formation. This workflow allows for lower sample inputs and elimination of the gel purification step, which in turn allows for an automatable sRNA library preparation protocol."
https://openalex.org/W2552037968,"Knowledge of the processes that underlie IgG subclass switching could inform strategies designed to counteract infections and autoimmunity. Here we show that TLR7 ligands induce subsets of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells to secrete interferon γ (IFNγ) in the absence of antigen receptor stimulation. In turn, TLR ligation and IFNγ cause B cells to express the transcription factor, T-bet, and to switch immunoglobulin production to IgG2a/c. Absence of TLR7 in T cells leads to the impaired T-bet expression in B cells and subsequent inefficient IgG2a isotype switching both in vitro and during the infection with Friend virus in vivo. Our results reveal a surprising mechanism of antiviral IgG subclass switching through T-cell intrinsic TLR7/IL-12 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2552270511,"Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the most severe viral zoonozes. It is prevalent throughout Africa, Asia and southern Europe. Limited availability of sequence data has hindered phylogeographic studies. The complete genomic sequence of all three segments of 14 Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains isolated from 1958-2000 in Russia, Central Asia and Africa was identified. Each genomic segment was independently subjected to continuous Bayesian phylogeographic analysis. The origin of each genomic segment was traced to Africa about 1,000-5,000 years ago. The virus was first introduced to South and Central Asia in the Middle Ages, and then spread to China, India and Russia. Reverse transfers of genomic segments from Asia to Africa were also observed. The European CCHFV genotype V was introduced to Europe via the Astrakhan region in South Russia 280-400 years ago and subsequently gradually spread westward in Russia, to Turkey and the Balkans less than 150 years ago. Only a few recombination events could be suggested in S and L genomic segments, while segment reassortment was very common. The median height of a non-reassortant phylogenetic tree node was 68-156 years. There were reassortment events within the European CCHFV lineage, but not with viruses from other locations. Therefore, CCHFV in Europe is a recently emerged zoonosis that represents a spillover from the global gene pool."
https://openalex.org/W2549396322,"Arrhythmias in cardiac tissue are generally associated with irregular electrical wave propagation in the heart. Cardiac tissue is formed by a discrete cell network, which is often heterogeneous. Recently, it was shown in simulations of two-dimensional (2D) discrete models of cardiac tissue that a wave crossing a fibrotic, heterogeneous region may produce reentry and transient or persistent ectopic activity provided the fraction of conducting connections is just above the percolation threshold. Here, we investigate the occurrence of these phenomena in three-dimensions by simulations of a discrete model representing a thin slab of cardiac tissue. This is motivated (i) by the necessity to study the relevance and properties of the percolation-related mechanism for the emergence of microreentries in three dimensions and (ii) by the fact that atrial tissue is quite thin in comparison with ventricular tissue. Here, we simplify the model by neglecting details of tissue anatomy, e. g. geometries of atria or ventricles and the anisotropy in the conductivity. Hence, our modeling study is confined to the investigation of the effect of the tissue thickness as well as to the comparison of the dynamics of electrical excitation in a 2D layer with the one in a 3D slab. Our results indicate a strong and non-trivial effect of the thickness even for thin tissue slabs on the probability of microreentries and ectopic beat generation. The strong correlation of the occurrence of microreentry with the percolation threshold reported earlier in 2D layers persists in 3D slabs. Finally, a qualitative agreement of 3D simulated electrograms in the fibrotic region with the experimentally observed complex fractional atrial electrograms (CFAE) as well as strong difference between simulated electrograms in 2D and 3D were found for the cases where reentry and ectopic activity were triggered by the micro-fibrotic region."

Data on sociodemographic characteristics of the participants and adherence to antihypertensive medication(s) were collected from patients by face to face interview using a pretested structured questionnaire. Comorbidities, antihypertensive medication(s) and blood pressure measurements were collected retrospectively from medical records. Medication adherence was assessed using Morisky's Medication Adherence Scale-8 score. We did the statistical analysis using chi-square test and binary logistic regression with level of α set at 0.05. Statistical significance was considered for variables with p<0.05.Out of 311 participants, 286 patients were eligible and were studied. More than half, 154 (53.8%), of the participants were males. The mean age of the participants was 54.8± 12.6 years (range 26 to 94). The majority, 196 (68.53%), of the participants were taking more than one antihypertensive medication. More than one third (39.5%) of the participants were non adherent to their medication(s). The rate of blood pressure control was 50.3%. In a univariate logistic regression analyses, age ≥65 years old (P = 0.008), physical inactivity (p<0.001), chat chewing (P<0.001), adding salt to food (P<0.001), and coffee use (P<0.001) are significantly associated with uncontrolled blood pressure.Almost half of the hypertensive patients on follow up had uncontrolled blood pressure. We recommend better health education and care of patients to improve the rate of blood pressure control at the hospital."
https://openalex.org/W2553842161,"Almost all dental diseases are caused by biofilms that consist of multispecies communities. DJK-5, which is a short D-enantiomeric, protease-resistant peptide with broad-spectrum anti-biofilm activity, was tested for its effect on oral multispecies biofilms. Peptide DJK-5 at 10 μg/mL effectively prevented the growth of these microbes in culture media in a time-dependent manner. In addition to the prevention of growth, peptide DJK-5 completely killed both Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis suspended from biofilms after 30 minutes of incubation in liquid culture media. DJK-5 also led to the effective killing of microbes in plaque biofilm. The proportion of bacterial cells killed by 10 μg/mL of DJK-5 was similar after 1 and 3 days, both exceeding 85%. DJK-5 was able to significantly prevent biofilm formation over 3 days (P = 0.000). After 72 hours of exposure, DJK-5 significantly reduced and almost completely prevented plaque biofilm production by more than 90% of biovolume compared to untreated controls (P = 0.000). The proportion of dead biofilm bacteria at the 10 μg/mL DJK-5 concentration was similar for 1- and 3-day-old biofilms, whereby >86% of the bacteria were killed. DJK-5 was also able to kill >79% and >85% of bacteria, respectively, after one-time and three brief treatments of 3-day-old biofilms. The combination of DJK-5 and chlorhexidine showed the best bacterial killing among all treatments, with ~83% and >88% of bacterial cells killed after 1 and 3 minutes, respectively. No significant difference was found in the percentage of biofilm killing amongst three donor plaque samples after DJK-5 treatment. In particular, DJK-5 showed strong performance in inhibiting biofilm development and eradicating pre-formed oral biofilms compared to L-enantiomeric peptide 1018. DJK-5 was very effective against oral biofilms when used alone or combined with chlorhexidine, and may be a promising agent for use in oral anti-biofilm strategies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2554209253,"Inducing apoptosis is an interesting therapeutic approach to develop drugs that act against helminthic parasites. Researchers have investigated how curcumin (CUR), a biologically active compound extracted from rhizomes of Curcuma longa, affects Schistosoma mansoni and several cancer cell lines. This study evaluates how CUR influences the induction of apoptosis and oxidative stress in couples of adult S. mansoni worms. CUR decreased the viability of adult worms and killed them. The tegument of the parasite suffered morphological changes, the mitochondria underwent alterations, and chromatin condensed. Different apoptotic parameters were determined in an attempt to understand how CUR affected adult S. mansoni worms. CUR induced DNA damage and fragmentation and increased the expression of SmCASP3/7 transcripts and the activity of Caspase 3 in female and male worms. However, CUR did not intensify the activity of Caspase 8 in female or male worms. Evaluation of the superoxide anion and different antioxidant enzymes helped to explore the mechanism of parasite death further. The level of superoxide anion and the activity of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) increased, whereas the activity of Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), Glutathione reductase (GR), and Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) decreased, which culminated in the oxidation of proteins in adult female and male worms incubated with CUR. In conclusion, CUR generated oxidative stress followed by apoptotic-like-events in both adult female and male S. mansoni worms, ultimately killing them."

Most of the critical fascin residues are positively charged arginine and lysine residues (11.Yang S. Huang F.K. Huang J. Chen S. Jakoncic J. Leo-Macias A. Diaz-Avalos R. Chen L. Zhang J.J. Huang X.Y.

These residues predominantly cluster at two sites, suggesting that these are the two major actin binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2) 5The abbreviations used are: ABS, actin binding site; Ub, ubiquitin; mUb, monoubiquitinated; DTNB, 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; SLS, static light scattering. that cross-link actin filaments through electrostatic interactions. It has been reported that the phosphorylation of Ser39 by PKC abrogated fascin bundling activity (15.Ono S. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsudaira P.T. Gnarra J.R. Obinata T. Matsumura F.

Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Proteins may be modified either by the monomeric ubiquitin (monoubiquitination) or the polymeric ubiquitin chain (polyubiquitination) (16.Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 17.Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins: decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 291-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination has been implicated in regulating DNA repair, endocytosis, virus budding, and nuclear export (18.Hicke L. Protein regulation by monoubiquitin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Fascin has been previously implicated in ubiquitin proteasome-mediated synaptic reorganization in neuronal ischemic tolerance (19.Meller R. Thompson S.J. Lusardi T.A. Ordonez A.N. Ashley M.D. Jessick V. Wang W. Torrey D.J. Henshall D.C. Gafken P.R. Saugstad J.A. Xiong Z.G. Simon R.P. Ubiquitin proteasome-mediated synaptic reorganization: a novel mechanism underlying rapid ischemic tolerance.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, whether or how ubiquitination regulates fascin function is not known. In this study we investigated the post-translational modification of fascin. We discovered that fascin was monoubiquitinated at two lysine residues in its ABS2. We further used an in vitro chemical ubiquitination method to synthesize monoubiquitinated fascin protein and investigated the effects of Lys250 monoubiquitination on fascin bundling activity, the ultrastructure of fascin bundles, and the kinetics of actin bundle formation and disassembly. Our data suggested that monoubiquitination at ABS2 inhibited fascin bundling activity by interfering the interaction between F-actin and the positively charged patch at ABS2. Our findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism for fascin proteins and shed new light on our understanding of actin bundle regulation. To understand molecular mechanisms that regulate fascin bundling activity, we employed mass spectrometry to identify post-translational modifications of fascin. FLAG-tagged fascin ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells was immunoprecipitated in the presence of phosphatase and pan-HDAC inhibitors, and the post-translational modifications were examined through LC-MS/MS. In addition to the previously reported phosphorylation at Ser39 (data not shown), we consistently detected fascin ubiquitination at Lys247 and Lys250 (Fig. 1A). To determine whether fascin was indeed modified by ubiquitination, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-fascin and HA-Ub. After immunoprecipitation of FLAG-fascin, the presence of ubiquitinated fascin was probed with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, ubiquitinated protein bands corresponding to mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-Ub fascin were visible when HEK293 cells were co-transfected with HA-Ub and FLAG-fascin, but not when the cells were transfected with FLAG-fascin or HA-Ub alone, suggesting that fascin is indeed modified by ubiquitination in these cells. To determine whether Lys247 and Lys250 are required for fascin ubiquitination, we mutated the two lysine residues to arginine. The K247R/K250R double mutant (2KR) reduced the ubiquitination level by ∼50% (Fig. 1C). The additional ubiquitination at Lys41, Lys42, Lys241, Lys353, Lys399, Lys464, and Lys471 was identified on the K247R/K250R fascin mutant through mass spectrometry (data not shown), suggesting that these lysine residues were suboptimal ubiquitination sites that could be modified in the absence of Lys247 and Lys250 ubiquitination. Mutation of three additional lysine residues (5KR mutant, K41R/K42R/K247R/K250R/K399R) further reduced the levels of ubiquitinated fascin (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether fascin protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination, we examined the effects of proteasome inhibitor MG132 on fascin protein levels in several fascin expressing cells from different lineages including NIH3T3 (murine fibroblast), B103 (rat neuroblastoma), HEK293 (human kidney), and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) cells. MG132 treatment had no effects on fascin protein levels in any of these cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, no detectable decrease in fascin protein levels was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells even 30 h after inhibition of total protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Fig. 1E). Taken together, our data suggest that fascin is a stable protein, and ubiquitination does not play a noticeable role in regulating its stability or protein expression levels. Because our data suggested that ubiquitination may not regulate fascin protein stability, we examined the possibility that fascin might be monoubiquitinated. As shown in Fig. 1F, fascin ubiquitination was readily detectable when co-transfected with K0-HA-Ub (all lysine residues mutated to alanine). The modification by K0 mutant ubiquitin suggested that fascin could be mono- or multiubiquitinated (ubiquitination of multiple lysine residues by ubiquitin monomers). To determine the proportions of mono- and multiubiquitinated fascin, we used Ni-NTA beads to purify ubiquitinated proteins from HEK293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-fascin and His-Ub, and the presence of fascin was probed with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1G, fascin purified with Ni-NTA beads were predominantly (>90%) corresponding to the monoubiquitinated band, although di-, tri-, and tetra-ubiquitinated fascin was also detectable (Fig. 1G). Similarly, we were able to observe monoubiquitinated fascin-2 when co-transfected with His-Ub (data not shown), suggesting that post-translational modification by ubiquitin is at least conserved between these two fascin isoforms. We were not able to ectopically express fascin-3 in HEK293 cells and thus not able to determine whether fascin-3 is modified by monoubiquitination. Taken together, our data suggested that both fascin and fascin-2 are post-translationally modified by monoubiquitination. In a previous systemic alanine scan mutagenesis, we identified two major actin binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2) critical for fascin bundling activity (11.Yang S. Huang F.K. Huang J. Chen S. Jakoncic J. Leo-Macias A. Diaz-Avalos R. Chen L. Zhang J.J. Huang X.Y. Molecular mechanism of fascin function in filopodial formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 274-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly most of the monoubiquitinated lysine residues are either required for fascin bundling activity (e.g. Lys41, Lys247, Lys250, Lys353, and Lys471), or are immediately adjacent to residues critical for bundling (e.g. Lys42 and Lys399) (Fig. 2A), indicating that monoubiquitination might be involved in the regulation of fascin-actin interaction. To understand the functional role of fascin monoubiquitination, we evaluate the structural relationship between monoubiquitination sites and electrostatic potential on the surface of solvent-accessible fascin (Fig. 2, B–E). There are two distinct patches of positive charges on fascin surface that co-localize with ABS1 and ABS2 (Fig. 2, B–D). A third positive charge patch at the tip of β-trefoil domain 3 may constitute an ancillary interaction site with F-actin (Fig. 2E). The positive charge patch at ABS1 consists of five positively charged residues Lys22, Lys41, Lys42, Lys43, and His65 from β-trefoil domain 1, with Lys41 and Lys42 being suboptimal monoubiquitination sites (Fig. 2C). Lys22, Lys41, and Lys43 have been previously shown to be essential for fascin activity. Glu27, another residue essential for fascin bundling activity, forms a 2.6 Å salt bridge with Lys43 (Fig. 2D). It is worth noting that Glu27 is the only essential residue with negative charge identified in our previous mutagenesis screening. The proximity of Glu27 to this positive charge patch and the Lys43–Glu27 salt bridge suggest that Glu27 may contribute to actin bundling by regulating the proper conformation of the ABS1 positive charge patch. The second positive charge patch at ABS2 consists of Arg149, Lys150, Arg151, Arg217, Lys220, Lys241, Lys244, Lys247, and Lys250 from β-trefoil 2, with Lys247 and Lys250 being the predominant monoubiquitination sites and Lys241 being one of the suboptimal ubiquitination sites (Fig. 2, E and F). Interestingly, the three monoubiquitinated residues locate at a lysine-rich loop that is at the center of the ABS2 positive charge patch (Fig. 2, E and F). A single lysine to alanine mutation shifted the EC50 of actin bundling activity from 0.15 μm (for WT fascin) to 0.2 μm (for K241A and K247A) or 0.4 μm (for K244A and K250A) (Fig. 2H). The EC50 further increased to 0.8–1 μm when two lysine residues were simultaneously mutated (K241A/K244A and K247A/K250A), suggesting that positive charges from this loop contribute to actin bundling accumulatively (Fig. 2H). The quadruple mutations of all the lysines in this loop lead to the complete loss of fascin activity (Fig. 2H), signifying the critical role of this monoubiquitinated loop in fascin-F-actin interaction. The co-localization of monoubiquitination sites with positively charged patches at actin binding sites suggests that monoubiquitination may regulate the electrostatic interaction between fascin and F-actin. On the one hand, it is possible that modification by highly positively charged ubiquitin would strengthen the fascin-actin interaction by providing additional positive charges (ubiquitin surface is highly positively charged); on the other hand, monoubiquitination may block fascin bundling activity by introducing steric hindrance to interfere with fascin-actin interaction. To understand the effects of monoubiquitination on fascin bundling activity, reconstituted actin bundling assay using purified wild type fascin and monoubiquitinated fascin would be essential. Recently, a chemical ubiquitination method has been developed to allow site-specific monoubiquitination of PCNA (20.Chen J. Ai Y. Wang J. Haracska L. Zhuang Z. Chemically ubiquitylated PCNA as a probe for eukaryotic translesion DNA synthesis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We adapted this method to chemically monoubiquitinate fascin (Fig. 3). We decided to focus on Lys247 and Lys250 because these two sites are the predominant monoubiquitination sites and also because there is currently no report on the post-translational regulation of fascin ABS2. Recombinant His-tagged ubiquitin was expressed and purified as an intein fusion protein. After cleavage of intein with cysteamine and activation of the thiol group with DTNB, the DTNB-activated ubiquitin is able to modify cysteine by forming disulfide bond with the free thiol group (Fig. 3A). Therefore, mutation of Lys247 or Lys250 to cysteine would allow the synthesis of chemically ubiquitinated fascin that closely resembles natively monoubiquitinated fascin (Fig. 3A). Seven of the eleven cysteine residues in fascin are solvent-accessible, which explains the modification of wild type fascin by Ub-DTNB (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the seven solvent-accessible cysteines to serines (7CS mutant) abrogated the chemical ubiquitination (Fig. 3B). Next we mutated Lys247 and Lys250 to cysteine and purified recombinant K250C/7CS and K247C/7CS fascin mutants. By incubating with Ub-DTNB, we were able to obtain monoubiquitinated K250C/7CS (referred to as mUb-fascin hereafter for simplicity). The chemical ubiquitination of K247C/7CS was unsuccessful for unknown reasons. The mUb-fascin was partially purified with Ni-NTA beads (Fig. 3B), and the chemical ubiquitination of the mutant at Cys250 through a disulfide bond was confirmed through mass spectrometry (Fig. 3C). To understand the biochemical function of fascin monoubiquitination, we first used a low speed sedimentation assay to determine the effects of chemical ubiquitination on fascin bundling activity (Fig. 4, A and B). The bundling activity of the 7CS mutant was comparable with wild type fascin, with no obvious difference in actin bundling EC50, suggesting that mutation of the seven cysteines has no global effect on fascin conformation (Fig. 4, A and B). The K250C mutation slightly shifted the actin bundling EC50 from 0.15 to ∼0.25 μm, which is consistent with its localization at a positive charge patch essential for fascin bundling activity. When the K250C/7CS mutant was monoubiquitinated at Cys250, the EC50 further shifted to ∼1 μm, suggesting an over 5-fold decrease in bundling activity after monoubiquitination at the lysine-rich Lys241–Lys250 loop. Importantly, cleavage of ubiquitin from mUb-fascin with DTT was able to restore fascin bundling activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the inhibition of fascin activity was indeed due to the modification of Cys250 by the disulfide bond linked ubiquitin. Next, we used two complementary assays to further evaluate the effects of monoubiquitination on fascin bundling activity (Fig. 4, C–F). To visualize actin filaments and bundles directly under a fluorescent microscope, F-actin incubated with or without wild type, mutant, or mUb-fascin was stained with phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 4C, wild type fascin, 7CS, and K250C/7CS mutants induced the formation of thick and bright actin bundles. The bundling activity of K250C/7CS was abrogated after chemical ubiquitination (Fig. 4, C and D). To evaluate the effects of monoubiquitination on the ultrastructure of F-actin bundles, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the actin bundles cross-linked by wild type, mutant, or mUb-fascin (Fig. 4, E–G). Incubation with 0.5 μm wild type fascin or 7CS mutant completely cross-linked all the actin filaments into tight and straight bundles with an average diameter of 383.5 ± 26.2 nm (Fig. 4, D and E). The K250C mutation slightly decreased the bundle thickness to 328.8 ± 28.3 nm and resulted in incomplete bundling of actin filaments (Fig. 4, D and E). No actin bundle was observed when F-actin was incubated with 0.5 μm mUb-fascin. The abrogation of actin bundling activity by chemical ubiquitination could be at least partially rescued by treatment with DTT (average bundle thickness, 260.6 ± 30.3 nm) (Fig. 4, D and E), which is consistent with the nature of the disulfide bond-linked chemical ubiquitination. It is worth noting that although mUb-fascin was able to cross-link F-actin at a saturating 2 μm, the bundles by Ub-fascin were less densely packed and disordered (Fig. 4G), suggesting inherently defective bundling by mUb-fascin even at high concentrations. To evaluate the effects of monoubiquitination on fascin bundling dynamics, we used light scattering to monitor the cross-linking of F-actin (Fig. 5A). Incubation of F-actin with wild type fascin led to increase in light scattering, suggesting the increase in bundle size after cross-linking of actin filaments. The increase in light scattering quickly reached a plateau at ∼15 min for wild type fascin and the 7CS mutant (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, there was a 10–15-min lag in actin bundling when actin filaments were incubated with 0.5 μm K250C/7CS mutant, although the increase in light scattering eventually reached a plateau comparable with that of wild type and 7CS mutant fascin after 60 min. No increase in light scattering was observed when actin filaments were incubated with 0.5 μm mUb-fascin. At the saturating bundling concentration for mUb-fascin (2 μm), there was a delay in actin bundling similar to that of 0.5 μm K250C mutant (Fig. 5A). Next, we investigated the effects of monoubiquitination on fascin bundle disassembly. The actin bundles were cross-linked by incubation with wild type fascin, K250C mutant, or mUb-fascin at saturating concentrations. The bundles were separated from unbound fascin proteins by centrifugation. The disassembly was initiated by resuspending the bundles in actin polymerization solution and monitored by the decrease in fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 5B, the fluorescence of wild type fascin and K250C/7CS bundles decreased by ∼50% at 5 min, indicating the disassembly of actin bundles. In contrast, fluorescence of Ub-fascin bundles decreased by more than 50% within 1 min, indicating an 5-fold increase in disassembly rates. Taken together, our data suggested that perturbation of the positive charge patches at the actin binding sites of fascin will affect both the avidity and kinetics of the interaction between fascin and F-actin. It is well established that fascin promotes cell migration in an actin bundling dependent manner. To determine the effects of monoubiquitination on the cellular function of fascin, we expressed wild type fascin or 2KR (K247R/K250R) mutant in DLD-1 colon cancer cells (Fig. 6A). The lysine to arginine mutations prevent monoubiquitination at these sites without perturbing the positive charges at the actin binding sites. The ectopic expression of wild type fascin in DLD-1 cells promoted the numbers of migrated cells by ∼2-fold (Fig. 6, B and C). The ectopic expression of 2KR mutant further promoted the migration of DLD-1 cells when compared with wild type fascin (Fig. 6, B and C). Taken together, our data suggested that monoubiquitination inhibits the pro-migratory activity of fascin. To determine the E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediating fascin monoubiquitination, we used FLAG-M2 beads to pull down fascin, and the proteins associated with fascin were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and identified through mass spectrometry. Interestingly, six peptides corresponding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase were identified through LC-MS/MS (Fig. 7A). EGFP-fascin was co-immunoprecipitated by Smurf1, but not its analog Smurf2, suggesting that fascin specifically interacted with Smurf1 (Fig. 7B). To determine whether Smurf1 interacted with endogenous fascin, the fascin protein in HEK293 cells was immunoprecipitated by anti-fascin antibody, and the co-immunoprecipitated Smurf1 was detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 7C, anti-fascin antibody, but not the control IgG, precipitated Smurf1, indicating the interaction between the two endogenous proteins. The ectopic expression of Smurf1 together with wild type or K0 ubiquitin in HEK293 cells significantly increased the amount of mono- and multiubiquitinated fascin (Fig. 7, D–F), whereas Smurf1 knockdown in HEK293 cells decreased the amount of monoubiquitinated fascin by ∼50%, suggesting that Smurf1 is at least partially responsible for catalyzing fascin monoubiquitination (Fig. 7G). To determine whether fascin might be able to directly mediate fascin monoubiquitination, we purified recombinant Smurf1 and conducted an in vitro ubiquitination assay. Purified fascin was incubated with ubiquitin, E1, and E2 ligase and with or without recombinant Smurf1. As shown in Fig. 7H, a mono-Ub fascin band was detectable when Smurf1 was present in the in vitro ubiquitination reaction, suggesting that Smurf1 directly catalyzes the monoubiquitination of fascin. Because individual actin filaments are insufficient to overcome compressive forces from the plasma membrane (21.Vignjevic D. Kojima S. Aratyn Y. Danciu O. Svitkina T. Borisy G.G. Role of fascin in filopodial protrusion.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), the cross-linking of F-actin into compact and rigid bundles is essential to generate finger-like protrusions such as filopodia. In filopodia fascin undergoes rapid cycles of association and dissociation, with t½ <10 s (4.Li A. Dawson J.C. Forero-Vargas M. Spence H.J. Yu X. König I. Anderson K. Machesky L.M.

https://openalex.org/W2555394080,"Many insects carry facultative bacterial symbionts, which provide benefits including resistance to natural enemies and abiotic stresses. Little is known about how these beneficial phenotypes are affected when biotic or abiotic threats occur simultaneously. The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) can host several well-characterized symbiont species. The symbiont known as X-type can protect against both parasitoid wasps and heat stress. Here, we used three pea aphid genotypes that were naturally infected with X-type and the symbiont Spiroplasma sp. We compared aphids coinfected with these two symbionts with those cured from X-type and infected with only Spiroplasma to investigate the ability of X-type to confer benefits to the host when two threats are experienced simultaneously. Our aim is to explore how robust symbiont protection may be outside a benign laboratory environment. Aphids were subjected to heat shock either before or after attack by parasitoid wasps. Under a benign temperature regime, the aphids carrying X-type tended to be better protected from the parasitoid than those cured. When the aphids experienced a heat shock before being parasitized aphids carrying X-type were more susceptible than those cured. Regardless of infection with the symbiont, the aphids benefitted from being heat shocked after parasitization. The results demonstrate how resistance to parasitoid wasps can be strongly environment-dependent and that a beneficial phenotype conferred by a symbiont under controlled conditions in the laboratory does not necessarily equate to a consistently useful effect in natural populations."

The primary goal of our study was to examine and compare the potential and the limits of marker-assisted selection and genome-wide prediction of six important seed quality traits of B. napus. Our study is based on a bi-parental population comprising 202 doubled haploid lines and a diverse validation set including 117 B. napus inbred lines derived from interspecific crosses between B. rapa and B. carinata. We used phenotypic data for seed oil, protein, erucic acid, linolenic acid, stearic acid, and glucosinolate content. All lines were genotyped with a 60k SNP array. We performed five-fold cross-validations in combination with linkage mapping and four genome-wide prediction approaches in the bi-parental population. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) with large effects were detected for erucic acid, stearic acid, and glucosinolate content, blazing the trail for marker-assisted selection. Despite substantial differences in the complexity of the genetic architecture of the six traits, genome-wide prediction models had only minor impacts on the prediction accuracies. We evaluated the effects of training population size, marker density and phenotyping intensity on the prediction accuracy. The prediction accuracy in the independent and genetically very distinct validation set still amounted to 0.14 for protein content and 0.17 for oil content reflecting the utility of the developed calibration models even in very diverse backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2550591043,"Human behaviour in various circumstances mirrors the corresponding brain connectivity patterns, which are suitably represented by functional brain networks. While the objective analysis of these networks by graph theory tools deepened our understanding of brain functions, the multi-brain structures and connections underlying human social behaviour remain largely unexplored. In this study, we analyse the aggregate graph that maps coordination of EEG signals previously recorded during spoken communications in two groups of six listeners and two speakers. Applying an innovative approach based on the algebraic topology of graphs, we analyse higher-order topological complexes consisting of mutually interwoven cliques of a high order to which the identified functional connections organise. Our results reveal that the topological quantifiers provide new suitable measures for differences in the brain activity patterns and inter-brain synchronisation between speakers and listeners. Moreover, the higher topological complexity correlates with the listener’s concentration to the story, confirmed by self-rating, and closeness to the speaker’s brain activity pattern, which is measured by network-to-network distance. The connectivity structures of the frontal and parietal lobe consistently constitute distinct clusters, which extend across the listener’s group. Formally, the topology quantifiers of the multi-brain communities exceed the sum of those of the participating individuals and also reflect the listener’s rated attributes of the speaker and the narrated subject. In the broader context, the presented study exposes the relevance of higher topological structures (besides standard graph measures) for characterising functional brain networks under different stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2556215147,"Like other animals flies develop a state of learned helplessness in response to unescapable aversive events. To show this, two flies, one 'master', one 'yoked', are each confined to a dark, small chamber and exposed to the same sequence of mild electric shocks. Both receive these shocks when the master fly stops walking for more than a second. Behavior in the two animals is differently affected by the shocks. Yoked flies are transiently impaired in place learning and take longer than master flies to exit from the chamber towards light. After the treatment they walk more slowly and take fewer and shorter walking bouts. The low activity is attributed to the fly's experience that its escape response, an innate behavior to terminate the electric shocks, does not help anymore. Earlier studies using heat pulses instead of electric shocks had shown similar effects. This parallel supports the interpretation that it is the uncontrollability that induces the state."
https://openalex.org/W2556104244,"Crustaceans can exert a greater force using their claws than many animals can with other appendages. Furthermore, in decapods, the chela is a notable organ with multifunctional roles. The coconut crab, Birgus latro, is the largest terrestrial crustacean and has a remarkable ability to lift weights up to approximately 30 kg. However, the pinching force of this crab's chelae has not been previously investigated. In the present study, we measured the pinching force of the chelae in 29 wild coconut crabs (33-2,120 g in body weight). The maximum force ranged from 29.4 to 1,765.2 N, and showed a strong positive correlation with body mass. Based on the correlation between pinching force and body weight, the force potentially exerted by the largest crab (4 kg weight) reported in a previous study would be 3300 N, which greatly exceeds the pinching force of other crustaceans as well as the bite force of most terrestrial predators. The mighty claw is a terrestrial adaptation that is not only a weapon, which can be used to prevent predator attack and inhibit competitors, but is also a tool to hunt other terrestrial organisms with rigid exteriors, aiding in these organisms to be omnivores."

Results provide a long-term view of risk that delineates the main tornado corridors in the United States where the expected annual rate exceeds two tornadoes per 10,000 square km. A few counties in the Texas Panhandle and central Kansas have annual rates that exceed four tornadoes per 10,000 square km. Refitting the model after removing the least damaging tornadoes from the data (EF0) produces a similar map but with the greatest tornado risk shifted south and eastward. Second, a space-time model is fit to the counts aggregated in raster cells with terms that control for changes in climate factors. Results provide a short-term view of risk. The short-term view identifies the shift of tornado activity away from the Ohio Valley under El Ni\~no conditions and away from the Southeast under positive North Atlantic oscillation conditions. The combined predictor effects on the local rates is quantified by fitting the model after leaving out the year to be predicted from the data. The models provide state-of-the-art views of tornado risk that can be used by government agencies, the insurance industry, and the general public."
https://openalex.org/W2553852401,"In light of current debates on global climate change it has become important to know more on how large, roaming species have responded to environmental change in the past. Using the highly variable mitochondrial control region, we revisit theories of Rangifer colonization and propose that the High Arctic archipelagos of Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, and Novaia Zemlia were colonized by reindeer from the Eurasian mainland after the last glacial maximum. Comparing mtDNA control region sequences from the three Arctic archipelagos showed a strong genetic connection between the populations, supporting a common origin in the past. A genetic connection between the three archipelagos and two Russian mainland populations was also found, suggesting colonization of the Eurasian high Arctic archipelagos from the Eurasian mainland. The age of the Franz Josef Land material (>2000 years before present) implies that Arctic indigenous reindeer colonized the Eurasian Arctic archipelagos through natural dispersal, before humans approached this region."
https://openalex.org/W2555539717,"This paper proposes a new mathematical model to evaluate the effects of artificial feeding on bee colony population dynamics. The proposed model is based on a classical framework and contains differential equations that describe the changes in the number of hive bees, forager bees, and brood cells, as a function of amounts of natural and artificial food. The model includes the following elements to characterize the artificial feeding scenario: a function to model the preference of the bees for natural food over artificial food; parameters to quantify the quality and palatability of artificial diets; a function to account for the efficiency of the foragers in gathering food under different environmental conditions; and a function to represent different approaches used by the beekeeper to feed the hive with artificial food. Simulated results are presented to illustrate the main characteristics of the model and its behavior under different scenarios. The model results are validated with experimental data from the literature involving four different artificial diets. A good match between simulated and experimental results was achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2556257285,"Biodiversity-friendly coffee certifications offer a viable way to protect wildlife habitat while providing a financial incentive to farmers. Most studies related to these certifications focus on avian habitat requirements and it is not known whether these standards also apply to other wildlife, such as mammals, that inhabit the coffee landscapes. We assessed the non-volant mammalian fauna and their associated habitat requirements in 23 sites representing forest, Bird Friendly® shade, conventional shade, and sun coffee habitats. We used Sherman trap-grids to measure small mammal abundance and richness, while camera traps were set for medium-sized and large mammals. We detected 17 species of mammals, representing 11 families. This preliminary study indicates that coffee farms in this region provide an important refuge for mammalian wildlife. Mammal species density ranked significantly higher in Bird Friendly® coffee sites than other coffee habitats, although there was no significant difference for species richness (using Chao2 estimator) among the habitat types. No significant difference was found in small mammal abundance among the habitat types. We found a higher species density of medium and large mammals in sites with larger, more mature shade trees associated with, but not required by Bird Friendly® certification standards. However, lower strata vegetation (5 cm to 1 m tall), the only vegetation parameter found to increase abundance and density for small mammals, is not specified in the Bird Friendly® standards. Our findings suggest that although the standards devised for avian habitat do benefit mammals, further study is needed on the requirements specific for mammals that could be included to enhance the coffee habitat for mammals that inhabit these coffee landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2551221471,"The use of Internet-based sources of information for health surveillance applications has increased in recent years, as a greater share of social and media activity happens through online channels. The potential surveillance value in online sources of information about emergent health events include early warning, situational awareness, risk perception and evaluation of health messaging among others. The challenge in harnessing these sources of data is the vast number of potential sources to monitor and developing the tools to translate dynamic unstructured content into actionable information. In this paper we investigated the use of one social media outlet, Twitter, for surveillance of avian influenza risk in North America. We collected AI-related messages over a five-month period and compared these to official surveillance records of AI outbreaks. A fully automated data extraction and analysis pipeline was developed to acquire, structure, and analyze social media messages in an online context. Two methods of outbreak detection; a static threshold and a cumulative-sum dynamic threshold; based on a time series model of normal activity were evaluated for their ability to discern important time periods of AI-related messaging and media activity. Our findings show that peaks in activity were related to real-world events, with outbreaks in Nigeria, France and the USA receiving the most attention while those in China were less evident in the social media data. Topic models found themes related to specific AI events for the dynamic threshold method, while many for the static method were ambiguous. Further analyses of these data might focus on quantifying the bias in coverage and relation between outbreak characteristics and detectability in social media data. Finally, while the analyses here focused on broad themes and trends, there is likely additional value in developing methods for identifying low-frequency messages, operationalizing this methodology into a comprehensive system for visualizing patterns extracted from the Internet, and integrating these data with other sources of information such as wildlife, environment, and agricultural data."
https://openalex.org/W2553805023,"A major goal for HIV-1 vaccine development is an ability to elicit strong and durable broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) responses. The trimeric envelope glycoprotein (Env) spikes on HIV-1 are known to contain multiple epitopes that are susceptible to bNAbs isolated from infected individuals. Nonetheless, all trimeric and monomeric Env immunogens designed to date have failed to elicit such antibodies. We report the structure-guided design of HIV-1 cyclically permuted gp120 that forms homogeneous, stable trimers, and displays enhanced binding to multiple bNAbs, including VRC01, VRC03, VRC-PG04, PGT128, and the quaternary epitope-specific bNAbs PGT145 and PGDM1400. Constructs that were cyclically permuted in the V1 loop region and contained an N-terminal trimerization domain to stabilize V1V2-mediated quaternary interactions, showed the highest homogeneity and the best antigenic characteristics. In guinea pigs, a DNA prime-protein boost regimen with these new gp120 trimer immunogens elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses against highly sensitive Tier 1A isolates and weaker neutralizing antibody responses with an average titer of about 115 against a panel of heterologous Tier 2 isolates. A modest fraction of the Tier 2 virus neutralizing activity appeared to target the CD4 binding site on gp120.

Env is synthesized as a gp160 precursor protein, which is further cleaved into surface proximal gp120 and membrane anchored gp41 subunits. A functional HIV-1 Env spike consists of a trimer of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers. The base of the trimer is proximal to the viral membrane (3Liu J. Bartesaghi A. Borgnia M.J. Sapiro G. Subramaniam S.

Binding of Env to the CD4 receptor on T cells causes extensive conformational changes in the Env trimer and leads to the formation of an open CD4-bound conformation in which the cryptic, co-receptor binding site becomes accessible. This facilitates interaction of the co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) with Env, further driving the fusion of viral and host cell membranes (3Liu J. Bartesaghi A. Borgnia M.J. Sapiro G. Subramaniam S.

In natural HIV-1 infection, most of the B cell response is elicited against the Env protein, due to its location on the virion surface and relatively high immunogenicity.

To minimize conformational dynamics in these loops, based on available structural information, we inserted a heterologous trimerization domain into the V1 loop region to trimerize the gp120 molecule at the apex instead of at the C terminus of gp120 as had been done previously. We have previously designed cyclically permuted gp120 by making new N and C termini at the V1 loop and by connecting the native N and C termini with an appropriate flexible linker (37Saha P.

Here we describe the antigenicity and immunogenicity of a new generation of cyclically permuted gp120s that exhibit improved homogeneity and trimer stability. Several cryo-EM and crystallographic studies indicate that the three monomers of gp120 in pre-fusion, native Env interact though quaternary contacts at the apex of the trimer that are largely mediated by the V1V2 regions of the gp120 subunits (3Liu J.

We hypothesized that insertion of a heterologous trimerization sequence in the V1V2 region might help in the formation of native-like gp120 trimers. We anticipated that the long distances between the N and C termini of commonly used coiled-coil trimerization domains would make them unsuitable for insertion into V1V2 loop regions of gp120 protein. To overcome this problem, we designed gp120 derivatives that are cyclically permuted at the V1 loop region of gp120 at sites where mutations and insertions are tolerated (supplemental Fig. S1) (37Saha P. Bhattacharyya S. Kesavardhana S. Miranda E.R. Ali P.S. Sharma D. Varadarajan R. Designed cyclic permutants of HIV-1 gp120: implications for envelope trimer structure and immunogen design.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 1836-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To this end, the native N and C termini of the gp120 molecule were connected with a 20-amino acid linker and new N and C termini were created within the V1 loop region at specific positions in the gp120 sequence. When a heterologous, disulfide-linked, coiled-coil trimerization domain from human cartilage matrix protein (hCMP) was inserted at the V1 loop region of cyclically permuted gp120, it facilitated the formation of homogeneous trimers. In the present study we characterized the antigenicity and immunogenicity of cyclically permuted gp120 trimers made from both JRFL and JRCSF gp120 sequences. The flexible C1 region of gp120 (residues 31–83) was removed from all the constructs to restrict conformational flexibility (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2). We also used JRFL gp120 (residues 83–511) and JRFLgp120-L6-hCMP (JRFL gp120 with a C-terminal hCMP domain connected with a 6-residue linker) for comparison, to assess the biochemical properties, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of cyclically permuted gp120 trimers (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2). All constructs were expressed in HEK 293T cells and proteins were purified from cell supernatants by lentil lectin affinity chromatography. Both cyclically permuted gp120 constructs (JRFL-hCMP-V1cyc and JRCSF-hCMP-V1cyc) appeared as homogeneous trimers as determined by blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) (Fig. 1B), analytical gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1C), and multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S3), whereas JRFL gp120 appeared as mixed oligomers with predominantly monomeric species and JRFLgp120-L6-hCMP appeared as a mixture of oligomers. The JRFL-hCMP-V1cyc and JRCSF-hCMP-V1cyc were not dissociated into dimers or monomers after purification and they were stable at 4 °C for 40 days without any degradation. In addition, we monitored the stability of all constructs after heating them to 60 and 100 °C for 1 h and subsequently monitoring their interaction with bNAbs using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Heating at 60 °C did not affect the binding of cyclically permuted gp120 trimers and JRFLgp120-L6-hCMP to surface-immobilized bNAbs, VRC01, and PGT128 (Fig. 1E). In contrast, binding of JRFL gp120 to VRC01 and PGT128 was significantly decreased upon heating at 60 °C. When all proteins were heated at 100 °C, cyclically permuted gp120 trimers retained detectable binding to VRC01 and PGT128 bNAbs, in contrast to JRFL gp120 and JRFLgp120-L6-hCMP, which lost binding (Fig. 1E). The thermal stability was also monitored by CD spectroscopy. Data were analyzed assuming two-state thermal unfolding and yielded apparent melting temperatures (Tm) of 341.8 (68.7 °C) and 337.1 K (64.0 °C) for JRFL trimeric cyclic permutant and monomeric gp120, respectively (Fig. 1F). To further understand the conformation and trimeric nature of cyclically permuted gp120 trimers we subjected purified protein to negative stain EM. Visual inspection of the negative stained EM images indicates that cyclically permuted gp120 attained trimeric structures, consistent with our SEC-MALS data (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S4), albeit with some degree of conformational heterogeneity. In addition, we performed negative stain EM on the cyclically permuted gp120 trimers complexed with PGDM1400 (38Sok D. van Gils M.J. Pauthner M. Julien J.P. Saye-Francisco K.L. Hsueh J. Briney B.

The disease spectrum of EV-D68 infections in children with underlying medical conditions other than asthma, the role of EV-D68 loads on clinical illness, and the variation of EV-D68 strains within the same institution over time have not been described. We sought to define the association between EV-D68 loads and sequence variation, and the clinical characteristic in hospitalized children at our institution from 2011 to 2014. Methods May through November 2014, and August to September 2011 to 2013, a convenience sample of nasopharyngeal specimens from children with rhinovirus (RV)/EV respiratory infections were tested for EV-D68 by RT-PCR. Clinical data were compared between children with RV/EV-non-EV-D68 and EV-D68 infections, and among children with EV-D68 infections categorized as healthy, asthmatics, and chronic medical conditions. EV-D68 loads were analyzed in relation to disease severity parameters and sequence variability characterized over time. Results In 2014, 44% (192/438) of samples tested positive for EV-D68 vs. 10% (13/130) in 2011–13 (p<0.0001). PICU admissions (p<0.0001) and non-invasive ventilation (p<0.0001) were more common in children with EV-D68 vs. RV/EV-non-EV-D68 infections. Asthmatic EV-D68+ children, required supplemental oxygen administration (p = 0.03) and PICU admissions (p <0.001) more frequently than healthy children or those with chronic medical conditions; however oxygen duration (p<0.0001), and both PICU and total hospital stay (p<0.01) were greater in children with underlying medical conditions, irrespective of viral burden. By phylogenetic analysis, the 2014 EV-D68 strains clustered into a new sublineage within clade B. Conclusions This is one of the largest pediatric cohorts described from the EV-D68 outbreak. Irrespective of viral loads, EV-D68 was associated with high morbidity in children with asthma and co-morbidities. While EV-D68 circulated before 2014, the outbreak isolates clustered differently than those from prior years."
https://openalex.org/W2549634579,"As an increasing number of malaria-endemic countries approach the disease elimination phase, sustenance of control efforts and effective monitoring are necessary to ensure success. Mathematical models that estimate anti-parasite antibody seroconversion rates are gaining relevance as more sensitive transmission intensity estimation tools. Models however estimate yearly seroconversion and seroreversion rates and usually predict long term changes in transmission, occurring years before the time of sampling. Another challenge is the identification of appropriate antigen targets since specific antibody levels must directly reflect changes in transmission patterns. We therefore investigated the potential of antibodies to sporozoite and blood stage antigens for detecting short term differences in malaria transmission in two communities in Northern Ghana with marked, seasonal transmission.Cross-sectional surveys were conducted during the rainy and dry seasons in two communities, one in close proximity to an irrigation dam and the other at least 20 Km away from the dam. Antibodies against the sporozoite-specific antigens circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and Cell traversal for ookinetes and sporozoites (CelTOS) and the classical blood stage antigen apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) were measured by indirect ELISA. Antibody levels and seroprevalence were compared between surveys and between study communities. Antibody seroprevalence data were fitted to a modified reversible catalytic model to estimate the seroconversion and seroreversion rates.Changes in sporozoite-specific antibody levels and seroprevalence directly reflected differences in parasite prevalence between the rainy and dry seasons and hence the extent of malaria transmission. Seroconversion rate estimates from modelled seroprevalence data did not however support the above observation.The data confirms the potential utility of sporozoite-specific antigens as useful markers for monitoring short term/seasonal changes in malaria transmission. It may however be essential to update models to allow for assessment of seasonal changes in malaria transmission, which usually occur within four to six months."
https://openalex.org/W2551537259,"The potential effects of pile driving on fish populations and commercial fisheries have received significant attention given the prevalence of pile driving occurring in coastal habitats throughout the world. Behavioral impacts of sound generated from these activities on fish typically have a greater area of influence than physical injury, and may therefore adversely affect a greater portion of the local population. This study used acoustic telemetry to assess the movement, residency, and survival of 15 sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and 10 grey snapper (Lutjanus griseus) in Port Canaveral, Florida, USA, in response to 35 days of pile driving at a wharf complex. No obvious signs of mortality or injury to tagged fish were evident from the data. Received sound pressure levels from pile strikes on the interior of the wharf, where reef fish primarily occur, were on average 152–157 dB re 1 μPa (peak). No significant decrease in sheepshead daytime residency was observed during pile driving within the central portion of the wharf and area of highest sound exposure, and no major indicators of displacement from the exposure wharf with the onset of pile driving were observed. There was evidence of potential displacement from the exposure wharf that coincided with the start of pile driving observed for 2 out of 4 grey snapper, along with a decrease in daytime residency for a subset of this species with high site fidelity prior to the event. Results indicate that snapper may be more likely to depart an area of pile driving disturbance more readily than sheepshead, but were less at risk for behavioral impact given the lower site fidelity of this species."
https://openalex.org/W2552121179,"Phosphorylation at serine 235 (S235) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) plays a critical role in the viral life cycle. For medical and virological interests, we exploited the HEK293T kidney cells to test 3 candidate protein kinases on NS5A S235 phosphorylation. Inhibitors that inhibit casein kinase I α (CKIα), polo-like kinase I (PlKI) or calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) all reduced NS5A S235 phosphorylation. CKIα was studied previously and PlKI had severe cytotoxicity, thus CaMKII was selected for validation in the Huh7.5.1 liver cells. In the HCV (J6/JFH1)-infected Huh7.5.1 cells, CaMKII inhibitor reduced NS5A S235 phosphorylation and HCV RNA levels without apparent cytotoxicity. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of CaMKII γ and δ isoforms in the Huh7.5.1 cells. Both CaMKII γ and δ directly phosphorylated NS5A S235 in vitro. CaMKII γ or δ single knockdown did not affect NS5A S235 phosphorylation but elevated the HCV RNA levels in the infected cells. CKIα plus CaMKII (γ or δ) double knockdown reduced NS5A S235 phosphorylation and reduced HCV RNA levels; however, the HCV RNA levels were higher than those in the infected cells with CKIα single knockdown. We conclude that CKIα-mediated NS5A S235 phosphorylation is critical for HCV replication. CaMKII γ and δ may have negative roles in the HCV life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2551530112,"Within the large order of bats, sexual size dimorphism measured by forearm length and body mass is often female-biased. Several studies have explained this through the effects on load carrying during pregnancy, intrasexual competition, as well as the fecundity and thermoregulation advantages of increased female body size. We hypothesized that wing shape should differ along with size and be under variable selection pressure in a species where there are large differences in flight behaviour. We tested whether load carrying, sex differential migration, or reproductive advantages of large females affect size and wing shape dimorphism in the common noctule (Nyctalus noctula), in which females are typically larger than males and only females migrate long distances each year. We tested for univariate and multivariate size and shape dimorphism using data sets derived from wing photos and biometric data collected during pre-migratory spring captures in Switzerland. Females had forearms that are on average 1% longer than males and are 1% heavier than males after emerging from hibernation, but we found no sex differences in other size, shape, or other functional characters in any wing parameters during this pre-migratory period. Female-biased size dimorphism without wing shape differences indicates that reproductive advantages of big mothers are most likely responsible for sexual dimorphism in this species, not load compensation or shape differences favouring aerodynamic efficiency during pregnancy or migration. Despite large behavioural and ecological sex differences, morphology associated with a specialized feeding niche may limit potential dimorphism in narrow-winged bats such as common noctules and the dramatic differences in migratory behaviour may then be accomplished through plasticity in wing kinematics."
https://openalex.org/W2553294090,"Birth defects are among the leading causes of infant mortality and contribute substantially to illness and long-term disability. Defects in Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling are associated with cleft lip/palate. Many craniofacial syndromes are caused by defects in signaling pathways that pattern the cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) along the dorsal-ventral axis. For example, auriculocondylar syndrome is caused by impaired Endothelin-1 (Edn1) signaling, and Alagille syndrome is caused by defects in Jagged-Notch signaling. The BMP, Edn1, and Jag1b pathways intersect because BMP signaling is required for ventral edn1 expression that, in turn, restricts jag1b to dorsal CNCC territory. In zebrafish, the scaffolding protein Wdr68 is required for edn1 expression and subsequent formation of the ventral Meckel’s cartilage as well as the dorsal Palatoquadrate. Here we report that wdr68 activity is required between the 17-somites and prim-5 stages, that edn1 functions downstream of wdr68, and that wdr68 activity restricts jag1b, hey1, and grem2 expression from ventral CNCC territory. Expression of dlx1a and dlx2a was also severely reduced in anterior dorsal and ventral 1st arch CNCC territory in wdr68 mutants. We also found that the BMP agonist isoliquiritigenin (ISL) can partially rescue lower jaw formation and edn1 expression in wdr68 mutants. However, we found no significant defects in BMP reporter induction or pSmad1/5 accumulation in wdr68 mutant cells or zebrafish. The Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway is also known to be important for craniofacial development and can interfere with BMP signaling. Here we further report that TGF-β interference with BMP signaling was greater in wdr68 mutant cells relative to control cells. To determine whether interference might also act in vivo, we treated wdr68 mutant zebrafish embryos with the TGF-β signaling inhibitor SB431542 and found partial rescue of edn1 expression and craniofacial development. While ISL treatment failed, SB431542 partially rescued dlx2a expression in wdr68 mutants. Together these findings reveal an indirect role for Wdr68 in the BMP-Edn1-Jag1b signaling hierarchy and dorso-anterior expression of dlx1a/2a."

https://openalex.org/W2549786899,"The peripheral nervous system may play an important role in normal bone maintenance and remodeling. Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide associated with bone loss and formation that may mediate the effects of the nervous system. The purpose of this study is to determine if treadmill running combined with electro-acupuncture at Jiaji acupoints (Jiaji-EA) affects tibial bone mass and SP expression in rabbits with sciatic nerve injury. Twenty-four juvenile male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups: sham injury control (sham), sciatic never crush control (SNCr), treadmill running (treadmill), and Jiaji-EA combined with treadmill running (ET group). The SNCr, treadmill, and ET groups all had an induced sciatic never crush injury of approximately 2mm. Control groups received no intervention; the treadmill and ET groups were trained by treadmill; the ET group also received Jiaji-EA. After the 4 weeks of treatment, toe-spreading index (TSI), BMD, bone strength, and SP expression in the tibia were significantly lower in the nerve injury groups (SNCr, treadmill, and ET) compared to the sham groups (p<0.05). Treatment (treadmill and ET groups) increased all measures compared to the SNCr group (p<0.05). Further, TSI, BMD, bone strength, and SP expression in the ET group were higher than the treadmill group (p<0.05). Our results indicate that treadmill therapy combined with electro-acupuncture at Jiaji acupoints prevents bone loss in rabbit tibias after sciatic nerve injury. This may occur in two ways: indirectly in association with axon regeneration and directly via loading on the bone mediated through increased SP expression. This study provides important evidence for the clinical treatment of bone loss after peripheral nerve injury."

We tested the iminosugars N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) and N-(9-methoxynonyl)-1deoxynojirimycin (MON-DNJ) for safety in uninfected animals, and for antiviral efficacy in animals infected with a lethal dose of guinea pig adapted EBOV. 1850 mg/kg/day NB-DNJ and 120 mg/kg/day MON-DNJ administered intravenously, three times daily, caused no adverse effects and were well tolerated. A pilot study treating infected animals three times within an 8 hour period was promising with 1 of 4 infected NB-DNJ treated animals surviving and the remaining three showing improved clinical signs. MON-DNJ showed no protective effects when EBOV-infected guinea pigs were treated. On histopathological examination, animals treated with NB-DNJ had reduced lesion severity in liver and spleen. However, a second study, in which NB-DNJ was administered at equally-spaced 8 hour intervals, could not confirm drug-associated benefits. Neither was any antiviral effect of iminosugars detected in an EBOV glycoprotein pseudotyped virus assay. Overall, this study provides evidence that NB-DNJ and MON-DNJ do not protect guinea pigs from a lethal EBOV-infection at the dose levels and regimens tested. However, the one surviving animal and signs of improvements in three animals of the NB-DNJ treated cohort could indicate that NB-DNJ at these levels may have a marginal beneficial effect. Future work could be focused on the development of more potent iminosugars."
https://openalex.org/W2556817732,"Telomere shortening is an important molecular event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiation; however, its role in HCC progression and prognosis is less clear. Our study aimed to examine the association of telomere length with survival of patients with HCC.We measured telomere length in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 126 persons with HCC in the United States (U.S.) who were followed for mortality outcomes. Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by a monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between telomere length and all-cause mortality. We also examined associations between telomere length and patient characteristics using multiple linear regression.During a mean follow-up of 6.0 years, 79 deaths occurred among 114 individuals for whom survival data were available. The ratio of RTL in tumor relative to non-tumor tissue was greater for individuals with regional or distant stage tumors (0.97) than localized stage tumors (0.77), and for individuals with grade III or IV tumors (0.95) than grade II (0.88) or grade I (0.67) tumors. An RTL ratio ≥1 was not associated with survival (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55, 1.55) compared to a ratio <1, after adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, tumor stage and tumor size. Similarly, RTL in the tumor and non-tumor tissue, respectively, were not associated with survival.This U.S. based study found that telomeres may be longer in more aggressive HCCs. There was no evidence, however, that telomere length was associated with survival of patients with HCC. Future investigations are warranted to clarify the role of telomere length in HCC prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2551508227,"Gaze is one of the most important cues for human communication and social interaction. In particular, gaze contact is the most primary form of social contact and it is thought to capture attention. A very early-differentiated brain response to direct versus averted gaze has been hypothesized. Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to test this hypothesis. Topographical analysis allowed us to uncover a very early topographic modulation (40-80 ms) of event-related responses to faces with direct as compared to averted gaze. This modulation was obtained only in the condition where intact broadband faces-as opposed to high-pass or low-pas filtered faces-were presented. Source estimation indicated that this early modulation involved the posterior parietal region, encompassing the left precuneus and inferior parietal lobule. This supports the idea that it reflected an early orienting response to direct versus averted gaze. Accordingly, in a follow-up behavioural experiment, we found faster response times to the direct gaze than to the averted gaze broadband faces. In addition, classical evoked potential analysis showed that the N170 peak amplitude was larger for averted gaze than for direct gaze. Taken together, these results suggest that direct gaze may be detected at a very early processing stage, involving a parallel route to the ventral occipito-temporal route of face perceptual analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2552512798,"The slowly inactivating or late Na+ current, INa-L, can contribute to the initiation of both atrial and ventricular rhythm disturbances in the human heart. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie these pro-arrhythmic influences are not fully understood. At present, the major working hypothesis is that the Na+ influx corresponding to INa-L significantly increases intracellular Na+, [Na+]i; and the resulting reduction in the electrochemical driving force for Na+ reduces and (may reverse) Na+/Ca2+ exchange. These changes increase intracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i; which may further enhance INa-L due to calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the Na+ channels. This paper is based on mathematical simulations using the O'Hara et al (2011) model of baseline or healthy human ventricular action potential waveforms(s) and its [Ca2+]i homeostasis mechanisms. Somewhat surprisingly, our results reveal only very small changes (≤ 1.5 mM) in [Na+]i even when INa-L is increased 5-fold and steady-state stimulation rate is approximately 2 times the normal human heart rate (i.e. 2 Hz). Previous work done using well-established models of the rabbit and human ventricular action potential in heart failure settings also reported little or no change in [Na+]i when INa-L was increased. Based on our simulations, the major short-term effect of markedly augmenting INa-L is a significant prolongation of the action potential and an associated increase in the likelihood of reactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current, ICa-L. Furthermore, this action potential prolongation does not contribute to [Na+]i increase."

For each patient, the presence of intimal flap, intramural hematoma, and vessel dilatation were evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists on each sequence. Interobserver agreement was assessed. Results Seventeen patients (mean age: 41 ± 10 [SD] years; 13 men) were diagnosed with definite dissection. The intimal flaps were more frequently detected on 3D-PD (88.2%, 15/17) than on 3D-iMSDE-T1 (29.4%, 5/17), and post-contrast 3D-iMSDE-T1 (35.3%, 6/17; P = 0.006 and P = 0.004, respectively). No significant difference was found in the detection rate of intramural hematomas (59–71%) and vascular dilatations (47%) on each sequence. Interobserver agreement for detection of dissection findings showed almost perfect agreement (k = 0.84–1.00), except for detection of intimal flaps on pre-contrast 3D-iMSDE-T1 (k = 0.62). After addition of 3D-PD to pre- and post-contrast 3D-iMSDE-T1, more patients were diagnosed with definite dissection with the initial MRI (88.2% vs. 47.1%; P = 0.039). Conclusions The intimal flap might be better visualized on the 3D-PD sequence than the 3D-iMSDE-T1 sequences, allowing diagnosis of definite dissection without follow-up imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2556358229,"Yellowstone National Park is home to one of the only plains bison populations that have continuously existed on their present landscape since prehistoric times without evidence of domestic cattle introgression. Previous studies characterized the relatively high levels of nuclear genetic diversity in these bison, but little is known about their mitochondrial haplotype diversity. This study assessed mitochondrial genomes from 25 randomly selected Yellowstone bison and found 10 different mitochondrial haplotypes with a haplotype diversity of 0.78 (± 0.06). Spatial analysis of these mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes did not detect geographic population subdivision (FST = -0.06, p = 0.76). However, we identified two independent and historically important lineages in Yellowstone bison by combining data from 65 bison (defined by 120 polymorphic sites) from across North America representing a total of 30 different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes from one of the Yellowstone lineages represent descendants of the 22 indigenous bison remaining in central Yellowstone in 1902. The other mitochondrial DNA lineage represents descendants of the 18 females introduced from northern Montana in 1902 to supplement the indigenous bison population and develop a new breeding herd in the northern region of the park. Comparing modern and historical mitochondrial DNA diversity in Yellowstone bison helps uncover a historical context of park restoration efforts during the early 1900s, provides evidence against a hypothesized mitochondrial disease in bison, and reveals the signature of recent hybridization between American plains bison (Bison bison bison) and Canadian wood bison (B. b. athabascae). Our study demonstrates how mitochondrial DNA can be applied to delineate the history of wildlife species and inform future conservation actions."
https://openalex.org/W2555917652,"Foxn1 (forkhead box N1), also known as the nude gene or winged-helix nude (Whn), is a forkhead transcription factor thought to be restricted to keratinocytes in the skin and thymus. Consistent with this tissue distribution, spontaneous or targeted mutation of Foxn1 results in the absence of both hair and a thymus. Genetic manipulation of the Foxn1 locus thus represents a powerful tool for tissue specific gene control in the skin and thymus, and tools such as Cre recombinase under control of the Foxn1 locus are widely used for this purpose. Unexpectedly, we show that Foxn1[Cre] exhibits unexpected activity in male germ cells, resulting in ubiquitous targeting of loxP-flanked alleles in all tissues in offspring from Foxn1[Cre] expressing male mice. Inheritance of recombined loxP alleles occurs independently of Cre inheritance (i.e., offspring lacking Cre nonetheless exhibit recombined alleles), suggesting that Foxn1[Cre] induced recombination in male germ cells must occur prior to meiosis in diploid germ cells. Together with previously published data, our results show that Foxn1, and alleles under its control, are expressed in the pre-meiotic male germline, revealing a new tool for germline targeting of genes, and raising important concerns for gender selection when using Foxn1 regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2553714368,"Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder with diverse seizure types and epileptic syndromes. AMPA receptor antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzoquinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) attenuates spontaneous recurrent seizures in rats. However, the anti-epileptic effect of NBQX in chronic epilepsy model is poorly understood. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular matrix structures, surround parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons, and play a critical role in neuronal cell development and synaptic plasticity. Here, we focused on the potential involvement of PNNs in the treatment of epilepsy by NBQX. Rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 50 mg/kg) for 28 consecutive days to establish chronic epilepsy models. Subsequently, NBQX (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected for 3 days for the observation of behavioral measurements of epilepsy. The Wisteria floribundi agglutinin (WFA)-labeled PNNs were measured by immunohistochemical staining to evaluate the PNNs. The levels of three components of PNNs such as tenascin-R, aggrecan and neurocan were assayed by Western blot assay. The results showed that there are reduction of PNNs and decrease of tenascin-R, aggrecan and neurocan in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the rats injected with PTZ. However, NBQX treatment normalized PNNs, tenascin-R, aggrecan and neurocan levels. NBQX was sufficient to decrease seizures through increasing the latency to seizures, decrease the duration of seizure onset, and reduce the scores for the severity of seizures. Furthermore, the degradation of mPFC PNNs by chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) exacerbated seizures in PTZ-treated rats. Finally, the anti-epileptic effect of NBQX was reversed by pretreatment with ChABC into mPFC. These findings revealed that PNNs degradation in mPFC is involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and enhancement of PNNs may be effective for the treatment of epilepsy."

In this study, a transcriptomes of mixed-stage population of CFN was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. 68.10 million Illumina high quality paired end reads were obtained which generated 26,817 transcripts with a mean length of 1,032 bp and an N50 of 1,672 bp, of which 16,467 transcripts were annotated against six databases. In total, 20,311 coding region sequences (CDS), 495 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 8,353 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were predicted, respectively. The CFN with the most shared sequences was B. xylophilus with 16,846 (62.82%) common transcripts and 10,543 (39.31%) CFN transcripts matched sequences of all of four plant parasitic nematodes compared. A total of 111 CFN transcripts were predicted as homologues of 7 types of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) with plant/fungal cell wall-degrading activities, fewer transcripts were predicted as homologues of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes than fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes. The phylogenetic analysis of GH5, GH16, GH43 and GH45 proteins between CFN and other organisms showed CFN and other nematodes have a closer phylogenetic relationship. In the CFN transcriptome, sixteen types of genes orthologues with seven classes of protein families involved in the RNAi pathway in C. elegans were predicted. This research provides comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level, which will facilitate the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of CFN and the distribution of gene functions at the macro level, potentially revealing improved methods for controlling CFN."

We examined the association of the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 FA (ω-6:ω-3) and individual FA components with pathological results among men with prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing radical prostatectomy. Methods Sixty-nine men were included in the study. Components of ω-6 (linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA)) and ω-3 (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass selective detector separation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine association of FA with pathological high grade (Gleason ≥4+3) disease. Results The were 35 men with low grade disease (Gleason ≤3+4) and 34 men with high grade disease. Men with low grade disease were significantly younger (58y vs 61y, p = 0.012) and had lower D’Amico clinical classification (p = 0.001) compared to men with high grade disease. There was no significant association of ω-6:ω-3 with high grade disease (OR 0.93, p = 0.78), however overall ω-6, ω-3, and individual components of ω-6 and ω-3 FAs except EPA were significantly associated with high grade disease (ω-6: OR 3.37, 95% CI: 1.27,8.98; LA: OR 3.33, 95% CI:1.24,8.94; AA: OR 2.93, 95% CI:1.24,6.94; DGLA: OR 3.21, 95% CI:1.28,8.04; ω-3: OR 3.47, 95% CI:1.22,9.83; DHA: OR 3.13, 95% CI:1.26,7.74). ω-6 and ω-3 FA components were highly correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.77). Conclusion Higher levels of individual components of ω-6 and ω-3FAs may be associated with higher-grade PCa. Impact Studies into the causative factors/pathways regarding FAs and prostate carcinogenesis may prove a potential association with PCa aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2549786100,"We investigated the ability of monoclonal B cells to restore primary and secondary T-cell dependent antibody responses in adoptive immune-deficient hosts. Priming induced B cell activation and expansion, AID expression, antibody production and the generation of IgM+IgG- and IgM-IgG+ antigen-experienced B-cell subsets that persisted in the lymphopenic environment by cell division. Upon secondary transfer and recall the IgM-IgG+ cells responded by the production of antigen-specific IgG while the IgM+ memory cells secreted mainly IgM and little IgG, but generated new B cells expressing germinal center markers. The recall responses were more efficient if the antigenic boost was delayed suggesting that a period of adaptation is necessary before the transferred cells are able to respond. Overall these findings indicate that reconstitution of a functional and complete memory pool requires transfer of all different antigen-experienced B cell subsets. We also found that the size of the memory B cell pool did not rely on the number of the responding naïve B cells, suggesting autonomous homeostatic controls for naïve and memory B cells. By reconstituting a stable memory B cell pool in immune-deficient hosts using a monoclonal high-affinity B cell population we demonstrate the potential value of B cell adoptive immunotherapy."

The circadian clock is a highly conserved system existing in almost all organisms that regulates a wide range of physiological and behavioral events to adapt to the day-night cycle. Here, the interactions between hCK1ɛ/δ/DBT (Drosophila ortholog of CK1δ/ɛ) and serine-rich (SR) motifs from hPER2 (ortholog of Drosophila per) were reconstructed in a Drosophila circadian system. The results indicated that in Drosophila, the SR mutant form hPER2S662G does not recapitulate the mouse or human mutant phenotype. However, introducing hCK1δ (but not DBT) shortened the circadian period and restored the SR motif function. We found that hCK1δ is catalytically more efficient than DBT in phosphorylating the SR motif, which demonstrates that the evolution of CK1δ activity is required for SR motif modulation. Moreover, an abundance of phosphorylatable SR motifs and the striking emergence of putative SR motifs in vertebrate proteins were observed, which provides further evidence that the correlated evolution between kinase activity and its substrates set the stage for functional diversity in vertebrates. It is possible that such correlated evolution may serve as a biomarker associated with the adaptive benefits of diverse organisms.

These results also provide a concrete example of how functional synthesis can be achieved through introducing evolutionary partners in vivo. The assumption of conserved function between orthologs has been supported even between relatively distant species. However, orthologs are increasingly found to diverge in sequence, in expression, and even in knock-out phenotypes (1Studer R.A. Robinson-Rechavi M. How confident can we be that orthologs are similar, but paralogs differ?.Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As a kinase phosphorylates tens to hundreds of substrates, if we can catalog the genetic and functional differences of orthologous kinases and pick out relevant changes to adaptive functional regions in their substrates, then we can better understand the impact of orthologs on evolutionary novelty. In Drosophila, DBT, the single Drosophila ortholog of CK1δ/ɛ, binds to and phosphorylates PER, and DBT then regulates the subcellular localization of PER and signals the rapid degradation of PER by the proteasome (2Cyran S.A.

The mammalian orthologs of DBT are the CK1δ/ɛ proteins, which mediate the phosphorylation and degradation of mPER2 and facilitate its entry into the nucleus (5Akashi M. Ichise T. Mamine T. Takumi T.

Moreover, the introduction of hPER2S662G (the first serine in the SR motif is mutated) into mice faithfully recapitulates the human phenotype, whereas hPER2S662D (which mimics the phosphorylated status) lengthened the circadian period (7Xu Y. Toh K.L. Jones C.R. Shin J.Y. Fu Y.H. Ptácek L.J. Modeling of a human circadian mutation yields insights into clock regulation by PER2.Cell. 2007; 128: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, a mutation in CK1δ (hCK1δT44A) also causes FASPS and hCK1δT44A expression in mice, thus shortening the circadian period (6Xu Y. Padiath Q.S. Shapiro R.E. Jones C.R. Wu S.C. Saigoh N.

These studies suggest that PER2 SR phosphorylation is conserved by CK1δ in the mammalian circadian clock. In Drosophila, however, overexpressing hCK1δT44A lengthened the circadian period without mimicking mouse or human phenotypes (6Xu Y. Padiath Q.S. Shapiro R.E. Jones C.R. Wu S.C. Saigoh N. Saigoh K.

CK1δ and CK1ɛ are close paralog of the CK1 family, which is found in most vertebrates (8Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Casein kinase I: spatial organization and positioning of a multifunctional protein kinase family.Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). One consensus phosphorylation target for CK1 is (pS/pT)XX(S/T) (pS/pT, phospho-serine/threonine; X, any amino acid) (9Flotow H. Roach P.J.

Interestingly, many sequential phosphorylation examples in SR motifs by CK1δ/ɛ have been described to play important roles in various biological processes. Phosphorylation of the SR motif in the Yes-associated protein (YAP) by CK1δ/ɛ was reported to promote YAP degradation and therefore suppress its oncogenic function (11Zhao B. Li L. Tumaneng K. Wang C.-Y. Guan K.-L. A coordinated phosphorylation by Lats and CK1 regulates YAP stability through SCFβ-TRCP.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). A homologous mutation in the hPER1 SR motif (hPER1S714G) caused an advanced feeding rhythm in mice and disrupted their metabolic oscillation (12Liu Z. Huang M. Wu X. Shi G. Xing L. Dong Z. Qu Z. Yan J. Yang L. Panda S. Xu Y. PER1 phosphorylation specifies feeding rhythm in mice.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 1509-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These well recorded examples suggest critical functions for the SR motifs in the mammalian physiology. However, the apparent complexity of CK1δ/ɛ and SR motifs in mammals has hampered efforts to catalog the genetic differences and link them to specific phenotypic consequences. Here, we improved the available strategies for assessing circadian rhythms by reconstructing a kinase-substrate system in Drosophila and using a reliable circadian period as a readout together with a biochemistry assay and bioinformatics analysis to determine their correlation. We demonstrated that despite the highly conserved enzyme domains and sequences between Drosophila and vertebrates, CK1δ has acquired novel regulatory features that may interact with a newly emerging SR motif in their vertebrate substrates. We suggest that divergences between orthologs effectively facilitate the evolution of new functions in vertebrates. Identifying the underlying intrinsic mechanisms that drive the differences among different species can provide valuable information for determining when and how new functions occur in the species and therefore realize functional synthesis in vivo. The maximum likelihood indicates that the difference in CK1δ in the circadian period of mammals and Drosophila may be related to different substrates and/or different kinase-substrate interactions. To clarify the functional differences, we compared the protein sequences of human and mouse PER1 and PER2 with those of Drosophila PER (dPER). A sequence alignment analysis shows that dPER does not contain the hPER2 SR motif conserved sequence (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Because the phosphorylation status of PER2 SR motif is correlated with the period length in mice, we can use point mutation-mediated period changes to quantitatively analyze whether the SR motif is compatible with the Drosophila system (e.g. PER2S662G abolishes sequential phosphorylation for a short period and PER2S662D mimics phosphorylation for a long period). In mice, however, the expression of the period paralogous hPER1S714G (12Liu Z. Huang M. Wu X. Shi G. Xing L. Dong Z. Qu Z. Yan J. Yang L. Panda S. Xu Y. PER1 phosphorylation specifies feeding rhythm in mice.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 1509-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or hPER3S630G, 4Z. Liu and Y. Xu, unpublished data. the first serine-directed mutation in the SR motif, failed to change the locomotor period as observed in the hPER2S662G mice, suggesting that PER2 is an optimal candidate for quantitative analysis of locomotor period changes. Therefore, we introduced hPER2S662 (wild type), hPER2S662G, and hPER2S662D into Drosophila. Driven by timeless-GAL4 (tim-GAL4), the overexpression of hPER2S662, hPER2S662G, and hPER2S662D all lengthened the Drosophila circadian period (Fig. 1B, upper row), indicating that hPER2 can regulate the circadian period in Drosophila. However, SR motif-dependent circadian period changes were not apparent in Drosophila. The period lengths from three genotypes of hPER2 transgenic flies were positively correlated with hPER2 expression but not with mutant types (Fig. 1B, bottom row). These results indicated that the SR motif of hPER2 is incompatible with the Drosophila circadian system. To test whether the incompatibility of the SR motif with the Drosophila circadian system occurs because the SR motif cannot be modified or because the Drosophila circadian system cannot respond to the phosphorylated SR motifs, we examined the hPER2 proteins in transgenic flies. As compared with the SR motif-dependent sequential phosphorylation of PER2 proteins in mice (Fig. 1C) (7Xu Y. Toh K.L. Jones C.R. Shin J.Y. Fu Y.H. Ptácek L.J. Modeling of a human circadian mutation yields insights into clock regulation by PER2.Cell. 2007; 128: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), hPER2S662, hPER2S662G, and hPER2S662D showed a similar phosphorylation pattern in Drosophila (Fig. 1D), which may explain why the period lengths are not associated with their genotypes (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that the SR motif is not recognized by the kinases in the Drosophila background. The recent discovery of phosphorylation by the NEMO/NLK kinase at the “per-short” domain (Fig. 1A) on dPER stimulates a hierarchical phosphorylation by DBT to set the circadian period in the Drosophila (13Chiu J.C. Ko H.W. Edery I.

Biol. 2011; 21: 756-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), strikingly similar to the PER2 SR motif in mammals (a potential SR motif on dPER). To estimate the conservation of this kinase and its potential role as PER1 and PER2 kinase within a more functional context in mice, we generated Nlk knock-out mice with targeted embryonic stem cells obtained from the International Mouse Mutagenesis Program (Fig. 2A). Because Nlk-deficient mice died within 2 days after birth, we tried to examine the function of NLK in the central clock by examining the circadian phenotype of the Nestin-cre;Nlkf/f mice, in which Nlk is knocked out in central and peripheral neuron cells. However, as with Nlk conventional knock-out mice, most Nestin-cre;Nlkf/f mice died after birth. We only generated one Nestin-cre;Nlkf/f mouse that survived. Tested by wheel running, the circadian period of this mouse is 23.29 h, as compared with the 23.44 h of the control mice (Fig. 2B). Given the limited number of Nestin-cre;Nlkf/f mice, we cannot come to a confident conclusion of the function of NLK in the central clock. Because Nlk expressed at a high level in the liver (data not shown), Alb-Cre (Cre recombinase transcription under the control of the albumin promoter) mice were crossed with Nlkf/f mice to generate liver-specific Nlk knock-out mice (Alb;Nlkf/f) (Fig. 2C) (15Knutson S.K.

The circadian period of PER2::LUC expression from the liver tissues was comparable in the WT and Alb;Nlkf/f mice (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we found that the discernible expression changes of the core clock genes such as Per2 and Cry1, and time-dependent changes in phosphorylated state of PER1 and PER2 relative to the WT and Alb;Nlkf/f mice, did not occur (Fig. 2, E and F). These data indicate that the phosphorylation function of NEMO/NLK on the SR-like or SR motif was not conserved in Drosophila and mammals. hCK1δ, hPER2, and NEMO/NLK cannot recapitulate the function in Drosophila or mammals, which suggests that divergences may have occurred in both substrates and kinases. The mechanisms by which new functions evolved can be identified by introducing new components into ancestral backgrounds and characterizing the effects of their interactions (18Dean A.M. Thornton J.W. Mechanistic approaches to the study of evolution: the functional synthesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 675-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Yokoyama S. Tada T. Zhang H.

We attempted to restore the SR motif function by reconstructing hPER2S662, hPER2S662G, and hPER2S662D expression in hCK1ɛ, hCK1δ, or DBT backgrounds in Drosophila. First, we introduced DBT, hCK1ɛ, or hCK1δ into Drosophila and fused a V5 tag to their C terminus to compare the expression levels among different lines and different proteins. Consistent with previous studies (6Xu Y. Padiath Q.S. Shapiro R.E. Jones C.R. Wu S.C. Saigoh N. Saigoh K. Ptácek L.J. Fu Y.H. Functional consequences of a CKIδ mutation causing familial advanced sleep phase syndrome.Nature. 2005; 434: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), the transgenic lines expressing hCK1δ, hCK1ɛ, or DBT driven by tim-GAL4 all showed a significantly prolonged circadian period (Table 1), indicating that CK1ɛ and CK1δ are able to regulate components for circadian function in a Drosophila genetic background. Although the expression levels of DBT, hCK1ɛ, and hCK1δ in transgenic flies are comparable among different lines (Fig. 3A), the overexpression of hCK1ɛ and hCK1δ produced a longer circadian period than DBT (Table 1), suggesting that hCK1ɛ and hCK1δ may display different activity and/or interact with different substrates than DBT in Drosophila. Interestingly, when hCK1δ was coexpressed with hPER2S662, hPER2S662G, or hPER2S662D in Drosophila under tim-GAL4 driver, hPER2S662G::CK1δ double transgenic flies showed a significantly shorter period relative to hPER2S662::CK1δ and hPER2S662D::CK1δ flies (Fig. 3B), thus recapitulating the mouse function (7Xu Y.

Modeling of a human circadian mutation yields insights into clock regulation by PER2.Cell. 2007; 128: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, the expression of hPER2S662, hPER2S662D, or hPER2S662G from CK1ɛ- or DBT-overexpressed background produced weak or no effects on the circadian period (Fig. 3B). These phenotypes suggest that hCK1δ preferably (or at least partially) interacts with the SR motif to generate a behavioral response in the Drosophila circadian clock. In other words, hCK1δ (rather than CK1ɛ or DBT) is the preferred kinase for the PER2 SR motif.TABLE 1Period length of DBT and CK1δ/ɛ in transgenic fliesLinePeriod ± S.E.% of rhythmic (Rhy/Tested)htim-GAL4/UAS-DBT125.7 ± 0.377 (30/39)225.3 ± 0.471 (32/45)325.3 ± 0.387 (20/23)tim-GAL4/UAS-hCK1δ126.4 ± 0.471 (22/31)226.6 ± 0.571 (15/21)326.9 ± 0.586 (18/21)tim-GAL4/UAS-hCK1ɛ127.1 ± 0.591 (21/23)227.0 ± ± 0.495 (39/41)327.4 ± 0.572 (28/39)tim-GAL4/UAS-hCK1δT44A126.2 ± 0.573 (22/30)225.7 ± 0.583 (25/30)326.1 ± 0.482 (23/28)UAS-DBT/+123.9 ± 0.296 (26/27)223.7 ± 0.389 (17/19)323.7 ± 0.494 (32/34)UAS-hCK1δ/+123.6 ± 0.384 (21/25)223.6 ± 0.474 (23/31)323.7 ± 0.3100 (29/29)UAS-hCK1ɛ/+123.8 ± 0.388 (22/25)223.6 ± 0.492 (23/25)323.7 ± 0.397 (29/30)UAS-hCK1δT44A/+123.8 ± 0.388 (23/26)223.7 ± 0.294 (30/32)323.6 ± 0.392 (24/26)tim-GAL4/+23.8 ± 0.388 (21/24) Open table in a new tab To provide more direct evidence to support this conclusion, we examined hPER2 protein levels from different kinase backgrounds and found that hCK1δ has differential effects on PER2S662, PER2S662G, and PER2S662D protein levels, leading to varied and distinct protein oscillation profiles (Fig. 4A). In contrast, DBT has a uniform destabilizing effect on these very different PER2 mutants (Fig. 4A). The comparable interaction of DBT and hCK1δ with hPER2 (Fig. 4B) suggests that DBT phosphorylates other sites in PER2. Although the mechanisms by which the hPER2S662G/hPER2S662/hPER2S662D proteins were affected and how PER2 protein change was linked to a period event are not well understood, we speculate that the kinase activity of hCK1δ increased during evolution. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic flies expressing hCK1δT44A, which reduced the kinase activity on PER2 (6Xu Y. Padiath Q.S. Shapiro R.E. Jones C.R. Wu S.C. Saigoh N. Saigoh K. Ptácek L.J. Fu Y.H. Functional consequences of a CKIδ mutation causing familial advanced sleep phase syndrome.Nature. 2005; 434: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Similar to DBT and CK1ɛ, hCK1δT44A also lengthened the Drosophila circadian period like DBT and CK1ɛ (Table 1), and the expression levels among these kinases are comparable (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, hCK1δT44A has an impaired ability to shorten period length in hPER2S662G transgenic flies (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the kinase activity of hCK1δ is critical for the SR motif. To further compare the kinase activity among DBT, CK1ɛ, and CK1δ on the SR motif, we immunoprecipitated DBT, CK1ɛ, and CK1δ from transgenic Drosophila heads with a V5 antibody because DBT purified from Escherichia coli is enzymatically inactive (21Preuss F.

Replacing the first serine with an aspartate residue in the PER2 SR motif could facilitate the sequential phosphorylation (7Xu Y. Toh K.L. Jones C.R. Shin J.Y. Fu Y.H. Ptácek L.J. Modeling of a human circadian mutation yields insights into clock regulation by PER2.Cell. 2007; 128: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 25Toh K.L. Jones C.R.

An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome.Science. 2001; 291: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). We thus substituted the first serine with an aspartate residue in the SR motif (DVASLTSQCSYSS) (termed SD) to test the phosphorylation reactions in vitro. GST was linked to SD (GST-SD: GST-DVASLTSQCSYSS), and this peptide was expressed in E. coli by induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and purified with a glutathione-Sepharose affinity resin. The in vitro kinase assay showed that CK1δ had the greatest activity on SD (Fig. 4C). Because the level of DBT auto-phosphorylation was much lower than that of CK1δ, we reasoned that the difference in kinase activity over the SR motif was not caused by auto-phosphorylation because auto-phosphorylation likely inhibits the activity of kinases (26Gietzen K.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Finally, we compared the effect of these kinases on the generalized CK1 peptide (GST-RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSITA) (29Marin O. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Design and synthesis of two new peptide substrates for the specific and sensitive monitoring of casein kinases 1 and 2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), where serine phosphorylation is primed by a series of aspartic or glutamic acids. Consistent with the effect on the SR motif, hCK1δ phosphorylated the CK1 peptide much more efficiently than DBT (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these data suggest that hCK1δ strongly enhanced phosphorylation at the SR motif and did so more efficiently than DBT and CK1ɛ. If CK1δ had evolved to obtain the ability to catalyze the SR motif in the PER2 protein, it should be able to perform similar reactions on the SR motif in other substrates or utilize SR motifs in other protein to expand the repertoire of its enzymatic activities and result in functional adaptation (30Coyle S.M.

We found that an increased number of studies have suggested that CK1δ/ɛ phosphorylate SR motifs in many proteins including PER2, PER1, APC, NFATC, and PGC1a and YAP1 (7Xu Y. Toh K.L. Jones C.R.

These SR motifs are well conserved in vertebrates (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with the highly conserved vertebrate CK1δ/ɛ protein sequence (supplemental Fig. S2 and Fig. 5B). In addition, we found that SR motifs are divergent among 48% (13/27) of PER3 proteins lacking one or two serine residues at SR motifs (Fig. 5C). However, the SR motifs in PER1 and PER2 are well conserved in different vertebrates (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, mouse PER3 does not show interaction with CK1ɛ/δ, which is inconsistent with PER1 and PER2 (35Lee C. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Direct association between mouse PERIOD and CKIɛ is critical for a functioning circadian clock.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both observations suggest that the functional evolution of CK1δ kinase activity is likely correlated with the evolution of the SR motif and/or that this activity is likely to preserve SR motifs in CK1δ substrates. Finally, a statistical analysis was performed of the conserved SR motifs in various species using protein sequence data retrieved from the OrthoMcl database. We searched for proteins in each species that contain a conserved SXXSXXSXXSXXS (5S) motif with their human orthologs and compared them with proteins containing other conserved similar pattern motifs such as AXXAXXAXXAXXA (Fig. 5D, A is an any amino acid).
