https://openalex.org/W2041800983,"Reexamination of stratified faunal components of a prehistoric Aleut midden excavated on Amchitka Island, Alaska, indicates that Aleut prey items changed dramatically during 2500 years of aboriginal occupation. Recent ecological studies in the Aleutian Islands have shown the concurrent existence of two alternate stable nearshore communities, one dominated by macroalgae, the other by epibenthic herbivores, which are respectively maintained by the presence or absence of dense sea otter populations. Thus, rather than cultural shifts in food preference, the changes in Aleut prey were probably the result of local overexploitation of sea otters by aboriginal Aleuts."
https://openalex.org/W1985782384,"Concentrations of organic pollutants in the air and in precipitation have been measured at Enewetak Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean. These data from a site removed from industrial and human activity indicate the present concentrations of synthetic organic pollutants in the atmosphere and establish the long-range atmospheric transport of organic pollutants to remote marine areas. Hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorocyclohexane isomers are present in the remote marine atmosphere. Polychlorobiphenyls, total DDT, dieldrin, chlordane, and two phthalate ester plasticizers were also found in the samples. The concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere remote from continental sources are good measures of the minimum concentrations of air pollutants on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W1977130497,Adult body size and fecundity of a number of hemimetabolous aquatic insects depend largely on thermal conditions during the larval period. Small adults and reduced fecundity result when temperatures are either warmed or cooled with respect to more optimal thermal conditions. Temperature apparently affects adult size by altering the larval growth rate and the timing and rate of adult tissue development for each larva. The data suggest a new interpretation for the geographic distribution of aquatic insects.
https://openalex.org/W2045905171,"In Metapolybia aztecoides some mated females produce only workers, losing in competition with other similar egg-layers before producing either males or queens. Worker production by these ultimately nonreproductive females may incidentally benefit others without lowering individual fitness (without ""altruism""). It could be a by-product of mutualism rather than of kin selection or parental manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W1999322078,"When hot saturated solutions of thermal copolymers containing the 18 common amino acids are allowed to cool, huge numbers of uniform, microscopic, relatively firm, and elastic spherules separate. The place of this phenomenon in a comprehensive theory of original thermal generation of primordial living units is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1997019455,"Laboratory measurements of foliar uptake of sulfur dioxide and ozone by red kidney beans demonstrated a strong effect of relative humidity on internal pollutant dose. Foliar uptake was enhanced two- to threefold for sulfur dioxide and three- to fourfold for ozone by an increase in relative humidity from 35 to 75 percent. For the same exposure concentration, vegetation growing in humid areas (such as the eastern United States) may experience a significantly greater internal flux of pollutants than that in more arid regions."
https://openalex.org/W2122817311,"Systematic variations in annual growth increments, formed over a 16-year period in shells of the marine bivalve mollusc Spisula solidissima, reveal more growth in some years than others. Favorable years are indicated by larger than expected annual growth increments and successful recruitment of juveniles. Variations in the size of growth increments correlate negatively with sea surface temperatures. The results suggest that the annual growth increments in the shells of certain molluscs record changes in the marine environment and may be useful monitors of pollution and indicators of paleotemperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2039886205,"""Helium spots,"" where a significant amount of helium is present in the soil [up to 350 parts per million with a high (3)He to (4)He ratio of (8.90 +/- 0.31) x 10(-6)], have been found along the fault zone formed by the 1966 Matsushiro swarm earthquakes. The formation of the ""helium spots"" and the occurrence of the earthquakes are interpreted as the results of a diapiric uprise of a magma approximately 1 kilometer in diameter."
https://openalex.org/W2016571026,"Seismic activity in the greater New York City area is concentrated along several northeast-trending faults of which the Ramapo fault appears to be the most active. Three nuclear power plants at Indian Point, New York, are situated close to the Ramapo fault. For a reactor site in use for 40 years, the probability that the site will experience an intensity equal to or in excess of the design (safe shutdown) earthquake is estimated to be about 5 to 11 percent."

https://openalex.org/W1964702548,"Individuals of the species Phoronopsis viridis Hilton exhibit an even distribution within their colonies. The distance between nearest neighbors is probably related to the space required for the operation of the lophophore. Distributions of other marine invertebrates are discussed briefly, together with the paleoecological implications of such knowledge."

https://openalex.org/W1969052502,"An interdisciplinary assessment of hail suppression in the past, present, and future has shown it to be currently scientifically uncertain but a potentially beneficial future technology. An established suppression technology would be widely adopted in the Great Plains, providing benefits to agriculture and secondarily to the American consumer. Development of a reliable technology will require a sizable longterm federal commitment to atmospheric and social research. Subcritical funding would be a mistake. Orderly future usage of hail suppression, with its scientific complexities and regional character, will necessitate development of governmental regulations, evaluation procedures, interstate arrangements, and means for compensating those who lose from modification."

https://openalex.org/W2063090629,"The difficulties associated with earthquake prediction are reviewed. The once-promising dilatancy theory has been displaced by monitoring of small earthquakes and earthquake swarms. While the ability to observe possible precursors has increased considerably, no reliable precursor has been found; without a long, detailed monitoring record, it is difficult to tell if some anomalous activity foretells a major earthquake. The existence of slow earthquakes would greatly complicate long-term prediction. (RWR)"

https://openalex.org/W2164074984,"In an interview, Joan Claybrook of NHTSA cites crash tests performed on foreign and domestic mass production vehicles and on NHTSA safe vehicle prototypes to take American automobile industry to task for not utilizing already invented safety devices and for believing that safety has no market value. In recent crash tests, American cars have held up better than their foreign counterparts, an advantage American have generally failed so far to capitalize on in their advertising. A prototype vehicle (equipped with air bags, soft bumpers, run-flat tires, antiskid brakes, and a radar warning system to forestall rear-end collisions) provides protection from serious injuries during 50 mph impacts while maintaining good fuel economy (33 mpg) and meeting all EPA emission standards. None of car's principal safety features have been incorporated in mass produced vehicles. Claybrook warns that the automakers view that safety has no market value could prove to be just as wrong as their attitude a year or two ago toward fuel efficiency. Meanwhile, Minicars, Inc., which made NHTSA prototype, plans to mass produce it, beginning in 1984."
