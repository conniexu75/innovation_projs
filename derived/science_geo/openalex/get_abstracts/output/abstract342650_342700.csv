https://openalex.org/W2051385393,"In spite of its simple composition, the structure of chalcocite, CU(2)S, has long defied analysis. In high chalcocite the sulfur atoms are in hexagonal close-packing, while three varieties of copper atoms, with four-fold, three-fold, and two-fold coordinations respectively, are in disorder in the interstices."

https://openalex.org/W2051062431,"Evidence from electron microscope studies of aphid and cockroach nerves, and from the bioassay of extracts of the aortal nerves of cockroaches indicates that some neurohormones are distributed from the corpora cardiaca along nerve axons to their target organs."
https://openalex.org/W2084385633,"Transpiration from a wellwatered sudangrass stand in a highly evaporative environment (Tempe, Arizona, in July) can be considerably increased by exposing a small plot of about I square meter to radiative and convective heat input. Thus, the transpiration of sudangrass in a full stand appears not to be determined by any physiological factor during any time of the day."
https://openalex.org/W2064517333,"Two strains (Bergerac and Bristol) of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, with different temperature tolerances, were reared axenically at 23 degrees to 25 degrees C. The Bergerac strain is heat sensitive (that is, it is sterile at maturity), whereas the Bristol strain is heat resistant (that is, it matures and reproduces normally). Hybrid hermaphrodites (F(1)), produced by crossing Bristol males and Bergerac hermaphrodites, are heat tolerant. Heat sensitivity segregates as a simple Mendelian recessive in the F(2) and F(3) generations."

https://openalex.org/W2032758625,Removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide enhanced penetration of seedling wheat by stem rust Puccinia graminis in light and dark but did not materially affect penetration by leaf rust P. recondita. A concentration of 5 percent CO(2) nearly suppressed penetration by P. graminis but not by P. recondita. Thus light may promote penetration by P. graminis through photosynthetic reduction of CO(2) within the leaf and P. recondita may penetrate independently of light because it is relatively insensitive to the effects of CO(2).

https://openalex.org/W2090817500,"Two whales were observed closely for an hour off Sarasota, Florida, by residents who provided observations of structural details which identify only the right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, a temperate and subpolar species previously known to range to the Florida east coast, but not to enter the Gulf of Mexico."

https://openalex.org/W2094736945,It is suggested that the originally European species Littorina littorea was introduced to North Ameriea by Norse settlers about A.D. 1000. Its subfossil distribution might be used in tracing the extent of Norse travel in this region. Recent archeological finds match very well with the historical records of the Norse exploration and settlements. This activity seems to have been concentrated in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.

https://openalex.org/W1989023026,"The combined effect of 5-bromodeoxyuridine and gamma rays on chromosomes in cells from the root tips of Zebrina pendula is synergistic. The enhanced, combined effects per cell of aberrations, bridges, and acentric fragments were, respectively, 2, 2.4, and 1.9 times the sum of the separate effects."
