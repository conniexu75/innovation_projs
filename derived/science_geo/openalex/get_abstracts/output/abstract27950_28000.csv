https://openalex.org/W2045180058,"We previously identified two tyrosine protein kinase genes, designated trk and trkB, that code for putative neurogenic cell surface receptors. In this study, we report that the mouse trkB locus codes for at least two classes of receptor-like molecules. These trkB proteins, designated gp145trkB and gp95trkB, have identical extracellular and transmembrane domains, suggesting that they might recognize the same ligand(s). However, only gp145trkB contains a long cytoplasmic region, which includes a catalytic tyrosine protein kinase domain. trkB transcripts coding for this protein were observed in the cerebral cortex and the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. In contrast, transcripts coding for the noncatalytic gp95trkB molecule were found in the ependymal linings of the cerebral ventricles and in the choroid plexus. These results illustrate that a tyrosine protein kinase locus can code for two structurally and functionally distinct cellular receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1998236920,"The endogenous steroid metabolites 3 alpha,21dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one potentiate GABA-activated Cl- currents recorded from a human cell line transfected with the beta 1, alpha 1 beta 1, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 combinations of human GABAA receptor subunits. These steroids are active at nanomolar concentrations in potentiating GABA-activated Cl- currents and directly elicit bicuculline-sensitive Cl- currents when applied at micromolar concentrations. The potentiating and direct actions of both steroids were expressed with every combination of subunits tested. However, an examination of single-channel currents recorded from outside-out patches excised from these transfected cells suggests that despite the common minimal structural requirements for expressing steroid and barbiturate actions, the mechanism of GABAA receptor modulation by these pregnane steroids may differ from that of barbiturates."
https://openalex.org/W1980561309,"To study the role of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) in normal mammary development and mammary neoplasia in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice in which a human TGF alpha cDNA is expressed under the control of the MMTV enhancer/promoter. Overexpression of TGF alpha in the mammary epithelium, as confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, is associated with hyperplasia of alveoli and terminal ducts in virgin female and pregnant transgenic mice. A range of morphologic abnormalities including lobular hyperplasia, cystic hyperplasia, adenoma, and adenocarcinoma is seen in mammary tissue of transgenic females. In contrast, no morphologic abnormalities are seen in transgenic males in spite of TGF alpha overexpression in salivary glands and reproductive organs. TGF alpha can therefore act as an oncogene in vivo and appears to predispose mammary epithelium to neoplasia and carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1505862344,"Calponin isolated from chicken gizzard smooth muscle inhibits the actin-activated MgATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin in a reconstituted system composed of contractile and regulatory proteins. ATPase inhibition is not due to inhibition of myosin phosphorylation since, at calponin concentrations sufficient to cause maximal ATPase inhibition, myosin phosphorylation was unaffected. Furthermore, calponin inhibited the actin-activated MgATPase of fully phosphorylated or thiophosphorylated myosin. Although calponin is a Ca2(+)-binding protein, inhibition did not require Ca2+. Furthermore, although calponin also binds to tropomyosin, ATPase inhibition was not dependent on the presence of tropomyosin. Calponin was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, but not by cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinases, or myosin light chain kinase. Phosphorylation of calponin by either kinase resulted in loss of its ability to inhibit the actomyosin ATPase. The phosphorylated protein retained calmodulin and tropomyosin binding capabilities, but actin binding was greatly reduced. The calponin-actin interaction, therefore, appears to be responsible for inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase. These observations suggest that calponin may be involved in regulating actin-myosin interaction and, therefore, the contractile state of smooth muscle. Calponin function in turn is regulated by Ca2(+)-dependent phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2001609760,"During cell division complete DNA replication must occur before mitosis is initiated. Using a cell-free extract derived from Xenopus eggs that oscillates between S phase and mitosis, we have investigated how completion of DNA synthesis is coupled to the initiation of mitosis. We find that Xenopus eggs contain a feedback pathway which suppresses mitosis until replication is completed and that activation of this inhibitory system is dependent on the presence of a threshold concentration of unreplicated DNA. We demonstrate that in the presence of unreplicated DNA the active feedback system inhibits initiation of mitosis by blocking the activation of MPF, a regulator of mitosis found in all eukaryotic cells. Our results demonstrate that the feedback system does not inhibit MPF activation by blocking the synthesis or accumulation of cyclin protein, a subunit of MPF, or by blocking association of cyclin with the cdc2 subunit of MPF. We propose that the feedback system blocks mitosis by maintaining MPF in an inactive state by modulating posttranslational modifications critical for MPF activation."
https://openalex.org/W2136614450,"The dauer larva is a developmentally arrested, non-feeding dispersal stage normally formed in response to overcrowding and limited food. The daf-1 gene specifies an intermediate step in a hierarchy of genes thought to specify a pathway for neural transduction of environmental cues. Mutations in daf-1 result in constitutive formation of dauer larvae even in abundant food. This gene has been cloned by Tc1-transposon tagging, and it appears to encode a new class of serine/threonine kinase. A daf-1 probe detects a 2.5 kb mRNA of low abundance, and the DNA sequence indicates that the gene encodes a 669 amino acid protein, with a putative transmembrane domain and a C-terminal protein kinase domain most closely related to the cytosolic, raf proto-oncogene family. Hence, the daf-1 product appears to be a cell-surface receptor required for transduction of environmental signals into an appropriate developmental response."
https://openalex.org/W1976027096,"We describe a novel DNA and RNA found in the mitochondria of the Varkud-1c natural isolate of Neurospora. The majority of the RNA, termed VSRNA, is an 881 nucleotide single-stranded circular molecule complementary to one strand of a low copy, double-stranded circular DNA, VSDNA. VSRNA combines some features of the human hepatitis delta virus, group I introns, retroelements, and plant viral satellite RNAs. VSRNA synthesized in vitro performs a self-cleavage reaction whose products terminate with a 5' hydroxyl and a 2',3' cyclic phosphate. This reaction may be involved in the natural processing pathway of multimeric VSRNA in vivo. VSRNA lacks a hammer-head structure or substantial sequence similarity to any other self-cleaving RNA, suggesting that the RNA structure involved in cleavage may be different from those in previously characterized catalytic RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1562245105,"A series of synthetic peptides representing authentic proteolytic cleavage sites of human rhinovirus type 14 were assayed as substrates for purified 3C protease. Competition cleavage assays were employed to determine the relative specificity constants (Kcat/Km) for substrates with sequences related to the viral 2C-3A cleavage site. Variable length peptides representing the 2C-3A cleavage site were cleaved with comparable efficiency. These studies defined a minimum substrate of 6 amino acids (TLFQ/GP), although retention of the residue at position P5 (ETLFQ/GP) resulted in a better substrate by an order of magnitude. Amino acid substitutions at position P5, P4, P1', or P2' indicated that the identity of the residue at position P5 was not critical, whereas substitutions at position P4, P1' or P2' resulted in substrates with Kcat/Km values varying over 2 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the 2C-3A cleavage site, small peptide derivatives representative of the 3A-3B cleavage site were relatively poor substrates, which suggested that residues flanking the minimum core sequence may influence susceptibility to cleavage. The 3C protease of rhinovirus type 14 was also capable of cleaving peptides representing comparable cleavage sites predicted for coxsackie B virus and poliovirus."
https://openalex.org/W1489766749,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB), a protein containing several hydrophobic beta-sheet structures, is essential for the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Previously, we found that only a fraction of de novo synthesized apoB is secreted; the remainder is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum where it is degraded. To understand the basis for these observations, translocation, the first step in the secretory pathway, was examined. Translocation of apoB was determined by its sensitivity to degradation by the exogenous protease, trypsin. In rough microsomes, about half of the apoB was degraded by trypsin. In contrast, in Golgi fractions little (if any) apoB was accessible to trypsin. Essentially all of the apoB that was degraded was membrane bound. Monoclonal IgGs against either the N-terminal or C-terminal halves of apoB were bound to magnetic beads and used to immunoisolate microsomes. In contrast to the specific ability of the IgGs against apoB to isolate microsomes, little or no microsomes were isolated using nonimmune IgG and IgG against albumin. Since microsomes remained intact and oriented right-side out as demonstrated by the inability of trypsin both to degrade albumin and to affect the capacity of the intralumenal enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase to dephosphorylate mannose 6-phosphate, the data suggest that a pool of apoB is exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To determine if the trypsin-accessible pool of apoB is a transient form, pulse-chase experiments were performed. The results show that the percent of apoB that was trypsin accessible increased during the first 20 min of the chase, suggesting that during this time the trypsin-accessible pool of apoB is not translocated (it does not become trypsin insensitive). Thus, in two in vivo models (cultured cells and rat liver) translocation of apoB is not quantitative. We propose that apoB translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum determines its entry into two functionally distinct pools. The intralumenal trypsin-insensitive pool participates in the assembly of very low density lipoprotein; the trypsin-accessible nontranslocated cytoplasmic pool is shunted into a degradative pathway. Regulated translocation of apoB may provide a unique mechanism with which to determine the rate of very low density lipoprotein assembly/secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1508531955,"Oxidation of apogalactose oxidase with ferricyanide leads to the formation of a stable free radical exhibiting distinctive optical absorption and EPR spectral features. The radical is associated with absorption in both near-UV and near-IR spectral regions, and its EPR spectrum is characteristic of an aromatic free radical with gav = 2.005. Reconstitution of both the apoenzyme and the free radical-containing form with copper substantially restores both the absorption spectra and the catalytic activity of the active enzyme, indicating that the preparation of the radical species does not significantly damage the protein. The absence of a free radical EPR signal in reconstituted and activated galactose oxidase containing nearly stoichiometric copper suggests the radical is an active site species relating to the free radical-coupled copper site previously proposed for this enzyme. Isotopic labeling experiments demonstrate that the radical derives from a tyrosine residue. The distinctive spectra associated with this radical indicate an environment which is different from that associated with the tyrosyl phenoxyl sites in other free radical enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1983271049,"In eukaryotic cells alternative splicing of messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNA′s) is a means of regulating gene expression. Although a number of the components that participate in regulating some alternative splicing events have been identified by molecular genetic procedures, the elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms governing alternative splicing requires in vitro reaction systems. The tissue specificity of P element transposition in Drosophila depends on the germline restriction of pre-mRNA splicing of the P element third intron (IVS3). Drosophila P element IVS3 pre-mRNA substrates were spliced accurately in vitro in heterologous human cell extracts but not in Drosophila somatic cell splicing extracts. Components in Drosophila somatic cell extracts that specifically inhibited IVS3 splicing in vitro were detected by a complementation assay. Biochemical assays for Drosophila RNA binding proteins were then used to detect a 97-kilodalton protein that interacts specifically with 5′ exon sequences previously implicated in the control of IVS3 splicing in vivo. Inhibition of IVS3 splicing in vitro could be correlated with binding of the 97-kD protein to 5′ exon sequences, suggesting that one aspect of IVS3 tissue-specific splicing involves somatic repression by specific RNA-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1554348499,"Oxyuranus scutellatus toxin 1 (OS1) and toxin 2 (OS2) are two monochain phospholipases A2 isolated from the venom of Taipan. Their iodinated derivatives have been used to characterize phospholipase A2 receptors on rabbit skeletal muscle cells in culture. Both ligands recognize one family of binding sites on myotube membranes with a Bmax of 1.9 to 2.2 pmol/mg of protein and dissociation constant values of 7.4 pM for 125I-OS2 and 38 pM for 125I-OS1. Other snake venom phospholipases A2 are able to inhibit 125I-OS2 binding to the muscle receptor. Competition experiments with these unlabeled phospholipases A2 define a pharmacological profile of the muscle receptor very different from the previously described pharmacological profile of the neuronal phospholipase A2 receptors. The number of 125I-OS2 receptors in skeletal muscle cells increases during in vitro cell maturation but there is no clear relation between the increase of Bmax and the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. The phospholipase A2 binding protein from myotubes has been identified both by cross-linking experiments and by purification studies. It is composed of only one subunit of Mr 180,000."
https://openalex.org/W1595184397,"The influence of mammalian DNA topoisomerase I phosphorylation on enzyme activity has been investigated. Dephosphorylation by calf intestine alkaline phosphatase abolished the DNA relaxing activity of DNA topoisomerase I and the sensitivity of the enzyme to its specific inhibitor, camptothecin. DNA topoisomerase I could be reactivated by incubation with purified protein kinase C. DNA topoisomerase I was then able to relax supercoiled DNA processively, like the native enzyme, and to cleave 32P-end-labeled SV40 DNA fragments at the same sequences as the native enzyme in the presence of camptothecin. These results show that active DNA topoisomerase I is a phosphoprotein and suggest a possible regulatory role of protein kinase on topoisomerase I activity and on its sensitivity to camptothecin."
https://openalex.org/W2163865184,"Fabry disease, an inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, alpha-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22). Six alpha-galactosidase A gene rearrangements that cause Fabry disease were investigated to assess the role of Alu repetitive elements and short direct and/or inverted repeats in the generation of these germinal mutations. The breakpoints of five partial gene deletions and one partial gene duplication were determined by either cloning and sequencing the mutant gene from an affected hemizygote, or by polymerase chain reaction amplifying and sequencing the genomic region containing the novel junction. Although the alpha-galactosidase A gene contains 12 Alu repetitive elements (representing approximately 30% of the 12-kilobase (kb) gene or approximately 1 Alu/1.0 kb), only one deletion resulted from an Alu-Alu recombination. The remaining five rearrangements involved illegitimate recombinational events between short direct repeats of 2 to 6 base pairs (bp) at the deletion or duplication breakpoints. Of these rearrangements, one had a 3' short direct repeat within an Alu element, while another was unusual having two deletions of 1.7 kb and 14 bp separated by a 151-bp inverted sequence. These findings suggested that slipped mispairing or intrachromosomal exchanges involving short direct repeats were responsible for the generation of most of these gene rearrangements. There were no inverted repeat sequences or alternating purine-pyrimidine regions which may have predisposed the gene to these rearrangements. Intriguingly, the tetranucleotide CCAG and the trinucleotide CAG (or their respective complements, CTGG and CTG) occurred within or adjacent to the direct repeats at the 5' breakpoints in three and four of the five alpha-galactosidase A gene rearrangements, respectively, suggesting a possible functional role in these illegitimate recombinational events. These studies indicate that short direct repeats are important in the formation of gene rearrangements, even in human genes like alpha-galactosidase A that are rich in Alu repetitive elements."
https://openalex.org/W2166803405,"Partially edited mRNAs were selected by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. In the case of cytochrome b, 102 out of 106 clones displayed patterns of editing that were consistent with a strictly progressive 3' to 5' editing process, as predicted by the guide RNA model of RNA editing. In the case of cytochrome oxidase subunit III (COIII), 177 out of 304 clones displayed strictly progressive 3' to 5' patterns of editing. However, the remaining 127 COIII clones displayed unexpected patterns in which upstream editing preceded downstream editing, uridines were inserted at sites not normally edited, and purine residues were deleted. We suggest that many of these RNAs are produced by normal 3' to 5' editing of the COIII mRNA with incorrect guide RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2008669463,"Herpesviral infection of endothelial cells (ECs) induces arterial injury. We now demonstrate that such infection promoted enhanced monocyte-endothelial adhesion. Enhanced adhesion was blocked by monoclonal antibodies to the viral-encoded cell surface glycoprotein gC but not by antibodies to gD or gE. Adhesion was also blocked by treating ECs with specific thrombin inhibitors or by growing cells in prothrombin-depleted serum. We found that gC bound and promoted activation of factor X on infected ECs, thereby contributing to thrombin generation. Factor X also bound to transfected L cells that were induced to express gC. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated factor X-gC complex formation on the surface of these cells. We suggest that gC-dependent thrombin generation by herpes-infected endothelium may be an important mediator of vascular pathology during viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1571933804,"The binding of a synthetic four-way junction in DNA by T4 endonuclease VII has been studied using gel retardation and footprint analysis. Two specific protein-DNA complexes have been observed, but only one is stable in the presence of moderate concentrations of salt. The footprint of T4 endonuclease VII in the salt-resistant complex has been probed using hydroxyl radicals generated by the reaction of iron(II)/EDTA with hydrogen peroxide. The hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern indicates protection of approximately 5 residues in two strands that are diametrically opposed across the junction point."
https://openalex.org/W1555031898,"To study the mechanism and role of ligand-dependent endocytosis, we have engineered a mutant insulin receptor that retains its insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activities but does not exhibit ligand-induced internalization. The mutant has a deletion of the 16th exon which encodes 22 amino acids (residues 944-965) on the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane region of the receptor beta-subunit. When the cDNA is transfected in Rat 1 cells, the mutant receptor (HIR delta ex16) is processed to a glycosylated alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetramer and expressed at the cell surface. HIR delta ex16 receptors bind insulin with lower affinity than normal receptors (ED50 for insulin competition = 1.1 nM compared with 0.2 nM for normal receptors), but binding is normal in detergent solution. The mutant HIR delta ex16 receptor undergoes insulin-dependent autophosphorylation and activation as a tyrosine kinase toward exogenous substrates in vitro. In vivo, the receptor is also enzymatically active, as assessed 1) by the ability of antiphosphotyrosine antibodies to precipitate equivalent proportions (58-60%) of occupied wild type or mutant receptors and 2) by immunoblotting extracts of insulin-stimulated cells using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. In the latter experiment, cells expressing HIR delta ex16 receptors exhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta-subunits as well as of pp 185, a putative substrate of the receptor. Despite the ability to bind insulin and activate as a tyrosine kinase, HIR delta ex16 receptors do not internalize in Rat 1 cells. Whereas normal surface receptors covalently labeled with the photoaffinity reagent 125I-NAPA-DP insulin are 36% intracellular after 1 h at 37 degrees C, only background levels of internalization are seen when HIR delta ex16 receptors are labeled. The HIR delta ex16 receptors mediate no internalization or degradation of 125I-insulin compared with control untransfected Rat 1 cells, and they do not down-regulate after long exposure to saturating concentrations of insulin. We conclude that the 16th exon encodes a domain necessary for ligand-dependent endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1656100325,"The dioxin-responsive enhancer upstream of the CYP1A1 gene contains four copies of the recognition motif for the liganded Ah receptor. The results of deletion analyses, linker-scanning analyses, and the analysis of individual enhancer subdomains reveal that each copy of the motif contributes to the response of the enhancer to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. In the context of the dioxin-responsive enhancer, a GC box, representing the DNA binding site for Sp1 (or a related transcription factor), has no detectable intrinsic activity but enhances gene expression when linked to a recognition motif for the liganded Ah receptor, thereby producing a synergistic effect on enhancer function."
https://openalex.org/W1504516692,"The nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor is a glycosylated transmembrane protein present on the cell surface as both high and low affinity forms, but biological responsiveness requires interactions of NGF with the high affinity site. We have tested the effects of mutations in the intracellular domain of the receptor upon its cell surface expression and equilibrium binding of 125I-NGF. Although mutant receptors lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain are processed and expressed at the cell surface and are capable of binding to NGF, the absence of cytoplasmic sequences leads to a loss of high affinity binding and to a lack of an appropriate cross-linking pattern as assessed by N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 4-azidobenzoate photoaffinity cross-linking. These results, taken together with the highly conserved nature of these cytoplasmic sequences, implies that the interaction of the receptor with an accessory molecule is necessary to form the high affinity receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1480005565,"The alterations by peroxisome proliferators of metabolism of linoleic acid in rat liver were studied. Administration of P-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (clofibric acid) enhanced in vivo conversion of linoleic acid to its desaturated and/or elongated metabolites, 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid, 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, and arachidonic acid, whereas the formation of 11,14-eicosadienoic acid was decreased. These changes observed in vivo were confirmed in vitro to be due to the increases in activities of delta 6 desaturation of linoleic acid to 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid (18.4 times), delta 8 desaturation of 11,14-eicosadienoic acid to 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (3.4 times), and delta 5 desaturation of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid (4.1 times). No considerable changes in activities of chain elongation of either linoleic acid or 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid were observed. The increases in the activities of three desaturations by clofibric acid were prevented by the treatment of rats with cycloheximide. The inductions of delta 6 and delta 5 desaturations were brought about by the treatment of rats with 2,2'-(decamethylenedithio)diethanol or di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate, peroxisome proliferators structurally unrelated to clofibric acid, as well. These changes in metabolism of linoleic acid by clofibric acid were consistent with the changes in mass proportion of omega 6 fatty acids in hepatic lipid. Physiological significance of the marked changes in linoleic acid metabolism by peroxisome proliferators was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1695605475,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is believed to mediate the regulation of calcium metabolism by a steroid hormone receptor mechanism. We now demonstrate that phosphorylation of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor occurs rapidly in embryonic chick duodenal organ culture in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Phosphorylation of the receptor is strongly induced within 1 h by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and occurs prior to the initiation of calcium uptake or induction of calcium-binding protein in this system. Phosphorylation is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. Since chick duodenal organ culture is a vitamin D-responsive system that closely parallels in vivo rachitic chicken intestine, the occurrence of receptor phosphorylation in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 strongly suggests that it is a physiologically relevant event. In addition, since it occurs prior to the other responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, it appears possible that phosphorylation may play a significant role in the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 regulation of transcription in the intestine."

https://openalex.org/W2109481978,"The murine lymphoid cell line 70Z/3 has been extensively used to study the intracellular mechanisms of interleukin-1 (IL-1) action. In these cells IL-1 is known to induce kappa gene expression but the signal transduction pathway has yet to be defined. IL-1-induced kappa expression is associated with stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange and activation of protein kinase C, but these events are not sufficient to trigger kappa expression. Thus, other signals must be present. Because cAMP is a well recognized second messenger, we sought to determine whether cAMP is the signal that triggers IL-1-induced kappa expression. To that end we first measured intracellular levels of cAMP following IL-1 treatment. The results showed that exposure of 70Z/3 cells to IL-1 alpha induced a rapid and a transient increase in cAMP, it peaked at 5 min and was back to base-line level at 20 min. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) also increased cAMP with similar kinetics to IL-1 alpha but the increased levels were far greater. IL-1 alpha-induced increase in cAMP proved not be a sufficient signal because an increase in intracellular cAMP by N6,O2'-dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) or PGE2 failed to increase surface IgM or to increase kappa mRNA level. Although when used alone they had no effect, Bt2cAMP and PGE2 were found to amplify the IL-1 alpha-induced kappa expression. IL-1 alpha transiently activated NF-kappa B transcription factor. But this effect could not be simulated by Bt2cAMP or PGE2. This observation provides further evidence that cAMP is not a trigger of kappa expression. Although Bt2cAMP or PGE2 when used alone had no effect, they did consistently modify the level of NF-kappa B activity induced by IL-1 alpha. Results of this study show that cAMP is not sufficient to induce NF-kappa B or kappa expression. Therefore, the role of cAMP may not be trigger but rather to modulate the IL-1 alpha-induced kappa expression. Regulation of the response could occur at one or a number of points along the signal pathway. Such a regulatory role is supported by the observation that cAMP modulates the IL-1 alpha-induced NF-kappa B activity."
https://openalex.org/W1500666613,"Relaxin is a member of the insulin family of polypeptide hormones and is known to exert its biological effects on various parts of the mammalian reproductive system. Biologically active human relaxin has been chemically synthesized based on the nucleotide sequence obtained from an ovarian cDNA clone. In the present study synthetic human relaxin was radiolabled by phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP to a specific activity of 5000 Ci/mmol. The phosphorylated relaxin was purified on cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography and was shown to co-migrate with relaxin on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry revealed a single phosphorylated site on the B chain of relaxin. The 32P-relaxin was able to bind to a goat anti-relaxin antibody, and this binding could be displaced by unlabeled relaxin in a concentration-dependent manner. A comparison of the concentration responses of cellular cAMP production stimulated by relaxin and phosphorylated relaxin in a primary human uterine cell line showed that phosphorylation did not affect the in vitro biological efficacy of relaxin. This made it suitable for in situ autoradiographic localization of relaxin binding sites in rat uterine, cervical, and brain tissue sections. Displacement of the binding of 100 pM 32P-relaxin by 100, 10, and 3 nM unlabeled relaxin, but not by 100 nM insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and an insulin-like growth factor-I analog, demonstrated the high affinity and specificity of such binding. We conclude that 32P-labeled human relaxin is biologically and immunologically active and that this novel probe binds reversibly and with high affinity to classical (e.g. uterus) and unpredicted (e.g. brain) tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1562624919,"We have previously determined that beta-adrenergic and somatostatin receptors stimulate and inhibit, respectively, Na-H exchange independent of changes in cAMP accumulation (Barber, D.L., McGuire, M.E., and Ganz, M.B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21038-21042). The present study extends our work on the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) by investigating receptor activation of Na-H exchange in multiple cell types that either endogenously express the beta AR or that have been transfected with cDNA of the hamster lung beta 2AR or the turkey erythrocyte beta AR. Exchanger activity was determined by monitoring intracellular pH in cell populations loaded with the pH-sensitive dye BCECF (2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein). In addition to the action of the beta AR, activation of prostaglandin E1 and parathyroid hormone receptors induced an intracellular alkalinization by stimulating a Na(+)-dependent amiloride-sensitive Na-H exchange. In contrast, activation of D2-dopaminergic receptors induced an intracellular acidification by inhibiting Na-H exchange. beta-Adrenergic, prostaglandin E1, and parathyroid hormone receptors activated Na-H exchange independent of changes in intracellular cAMP accumulation and independent of a cholera toxin-sensitive stimulatory GTP regulatory protein. D2-dopaminergic receptors inhibited exchanger activity independent of a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory GTP regulatory protein. We suggest that these receptors are functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase and Na-H exchange through divergent signaling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1525947551,"To delineate cis-acting regulatory elements of the human elastin gene, several elastin promoter region/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs were developed. The spectrum of inserts, spanning from -2260 to +2, was shown to contain several SP-1 and AP2 binding sites, as well as putative glucocorticoid, cAMP, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive elements. Assay of promoter activity in transient transfections of rat aortic smooth muscle cells, human skin fibroblasts, HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, HeLa cells, or mouse NIH-3T3 cells allowed delineation of several functional subregions within 2.26 kilobases of the 5'-flanking DNA. The results suggest that the basic promoter element resides within the region -128 to -1, and the 5'-flanking DNA contains several functional regulatory subregions. Also, the regulatory function of three putative SP-1 binding sites was demonstrated by transfections with a plasmid devoid of such sequences. These findings attest to the complexity of transcriptional regulation of the elastin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1598878216,"A new, rapid method for purification of inositol(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase in high yield from rat brain is described. Purified enzyme exhibited a polypeptide of Mr = 53,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and a specific activity of 29 mumol/min/mg at 37 degrees C in the absence of calmodulin. Inclusion of calpain inhibitors was critical for obtaining the 53-kDa protein as the major product and 0.1% of the zwitterionic detergent, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-2-propanesulfonate, was necessary to stabilize enzyme activity. In the absence of calpain inhibitors, the 53-kDa protein degraded progressively during purification and yielded a mixture containing polypeptides of various sizes. Relative intensity of these degradation products on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel varied from one preparation to another. However, broad band(s) at the 42-45 kDa region and a band at 35 kDa were always weak, while bands of 53, 51, 40 (sometimes doublets), 33, and 32 KDa were usually strong. The fact that all of these polypeptides including the weak bands of 42-45 and 35 kDa were derived from the 53 kDa form was confirmed by their immunocross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies to the 53 kDa form. When the 51, 40, and a mixture of the 33 and 32 kDa forms were obtained separately and nearly free from other forms, each of them exhibited catalytic activity. Nevertheless, calmodulin binds to polypeptides larger than 35,000 but not to the 33 and 32 kDa forms. Incubation of the purified 53 kDa form with calpain generated a fragmentation pattern nearly identical to that generated during purification in the absence of calpain inhibitors. Incubation with five other endoproteases produced proteolytic fragments slightly different from those by calpain. However, the general fragmentation patterns generated by the proteases were similar, suggesting that inositol(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase contains several motifs susceptible to a variety of proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1561331691,"[3H]Phorbol dibutyrate [( 3H]PDB) rapidly and reversibly binds to human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Ca2+/diacylglycerol/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C appeared to be the receptor for this binding because: a diacylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol, competed with [3H]PDB for PMN binding sites; a blocker of protein kinase C-phospholipid interactions, sphinganine, inhibited PMN binding of [3H]PDB; and changes in cytosolic Ca2+ apparently regulated PMN binding of the label. Relevant to the last point, disrupted PMN contained 9 X 10(5) phorbol diester receptors/cell, whereas intact PMN had only 1.6 X 10(5) such receptors that were accessed by the ligand. This number fell to 1.0 X 10(5) in Ca2(+)-depleted PMN and rose to 2.5 X 10(5) in cells stimulated with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. This ionomycin effect lasted for greater than 16 min, correlated temporally with changes in cytosolic Ca2+, did not occur in Ca2(+)-depleted PMN, and was blocked by sphinganine. A second ionophore, A23187, likewise induced Ca2(+)-dependent rises in [3H]PDB binding. These results fit the standard model, wherein rises in cytosolic Ca2+ cause protein kinase C to translocate from cytosol to plasmalemma and thereby become more available to [3H]PDB. In contrast, two humoral agonists, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and leukotriene (LT)B4, had actions that did not fit this model. They stimulated PMN to increase the availability of PDB binding sites by a sphinganine-sensitive mechanism, but their actions differed from those of ionophores. They induced biphasic (t = 15 and 60 s) increases in [3H]PDB binding while eliciting monophasic (t = 15 s), short-lived (t less than 1 min) rises in cytosolic Ca2+. In Ca2(+)-depleted PMN, moreover, fMLP and LTB4 stimulated slow (t greater than or equal to 30 s), monophasic, prominent rises in [3H]PDB binding and binding site number without appreciably altering cytosolic Ca2+. We suggest, therefore, that fMLP and LTB4 translocate protein kinase C using two sequential mechanisms. The first involves Ca2+ transients and thus produces abrupt (t = 15 s), rapidly reversing responses. The second mechanism uses an unrelated signal to effect a more slowly evolving (t = 60 s) movement of protein kinase C to plasmalemma. Hence, the standard model does not explain all instances of protein kinase C translocation, and a cytosolic Ca2(+)-independent signal contributes to the regulation of protein kinase C as well as those responses elicited by the effector enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1550134510,"The aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor, also called the xenobiotic or TCDD receptor, mediates transcriptional activation of the cytochrome P-450c (CYP1A1) gene by interacting with Ah or xenobiotic response elements. This paper presents evidence that a metal ion, probably Zn2+, is an essential cofactor for the Ah receptor. This paper also maps in detail the interactions between the Ah response element XRE1 and the Ah receptor from the rat hepatocyte-derived cell line LCS7. Interactions were mapped by three methods, 1) methylation interference footprinting, 2) mobility shift competition experiments, using a series of synthetic oligonucleotides with systematic alterations in the Ah response element core sequence, and 3) orthophenanthroline/Cu+ footprinting. These findings suggest the following consensus sequence for DNA recognition by the Ah receptor: CNA/TNA/TCACGCA/TA/T. The chelators 1,10-phenanthroline and oxalic acid inhibited the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of the AH receptor in a concentration dependent manner, suggesting that the DNA-binding activity of the receptor requires divalent metal ions. Inhibition was due to metal-chelation, since: 1) inhibition was almost completely prevented by the presence of Zn2+, or other divalent metal ions having high affinity for the chelators used, while metal ions with low affinity did not protect; 2) the DNA-binding activity of the receptor could be restored by dialysis to remove 1,10-phenanthroline, but only in the presence of Zn2+, while dialysis in the absence of metal ions reversed inhibition by the nonchelating isomer 4,7-phenanthroline. The involvement of a divalent cation in receptor function, possibly bound via sulfhydryls, was also suggested by the finding that Cd2+ and Co2+ inhibited DNA-binding activity. Once bound to the XRE1 DNA sequence, the receptor could not be inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting that the essential metal ion must become inaccessible to chelation when the receptor binds DNA. The Zn2+ requirement of the Ah receptor is similar to that of the estrogen and the glucocorticoid receptors and is consistent with the hypothesis that the Ah receptor is a member of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1483826827,"ARPP-16 (cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr = 16,000) is a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is enriched in the basal ganglia. ARPP-16 has been purified to homogeneity from the soluble fraction of bovine caudate nuclei. An additional substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase of Mr = 19,000 (ARPP-19) was found to cross-react with rabbit anti-serum prepared against purified ARPP-16. Immunological analysis indicated that ARPP-16 was enriched in the basal ganglia while ARPP-19 was present in similar levels in all brain regions studied and was also present in non-neuronal tissues. ARPP-19 was also purified to homogeneity from bovine caudate nucleus cytosol. Using oligonucleotide probes based on the partial amino acid sequence of purified ARPP-16, cDNA clones for ARPP-16 and ARPP-19 were isolated from a bovine caudate nucleus cDNA library and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two proteins were identical except that ARPP-19 had an additional 16 amino acids at the NH2-terminal. The two cDNA clones share an identical 3'-untranslated region of 756 nucleotides. The cDNA clone for ARPP-16 contained 806 additional nucleotides located 3' to this common sequence. The 5'-untranslated regions of the two clones were entirely different. The results suggest the possibility that ARPP-16 and ARPP-19 are produced by alternative transcription and splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1487089548,"To evaluate the role of domain I of calmodulin (CaM) in the activation of target enzymes, a series of CaM mutants was constructed in which domain I (49 amino acids) was substantially deleted, or was exchanged with the homologous region (58 amino acids) of cardiac troponin C (cTnC). The proteins are 1) aM, a mutant CaM in which domain I has been deleted; 2) TaM, first domain of cTnC, last three domains of CaM; 3) TaM-BMI, same as TaM, except the nonfunctional first Ca2(+)-binding domain has been restored by mutagenesis; 4) CaT, first domain of CaM, last three domains of cTnC. These proteins were evaluated for Ca2+ binding properties and as activators of three CaM target enzymes, CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE), smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and CaM-dependent multifunctional protein kinase (CaM kinase II). The chimeric proteins containing four domains bound Ca2+ in the manner expected from the number and nature of EF hands. In contrast, aM bound only two Ca2+, suggesting that deletion of domain I may have disrupted binding in one of the remaining three domains, and did not activate the three enzymes. The kinetics of activation of PDE by CaM, TaM, and TaM-BMI were identical. Although cTnC and CaT could maximally activate PDE, the Kact for these mutants were greater than 2000 times than for CaM. All mutated proteins except CaT were poor activators of CaM kinase II and this protein activated the kinase to 65% that of CaM, with a nearly identical Kact. CaT and TaM, were poor agonists of MLCK. Activation of Ca2(+)-binding site I in TaM (TaM-BMI), completely prevented activation of MLCK. In addition, TaM-BMI was a potent competitive inhibitor of MLCK activation by CaM (Ki = 66 nM). We conclude 1) a domain I is necessary to activate these target enzymes, and the substitution of the corresponding region of cTnC into CaM leads to differential effects; 2) an active first Ca2(+)-binding site is not essential for activation of PDE and the primary sequence of the first domain of CaM need not be highly conserved; 3) for CaM kinase II, determinants in the first domain are critical whereas more flexibility exists for the remaining three domains; 4) since TaM-BMI acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of MLCK binding of CaM to a target enzyme and activation can be dissociable events."
https://openalex.org/W1606360242,"We have identified two distinct classes of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-binding proteins by affinity labeling rat glomeruli with 125I-TGF-beta 1 and 125I-TGF-beta 2. The first type consists of a group of proteins that bind TGF-beta 1 but do not bind TGF-beta 2. When 125I-TGF-beta 1 affinity-labeled glomeruli were separated under nonreducing conditions, four prominent bands with Mr values of 320,000, 260,000, 170,000, and 90,000 were observed. Following reduction, the 320,000 and 170,000 bands yielded only a 100,000 band, the 260,000 complex yielded bands of 200,000, 100,000, and 85,000, and the 90,000 band migrated with an Mr of 85,000. Binding of 125I-TGF-beta 1 to these proteins was unaffected by the addition of as much as a 1,000-fold excess of TGF-beta 2. The second type of glomerular TGF-beta-binding protein consists of Mr 160,000-200,000 and 280,000 proteins that bind both TGF-beta 1 and beta 2. Digestion of these affinity-labeled proteins with heparitinase and chondroitinase resulted in a decrease of approximately 40,000 in their apparent molecular weights. Glomerular TGF-beta 1-binding proteins are distinct from previously described TGF-beta-binding proteins in their specificity for TGF-beta 1 and their formation of disulfide-linked multimers. The TGF-beta 1/beta 2-binding proteins share some properties of the previously described type III TGF-beta receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1577934740,"We have examined the binding of [3H]bradykinin to bovine myometrial membranes and assessed its sensitivity to guanine nucleotides. Total binding displayed a typical B2 kinin receptor specificity. However, saturation binding isotherms were resolved into at least two components with KD values of 8 pM (45%) and 378 pM (55%). Low affinity binding exhibited relatively rapid rates of association (kobs = 1.40 x 10(-2) s-1) and dissociation (k-1 = 3.82 x 10(-3) s-1), while high affinity binding exhibited considerably slower rates (kobs = 9.52 x 10(-4) s-1 and k-1 = 4.43 x 10(-5) s-1). Pre-equilibrium dissociation kinetics revealed that formation of high affinity binding was characterized as a time-dependent accumulation of the slow dissociation rate at the expense of at least one other more rapid dissociation rate. In the presence of 10 microM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), at least two binding components were resolved with KD values of 37 pM (12%) and 444 pM (88%). Gpp(NH)p apparently specifically perturbed high affinity binding by completely preventing the accumulation of the slow dissociation phase. Instead, two more rapid dissociation rates (k-1 = 8.53 x 10(-3) s-1 and 4.43 x 10(-4) s-1) were observed. These results suggest that [3H]bradykinin interacts with at least two B2 kinin receptor-like binding sites in bovine myometrial membranes. A three-state model for the guanine nucleotide-sensitive agonist interaction with the high affinity binding sites is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1627550602,"The Escherichia coli lactose carrier is an energy-transducing H+/galactoside cotransport protein which strictly couples sugar and proton transport in 1:1 stoichiometry. Here we describe five lactose carrier mutants which catalyze uncoupled sugar-independent H+ transport. Symptoms similar to uncoupling by a proton ionophore have been observed in cells expressing these mutant carriers. The mutations occur at two separate loci, encoding substitutions either for alanine 177 (valine) or tyrosine 236 (histidine, asparagine, phenylalanine, or serine). Compared to the parent, cells expressing the valine 177 carrier grew slowly on minimal media with glucose as carbon source. When washed cells were incubated in the absence of added sugars the mutant showed a reduced protonmotive force compared with the parent. Addition of either thiodigalactoside or alpha-p-nitrophenylgalactoside reduced the defect in protonmotive force. Sugar-independent H+ entry rate into cells expressing either the normal carrier or the Val-177 mutant were measured directly using the pH electrode. Following sudden acidification of the external medium (by either oxygen-pulse or acid-pulse) protons entered more rapidly into cells expressing the Val-177 carrier. This novel sugar-independent mode of H+ transport probably depends on an acquired capacity of the Val-177 carrier to bind the transported proton with higher than normal affinity in a transition state involving the binary carrier/H+ complex."
https://openalex.org/W1595366907,"Electrogenic H(+)-ATPase was found in neurosecretory granules from bovine posterior pituitary. This enzyme was sensitive to bafilomycin, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, and was inactivated completely by cold treatment in the presence of MgATP and NaNO3. Immunoblot analysis showed the presence of immunologically identical polypeptides (72, 57, and 34 kDa) in the ATPases of the neurosecretory granules and chromaffin granules. The granules showed MgATP-dependent activity for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) uptake. This uptake was temperature-dependent and showed saturation kinetics (apparent Km for 5-hydroxytryptamine, 2 microM) and counter-flow. Reserpine and tetrabenazine at 1 microM inhibited the uptake, whereas imipramine at 2 microM had no effect. Dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine were also inhibitory. The uptake was abolished by various treatments that dissipated the electrochemical H+ gradient or inhibited the H(+)-ATPase. These results indicate that a vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase in the neurosecretory granules forms an electrochemical H+ gradient that drives 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake by a specific transport system. A similar granular fraction from the anterior pituitary had no ATP-dependent activity for 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1483105969,"To characterize the type of cell expressing natriuretic peptide receptors in the brain and the nature of these receptors, we conducted studies in primary cultured glial and neuronal cells derived from fetal rat diencephalon. The glial predominant cultures (95% of total cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein positive) expressed nearly a 10-fold greater specific binding of the natriuretic peptides to cell surface receptors compared with the neuron-predominant cultures. Scatchard analysis of binding studies with 125I-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and 125I-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) revealed a single class of receptors with dissimilar affinities (0.25 +/- 0.09 and 0.74 +/- 0.07 nM, respectively, n = 3 experiments p less than 0.01) but similar numbers of binding sites for both peptides (93 and 88 fmol/mg of protein, respectively). Cross-linking of 125I-ANP and BNP to cultured glia followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography identified distinct bands at either approximate Mr 130,000, or 102,000 and 66,000, corresponding to two high molecular weight (B) receptors and one low molecular weight (C) receptor described in other tissues. Different subtypes of astrocytes appeared to express different B receptors. Binding and cross-linking of radiolabeled ANP or BNP were competitively inhibited equally by unlabeled ANP or BNP, indicating that ANP and BNP probably bind the same receptors. The glial cultures functionally expressed a receptor(s) with guanylate cyclase activity; BNP was less potent than ANP in stimulating cGMP at lower concentrations. These results indicate that both high and low molecular weight natriuretic peptide receptors are expressed in astrocyte-predominant cultures from the fetal diencephalon and suggest that glia participate in several actions of ANP which are probably mediated through this area of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1544958552,"We have established previously that 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (alkylacetyl-G) can be converted into at least six metabolites by rabbit platelets, including alkylacetyl-sn-(glycero-3-phosphocholine) (-GPC), i.e. platelet-activating factor (PAF) and 1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn- (alkylacyl)-GPC. Since part of the biological functions of alkylacetyl-G can be explained by its metabolic conversion to PAF and also to alkylacyl-GPC as an inactive storage precursor of PAF, the present study focused on the regulation of the synthesis of PAF and alkylacyl-GPC from alkylacetyl-G. Our results document the presence of a specific dithiothreitol (DTT)-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase in saponin-permeabilized rabbit platelets and show that DTT potentiates the production of PAF from alkylacetyl-G but inhibits the formation of phosphatidylcholine from diolein. We also demonstrated that the availability of CDP-choline controls the generation of PAF from alkylacetyl-G. Furthermore, when CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is activated to produce more CDP-choline through the translocation of this enzyme from the cytosol to membranes by incubating the rabbit platelets with 0.2 mM sodium oleate, the production of PAF from alkylacetyl-G is increased 5-fold. More importantly, our experiments reveal the presence of two metabolic pathways that are responsible for the synthesis of alkylacyl-GPC from alkylacetyl-G, with each producing a unique molecular species composition of the stored PAF precursor, alkylacyl-GPC. The latter is enriched in polyunsaturates (70.7-78.5% 20:4) when formed through the remodeling pathway of PAF cycle via alkylacetyl-G (DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase)----alkylacetyl-GPC----alkyllyso-GPC---- alkylacyl-GPC . Alkylacyl-GPC containing saturated species (71.8% 16:0) is generated by the retroconversion/de novo pathway according to the reaction scheme of alkylacetyl-G----alkyl-G----alkyllyso-glycero-3-phosphate (-GP)----alkylacyl-GP----alkylacyl-G (DTT-sensitive cholinephosphotransferase)----alkylacyl-GPC. Inactivation of PAF through the remodeling/PAF cycle can generate alkylacyl-GPC at both low (1.75 x 10(-7) M) and high (10(-6) M) concentrations of PAF whereas the conversion of alkylacetyl-G to alkylacyl-GPC via PAF through the remodeling pathway only occurs at a low concentration (1.75 x 10(-7) M). At a high concentration (10(-6) M), alkylacetyl-G is converted to alkylacyl-GPC via the retroconversion/de novo route. These data suggest that the formation of PAF by the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase activity limits the amounts of alkylacyl-GPC produced from alkylacetyl-G through this remodeling pathway (PAF cycle).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1585979163,"Arrestin (also called S-antigen or 48-kDa protein) binds to photoexcited and phosphorylated rhodopsin and, thereby, blocks competitively the activation of transducin. Using Ca2+ titration in the presence of the indicator arsenazo III and 45Ca2+ autoradiography, we show that arrestin is a Ca2(+)-binding protein. The Ca2+ binding capacity of arresting-containing protein extracts from bovine rod outer segments is about twice as high as that of arrestin-depleted extracts. The difference in the Ca2+ binding of arrestin-containing and arrestin-depleted protein extracts was attributed to arrestin. Both, these difference-measurements of protein extracts and the measurements of purified arrestin yield dissociation constants for the Ca2+ binding of arrestin between 2 and 4 microM. The titration curves are consistent with a molar ratio of one Ca2+ binding site per arrestin. No Ca2+ binding in the micromolar range was found in extracts containing mainly transducin and cGMP-phosphodiesterase. Since arrestin is one of the most abundant proteins in rod photoreceptors occurring presumably up to millimolar concentrations in rod outer segments, we suggest that aside from its function to prevent the activation of transducin, arrestin acts probably as an intracellular Ca2+ buffer."
https://openalex.org/W1518879062,"Chromatin with nucleosomes spaced at 180-base pair intervals can be formed in vitro on circular DNA molecules using a Xenopus oocyte S-150 extract, but the ability to form a periodic chromatin structure is lost upon fractionation of this extract. To identify factors other than the known ones involved in chromatin assembly, we have first depleted the extract by incubating it in batch with charged resins, and we have subsequently reconstituted it with purified fractions. Studies performed with the fractionated components indicate that formation of periodically spaced nucleosomes on the relaxed, closed circular DNA proceeds in two steps and does not require DNA topoisomerases. In a first step, histones H3/H4 are transferred from the endogenous H3/H4-N1 complex to the DNA, forming a nascent chromatin structure. This structure can then be rapidly complemented in a subsequent and independent step with a stoichiometric amount of histone H2A/H2B dimers. Under these experimental conditions, excess histone H2A/H2B dimers inhibit DNA supercoiling and nucleosome formation. We describe the purification of a factor from the Xenopus oocyte S-150 which permits DNA supercoiling and nucleosome formation under conditions of excess histone H2A/H2B. The activity purifies as a complex of five nonacidic polypeptides with apparent molecular masses ranging between 56 and 62 kDa. This factor prevents the binding of excess histone H2A/H2B to the DNA, and it can also remove excess histone H2A/H2B already bound to the DNA, thus ensuring that stoichiometric amounts of all four nucleosomal histones associate with the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1519249445,"31P and 23Na NMR spectroscopy was applied to the measurement of proton and sodium potentials in endogenously respiring Escherichia coli cells over an external pH (pHex) range from mildly acidic (6.4) to fairly alkaline (8.4). Stable maintenance of alkaline pHex in the face of metabolic acidification was achieved by use of a perfusion system. In the acidic to neutral pHex range, the sodium chemical potential followed the proton chemical potential quite closely, although always exceeding it slightly, as has been reported previously (Castle, A. M., Macnab, R. M., and Shulman, R. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7797-7806). Above pHex 7.4, the sodium potential changed abruptly from a decreasing to an increasing function of pHex, whereas the proton potential continued to decrease. As a consequence, the apparent stoichiometry (i.e. the ratio between the sodium and proton electrochemical potentials) took on progressively higher values, increasing from approximately 1.1 at pH 7.4 to approximately 1.3 at pH 7.8. Thereafter, the sodium chemical potential started to decrease again; however, since the decrease was less steep than that of the proton potential, the apparent stoichiometry continued to increase. At the highest pHex examined (8.4), it had reached a value of approximately 1.4. These results strongly support the hypothesis of an electroneutral (1:1) H+/Na+ antiporter operating virtually alone under acidic to neutral conditions and then being supplemented to an ever increasing degree by an electrogenic (for example, 2:1) antiporter under more alkaline conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1540365188,"Membranes isolated from normal murine B lymphocytes were found to contain a novel phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-specific phospholipase C (PLC) which becomes activated as the Mg2+ concentration is raised from 30 to 1000 microM. This activity, which has not been described previously in any tissue, is restricted to naturally occurring B cell blasts, i.e. it was not detected in quiescent B cells, B lymphomas, or plasmacytomas. As seen in other cell systems, B cell membranes were found to contain Mg2(+)-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase activity. Although neither the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase nor the PtdIns PLC activities were affected by Ca2+, B cell membranes were found to contain a Ca2(+)-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) PLC activity which is activated by [Ca2+] greater than 100 nM. Based on several characteristics, it appears that the Mg2(+)- and Ca2(+)-regulated PLCs are distinct species. First, they have distinct specificity for PtdIns and PtdInsP2, respectively. Second, they have distinct tissue distribution while the Ca2(+)-regulated activity was detected in all B cells, the Mg2(+)-regulated activity is restricted to low density, natural B blasts. Third, the kinetics of activation of the enzymes is distinct; the Mg2(+)-regulated enzyme exhibits slower and less transient activation kinetics. Fourth, the activities exhibit absolute specificity in terms of activation by Mg2+ and Ca2+, i.e. the PtdIns PLC is activated only by Mg2+ and the PtdInsP2 PLC is activated only by Ca2+. Data are consistent with the possibility that Mg2+ mobilization which follows ligation of certain receptors, may play an important role in the regulation of levels of the second messenger diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1487530470,"Efficient cleavage and polyadenylation of eukaryotic messenger RNAs require at least two signal elements: an AAUAAA or closely related sequence located 7-30 base pairs (bp) upstream of the site of processing, and a G/U- or U-rich sequence located 3' to the cleavage site. The herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (tk) gene contains two copies of the AATAAA hexanucleotide and a GT-rich region. We have shown that the first AATAAA and the GT-rich region are essential for efficient processing, both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the second AATAAA does not appear to play any role in the formation of tk mRNA 3' ends. The failure of a signal containing only the second AATAAA and the GT-rich element to signal cleavage and polyadenylation suggested that these two elements might be too close together to constitute a functional polyadenylation signal. The experiments described in this report were directed at determining the effects on mRNA 3' end formation of alterations in spacing between signal elements. Wild-type tk contains 19 bp between these two elements. Constructs were made in which an AATAAA and the GT-rich region were separated by various distances ranging from 7 to 43 bp. The quantity and location of 3' ends of the tk mRNA produced by these constructs in Cos-1 cells were measured by S1 nuclease protection analysis. Signal efficiency was gradually reduced as the separation between the two signal elements was increased; with a separation of 43 bp, the signal functioned at approximately one-eighth the efficiency of the parental construction. Bringing the two signals closer together resulted in decreased signal efficiency; with a separation of 7 or 9 bp, no tk mRNA polyadenylated within the normal region was produced. Altering the sequences between these two elements without changing the distance had small effects on processing efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2151027904,"Mouse peritoneal macrophages synthesize large amounts of prostaglandins and leukotrienes in response to certain inflammatory stimuli. Lipopolysaccharide and phorbol esters stimulate prostaglandin formation but not leukotriene synthesis. Zymosan and the calcium ionophore, A23187, stimulate the formation of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes, as well as the phospholipase C-catalyzed breakdown of phosphoinositides. We have examined the interrelationships among phosphoinositide breakdown and prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis in resident mouse peritoneal macrophages. We demonstrate that macrophages synthesize basally prostaglandin (PG)E2 and PGI2 and that these products begin to accumulate from the time of initial plating of the macrophages. The presence of these prostaglandins imparts a downward modulation of zymosan-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown and, as a result, a downward modulation on leukotriene formation. Inhibition of the basal release of prostaglandin by indomethacin resulted in enhanced zymosan-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown and an exactly corresponding enhancement of leukotriene release. This enhancement, resulting from the inclusion of indomethacin at the time of plating, was reversed by also including PGE2, PGI2, or dibutyryl cAMP. Dibutyryl cAMP, when added in the presence of zymosan and in the absence of indomethacin treatment, inhibited phosphoinositide breakdown and leukotriene synthesis in a parallel fashion, with no effect on prostaglandin release. These data demonstrate that phospholipase C activation is regulated in part by prostaglandin tone and that leukotriene synthesis, unlike prostaglandin synthesis, is dependent on phosphoinositide breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1563674346,"Previous studies demonstrated that several cultured human tumor cell lines potentiate the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by factor Xa and calcium in the absence of exogenous factor Va. In the present study, the specific binding of radioiodinated preparations of human factor X and factor Xa to a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) that constitutively synthesizes a factor V/Va molecule, and a human bladder carcinoma cell line (J82) that does not synthesize factor V/Va, was examined. Radioiodinated factor Xa bound specifically to J82 and HepG2 cells, whereas no significant specific binding of 125I-factor X to either cell was observed. The binding isotherm of 125I-factor Xa to each tumor cell line exhibited a hyperbolic profile, and Scatchard analysis demonstrated a single class of binding site for factor Xa on each cell surface with Kd values of 1.66 +/- 0.39 and 1.64 +/- 0.52 nM and 566,000 +/- 71,000 and 28,000 +/- 6,000 binding sites/cell for HepG2 and J82 cells, respectively. Thrombin formation by cell-bound factor Xa was hyperbolic and saturable at 5 nM factor Xa on each cell line. Hanes-Woolf plots of the prothrombin activation data indicated that half-maximal rates of thrombin formation occurred at factor Xa concentrations of 1.50 +/- 0.43 nM and 1.42 +/- 0.48 nM on HepG2 and J82 cells, respectively. Pretreatment of J82 cells with polyclonal anti-human factor V IgG had no measurable effect on either the binding of 125I-factor Xa or prothrombin activation. However, pretreatment of HepG2 cells with anti-human factor V IgG inhibited prothrombin activation in a dose-dependent manner, but did not inhibit the binding of factor Xa to this cell. When both cell lines were preincubated with exogenous human factor Va, the binding of factor Xa to either HepG2 or J82 cells was marginally affected. These data indicate that HepG2 and J82 cells have cell surface factor Xa binding sites proximal to, but independent of, cell surface factor Va of either exogenous or endogenous origin."

A mobility-shift electrophoresis assay was used to examine DNA fragments containing the promoter/regulatory and the mRNA leader regions of the thymidine kinase gene (TK, a model beta gene) for their ability to bind proteins present in nuclear extracts prepared from uninfected and infected cells. Specific complexes unique to each extract were formed. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for ICP4 (the major regulatory protein of HSV) we demonstrated that this protein is present in the complexes formed between probes encompassing either the promoter/regulatory or leader sequence DNAs and proteins in infected-cell extracts. These complexes formed despite the lack of a high affinity binding site for ICP4 in either of these regions. The stability of complexes formed in infected-cell extracts with DNA probes containing the promoter/regulatory, leader region, and a high affinity ICP4-binding site were compared by dissociation analysis. The relative kd(obs) for these DNA-protein complexes was in the order: TK-leader region much greater than TK-promoter/regulatory region greater than or equal to high affinity ICP4-binding site. Cu+/1,10-phenanthroline footprinting revealed that infected-cell complexes which form on a probe containing a high affinity ICP4-binding site generate a protection pattern, whereas those formed on a probe containing the TK-leader sequence do not. In contrast, complexes formed with the latter probe in extracts from uninfected cells are kinetically stable and refractile to cleavage. A model for activation of the TK gene which incorporates these results is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1519145141,"Transcription of the 117 gene and changes in its mRNA levels in Dictyostelium discoideum were studied by mRNA hybridization with a cDNA probe. In wild type cells (Ax-2), the expression is developmentally regulated during cell aggregation, while in the aggregateless mutant, Agip 45, 117 mRNA is not detectable during cell starvation. Low concentrations of cAMP, given in the form of extracellular pulses to induce the development of starved Agip 45 cells to aggregation competence, are able to induce the appearance of 117 mRNA. The induction seems to be via the cell surface cAMP receptor and by a mechanism which does not involve changes in intracellular cAMP. Interestingly, high concentrations of cAMP, which down-regulate the cell surface cAMP receptor, elicit a rapid decrease in the level of 117 mRNA in aggregation-competent cells. Nuclear run-off and pulse-chase experiments show that the high concentrations of cAMP selectively destabilize the mRNA for 117 antigen. This destabilization requires both de novo mRNA synthesis and protein synthesis since the addition of inhibitors of these processes eliminates the effects of cAMP on 117 mRNA. The data suggest that a cAMP-induced protein(s) may be involved in the destabilization of selective mRNAs."
