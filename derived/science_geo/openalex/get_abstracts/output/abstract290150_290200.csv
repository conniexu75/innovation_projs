https://openalex.org/W2080493392,"Comparison of precise leveling measurements made in 1923 with those made in 1975, 1976, and 1977 reveals that the 600,000-year-old Yellowstone caldera is being uplifted relative to its surroundings. Maximum relative uplift since 1923 is in excess of 700 millimeters-about 14 millimeters vertically per year. The most likely cause of this rapid and unusually large surface deformation is a recent influx of molten or partially molten materials to a location within the crust beneath Yellowstone National Park."
https://openalex.org/W2021972991,"Eight events of climate variation with durations of the order of 100 years have been found in the history of annual Nile River discharge dating from the year 622. They cease during the ""little climatic optimum"" in the North Atlantic and then reappear and intensify; this behavior suggests that control is from the belt of the polar westerlies."

https://openalex.org/W1988700082,"Helium appears indispensable for certain energy-related uses that may be important 50 years from now, when helium-bearing natural gas, a much cheaper source than air, may be exhausted. Present demand, however, is lower than productive capacity, and much helium is being dissipated into the atmosphere as natural gas is burned for fuel. Controversy over the need for a government-directed helium-conservation program reflects fundamental differences in viewpoints on the economic future of industrial society, on the limits of substitution of labor and capital for a depleting resource, and on intergenerational equity and risk-bearing."
