https://openalex.org/W2081034153,"Polyadenylic acid [poly(A)] segments containing 150 to 250 nucleotides appear to be covalently linked to heterogeneous nuclear RNA (HnRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in eucaryotic cells. The poly(A) is synthesized in the nucleus, and is probably linked initially to HnRNA that is ultimately transported as mRNA to the cytoplasm. Studies with inhibitors of RNA or poly(A) synthesis indicate that synthesis of poly(A) segments is independent of transcription. The poly(A) marker may prove useful to elucidate mRNA modification and transport in eucaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036101429,"An abrupt loss of effectiveness of the presumed carriers, nonactin and valinomycin, in mediating ion conductance occurred at the same temperature as the membrane fluidity, judged visually, was lost. By contrast, the effects of the presumed channel-former, gramicidin, were the same on solid and liquid membranes. Taken together, these findings imply that freezing the membrane primarily reduces the mobility of these antibiotics with little effect on their solubility."
https://openalex.org/W2064616746,"The growth and metabolism of cultured mammalian cells are markedly affected by the pH variation in ordinary hicarbonate-buffered media (pH 8.0 to 6.9). Those pH swings can be reduced and the pH of the culture can be stabilized as desired in the range pH 6.4 to 8.3 by appropriate combinations of two or three organic buffers, each at 10 to 15 millimolar, in conjunction with phosphate and bicarbonate. The initial alkalinization in sparse cultures is then minimized, and the metabolic acidificatiotn in 24 hours is usually less than 0.4 pH unit except in heavy cultutres."

Glucagon and pentagastrin also stimulate, but secretin and the octapetide of cholecystokinin do not. The stimulants may participate in regulation of intestinal secretion in health and in diseases with excessive secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2095371778,"Neural responses evoked by the same binaural speech signal were recorded from ten right-handed subjects during two auditory identification tasks. One task required analysis of acoustic parameters important for making a linguistic distinction, while the other task required analysis of an acoustic parameter which provides no linguistic information at the phoneme level. In the time interval between stimulus onset and the subjects' identification responses, evoked potentials from the two tasks were significantly different over the left hemisphere but identical over the right hemisphere. These results indicate that different neural events occur in the left hemisphere during analysis of linguistic versus nonlinguistic parameters of the same acoustic signal."
https://openalex.org/W1964458517,"Combined utilization of measures now available or imminent could reduce caries of the crowns of the teeth to the point of negligibility as a public health problem, if public desire were great enough to motivate changes in some of our habits. Universal optimum application of fluoride and substitution of starchy foods for sugary ones (or even simply judicious consumption of sugar) would alone do most of the job. Sealing of susceptible occlusal areas with adhesive polymers promises to protect the sites where fluoride evidently cannot be maximally effective. It seems unlikely that any single measure will be found sufficient to control this multifactorial disease. Consequently, we must continue the search for new means to increase the caries resistance of teeth, to reduce the cariogenicity of foodstuffs, and to check the deleterious activities of cariogenic bacteria. Anticaries food additives and antibacterial agents for intraoral use seem to be approaching practicability. Past performance warrants expectation that ongoing fundamental investigations will produce leads for future development and application."
https://openalex.org/W2063042089,"Deep body temperature of the house sparrow, Passer domesticus, was monitored continuously by radio telemetry. Pinealectomy abolished the normal circadian rhythm of body temperature in constant darkness, and significantly altered the amplitude of body temperature rhythms entrained to light cycles. The body temperature minima of pinealectomized birds never fell as low as those of unoperated birds regardless of the light conditions; the temperature maxima of both normal and pinealectomized birds were higher in light than in darkness. In sparrows the pineal organ is essential to the normal function of the biological clock controlling both activity and body temperature rhythms and may be directly involved in thermoregulation."

Addifion of vanadium to the diet enhances growth by over 40 percent. A nearly optimum effect is obtained with 10 micrograms of vanadium per 100 grams of diet in (0.1 part per million), supplied in the form of sodium orthovanadate, as seen from series of tests with levels ranging from 1 to 5 micrograms per 100 grams of diet. Different vanadium compounds show different potencies: sodium orthovanadate was effective, metavanadate less active, and pyrovanadate without activity. Tetravalent vanadium, supplied as vanadyl sulfate or acetate, was utilized but produced smaller responses. The amounts of vanadium required are those normally found in tissues and nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W2094324253,Subjects searched a rapid sequence of computer-produced letter arrays for the presence of a numeral in one of the arrays. The subjects' scanning rates were computed from their precentage of correct detections of the location of the numeral. Scanning rates were very high and approximately the same for a wide variety of conditions; the highest scanning rates (125 and 75 letters per second for two subjects) occurred when there were 9 or 16 letters in each of the arrays and when new arrays were presented every 40 to 50 milliseconds. Giving the subject advance knowledge of the numeral to be presented made little difference in the scores.

https://openalex.org/W2022182129,"The human red blood cell responds to prostaglandin E(2), epinephrine, and isoproterenol with a decrease in deformability. The maximum decrease is brought about by 10(-10)M prostaglandin E(2), 10(-9)M epinephrine, or 10(-7)M isoproterenol. The dose response curve is biphasic. The sensitivity of the red cell to prostaglandin suggests that this cell may be a primary target for prostaglandin action. These changes in response to vasoactive substances indicate that the red cell must be considered an active element in circulatory control."

On days 11 to 40, 12 rats received behaviorally effective doses of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, either orally or intraperitoneally. These rats ate significantly less than placebo-dosed controls during the treatment period, and gained significantly less weight. Food intake recovered in the 30-day posttreatment period, but the former drug group still weighed less than the controls on day 70. In addition, all rats who had received intraperitoneal injections of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol showed evidence of chronic diffuse nonsuppurative peritonitis."

The rates for α chains vary over a 6-fold range, the lowest rate, for guinea pig hemoglobin, being only 2.5 sec-1 at pH 9 and 20°. When compared with isolated chains, the rates for human α chains within the hemoglobin molecule are decreased 2-fold; the rates for β chains are little affected. The rates for the β chains from man, horse (two electrophoretic types), guinea pig, and sheep (two electrophoretic types) are all larger than the corresponding α chain rates, vary over a 3-fold range, and are slightly slower at pH 9 than at pH 7."

https://openalex.org/W1544711420,"Abstract The two major molecular weight classes of thrombin have been resolved chromatographically on sulfoethyl Sephadex. The larger thrombin is a molecule of 39,000 daltons, composed of two disulfide-linked chains of 33,000 and 6,000 daltons. The smaller thrombins have an intact molecular weight of 28,000. At least two molecular species are contained in this class with the proposed disulfide-linked chain structure (a) 18,000 and 10,000 daltons and (b) 14,000, 4,000, and 10,000 daltons. All the thrombins isolated have identical specific activities toward tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester. The clotting specific activity of the larger thrombin is 2,700 NIH units per mg while those of the two smaller thrombins appear to be about 0.50 and 0.25 of this value, respectively. Studies conducted with Parke-Davis topical thrombin and partially purified prothrombin indicate that the smaller thrombins are sequentially produced from the larger thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W1559967710,"Abstract Bovine prothrombin has been purified by modifications of existing procedures. The purified protein is effectively homogeneous in four analytical gel electrophoresis systems, and is stable during storage in 50% glycerol-H2O at -20°. The specific activity of the protein when assayed by a modified two-stage procedure is 1,100 to 1,300 NIH thrombin units per mg. The molecular weight of the proenzyme determined by gel filtration in both 6 m guanidinium chloride, and electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate is 72,000 ± 5,000. The activation of prothrombin in 25% sodium citrate-defibrinated plasma has been studied by monitoring molecular weight changes and the production of enzymatic activity toward fibrinogen and N-α-tosyl-l-arginine methylester. The results of this study are consistent with a mechanism in which prothrombin is first cleaved to an intermediate of 65,000 daltons. This intermediate is subsequently cleaved to produce two single chain molecules of 39,000 daltons and 24,000 daltons. The 39,000-dalton chain is thrombogenic, giving rise to an active thrombin composed of two disulfide-linked chains (33,000 and 6,000 daltons). Further cleavages in this molecule result in two 28,000-dalton thrombins; one composed of two disulfide-linked chains (18,000 and 10,000 daltons) and the other composed of three disulfide-linked chains (14,000, 4,000, and 10,000 daltons). The thrombins produced in the activation system are chromatographically and electrophoretically indistinguishable from those in Parke-Davis topical thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W2010526684,Gonadal growth was controlled in two avian species by corticosterone and prolactin injected daily at various times. Testicular growth was induced in photorefractory house sparrows (Passer domesticus) kept in continuous light by prolactin injected 4 or 8 hours after administration of corticosterone. Other temporal patterns were ineffective. Gonadal growth was also stimulated in photosensitive white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) kept in continuous light by prolactin injected 12 hours after administration of corticosterone. Daily injections of prolactin 8 hours after injection of corticosterone inhibited gonadal growth. The seasonal cycle of reproductive photorefractoriness and photosensitivity is controlled by a changing relation between the daily rhythms of plasma concentrations of corticosterone and prolactin.
https://openalex.org/W1808569266,"Abstract The previous observation (Babior, B. M., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 449 (1969)) that the tritium isotope effect for the coenzyme B12-dependent deamination of ethanolamine was smaller than the deuterium isotope effect prompted a reexamination of the various isotope effects observed in this reaction. Measurements of the rates of deamination of [1-D]- and [1,1-D2]ethanolamine showed that no secondary isotope effect was detectable within the limits of experimental error. Activation parameters for the deamination of unlabeled ethanolamine and [1,1-D2]ethanolamine at 23° were as follows: for the unlabeled substrate, Ea = 3.9 kcal per mole and S = -9.7 e.u.; for the deuterated substrate, Ea = 5.5 kcal per mole and S = -9.4 e.u. The similarity of these values implies that the rate-limiting step does not change on passing from the unlabeled to the deuterium-labeled substrate. Measurement of the tritium isotope effect for each of the two individual hydrogen transfer steps of the reaction gave the following results: for the first step (transfer of hydrogen from substrate to coenzyme), kt/kh = 4.7; for the second step (transfer of hydrogen from coenzyme to product), kt/kh = 160 and kt/kd = 22. The over-all deuterium isotope effect was found to be 7.4, confirming previous results. From these and other observations the following conclusions were drawn: (a) the rate-limiting step is the transfer of hydrogen from coenzyme to product; (b) an irreversible step occurs between the first hydrogen transfer step and the second; and (c) exchange between free and enzyme-bound coenzyme B12 during the course of the reaction is slow."
https://openalex.org/W2035131600,"The distribution of catecholamine varicosities within the brainstem reticular formation of the immature cat was determined by means of the formaldehyde-induced fluorescence technique. A continuous pattern of intense, green, medium-sized varicosities exists at nearly all brainstem levels. At most of these levels the varicosities appear within the boundaries of reticular formation nuclei. However, in rostral mesencephalon, some of the varicosities of the pattern lie in proximity to perikarya of the red nucleus. In addition, numerous varicosities in caudal medulla appear to extend from the pattern into nonreticular formation nuclei. A comparable pattern of reticular formation fluorescence is absent in the rat and this finding is believed to represent a true interspecies difference."

https://openalex.org/W2001497043,"Dimeric products are formed by riboflavin-sensitized photooxidation of 2,4-dichlorophenol. The products of this reaction were examined to determine whether chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins could be formed from chlorophenols in water by the action of light of wavelengths greater than 280 nanometers. Dimers are formed by union of phenoxy radicals through carbon-carbon or carbon-oxygen bonds. 4,6-Dichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol was obtained in greater quantity than other dimers. Products were characterized by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins which could result from ring closure of a 2-phenoxyphenol derivative were not detected in the products of photolysis. The failure to detect chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins may result from the rapid photolytic breakdown of the lower chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. Under environmental conditions, dioxins are unlikely products of the lower chlorinated phenols or phenoxyalkanoic acids."

https://openalex.org/W1486298457,"Abstract Rat liver cell suspensions oxidized [1-14C]palmitic acid and [1-14C]palmitoyl-l-carnitine efficiently to CO2. Oxidation of tracer amounts of palmitate was inhibited by α-bromo-palmitate (2 x 10-4 m). The oxidation of tracer amounts of palmitoyl-l-carnitine was not affected. α-Bromo-palmitoyl-dl-carnitine did not have any effect on the oxidation of either substrate. The inhibition of oxidation of tracer amounts of [1-14C]palmitate by the bromo-acid could be overcome by increasing the concentration of palmitic acid in the incubation medium. The oxidation of [1-14C]palmitic acid by liver mitochondria was also inhibited by α-bromo-palmitate but the inhibition could not be overcome by additional palmitate. α-Bromo-palmitoyl-dl-carnitine inhibited the oxidation of both palmitic acid and palmitoyl-l-carnitine by isolated mitochondria. The long chain acyl-CoA ligase activity of ultrasonically disrupted liver mitochondria was irreversibly inhibited by the α-bromo-palmitate but the long chain acyl-CoA-carnitine transferase was unaffected. Mitochondria isolated from liver cell which had been treated with α-bromo-palmitate were able to oxidize palmitic acid and had unimpaired long chain acyl-CoA ligase and acyl-CoA-carnitine transferase activities. The inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by cell suspensions in the presence of α-bromo-palmitic acid could be shown with palmitic, oleic, myristic, lauric, and decanoic acids but not with octanoic acid as substrates. From the results it is concluded that α-bromo-palmitic acid reversibly competes with a carrier mechanism of long chain fatty acid transport. It is suggested that long chain fatty acids do not cross the liver cell membrane by diffusion but probably by a mechanism involving fatty acid receptors on and across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2026660487,Proteins in human plasma and oyster fluid induce a strong feeding response in the marine snail Nassarius obsoletus. Purified human serum albumin induces a 50 percent positive response at concentrations of 1 to 2 × 10-9 molar. Adsorbed fatty acids markedly decrease the effectiveness of albumin. From oyster fluid a major glycoprotein has been isolated which accounts for essentially the entire stimulatory activity of the fluid and is effective at concentrations of approximately 1 to 2 × 10-10 molar. These findings provide evidence that specific proteins in extremely low concentrations may play a major role in chemoreception in aquatic animals.
https://openalex.org/W1503858780,"Abstract An application of a singular perturbation method to the case of carbon monoxide similar to that used previously for the case of oxygen (Murray, J. D., Proc. Roy. Soc. London B Biol. Sci., 178, 95 (1971)) shows that the absence of any observed facilitation of diffusion of this ligand by either hemoglobin or myoglobin in all of the experiments so far performed results from the very high affinity of both proteins for the gas. At every point in the solution both proteins were essentially at equilibrium with the gas but it was evidently impossible to reduce the pressure of carbon monoxide on the low pressure face of the solution sufficiently to remove a significant amount of the carbon monoxide from combination with the macromolecular carrier. The principle that a macromolecule can only function as a carrier under conditions in which its saturation with the ligand is incomplete in some region of the solution is quite general."

In addition to the binary complex species (MA', MH-1A', MH-2A', MH-1A'2, M2H-3A'2, MB, MB2, and MHA'', MA'', MH-1A'', MH-2A'', MA''2, MH2A''2, MH-1A''2, MH-2A''2, MB, MB2, respectively) two mixed complexes (MA'B, MH-1A'B and MA''B, MH-1A''B) were detected in each system. Their stability constants were refined with a general least squares treatment. In the case of an equimolecular mixture of the constituents, a maximum of about 50% of Cu(II) is present as MH-1A'B at pH 10 to 10.5 and as MH-1A''B at pH 8 to 10, when the concentration of each constituent is set equal to 10-2 m. Mixed coordination enhances the stability of the complexes. The effect is greater in the case of diglycylglycine than glycylglycine. The absorption spectra of the individual species were computed from absorbance measurements made under conditions of pH and ligand ratio which maximized the concentrations of the various species. The position of the absorption bands of the mixed species compared to those of the corresponding binary species was consistent with an increase of the ligand field due to an NH2 group entering into the coordination sphere of Cu(II). Mixed complex formation was also examined by the radiochromatographic studies utilizing 64Cu(II), [14C]glycine, and [14C]glycine peptides."

Only when unlabeled triiodothyronine was added as a carrier could the newly formed doubly labeled triiodothyronine be isolated. The fact that this triiodothyronine was labeled with the correct ratio of carbon-14 to iodine-125 indicated that it originated from thyroxine. Approximately 5 percent of the initial carbon-14 radioactivity was found in the recovered triiodothyronine.

https://openalex.org/W1506168115,"Abstract An intermediate is invoked to explain the formation of interstrand cross-links when the DNA is treated by nitrous acid. The cross-links appear with a time lag, and they continue to form after elimination of the nitrous acid. The concentration of the intermediate quickly reaches a steady state during the nitrous acid treatment. After a time lag of a few minutes, the appearance of cross-links follows zero order kinetics; moreover, the maximum increase of cross-links during post-treatment incubation is independent of the duration of nitrous acid treatment as soon as it exceeds a few minutes. As a pH decrease favors the DNA cross-linking either during the nitrous acid treatment or during the post-treatment incubation, it is proposed that a free aldehyde group plays a role in the reaction mechanism, and a reaction scheme is presented which involves deamination of guanine to xanthine, depurination of xanthine, and subsequent reaction of the liberated aldehyde function with an amino group of the opposite DNA chain. Finally, the lethal action of HNO2 on bacteriophages is also discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1524953404,"Abstract Liver cytochrome P-450 forms two spectroscopically and functionally distinct compounds with ethyl isocyanide, but the structural basis for the difference between them is unknown. We have examined the relative rates of formation of the two compounds at low temperatures. Reduced cytochrome P-450 was generated photochemically from its carbon monoxide complex at temperatures below 0°, and allowed to react with ethyl isocyanide. (a) The extent of conversion from the CO compound to the ethyl isocyanide compounds was a function of the relative concentrations of CO and ethyl isocyanide. At a concentration ratio of about 1, nearly complete conversion took place. (b) The ratio of the two ethyl isocyanide compounds formed upon irradiation with monochromatic light at 450 nm, measured by the relative heights of their Soret bands (455 and 430 nm), depended upon irradiation conditions such as temperature and time. In general, the lower the irradiation temperature, the higher the ratio of the 455-nm state to the 430-nm state. The sum of ethyl isocyanide compounds formed upon 1-min irradiation, however, decreased with decreasing temperature below -30°; no conversion occurred at or below -85°. (c) On irradiation at -30°, the 455-nm state was produced rapidly at first, then its concentration decreased gradually while that of the 430-nm state increased. Thus, the ratio of the 455-nm state to the 430-nm state decreased with increasing irradiation time. (d) A slow reversion from ethyl isocyanide compounds to CO complex occurred as a dark reaction after irradiation. During this conversion, at -30°, a rapid decrease in the ratio of the 455-nm state to the 430-nm state took place. These observations and others suggest that the following relationship exists among the cytochrome P-450 compounds studied. [see PDF for equation] where EtNC represents ethyl isocyanide."
https://openalex.org/W1504902429,"Spectropolarimetric studies were performed to examine the conformation of metapyrocatechase in the absence and presence of the substrate, catechol. Metapyrocatechase, a ferrous ion containing dioxygenase, had an ordered structure with a relatively low content of α helix. This ordered structure was partially destroyed by treatment of the enzyme with urea or alkali, but not by resolution of the bound iron. Upon addition of catechol under anaerobic conditions, a new negative circular dichroic band appeared at 317 nm with a concomitant decrease at 300 nm, although the circular dichroic spectrum in the region below 250 nm was essentially unchanged. The circular dichroic band at 317 nm permitted a quantitative assessment of substrate binding and 3 moles of catechol were shown to be bound per mole of enzyme. Similar results were obtained when other enzymatically active substrate analogues were employed. On the other hand, the addition of nonmetabolizable competitive inhibitors did not alter the circular dichroic spectra of the enzyme itself significantly, although they reduced the magnitude of the circular dichroic band at 317 nm produced by the substrates. The magnitude of the circular dichroic band at 317 nm was stoichiometrically related to the amount of ferrous ion bound to the enzyme. Available evidence indicates that the observed asymmetricity induced by the substrate binding is due to a local conformational change around the substrate-binding site and the iron-binding site of the enzyme protein."

The relative activities on these substrates indicate that chymotrypsinogens 1 and 2 correspond with mammalian chymotrypsinogens B and A, respectively. Preliminary specificity studies indicate that chymotrypsinogen 3 may correspond with mammalian chymotrypsinogen C."
https://openalex.org/W1638146979,"Abstract The acylation step of the α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate has been studied at pH 7.1 and 25° in 2-propanol-water mixtures. By the use of higher substrate concentrations than those used previously under the same conditions, it was shown that, contrary to a previous report, the reaction of acylation does follow saturation kinetics. The binding constant, Ks, and the acylation rate constant, K2, were determined. The acylation step of the δ-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate in acetonitrile-water was also shown to follow saturation kinetics. The pH dependences of k2 and Ks are similar to those reported for α-chymotrypsin, although the decrease in k2 at high pH is less for δ-chymotrypsin. Thus, the pH dependence of acylation by p-nitrophenyl acetate is qualitatively different from that of specific substrates where k2 is pH independent and Ks increases with pH. An explanation for this peculiar pH dependence of chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate is offered."
https://openalex.org/W1980315208,Three crystalline forms of calcium carbonate were identified in washings of the hamster vagina. Spherical concretions of vaterite and hexagonal concretions of calcite predominate on days 3 and 4 of the 4-day estrous cycle. Dumbbell-like concretions of aragonite predominate during pregnancy and pseudopregnancy. Each polymorph is associated with an acid-insoluble matrix. Concretions disappear after ovariectomy and reappear during daily injections of estrogen and progesterone.
https://openalex.org/W2059439027,"Although cybernetic models of one sort or another have become quite common in behavioral research, and although these models theoretically require a capacity for system detection of changes in error, no general psychophysical description of the individual human being's ability to discriminate different rates of stimulation is available. An initial survey of this type has been attempted and is reported here. For reasons which appear to be related to the biological mechanisms underlying sensory information processing, it is concluded, first, that ancillary cues of rate-related final magnitude are more valuable than cues of stimulus duration; second, that direct attention to on-going change is less precise than attention to final values only; and third, that differences in isochronal stimulus rates occurring in place or extent are more readily perceived than differences in isochronal rate of change in energy content, at least for the stimuli and ranges examined."
https://openalex.org/W2024638828,"A new phenomenon is reported in which alternate stimulation of either nasal or temporal hemiretinas produces, respectively, apparent oscillation in depth either behind or ahead of the frontal plane. This control over the perceived movement is dependent on the proper positioning of stimuli presented interocularly and in horizontal arrangements."
