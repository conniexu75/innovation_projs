https://openalex.org/W1641717686,"Under appropriate conditions, the activity of phosphofructokinase of skeletal muscle from frog and mouse is extremely sensitive to small changes in pH in the physiological range, a low pH decreasing the affinity of the enzyme for fructose 6-phosphate. It is concluded that shifts in intracellular pH are important in the regulation of phosphofructokinase, but that this effect makes interpretation of data from intact muscle quite difficult."
https://openalex.org/W1540662041,"Abstract For brain phosphofructokinase at pH 8, with noninhibitory levels of adenosine triphosphate, the Michaelis constants for ATP (0.1 mm) and fructose-6-P (0.04 mm) are each independent of the concentration of the second substrate. Inhibition of P-fructokinase by ATP is highly susceptible to many influences. In addition to the specific effects of NH4+, inorganic orthophosphate, AMP, fructose-6-P, and fructose diphosphate, ATP inhibition is affected by pH, the concentration of Mg2+, dimercaptopropanol, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate. At pH 8, with a high constant level of Mg2+, the velocities can be quantitatively accounted for, over a wide range of levels of both substrates, by a formulation involving two inhibitor sites for ATP and three deinhibitor sites for fructose-6-P, none of which influences the substrate site Michaelis constants for ATP or fructose-6-P. Free ATP is much more inhibitory than MgATP2-. Because of this, and because Mg2+ itself is inhibitory, the relationship between Mg2+ concentration and activity is complex. At pH 8 an Mg2+:ATP ratio of about 2:1 is optimal except at very low ATP levels; at pH 7 much higher Mg2+:ATP ratios are required for maximal rates. Inhibition by Mg2+ is antagonized by AMP. NH4+, Pi, and AMP all increase activity, particularly at inhibitory levels of ATP. The effects are synergistic. At pH 7 with almost complete inhibition by ATP, the results of adding various combinations of the three activators fit a formulation in which the catalytic activity increases progressively as one, two, or three of the activators are bound to the molecule. The formulation requires that the presence of any two of the activators increases the affinity of the enzyme for the third. ADP and cyclic 3',5'-AMP appear to act in the same manner as AMP, presumably at the same site. K+ appears to act in the same manner as NH4+ but does not increase enzyme activity to the same degree. At pH 8 and 27°, P-fructokinase loses half its activity in 4 sec and 95% in 2 min. It can be protected by very low levels of either substrate or either product or by AMP or sulfate. The half-life is doubled by 3 x 10-10 m fructose diphosphate. The kinetic findings have been interpreted to indicate the presence of not less than seven substrate, inhibitor, and deinhibitor sites (and possibly as many as 12). It would appear that these sites are so arranged that the addition of one inhibitor (ATP) makes it easier to add the other (citrate) and harder to add the deinhibitors, whereas addition of any two deinhibitors makes it easier to add the third and harder to add either inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1524103141,"Abstract 1. The properties of a mitochondrial fraction (F0) which confers oligomycin sensitivity on soluble ATPase were found to resemble in several aspects the properties of particles that catalyze oxidative phosphorylation. Susceptibility to oligomycin, Dio-9, tri-n-butyltin chloride, detergents, and phospholipase A are shared by both systems. 2. Treatment of F0 with phospholipase A resulted in complete loss of activity. About half of the original activity was restored by treatment of the preparation with serum albumin and phospholipids. 3. Brief exposure of particles containing F0 activity to trypsin or to sonic oscillation either at pH 10.0 or in the presence of phospholipid resulted in partial loss of F0 activity. Full restoration of activity was achieved by addition of coupling factor 4."
https://openalex.org/W1495162468,"Abstract Microsomes prepared from electric organ of Electrophorus electricus contain, in addition to a sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase, two different ATP-ADP transphosphorylases; one requires only magnesium, while the other requires Mg++ + Na+. The Mg++-activated nucleotide exchange is nonspecific with respect to substrates and is probably unrelated to the highly specific Na+-K+-ATPase. The (Mg++ + Na+)-activated exchange is highly specific with respect to Na+ and the adenine nucleotides and is probably a component of the Na+-K+-ATPase. However, the Na+-activated exchange may be deomonstrated only at low Mg++ concentrations relative to the optimum for the ATPase. Calcium, K+, ouabain, and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibit both the Na+-activated exchange and the ATPase. Oligomycin and incubation at pH 9 inhibit the ATPase with little effect on the exchange. It is concluded that the initial step of the Na+-K+-ATPase reaction is a reversible phosphorylation of the enzyme which requires both Na+ and Mg++ as activators. The nonspecific nucleotide exchange is considered to be irrelevant to the Na+-K+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1601924217,"Abstract 1. A factor conferring oligomycin sensitivity on mitochondrial ATPase was obtained from submitochondrial particles by sequential treatment with trypsin and urea, and was purified by fractionation with ammonium sulfate in the presence of 2% cholate. The preparation had a very low content of phospholipids and respiratory enzymes. 2. By omitting treatment with urea, an insoluble, oligomycin-sensitive ATPase was isolated which was also low in respiratory enzymes and phospholipids. 3. Addition of soluble mitochondrial ATPase to the factor conferring oligomycin sensitivity resulted in a marked inhibition of ATPase activity, which was fully restored by addition of phospholipids. Similarly, the isolated oligomycin-sensitive ATPase required phospholipids for ATPase activity. 4. The interaction of these preparations with tritium-labeled ATPase, 14C-phospholipids and 14C-rutamycin was analyzed quantitatively. The binding capacity of the factor for 3H-labeled ATPase was much larger than that of various particles containing phospholipids. Addition of phospholipids interfered with the binding of 3H-labeled ATPase. Inhibition by 14C-rutamycin was reversed by repeated washing of particles with phospholipids."

https://openalex.org/W1560885209,"Abstract 1. Evidence has been presented in this paper which greatly strengthens the suggestion that the spherical particles lining the inner membranes of mitochondria are the morphological representations of coupling factor 1 (ATPase). 2. With tritum-labeled ATPase it was shown that treatment of reconstituted particles with 2 m urea leads to a release of radioactivity which corresponded to the disappearance of the inner membrane spheres. 3. Certain salts, e.g. KI or KSCN were shown to facilitate the cold inactivation of ATPase in mitochondrial particles and to eliminate the inner membrane spheres. 4. Studies of the structural properties of reconstituted preparations of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase revealed characteristic fragments of membranes with inner membrane spheres. These preparations were essentially colorless and contained negligible amounts of respiratory enzymes. 5. A role of phospholipids in the organization of the membranous fragments was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1520903601,"Abstract The tissue levels of the glycolytic intermediates and adenine nucleotides were measured in perfused rat hearts supplied with 20 mm glucose during the transition from aerobiosis to carbon monoxide-induced anoxia. Facilitation of phosphofructokinase occurred as early as 20 sec after the induction of anoxia at 37°, as shown by an increase of fructose diphosphate and a fall of hexose monophosphate levels. Inorganic phosphate, creatine, adenosine monophosphate, and ADP levels increased simultaneously, while ATP and creatine-phosphate levels decreased. The increases of the nucleotides slightly preceded the rise of fructose diphosphate, and the largest percentage changes were in AMP and inorganic phosphate. These results are in accordance with the postulated activation of phosphofructokinase in vivo by AMP and phosphate. At 25°, the adenine nucleotide changes were much smaller, and an increase of phosphate accounted for the observed activation of phosphofructokinase. Maximum activation of phosphofructokinase occurred between 40 and 60 sec after the onset of anoxia. Overshoots in the levels of many glycolytic intermediates were observed during the transition from the aerobic to the anoxic steady states, indicating a complex sequence of interactions between the various control sites in the glycolytic pathway. Aerobic recovery after a brief period of anoxia was associated with an inhibition of phosphofructokinase, and a return of the levels of high energy phosphate intermediates to their preanoxic values."
https://openalex.org/W121598433,"Abstract Rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase was isolated and crystallized in the presence of adenosine triphosphate. The enzyme was homogeneous on electrophoresis. In the ultracentrifuge its behavior depended upon the conditions employed. For example, in glycerophosphate buffer at concentrations of enzyme above 0.1% a single asymmetric peak, s20,w = 37 S, with a trailing edge was present. With decreasing protein concentrations the sedimentation coefficient dropped to an s20,w of 13.8 S determined by density gradient centrifugation. In the presence of ATP lower sedimentation coefficients were observed, i.e. s20,w = 29 and 8.4 S, respectively, under the above conditions. In p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, phosphofructokinase sedimented as a single component with an s20,w = 13.1 S. The enzyme was stable when stored in the presence of ATP but aggregated in the absence of this nucleotide. It was determined that phosphofructokinase binds 1 mole of ATP, ADP, AMP, or cyclic 3',5'-AMP per 75,000 g of protein. The amino acid composition and the absorption spectrum of crystalline phosphofructokinase were determined. The crystalline enzyme showed the typical kinetic behavior previously reported for less pure preparations of enzyme in that it was inhibited by ATP and the inhibition was prevented by AMP or cyclic 3',5'-AMP. Phosphofructokinase examined in the electron microscope by negative staining revealed the presence of double or paired particles having dimensions of 130 x 100 x 25 A for the pair."
https://openalex.org/W1588735056,"Abstract The axonemal adenosine triphosphatase protein, dynein, consists of 14 S and 30 S fractions. Both forms of dynein require the presence of a divalent cation for activity: Mg++, Ca++, Mn++, Fe++, Co++, and Ni++ can all function as activator, but Be++, Cd++, Sr++, and Zn++ cannot. Specificity for ATP or deoxy-ATP is moderately high; other nucleoside triphosphates are hydrolyzed at only about 10% of the rate of ATP; AMP, pyrophosphate, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate are not hydrolyzed. The two forms of dynein both have a pH optimum at pH 8.5 to 9.0. Addition of neutral salts to the assay medium inhibits the activity of 14 S dynein but enhances that of 30 S dynein. When assayed under standard conditions with Mg++ activation, 14 S and 30 S dynein had maximal velocities of 3.5 and 1.3 µmoles of Pi per (min x mg of protein), respectively, and Michaelis constants of 3.5 x 10-5 and 1.1 x 10-5 m. The general similarity in enzymatic properties is consistent with a monomer-polymer relationship between 14 S and 30 S dynein, with the differences that occur being the results of a configurational change attendant upon polymerization. The possible physiological significance of the partial repression of ATPase activity in 30 S dynein is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1505934113,"Abstract Myosin obtained from red skeletal muscle of rabbit has a lower adenosine triphosphatase activity than myosin from white skeletal muscle. Structural differences between the two types of myosin are suggested by the higher apparent activation energy of the calcium-activated adenosine triphosphatase reaction catalyzed by red muscle myosin, by the higher rate of inactivation at pH 7.5 to 9.5, and by the previously reported slower rate of tryptic digestion of myosin from red muscle. No evidence has been found for the presence in red muscle, or in myosin prepared from red muscle, of inhibitors or inactivators of myosin adenosine triphosphatase. The two types of myosin also differ with respect to the pattern of activation of adenosine triphosphatase by sulfhydryl reagents. At low ionic strength myosin from red muscles is activated by N-ethylmaleimide and myosin from white muscles is unaffected, whereas at high ionic strength both myosins are activated. Four moles of p-chloromercuribenzoate per 105 g of myosin are needed for maximal activation of fresh myosin from red muscles, but only 2 moles are required per 105 g of myosin from white muscles. This difference disappears in a few days, suggesting a change in the availability of sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1493572762,"Abstract The sulfhydryl reagents, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), N-butylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, inhibit the Na+-K+-ATPase and Mg++-activated ATP-ADP transphosphorylation catalyzed by electric organ microsomes of Electrophorus. The first two reagents also cause the appearance of a sodium-dependent ATP-ADP transphosphorylation in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2. The sodium-dependent ATP-ADP transphosphorylation catalyzed by the NEM-treated microsomes has several features in common with the sodium-dependent ATP-ADP transphosphorylation catalyzed by the native microsomes (0.3 mm MgCl2). Both reactions specifically require adenosine nucleotides, sodium ions, and a divalent cation (preferably Mg++); both are inhibited by Ca++, ouabain, and K+, but not by oligomycin. With respect to the transphosphorylation, sodium increases the affinity of the microsomes for Mg++, while NEM treatment reduces it. The effects of NEM lend support to a multistep reaction scheme for the Na+-K+-ATPase and indicate that Na+ is required for the initial phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1505365655,"Purified α1-proteolytic inhibitor from human plasma was shown to inhibit trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and thrombin. This inhibitor is probably identical with the inhibitor previously known as serum trypsin inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin, or antiplasmin. The enzymes were affected by the inhibitor via two different mechanisms. Trypsin and chymotrypsin reacted instantaneously in stoichiometric manner, and the enzyme substrate had no effect on the reaction. The inhibition of plasmin and thrombin was time-dependent and of nonstoichiometric nature, and it was retarded by the presence of enzyme substrate. Even so, kinetic studies failed to show a competition reaction between the substrate and the inhibitor on a single site of the enzyme molecule. It is therefore suggested that the inhibition mechanism might be an enzymatic inactivation of the proteolytic enzymes concerned. This inactivation was irreversible in the sense that no enzymatic activity could be recovered after acid dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. It was shown by differential titration that the inhibitory activity of the inhibitor towards all four enzymes is due to a single molecular entity; this conclusion is also suggested by the high purity of the inhibitor preparation. On the basis of its stoichiometric combination with trypsin, the α1-proteolytic inhibitor was estimated to have a molecular weight of 47,000 and to comprise about 2% of plasma proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1504979389,"Abstract Sheep heart phosphofructokinase was extracted from a sedimentable fraction of homogenates after incubation with ATP and MgSO4. The extracted enzyme was fully active and soluble. The enzyme was purified by a procedure which involved ethanol fractionation, extraction from the ethanol fraction, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and ammonium sulfate fractionation. The final specific activity of the enzyme was 120 to 157. Enzyme recovery was about 55% of the enzyme activity in the original extract. The purified enzyme was crystallized. The crystals were hexagonal in shape and had approximately the same specific activity as the purified enzyme. Examination on starch gel electrophoresis showed that the enzyme moved as a diffuse patch with enzyme activity through the entire patch. Ultracentrifugal sedimentation analysis revealed the presence of either a schlieren pattern with a single asymmetrical peak or a pattern with a minor light peak and a major heavy peak. The value for s20,w varied from 22.5 to 50, according to the degree of poylmerization of the enzyme. The sedimentation coefficient as determined on the sucrose gradient was found to be concentration-dependent. The lowest value was s20,w 15.2. Sodium chloride (2 m) caused dissociation of the enzyme, accompanied by a decrease in its catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1633337670,"Abstract In the rat, kidney adenosine triphosphatase activity levels in the presence of sodium and potassium ((Na+ + K+)-ATPase) fall slowly after adrenalectomy, reaching a minimum on the 6th or 7th postoperative day. Kinetic data from kidney microsomal preparations indicate that this results from a decrease in enzyme levels rather than an alteration in the Km values for ATP, sodium, or potassium. The administration of aldosterone (10 µg) to adrenalectomized rats produced no detectable changes in kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase levels after 3 hours, even though maximal sodium retention may be observed at that time. However, corticosterone, when given in doses equivalent to the adrenal output, brought the kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase levels of adrenalectomized rats back to normal in 2 to 3 days."
https://openalex.org/W1992184014,"Mitochondria from brown adipose tissue of cold-acclimated rats (6°C) oxidize α-ketoglutarate at a rate twice that of controls (26°C). In both groups, however, the phosphorus: oxygen ratio with α-ketoglutarate never exceeded unity, and it is essentially zero with either succinate or α-glycerophosphate. Adenosine triphosphatase activity of these mitochondria is very low and it is not stimulated by 2,4-dinitrophenol. In addition, both respiration and phosphorylation are unaffected by adenosine diphosphate, 2,4-dinitrophenol, bovine serum albumin, or glutathione. Endogenous respiration of tissue slices is not stimulated by 2-4-dinitrophenol. It is suggested that brown fat mitochondria are not capable of oxidative phosphorylation, but do phosphorylate at the substrate level. Since these findings provide an unusual example of electron transport by means of an energetically nonconservative pathway, their significance to thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue is particularly emphasized."

https://openalex.org/W1578501502,"Abstract Treatment of dilute suspensions of rat liver mitochondria with Fe2+ results in the formation of lipid peroxides, an extensive fall in turbidity, and the loss of 65% of the mitochondrial protein and 39% of the mitochondrial lipid into the suspending medium. These changes occur with little alteration in the number or size of the mitochondrial particles. The formation of mitochondrial membrane ghosts is suggested. Membrane ghosts prepared from mitochondrial by Fe2+-induced peroxidation are found to retain almost no pyridine nucleotides, 33% of the total flavin, 50% of the ubiquinone, and 66%, 60%, and 27%, respectively, of the cytochromes a, b, and c + c1 of the mitochondria. An additional 67% of the initial cytochrome c + c1 is recovered from the supernatant medium following removal of the membrane ghosts by centrifugation. The membrane ghosts rapidly oxidize succinate, glutamate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate in the presence of added nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and cytochrome c. They show an antimycin A-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity. Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation results in inactivation of all of the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, 80% of the 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, 36% of the malate dehydrogenase, and 23% of the succinate dehydrogenase. There is no loss of glutamate dehydrogenase activity. However, 96% of the glutamate dehydrogenase and 57% of the malate dehydrogenase are released into the soluble fraction. Membrane ghosts prepared with Fe2+ exhibit no respiratory control or coupled phosphorylation with any of the substrates tested. There is an active Mg2+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase which is not stimulated by the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol."
https://openalex.org/W1545128315,"The role of the oxidizing agent in the xanthine oxidase reaction has been evaluated. The long standing notion that oxygen normally functions only as an electron acceptor in the xanthine oxidase reaction has been confirmed. When molecular oxygen was the oxidizing agent and the reaction was carried out at pH 7.5, 18O was incorporated into uric acid from 18O-labeled water; no 18O was found in uric acid when xanthine was oxidized in an atmosphere of 18O2. However, at pH 8.9 there was a small amount of direct oxygen transfer from 18O2 into uric acid. In experiments in which nicotinamide N-oxide was used in place of O2, the N-oxide appeared to function to a large extent by direct transfer of oxygen. It acted as an electron acceptor as well. Xanthine oxidase catalyzed the transfer of 18O from nicotinamide 18ON-oxide to xanthine in the course of the formation of uric acid. 18O from 18O-labeled water was also incorporated into uric acid when nicotinamide N-oxide was used as the oxidant in the xanthine oxidase reaction. Essentially identical results were obtained with both milk and liver xanthine oxidases. The possibility was raised that heterocyclic N-oxides may be capable of acting as general biological oxygenating agents."

https://openalex.org/W1507964359,"Abstract A protein fraction that confers 1,2-bis-(2-dicarboxymethylaminoethoxy)ethane (EGTA) sensitivity on reconstituted actomyosin made with highly purified actin and myosin has been prepared from actin extracted from the acetone-dried muscle powder at 25–37°. This protein fraction had effects upon reconstituted actomyosin that, in the absence of Ca++-binding agents, resembled those of tropomyosin made by classical methods in that the Mg++-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity was inhibited during the clearing phase and enhanced after superprecipitation. Unlike tropomyosin made by classical methods, this protein fraction potentiated an inhibitory action of EGTA upon the Mg++-activated ATPase activity of reconstituted actomyosin. In the presence of Mg++ and the protein fraction, EGTA appeared to prevent activation of myosin ATPase by actin. The EGTA-sensitizing protein fraction, which sedimented as a single symmetrical peak in the ultracentrifuge, had a sedimentation coefficient of 2.66 S, a value similar to that of tropomyosin. The dependence of specific viscosity upon ionic strength was similar for both. However, the intrinsic viscosity of the protein fraction was less than that of tropomyosin, and amino acid analyses revealed several significant differences between the two. The relatively high contents of proline and phenylalanine found in the EGTA-sensitizing protein fraction indicate that a previously undescribed protein was present in addition to tropomyosin. It is possible that this additional protein material was responsible for sensitization of actomyosin to Ca++-binding agents, but the possibility remains that this action was produced by a native form of tropomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W1591584816,"Abstract The water-soluble proteinpolysaccharide of bovine nasal cartilage, called PPL, prevents sedimentation of freshly precipitating calcium phosphate below 1,000 x g but not above 10,000 x g. By a method recently described, PPL can be separated into several fractions of which the main ones are PPL-3 and PPL-5. PPL-5, but not PPL-3, resembles PPL in its capacity to inhibit calcium phosphate sedimentation. Precipitation of calcium phosphate in the presence of PPL can be used to separate it into three fractions: the first is associated with calcium phosphate sedimentable below 1,000 x g and resembles PPL-6; the second is associated with calcium phosphate sedimentable above 10,000 x g and resembles PPL-5; the third remains in the supernatant solution and is identical with PPL-3. Thus different fractions of PPL have widely different effects on calcium phosphate precipitation, and, conversely, calcium phosphate precipitation in the presence of PPL can separate it into different fractions. By the procedures described, an entity can be isolated containing 16% PPL-5 and 43% Ca3(PO4)2. Evidence is given which suggests that this may be a chemical compound. Adsorption of different forms of PPL to solid Ca3(PO4)2 seems to be nonspecific and not related to the effect described."

After the first incubation, the ATP inhibition of tumor P-fructokinase became immediate. This inhibition can be reversed by the addition of orthophosphate, AMP, or fructose-6-P prior to the addition of all the necessary components for assaying enzyme activity.

The enzymatic assay data show that both human plasminogen and human plasmin participate in an equimolar stoichiometric reaction with streptokinase. The data are thus in agreement with previously reported physicochemical evidence for such a reaction. Activator activity was shown to be maximal whereas plasmin activity was minimal in equimolar mixtures of streptokinase and human plasminogen or human plasmin. The general mechanism of plasminogen activation is discussed in the light of the present findings and an hypothesis implicating the streptokinase-human plasmin complex as a universal activator of plasminogens is presented.
