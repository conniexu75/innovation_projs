https://openalex.org/W2108927999,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive lung tumor subtype with poor prognosis. We sequenced 29 SCLC exomes, 2 genomes and 15 transcriptomes and found an extremely high mutation rate of 7.4±1 protein-changing mutations per million base pairs. Therefore, we conducted integrated analyses of the various data sets to identify pathogenetically relevant mutated genes. In all cases, we found evidence for inactivation of TP53 and RB1 and identified recurrent mutations in the CREBBP, EP300 and MLL genes that encode histone modifiers. Furthermore, we observed mutations in PTEN, SLIT2 and EPHA7, as well as focal amplifications of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase gene. Finally, we detected many of the alterations found in humans in SCLC tumors from Tp53 and Rb1 double knockout mice. Our study implicates histone modification as a major feature of SCLC, reveals potentially therapeutically tractable genomic alterations and provides a generalizable framework for the identification of biologically relevant genes in the context of high mutational background."
https://openalex.org/W2023171799,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an exceptionally aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Here, we obtained exome, transcriptome and copy-number alteration data from approximately 53 samples consisting of 36 primary human SCLC and normal tissue pairs and 17 matched SCLC and lymphoblastoid cell lines. We also obtained data for 4 primary tumors and 23 SCLC cell lines. We identified 22 significantly mutated genes in SCLC, including genes encoding kinases, G protein-coupled receptors and chromatin-modifying proteins. We found that several members of the SOX family of genes were mutated in SCLC. We also found SOX2 amplification in ∼27% of the samples. Suppression of SOX2 using shRNAs blocked proliferation of SOX2-amplified SCLC lines. RNA sequencing identified multiple fusion transcripts and a recurrent RLF-MYCL1 fusion. Silencing of MYCL1 in SCLC cell lines that had the RLF-MYCL1 fusion decreased cell proliferation. These data provide an in-depth view of the spectrum of genomic alterations in SCLC and identify several potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

Despite recent progress, knowledge of the composition of human protein complexes remains limited. To close this gap, we applied an integrative global proteomic profiling approach, based on chromatographic separation of cultured human cell extracts into more than one thousand biochemical fractions that were subsequently analyzed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry, to systematically identify a network of 13,993 high-confidence physical interactions among 3,006 stably associated soluble human proteins. Most of the 622 putative protein complexes we report are linked to core biological processes and encompass both candidate disease genes and unannotated proteins to inform on mechanism. Strikingly, whereas larger multiprotein assemblies tend to be more extensively annotated and evolutionarily conserved, human protein complexes with five or fewer subunits are far more likely to be functionally unannotated or restricted to vertebrates, suggesting more recent functional innovations.

Comprehensive characterization of the composition of multiprotein complexes in the subcellular compartments of model organisms like yeast, fly, worm, and bacteria have provided critical mechanistic insights into the global modular organization of conserved biological systems (Hartwell et al., 1999Hartwell L.H.

Cusick M.E. Barabási A.L. Interactome networks and human disease.Cell. 2011; 144: 986-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). How the ∼20,000 or so proteins encoded by the human genome are partitioned into heteromeric “protein machines” remains an important but elusive research question, however, as less than one-fifth of all predicted human open reading frames are currently annotated as encoding subunits of protein complexes in public curation databases (Ruepp et al., 2010Ruepp A. Waegele B. Lechner M. Brauner B. Dunger-Kaltenbach I. Fobo G. Frishman G. Montrone C. Mewes H.W. CORUM: the comprehensive resource of mammalian protein complexes—2009.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D497-D501Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the subunits of protein complexes typically give rise to similar phenotypes or, through genetic interaction, amplify the phenotypic effects of other alleles in functionally linked sets of genes. Identifying the membership of protein complexes, therefore, addresses a crucial layer in the hierarchical functional organization of biological systems that links the core biochemistry of a functioning cell to the general physiology of an organism and is fundamental to deciphering the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Although bioinformatics analyses have been used to predict evolutionarily conserved human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) on a large scale (Ramani et al., 2008Ramani A.K. Li Z. Hart G.T.

Affinity purification (AP) of tagged exogenous proteins coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS) is an effective method for isolating and characterizing the composition of stably associated human proteins in experiments ranging from dozens to hundreds of different “baits” (Behrends et al., 2010Behrends C.

Likewise, immunoprecipitation can be used to systematically isolate endogenous human protein complexes from human cell lines (Malovannaya et al., 2011Malovannaya A. Lanz R.B. Jung S.Y. Bulynko Y.

Nevertheless, the limited availability of high-quality antibodies or sequence-verified complementary DNA (cDNA) clones suitable for targeted protein complex enrichment precludes scale-up required for the unbiased assessment of the molecular association networks underlying human cells.

Conversely, although traditionally used to isolate discrete complexes with specific assayable biochemical properties (e.g., enzymatic activity), classical biochemical fractionation procedures have been used to resolve biological mixtures as a means of ascertaining the collective composition of human protein complexes present in certain subcellular compartments (Ramani et al., 2008Ramani A.K. Li Z. Hart G.T. Carlson M.W. Boutz D.R. Marcotte E.M. A map of human protein interactions derived from co-expression of human mRNAs and their orthologs.Mol. Syst.

LC-MS/MS as an alternative for SDS-PAGE in blue native analysis of protein complexes.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, we have combined extensive, scaled-up biochemical fractionation with in-depth, quantitative mass spectrometric profiling and stringent computational filtering to resolve and identify endogenous, soluble, stably associated human protein complexes present in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts generated from cultured cells. Although the resulting reconstructed high-quality physical interaction network shows strong overlap with existing curated and experimentally derived sets of annotated protein complexes, it contains many predicted subunits and previously unreported complexes with specific functional, evolutionary, and disease-related biological attributes. To our knowledge, this resource represents the largest experimentally derived catalog to date of human protein complexes from cell culture, measured using a single standardized assay, and a reliable first draft reference of the basic physical wiring diagram of a human cell. To isolate human protein complexes in a sensitive and unbiased manner, we subjected cytoplasmic and nuclear soluble protein extracts isolated from human HeLa S3 and HEK293 cells grown as suspension and adherent cultures, respectively, to extensive complementary biochemical fractionation procedures. These two widely studied laboratory cell lines have been used as models of human cell biology for many decades (Graham et al., 1977Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. Characteristics of a human cell line transformed by DNA from human adenovirus type 5.J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3504) Google Scholar; Masters, 2002Masters J.R. HeLa cells 50 years on: the good, the bad and the ugly.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), providing a rich biological context for interpreting the resulting proteomic data. Stably interacting proteins that cofractionated together were identified subsequently by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We optimized our entire experimental pipeline, illustrated schematically in Figure 1A, by using a multipronged strategy to minimize two major confounding issues: limited dynamic range (i.e., preferential detection of high-abundance components) and “chance” coelution (i.e., cofractionation of functionally unrelated proteins). To address the former concern, we performed extremely deep biochemical fractionations by employing multiple orthogonal separation techniques to better resolve distinct protein complexes. As a primary separation technique, we employed nondenaturing high-performance multibed ion exchange chromatography (IEX-HPLC) by using four different empirically optimized analytical column combinations (see Experimental Procedures) and shallow salt gradients unlikely to perturb nonionic protein associations (Havugimana et al., 2007Havugimana P.C. Wong P. Emili A. Improved proteomic discovery by sample pre-fractionation using dual-column ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2007; 847: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In parallel, we applied complementary sucrose gradient centrifugation and isoelectric focusing technologies to capture salt-sensitive protein assemblies. In total, we collected 1,163 different fractions in a total of eight nuclear and five cytosolic extract fractionation experiments (for details see Table S1 available online), which were each subjected to label-free shotgun sequencing (duplicate LC-MS/MS analyses) using highly sensitive ion trap-based mass spectrometers (see Experimental Procedures). We identified 5,584 distinct human proteins (Figure 1C; estimated theoretical false discovery rate of 1% at both the protein and peptide levels based on a statistical model [Kislinger et al., 2003Kislinger T. Rahman K. Radulovic D. Cox B. Rossant J. Emili A. PRISM, a generic large scale proteomic investigation strategy for mammals.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar]; see Experimental Procedures for details). Despite the underrepresentation of membrane proteins in the starting cell extracts, this coverage encompasses about half of the experimentally verified human proteome (Figure S1B) (Nagaraj et al., 2011Nagaraj N. Wisniewski J.R. Geiger T. Cox J. Kircher M. Kelso J. Pääbo S. Mann M. Deep proteome and transcriptome mapping of a human cancer cell line.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 548Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This included 989 proteins detected exclusively in nuclear fractions (of which 376 were annotated transcription or chromatin-related factors) and 1,006 with links to human disease (e.g., annotated in a public database like OMIM). Only 1,632 (29%) of the identified proteins had biochemical annotations as subunits of previously reported protein complexes (corresponding to 64% of all existing human protein entries) in the CORUM curation database (Figure S1C; Ruepp et al., 2010Ruepp A. Waegele B. Lechner M. Brauner B. Dunger-Kaltenbach I. Fobo G. Frishman G. Montrone C. Mewes H.W. CORUM: the comprehensive resource of mammalian protein complexes—2009.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D497-D501Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Due to the extensive fractionation, we observed minimal bias in terms of protein abundance beyond that reported for previously annotated complexes or the experimentally defined human proteome (Figure 1D). Next, to minimize the possibility of chance coelution, rather than simply identifying the proteins present in each fraction, we quantified variation in protein abundance based on the observed patterns of spectral counts recorded across all of the collected fractions to determine the extent to which pairs of proteins coeluted. As shown in Figure 1B, these experimental profiles were highly reproducible (i.e., average Spearman rank correlation coefficients >80% between replicate experiments; Figure S2), even using alternate methods of mass spectrometric quantification (i.e., extracted MS1 peak intensities were largely consistent with spectral counting; Figure S2D). To objectively evaluate the biochemical data, we calculated a stringent summary statistic, termed the coapex score, for each pair of proteins identified by LC-MS/MS by determining the number of fractionation experiments in which the proteins showed maximum (modal) abundance in the same exact peak fraction. To assess the effectiveness of our cofractionation approach, we performed an initial validation by examining the coelution profiles and coapex scores obtained for a reference set of 20 well-known human protein complexes reported in CORUM. As illustrated by the representative HeLa nuclear extract IEX-HPLC profiles shown in Figure 1B, the subunits of these complexes typically coeluted in the same biochemical fractions. Of the 155 components detected by mass spectrometry, most (85%; 499/585) of the detected subunit pairs of the reference complexes had high coapex similarity scores (i.e., coeluted together in at least two or more experiments), validating the overall efficacy of the fractionation procedures we used to isolate native protein complexes and the general correctness of the protein identification and quantification pipeline. Despite the consistency in coelution of annotated complex members, certain functionally distinct complexes occasionally exhibited overlapping chromatographic elution profiles (e.g., splicing factor 3b and Coatomer complexes; Figure 2A), presenting a potential source of spurious interactions. Although this artifact was minimized to a certain degree by performing multiple independent fractionation experiments, we used an integrative computational approach to further improve deconvolution (Figure 2B). Because physically interacting cocomplexed proteins often perform related biological functions (Alberts, 1998Alberts B. The cell as a collection of protein machines: preparing the next generation of molecular biologists.Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) and are often evolutionarily coconserved (Hartwell et al., 1999Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. From molecular to modular cell biology.Nature. 1999; 402: C47-C52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2780) Google Scholar), we devised a machine learning procedure (Figure 2B; see Experimental Procedures for details) to score and select higher-confidence physical interactions based on both the experimentally measured coelution profiles and the existence of additional supporting functional association evidence inferred from correlated evolutionary rates (Tillier and Charlebois, 2009Tillier E.R. Charlebois R.L. The human protein coevolution network.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1861-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and functional genomics data sets compiled for H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans (see Table S6 for details). First, for each of the 13 fractionation experiments, we calculated correlation measures between all possible pairs of proteins to capture their tendency to coelute. In addition to the coapex summary statistic, to account for mass spectrometry sampling error, we devised a weighted cross-correlation function to account for slight variation in the protein profiles measured in each experiment. To account for low spectral values, we also generated a Poisson noise model before calculating Pearson correlation scores, deeming the coelution profiles of protein pairs measured with low spectral counts as less predictive of genuine physical interactions (Figure S5). Only protein pairs with a correlation score of at least 0.5 by at least one of these measures in one or more experiments were considered for further analysis, reducing the total number of pairs from over 15 million initially to the roughly 800,000 pairs with reasonable biochemical evidence. To improve the assignment of interaction probabilities, we also exploited the predictive power of correlated protein evolutionary rates (Tillier and Charlebois, 2009Tillier E.R. Charlebois R.L. The human protein coevolution network.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1861-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), messenger RNA (mRNA) coexpression, and domain co-occurrence and, via orthology, fly protein-protein interactions (based on binary yeast two-hybrid assay studies) and extensive physical and functional associations reported previously for yeast and worm (see Experimental Procedures) (Lee et al., 2011Lee I. Blom U.M. Wang P.I. Shim J.E. Marcotte E.M. Prioritizing candidate disease genes by network-based boosting of genome-wide association data.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The discriminatory power of the procedure was further improved by penalizing those interactions that lacked independent supporting evidence—and that were thus more likely to correspond to cases of “chance” coelution—by integrating evidence from these functional association data (Figure 2B). A feature selection algorithm was used to select the most informative data sets (Table S2) in addition to the biochemical correlation scores, and the resulting features were used to estimate the probability of interaction to protein pairs using a cross-validated random forest classifier. For training, we used the CORUM curated set of human protein complexes as our base reference, filtered for those complexes annotated as having been observed by biochemical methods. As many CORUM complexes are highly overlapping due to redundancy in existing annotations, we combined complexes sharing subunits (Simpson coefficient >0.5 between complexes). We used half of the resulting 324 nonredundant reference complexes (Table S3) as the training set for cocomplex probability prediction, defining gold standard positive interactions as pairs of proteins in the same complex and inferring gold standard negatives between proteins in different complexes. (The other half of the reference complexes was withheld for subsequent use as an independent training set for cluster optimization, as described below.) Although the biochemical data were a prerequisite for scoring, the performance curves shown in Figure 2C indicate that the inclusion of the additional functional genomic information substantially increased recall at the same level of precision compared to classifiers based on the profiling data alone. Moreover, the integration of this additional supporting functional evidence removed the bulk of spurious, intercomplex interactions (Figure 2D). Another advantage of our bioinformatic pipeline is that the results of the feature selection algorithm (Table S2) can be explored to examine the impact of each data set. For example, we find generally that sets of smaller biochemical fractionations using different separation techniques, although individually yielding a higher PPI false discovery rate, collectively provided more information on protein complex composition than deeper fractionations using a single separation method. As an alternate measure of reliability, we compared our scored human protein interactions to a recently reported network of Drosophila cocomplex protein interactions (Guruharsha et al., 2011Guruharsha K.G. Rual J.F. Zhai B. Mintseris J. Vaidya P. Vaidya N. Beekman C. Wong C. Rhee D.Y. Cenaj O. et al.A protein complex network of Drosophila melanogaster.Cell. 2011; 147: 690-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), which had not been used for building the classifier. Strikingly, despite using vastly different experimental methods and scoring schemes, we observed a remarkably good overall correlation (Spearman r = 0.40; n = 11,675 orthologs mapped using Inparanoid). Even after removing interactions supported by alternate Drosophila data, high-scoring fly pairs matched high-scoring pairs in our analysis and were strongly enriched for reference-positive cocomplex members (Figure 2E). Finally, in order to remove any remaining false positive interactions, we further denoised our cocomplex data set by pruning loosely connected interactions using a computational diffusion procedure calibrated by protein colocalization semantic similarity scores (Pesquita et al., 2009Pesquita C. Faria D. Falcão A.O. Lord P. Couto F.M. Semantic similarity in biomedical ontologies.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000443Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar; Yang et al., 2012Yang H. Nepusz T. Paccanaro A. Improving GO semantic similarity measures by exploring the ontology beneath the terms and modelling uncertainty.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to enforce local network topologies more consistent with annotated complexes from the withheld portion of the reference Corum complexes (see Experimental Procedures). Benchmark precision and recall versus the holdout set of known reference complexes (Figure 2F) were significantly higher than those reported for a smaller, recently published set of affinity-purified human protein complexes (Hutchins et al., 2010Hutchins J.R. Toyoda Y. Hegemann B. Poser I. Hériché J.K. Sykora M.M. Augsburg M. Hudecz O. Buschhorn B.A. Bulkescher J. et al.Systematic analysis of human protein complexes identifies chromosome segregation proteins.Science. 2010; 328: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), validating the reliability of our scoring procedure. Applying a PPI score threshold of 0.75, which corresponds to an estimated false discovery rate of 21.5% (i.e., well below the ∼40% reported for AP/MS-based analyses of protein complexes in model organisms [Gavin et al., 2006Gavin A.C. Aloy P. Grandi P. Krause R. Boesche M. Marzioch M. Rau C. Jensen L.J. Bastuck S.

Beltran-Alvarez P. et al.Proteome organization in a genome-reduced bacterium.Science. 2009; 326: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar]), we thus derived a high-confidence set of 13,993 cocomplex interactions among 3,006 unique human proteins (Table S2), most of which (8,691 PPI) have not been reported before (i.e., are not publicly annotated). It is worth reiterating that all of these physical interactions were directly supported by the experimental biochemical cofractionation data; the addition of functional data and denoising served only to flag candidates lacking either functional support or topological support within the network (Table S2). The interaction probability scores may be underestimated, however, because the reference “gold standards” used for learning are imperfect (Jansen and Gerstein, 2004Jansen R. Gerstein M.

Microbiol. 2004; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2096237314,"HSP90 is a molecular chaperone that associates with numerous substrate proteins called clients. It plays many important roles in human biology and medicine, but determinants of client recognition by HSP90 have remained frustratingly elusive. We systematically and quantitatively surveyed most human kinases, transcription factors, and E3 ligases for interaction with HSP90 and its cochaperone CDC37. Unexpectedly, many more kinases than transcription factors bound HSP90. CDC37 interacted with kinases, but not with transcription factors or E3 ligases. HSP90::kinase interactions varied continuously over a 100-fold range and provided a platform to study client protein recognition. In wild-type clients, HSP90 did not bind particular sequence motifs, but rather associated with intrinsically unstable kinases. Stabilization of the kinase in either its active or inactive conformation with diverse small molecules decreased HSP90 association. Our results establish HSP90 client recognition as a combinatorial process: CDC37 provides recognition of the kinase family, whereas thermodynamic parameters determine client binding within the family."
https://openalex.org/W2033160626,"The factors that sequester transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery are currently unknown. In a genome-wide RNAi screen, we found that depletion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase reduces histone methylation globally and causes derepression and release of heterochromatin from the nuclear periphery in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Analysis of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) showed that elimination of two HMTs, MET-2 and SET-25, mimics the loss of SAM synthetase, abrogating the perinuclear attachment of heterochromatic transgenes and of native chromosomal arms rich in histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. The two HMTs target H3K9 in a consecutive fashion: MET-2, a SETDB1 homolog, mediates mono- and dimethylation, and SET-25, a previously uncharacterized HMT, deposits H3K9me3. SET-25 colocalizes with its own product in perinuclear foci, in a manner dependent on H3K9me3, but not on its catalytic domain. This colocalization suggests an autonomous, self-reinforcing mechanism for the establishment and propagation of repeat-rich heterochromatin."

This work shows that adult htNSCs are multipotent and predominantly present in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice. Chronic high-fat-diet feeding led to not only depletion but also neurogenic impairment of htNSCs associated with IKKβ/NF-κB activation. In vitro htNSC models demonstrated that their survival and neurogenesis markedly decreased on IKKβ/NF-κB activation but increased on IKKβ/NF-κB inhibition, mechanistically mediated by IKKβ/NF-κB-controlled apoptosis and Notch signalling. Mouse studies revealed that htNSC-specific IKKβ/NF-κB activation led to depletion and impaired neuronal differentiation of htNSCs, and ultimately the development of obesity and pre-diabetes. In conclusion, adult htNSCs are important for the central regulation of metabolic physiology, and IKKβ/NF-κB-mediated impairment of adult htNSCs is a critical neurodegenerative mechanism for obesity and related diabetes. Cai and colleagues show that the function of adult hypothalamic neural stem cells in mice is impaired following NF-κB activation associated with a chronic high-fat diet, resulting in development of obesity and neurodegenerative features. Mechanistically, NF-κB affects both Notch signalling and apoptosis in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2137172397,"The hippocampus is essential for encoding self-experienced events into memory. During sleep, neural activity in the hippocampus related to a recent experience has been observed to spontaneously reoccur, and this 'replay' has been postulated to be important for memory consolidation. Task-related cues can enhance memory consolidation when presented during a post-training sleep session, and, if memories are consolidated by hippocampal replay, a specific enhancement for this replay should be observed. To test this, we trained rats on an auditory-spatial association task while recording from neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus. We found that, during sleep, a task-related auditory cue biased reactivation events toward replaying the spatial memory associated with that cue. These results indicate that sleep replay can be manipulated by external stimulation and provide further evidence for the role of hippocampal replay in memory consolidation."

Although the Suv39h methyltransferases (KMTs) are known to ensure pericentric H3K9me3 methylation, the mechanisms that initiate and maintain mammalian heterochromatin organization remain elusive. We developed a biochemical assay and used in vivo analyses in mouse embryonic fibroblasts to identify Prdm3 and Prdm16 as redundant H3K9me1-specific KMTs that direct cytoplasmic H3K9me1 methylation. The H3K9me1 is converted in the nucleus to H3K9me3 by the Suv39h enzymes to reinforce heterochromatin. Simultaneous depletion of Prdm3 and Prdm16 abrogates H3K9me1 methylation, prevents Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3 trimethylation, and derepresses major satellite transcription.

In mouse fibroblasts, pericentric heterochromatin clusters into distinct heterochromatic foci, which can be visualized by DAPI-staining of the underlying A/T-rich satellite repeats. In addition to this characteristic concentration into heterochromatic foci, a biochemical pathway for the Suv39h enzymes to induce H3K9me3 and binding of HP1 is a hallmark for mammalian heterochromatin (Bannister et al., 2001Bannister A.J.

Loss of the Suv39h KMTs significantly impairs heterochromatic modification patterns and results in reduction of H3K9me3 to H3K9me1 but allows preservation of heterochromatin organization within DAPI-dense foci (Peters et al., 2003Peters A.H.

These data indicate that other mechanisms, such as H3K9me1, initiate and precede Suv39h function at pericentric heterochromatin. Several additional enzymes participate in heterochromatin formation (e.g., Hdac1, Eset/Setdb1, Suv4-20h, and Dnmt3a/b; for review see Fodor et al., 2010Fodor B.D. Shukeir N. Reuter G. Jenuwein T.

These data expose an important function for histone monomethylation and suggest two-step pathways for the establishment of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 that require pre-existing H3K9me1 and H4K20me1. Monomethylating KMTs appear to be essential enzymes because their loss-of-function is embryonic lethal and defies cell viability. For example, knockout of the H4K20 monomethylase Pr-Set7 blocks development of mouse embryos prior to the eight cell stage (Oda et al., 2009Oda H. Okamoto I. Murphy N. Chu J. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Torres-Padilla M.E. Heard E. Reinberg D. Monomethylation of histone H4-lysine 20 is involved in chromosome structure and stability and is essential for mouse development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2278-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Also, loss of Eset results in early embryonic lethality starting at day E3.5 (Dodge et al., 2004Dodge J.E. Kang Y.K. Beppu H. Lei H. Li E. Histone H3-K9 methyltransferase ESET is essential for early development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2478-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Importantly, this enzyme can convert unmodified substrates to a monomethyl state but also acts progressively toward the generation of H3K9me3 (Loyola et al., 2009Loyola A. Tagami H. Bonaldi T. Roche D. Quivy J.P. Imhof A. Nakatani Y. Dent S.Y. Almouzni G.

This is prominent for H3K9me1 (and H3K9me2) because most of the other histone methylation marks cannot be detected in nonnucleosomal histones (Loyola et al., 2006Loyola A. Bonaldi T. Roche D.

We used a biochemical assay to identify enzymes that will convert an unmodified histone peptide to the H3K9me1 state and be inactive toward a H3K9me1 substrate. This analysis discovered Prdm3 and Prdm16 as H3K9me1-specific KMTs. The mammalian Prdm/PRDM family of SET domain enzymes consists of 17 members and is characterized by the combination of a PR-SET domain with a variable number of Zn-fingers (Fumasoni et al., 2007Fumasoni I.

Although these functions for Prdm3 and Prdm16 are well documented, no role in heterochromatin formation has been evident. This is probably because their gene function could be redundant, as has often been the case for mammalian heterochromatin components. Similar observations have been made for Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 (Peters et al., 2001Peters A.H. O’Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schöfer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M.

Published online September 16, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2382Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Based on the biochemical definition of Prdm3 and Prdm16 as H3K9me1 KMTs, we analyzed their contribution to mammalian heterochromatin formation by simultaneously depleting Prdm3 and Prdm16 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that Prdm3 and Prdm16 initiate heterochromatin formation by inducing cytoplasmic H3K9me1, which is then converted in the nucleus by the Suv39h enzymes to H3K9me3. Most notably, Prdm3 and Prdm16 are also required to maintain the subnuclear organization of mammalian heterochromatin because their impaired function dissolves DAPI-dense foci and unstructures the nuclear lamina. Our work thus discovers Prdm3 and Prdm16 as H3K9me1-specific enzymes in a sequential pathway that defines heterochromatic H3K9 methyl marks. In addition, it exposes a functional framework in which the anchoring to the nuclear lamina appears as an important mechanism to protect the integrity of mammalian heterochromatin. To develop a biochemical assay that would allow the identification of specific H3K9me1 KMTs, we first analyzed the distribution of H3K9 methylation in different cellular compartments. For this, histones were acid-extracted from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and subsequently probed with antibodies directed against unmodified histone H3, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3. In HeLa cells all H3K9 methylation states are present in the nucleus, but in the cytoplasm only H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 are detected (Figure 1A), which is in line with previous reports (Loyola et al., 2006Loyola A. Bonaldi T. Roche D. Imhof A. Almouzni G. PTMs on H3 variants before chromatin assembly potentiate their final epigenetic state.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 309-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although wild-type (WT) immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) display the same distribution as human cells, Suv39h double null (Suv39h dn) iMEFs are depleted for nuclear H3K9me3 (Figure 1A). This experiment confirmed that H3K9me1 occurs in the cytoplasm and nucleus of human and mouse cells and suggests that the responsible enzyme(s) might reside in both cellular compartments. We next performed in vitro methyltransferase assays with cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. The radioactive methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is efficiently transferred onto recombinant histone H3 in both extracts (Figure 1B). However, full-length histone H3 as a substrate does not allow discrimination between different methylation sites or methylation states. Therefore, we used histone peptides spanning the H3K9 position, either unmodified or monomethylated at lysine 9. A longer H3K9 peptide (amino acid [aa] 1–20) is again methylated in both extracts independently of its H3K9 methylation status. We next tried a very short peptide containing aa 6–11 (TARKST-2b), where lysine 9 is the only lysine in this substrate. These peptides were synthesized as branched molecules and present two linear aa sequences that are covalently linked by a C-terminal cysteine (so called two-branched, or 2b, peptides) (Peters et al., 2003Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O’Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. et al.Partitioning and plasticity of repressive histone methylation states in mammalian chromatin.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1577-1589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Strong and comparable enzymatic activities toward the unmodified TARKST-2b, but not toward the TARK(me1)ST-2b, peptide were observed in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (Figure 1B). For the initial purification, we decided to focus on cytoplasmic fractions because we detected substantial amounts of this modification in the cytoplasm (Figure 1A) and because H3K9me1 has been described as a prominent modification of nonnucleosomal histones (Loyola et al., 2006Loyola A. Bonaldi T. Roche D. Imhof A. Almouzni G. PTMs on H3 variants before chromatin assembly potentiate their final epigenetic state.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 309-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To identify H3K9me1-specific KMT(s), HeLa S100 extracts were subjected to a series of chromatography columns (detailed purification scheme in Figure 1C) and the H3K9me1 activity in the eluted fractions was monitored via radioactive KMT assays by using the short TARKST-2b and TARK(me1)ST-2b peptides as substrates (Figure 1E). After the last gel filtration column, odd-numbered fractions were used in KMT assays (Figure 1E), and their protein content was visualized on silver-stained SDS gels (Figure 1D). Fractions 19 through 39 displayed the activity profile of a specific H3K9 mono-KMT: active on the unmodified, but inactive on the TARK(me1)ST-2b peptide (Figure 1E). After resolution on a silver-gel, we observed two distinct banding patterns: in fractions 19–25 there was hardly any bands visible, whereas fractions 27–39 contained up to 4 prominent bands. To not exclude any enzymes, we used one representative fraction of the remaining even-numbered fractions (24 and 30) for in-solution digests and mass spectrometry (MS)-based protein identification. Analysis of sequenced peptides identified ∼500 proteins within these two fractions, including 32 proteins with a described chromatin connection (for a detailed listing see Table S1 available online). Next to DNA replication complexes, nuclear transport factors, and protein chaperones, there were also several enzymes such as acetyltransferases/deacetylases and methyltransferases/demethylases. Most notably, four (i.e., PRDM16, ESET/SETDB1, SETD5, and ASH1L) of the identified proteins contain the conspicuous SET domain, the hallmark of most KMTs (Figure 2A), and therefore represented strong candidates for H3K9me1 KMTs. In addition, we also noticed the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as a prominent hit among the identified peptide fragments. Because PRMT5 has been described to modify histone H3 on arginine 8 (H3R8) (Pal et al., 2004Pal S. Vishwanath S.N. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sif S. Human SWI/SNF-associated PRMT5 methylates histone H3 arginine 8 and negatively regulates expression of ST7 and NM23 tumor suppressor genes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9630-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), our assay design using the short H3 peptides (aa 6–11) might also select for such an activity. Although this is indeed the case (Figure S1A), our subsequent analysis using Prmt5 knockdown in iMEFs did not indicate a role for this enzyme in heterochromatin formation (Figure S1B). For the subsequent study, we focused our analysis on the mouse orthologs of the four identified SET domain proteins, PRDM16, ESET, ASH1L, and SETD5. Although Eset has been previously reported to mediate H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 (Loyola et al., 2009Loyola A. Tagami H. Bonaldi T. Roche D. Quivy J.P. Imhof A. Nakatani Y. Dent S.Y. Almouzni G.

To examine the activity and specificity of these potential H3K9me1 KMTs, bacterially or baculovirus expressed proteins were incubated with recombinant H3 and cold SAM, and the induced methylation status was probed with modification-specific antibodies against H3K9 and H3K27 methylation. Due to its close homology with Prdm16 (domain structure in Figure 2A, 54% identity in the amino acid sequence), we also included Prdm3 in this analysis. All examined proteins display specificity toward the H3K9 position and do not methylate H3K27 (Figure 2B), even though these two lysines reside in a very similar sequence context (ARKS motif). Prdm3, Prdm16, Setd5, and Ash1L act as H3K9me1 mono-KMTs in this assay because they induce H3K9me1 but do not generate H3K9me3. In line with previous reports (Loyola et al., 2009Loyola A. Tagami H. Bonaldi T. Roche D. Quivy J.P. Imhof A. Nakatani Y. Dent S.Y. Almouzni G.

Because Ash1L exhibited only very weak activity toward H3K9me1 and had been described to be involved in active transcription (Gregory et al., 2007Gregory G.D. Vakoc C.R. Rozovskaia T. Zheng X. Patel S. Nakamura T. Canaani E. Blobel G.A. Mammalian ASH1L is a histone methyltransferase that occupies the transcribed region of active genes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8466-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and Setd5 knockdown in iMEFs did not affect heterochromatin integrity (data not shown), we decided to focus our further analysis on Prdm3 and Prdm16 as H3K9me1 KMTs. We next sought to validate the specificity of Prdm3 and Prdm16 toward H3K9me1 by an antibody-independent method. For this, the reaction products of short linear H3 (aa 6–11) peptides that had been incubated with recombinant Prdm3 or Prdm16 were analyzed by MS. When an unmodified peptide was used as substrate, Prdm3 and Prdm16 exclusively generate monomethylation, with conversion rates ranging from 15.6% for Prdm16 to 20.9% for Prdm3 (Figure 2C). The observed shift in the corresponding mass spectra confirms the addition of only one methyl-group (Figure 2C). The subsequent MS/MS analysis proved that it is lysine 9 that is methylated (see Table S2). Importantly, the H3K9me1 peptide cannot be used as a substrate by the Prdm3 or Prdm16 enzymes (Figure 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Prdm3 and Prdm16 act as H3K9me1-specific KMTs in vitro. To address the role of Prdm 3 and Prdm16 for H3K9me1 in vivo, we generated lentiviral shRNA constructs to knock down their expression in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs). As a control, we also included the previously described Eset/Setdb1 in this analysis. Multiple sequences for each mRNA sequence were screened, and the most effective shRNA was chosen for virus production (Figure S2). Interestingly, one of the shRNAs designed for Prdm16 also targeted Prdm3, thereby allowing for an effective double knockdown using a single shRNA construct (sh16/3; Figures S2B and S2C). We first performed knockdowns in WT iMEFs, which display an accumulation of H3K9me3 at DAPI-dense foci and a broad nuclear staining of H3K9me1. Time points were taken at day 3, 6, and 12 after infection and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) with H3K9 methyl antibodies was carried out. Single knockdown of Eset, Prdm3, or Prdm16 did not result in a detectable alteration as compared to control cells (scrambled shRNA) (Figure 3A). By contrast, double knockdown of Prdm3 and Prdm16 abolished the pericentric localization of H3K9me3 in more than 50% of the cells (Figure 3A).Figure 3Simultaneous Depletion of Prdm3 and Prdm16 Abrogates Pericentric H3K9me3 and H3K9me1Show full caption(A) Immunofluorescence analysis for H3K9me3 in WT iMEFs upon shRNA mediated knockdown of Eset, Prdm3, Prdm16, and double knockdown of Prdm3/Prdm16.

We next infected Suv39h dn iMEFs with the lentiviral shRNA constructs. In Suv39h dn cells, H3K9me3 is lost from DAPI-dense foci, which instead accumulate H3K9me1 (Peters et al., 2003Peters A.H.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1577-1589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). Therefore, these cells provide an ideal resource to directly examine dependence of pericentric H3K9me1 on Prdm3, Prdm16, or Eset enzymes. IF analysis with H3K9me1-specific antibodies revealed that simultaneous depletion of Prdm3 and Prdm16 significantly disperses pericentric H3K9me1 (ranging from 70% of cells at day 3 to 94% of cells at day 12), whereas single knockdowns of Prdm3 and Prdm16 have no effect (Figure 3B). Depletion of Eset in Suv39h dn iMEFs also interferes with pericentric H3K9me1 accumulation because only 50%–33% of the cells maintain a focal enrichment for H3K9me1 (Figure 3B). This result indicates that Eset contributes to H3K9me1 at pericentric heterochromatin in Suv39h dn cells. Importantly, our data reveal that Prdm3 and Prdm16 are redundant H3K9me1 KMTs and specify a sequential pathway, in which Prdm3/Prdm16-dependent H3K9me1 is important for the subsequent conversion to H3K9me3 at pericentric heterochromatin by the Suv39h enzymes. In addition to the H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 marks, we also examined other histone modifications (H3K27me1 and H4K20me3), DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5-meC) and chromatin-associ"
https://openalex.org/W2016912614,"Among bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, to date no antitoxin has been identified that functions by cleaving toxin mRNA. Here we show that YjdO (renamed GhoT) is a membrane lytic peptide that causes ghost cell formation (lysed cells with damaged membranes) and increases persistence (persister cells are tolerant to antibiotics without undergoing genetic change). GhoT is part of a new toxin-antitoxin system with YjdK (renamed GhoS) because in vitro RNA degradation studies, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR and whole-transcriptome studies revealed that GhoS masks GhoT toxicity by cleaving specifically yjdO (ghoT) mRNA. Alanine substitutions showed that Arg28 is important for GhoS activity, and RNA sequencing indicated that the GhoS cleavage site is rich in U and A. The NMR structure of GhoS indicates it is related to the CRISPR-associated-2 RNase, and GhoS is a monomer. Hence, GhoT-GhoS is to our knowledge the first type V toxin-antitoxin system where a protein antitoxin inhibits the toxin by cleaving specifically its mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2123735783,"We investigated whether ancestral liver damage leads to heritable reprogramming of hepatic wound healing in male rats. We found that a history of liver damage corresponds with transmission of an epigenetic suppressive adaptation of the fibrogenic component of wound healing to the male F1 and F2 generations. Underlying this adaptation was less generation of liver myofibroblasts, higher hepatic expression of the antifibrogenic factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and lower expression of the profibrogenic factor transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) compared to rats without this adaptation. Remodeling of DNA methylation and histone acetylation underpinned these alterations in gene expression. Sperm from rats with liver fibrosis were enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z and trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3) at PPAR-γ chromatin. These modifications to the sperm chromatin were transmittable by adaptive serum transfer from fibrotic rats to naive rats and similar modifications were induced in mesenchymal stem cells exposed to conditioned media from cultured rat or human myofibroblasts. Thus, it is probable that a myofibroblast-secreted soluble factor stimulates heritable epigenetic signatures in sperm so that the resulting offspring better adapt to future fibrogenic hepatic insults. Adding possible relevance to humans, we found that people with mild liver fibrosis have hypomethylation of the PPARG promoter compared to others with severe fibrosis."

Silencing mutant HTT using nucleic acids would eliminate the root cause of HD. Developing nucleic acid drugs is challenging, and an ideal clinical approach to gene silencing would combine the simplicity of single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides with the efficiency of RNAi. Here, we describe RNAi by single-stranded siRNAs (ss-siRNAs). ss-siRNAs are potent (>100-fold more than unmodified RNA) and allele-selective (>30-fold) inhibitors of mutant HTT expression in cells derived from HD patients. Strategic placement of mismatched bases mimics micro-RNA recognition and optimizes discrimination between mutant and wild-type alleles. ss-siRNAs require Argonaute protein and function through the RNAi pathway. Intraventricular infusion of ss-siRNA produced selective silencing of the mutant HTT allele throughout the brain in a mouse HD model. These data demonstrate that chemically modified ss-siRNAs function through the RNAi pathway and provide allele-selective compounds for clinical development."

The risk variants are located near the HACE1 and LIN28B genes, both of which show altered expression in advanced neuroblastomas. Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all pediatric oncology deaths1. Here, we report a genome-wide association study of 2,817 neuroblastoma cases and 7,473 controls. We identified two new associations at 6q16, the first within HACE1 (rs4336470; combined P = 2.7 × 10−11; odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18–1.35) and the second within LIN28B (rs17065417; combined P = 1.2 × 10−8; odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.23–1.54). Expression of LIN28B and let-7 miRNA correlated with rs17065417 genotype in neuroblastoma cell lines, and we observed significant growth inhibition upon depletion of LIN28B, specifically in neuroblastoma cells that were homozygous for the risk allele. Low HACE1 and high LIN28B expression in diagnostic primary neuroblastomas were associated with worse overall survival (P = 0.008 and 0.014, respectively). Taken together, these data show that common variants in HACE1 and LIN28B influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and indicate that both genes likely have a role in disease progression."

If potent single-stranded RNAs could be identified, they would provide a simpler path to pharmacological agents. Here, we describe single-stranded siRNAs (ss-siRNAs) that silence gene expression in animals absent lipid formulation. Effective ss-siRNAs were identified by iterative design by determining structure-activity relationships correlating chemically modified single strands and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) activities, potency in cells, nuclease stability, and pharmacokinetics. We find that the passenger strand is not necessary for potent gene silencing. The guide-strand activity requires AGO2, demonstrating action through the RNAi pathway. ss-siRNA action requires a 5′ phosphate to achieve activity in vivo, and we developed a metabolically stable 5′-(E)-vinylphosphonate (5′-VP) with conformation and sterioelectronic properties similar to the natural phosphate. Identification of potent ss-siRNAs offers an additional option for RNAi therapeutics and an alternate perspective on RNAi mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1994529490,"The lissencephaly protein Lis1 has been reported to regulate the mechanical behavior of cytoplasmic dynein, the primary minus-end-directed microtubule motor. However, the regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we address this issue using purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a combination of techniques, including single-molecule imaging and single-particle electron microscopy. We show that rather than binding to the main ATPase site within dynein's AAA+ ring or its microtubule-binding stalk directly, Lis1 engages the interface between these elements. Lis1 causes individual dynein motors to remain attached to microtubules for extended periods, even during cycles of ATP hydrolysis that would canonically induce detachment. Thus, Lis1 operates like a ""clutch"" that prevents dynein's ATPase domain from transmitting a detachment signal to its track-binding domain. We discuss how these findings provide a conserved mechanism for dynein functions in living cells that require prolonged microtubule attachments."

Specific inactivation of Rab1 by VirA/EspG disrupts ER-to-Golgi trafficking. S. flexneri intracellular persistence requires VirA TBC-like GAP activity that mediates bacterial escape from autophagy-mediated host defense. Rab1 inactivation by EspG severely blocks host secretory pathway, resulting in inhibited interleukin-8 secretion from infected cells. Crystal structures of VirA/EspG-Rab1-GDP-aluminum fluoride complexes highlight TBC-like catalytic role for the arginine and glutamine finger residues and reveal a 3D architecture distinct from that of the TBC domain.

Mutant analysis of 42 genes shows that more than half of them contribute to auditory organ function, with phenotypes including hearing loss, auditory hypersusceptibility, and ringing ears.

https://openalex.org/W2129186628,"Despite the high inhibition of viral replication achieved by current anti-HIV drugs, many patients fail treatment, often with emergence of drug-resistant virus. Clinical observations show that the relationship between adherence and likelihood of resistance differs dramatically among drug classes. We developed a mathematical model that explains these observations and predicts treatment outcomes. Our model incorporates drug properties, fitness differences between susceptible and resistant strains, mutations and adherence. We show that antiviral activity falls quickly for drugs with sharp dose-response curves and short half-lives, such as boosted protease inhibitors, limiting the time during which resistance can be selected for. We find that poor adherence to such drugs causes treatment failure via growth of susceptible virus, explaining puzzling clinical observations. Furthermore, our model predicts that certain single-pill combination therapies can prevent resistance regardless of patient adherence. Our approach represents a first step for simulating clinical trials of untested anti-HIV regimens and may help in the selection of new drug regimens for investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1972325884,"Signal transduction typically begins by ligand-dependent activation of a concomitant partner that is otherwise in its resting state. However, in cases where signal activation is constitutive by default, the mechanism of regulation is unknown. The Arabidopsis thaliana heterotrimeric Gα protein self-activates without accessory proteins, and is kept in its resting state by the negative regulator, AtRGS1 (regulator of G-protein signalling 1), which is the prototype of a seven-transmembrane receptor fused with an RGS domain. Endocytosis of AtRGS1 by ligand-dependent endocytosis physically uncouples the GTPase-accelerating activity of AtRGS1 from the Gα protein, permitting sustained activation. Phosphorylation of AtRGS1 by AtWNK8 kinase causes AtRGS1 endocytosis, required for both G-protein-mediated sugar signalling and cell proliferation. In animals, receptor endocytosis results in signal desensitization, whereas in plants, endocytosis results in signal activation. These findings reveal how different organisms rearrange a regulatory system to result in opposite outcomes using similar phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis mechanisms. In plants, the heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit is kept inactive by binding to the regulator of G protein signalling 1 (RGS1) protein. Jones and colleagues show that G-protein β and γ subunits recruit the WNK8 kinase to the plasma membrane, where WNK8 phosphorylates RGS1 and facilitates its internalization. This effect de-represses Gα signalling and is required for sugar signalling and cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2113651938,"Mitochondrial oxidant stress is widely viewed as being critical to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease. But the origins of this stress are poorly defined. One possibility is that it arises from the metabolic demands associated with regenerative activity. To test this hypothesis, we characterized neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), a population of cholinergic neurons that show signs of pathology in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, in mouse brain slices. DMV neurons were slow, autonomous pacemakers with broad spikes, leading to calcium entry that was weakly buffered. Using a transgenic mouse expressing a redox-sensitive optical probe targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, we found that calcium entry during pacemaking created a basal mitochondrial oxidant stress. Knocking out DJ-1 (also known as PARK7), a gene associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease, exacerbated this stress. These results point to a common mechanism underlying mitochondrial oxidant stress in Parkinson's disease and a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate it."

The KO of JBP2 initially did not result in detectable defects, but these cells lose J; after >30 passages, only about 30% of J remains (Vainio et al., 2009Vainio S. Genest P.A. ter Riet B. van Luenen H.G.A.M. Borst P. Evidence that J-binding protein 2 is a thymidine hydroxylase catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of DNA base J.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 164: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When these cells are grown in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), they lose more J and die (Vainio et al., 2009Vainio S.

Cross M. Borst P. Biosynthesis and function of the modified DNA base β-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5643-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is not known, but it provides a tool to test possible functions of base J. In Leishmania species, >99% of all J is present in telomeric repeats (Genest et al., 2007Genest P.A. Ter Riet B. Cijsouw T. van Luenen H.G. Borst P. Telomeric localization of the modified DNA base J in the genome of the protozoan parasite Leishmania.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and we therefore looked for a telomeric phenotype in L. tarentolae JBP2 KO cells dying in BrdU. None were found. No other clue to the cause of death was found either. The dying cells do not stop in a defined phase of the cell cycle; they do not activate a DNA damage response (P.B., S.V., P.-A.G., and H.G.A.M.v.L., unpublished data). This deadlock was broken by Cliffe et al., 2010Cliffe L.J. Siegel T.N. Marshall M. Cross G.A. Sabatini R.

High-throughput sequencing confirmed the location of J in repetitive DNA but, in addition, revealed chromosome-internal J peaks coinciding with RNA polymerase (RNAP) II transcriptional initiation and termination sites (Cliffe et al., 2010Cliffe L.J.

The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (transcribed by RNAP I), tRNA, 5S RNA, and snRNA genes (transcribed by RNAP III) are scattered between RNAP II polycistronic transcription units (PTUs) (Padilla-Mejía et al., 2009Padilla-Mejía N.E.

Although 99% of all J in L. tarentolae is in telomeric repeats (Genest et al., 2007Genest P.A. Ter Riet B. Cijsouw T. van Luenen H.G. Borst P. Telomeric localization of the modified DNA base J in the genome of the protozoan parasite Leishmania.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we have shown that the remaining J is in chromosome-internal positions, but we were unable to map this internal J by standard cloning procedures (Genest et al., 2007Genest P.A. Ter Riet B. Cijsouw T. van Luenen H.G. Borst P. Telomeric localization of the modified DNA base J in the genome of the protozoan parasite Leishmania.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have now confirmed the presence of internal J at RNAP II transcription termination sites in L. major and L. tarentolae. We show that this internal J is strongly reduced in JBP2 KO L. tarentolae cells. This loss of J is accompanied by massive readthrough of normal RNAP II transcriptional termination sites. For the initial mapping of internal J in Leishmania, we used L. major because the genomic map of this species is the most refined (Myler et al., 1999Myler P.J. Audleman L. deVos T. Hixson G. Kiser P.

Histone acetylations mark origins of polycistronic transcription in Leishmania major.BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The DNA of the L. major Friedlin strain was sheared, and J-containing fragments were enriched by immunoprecipitation with a specific anti-J-DNA antiserum (van Leeuwen et al., 1997van Leeuwen F. Wijsman E.R. Kieft R. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Borst P. Localization of the modified base J in telomeric VSG gene expression sites of Trypanosoma brucei.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3232-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or by binding of the DNA fragments to Strep(II)-tagged JBP1 and retrieval of the bound fragments with streptavidin beads (see Experimental Procedures). Both methods enriched J-containing DNA fragments effectively, as shown by the high signal-to-noise ratio of the results presented here (see Figure 1 and Data S1 available online). To simplify the presentation, we mainly show the data obtained with the anti-J-DNA antiserum, but all J peaks discussed here were also found by using the Strep(II)-tagged JBP1. Our high-throughput sequencing locates the bulk of J in telomeric repeats, confirming earlier analyses (Genest et al., 2007Genest P.A. Ter Riet B. Cijsouw T. van Luenen H.G. Borst P. Telomeric localization of the modified DNA base J in the genome of the protozoan parasite Leishmania.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, we find internal J at three main locations. Prominent internal J peaks occur where two RNAP II PTUs converge and terminate (see Figure 1A for an example on chromosome 14). Of the 38 convergent transcription termination regions in the L. major genome, all but one had a J peak. A second location where internal J peaks are found is where RNAP II transcription starts in both directions. Although not all of these start regions contain internal J (see Figure 1A and Data S1), 16 of the 58 do contain a major internal J peak (see Figure 1B for an example on chromosome 7). These divergent transcription start regions are marked by two adjacent acetylated histone H3 (H3ac) peaks (Thomas et al., 2009Thomas S. Green A. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Myler P.J. Histone acetylations mark origins of polycistronic transcription in Leishmania major.BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the internal J peak is invariably found between these H3ac peaks. The size of the divergent start region (as measured by the distance between paired H3ac peaks) correlates with the presence of J because the 12 largest all have a major J peak. Conversely, most start regions with H3ac peaks close together have no J peak. A third major location of J peaks is immediately adjacent to single H3ac peaks within PTUs (see Figure 1C for an example on chromosome 4). The relative location of the internal J and H3ac peaks is what one would expect if these J peaks mark transcription termination sites and the H3ac peaks represent a restart of transcription in the same direction. In addition, scattered internal J peaks are found throughout the genome. We assume that their appearance in the middle of PTUs is an unavoidable mapping artifact due to inaccuracies in the current genomic map. Modest J peaks were also observed upstream of the SL RNA locus in chromosome 2 and flanking the rRNA gene clusters in chromosome 27. To study the effect of J loss, we switched to L. tarentolae, as all mutants affecting J levels were made in L. tarentolae. Although the assembly of the L. tarentolae genome is not yet as refined as that of L. major, the overall genome organization of the two species is very similar and so is the location of J. In fact, all major internal J peaks in L. major can be found at corresponding positions in the L. tarentolae genome (see Figures 1A and 1D and Data S1). As we have far more reads on J-DNA fragments from L. tarentolae than from L. major, we also see more minor J peaks. For instance, for the 58 divergent transcription start regions of L. tarentolae, we find a major J peak in 22, a minor J peak in 18, and no J in 26. We have previously shown that disruption of JBP2, one of the genes involved in J biosynthesis, results in a gradual loss of J (Vainio et al., 2009Vainio S. Genest P.A. ter Riet B. van Luenen H.G.A.M. Borst P. Evidence that J-binding protein 2 is a thymidine hydroxylase catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of DNA base J.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 164: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When these JBP2 KO cells are cultured in BrdU-containing medium (KO+BrdU), they lose additional J and die (Vainio et al., 2009Vainio S. Genest P.A. ter Riet B. van Luenen H.G.A.M. Borst P. Evidence that J-binding protein 2 is a thymidine hydroxylase catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of DNA base J.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 164: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We now find that the overall drop in J levels in L. tarentolae JBP2 KO is accompanied by a profound decrease in internal J, as determined by high-throughput sequencing of J-containing fragments (see Figure 2 and Data S2). Under the conditions of these experiments, the overall J levels in JBP2 KO cells, measured by quantitative dot blots, varied between 30% and 37% of wild-type (WT) (n = 3). For the corresponding samples of JBP2 KO L. tarentolae grown for 4 or 5 days in KO+BrdU, the J levels were 13%–16% of WT. Nearly all of this J is present in telomeric repeats (Genest et al., 2007Genest P.A. Ter Riet B. Cijsouw T. van Luenen H.G. Borst P. Telomeric localization of the modified DNA base J in the genome of the protozoan parasite Leishmania.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and indeed, these repeats are still prominently precipitated in the KO+BrdU DNA samples (Data S2). In contrast, the decrease in internal J looks far more pronounced than that of overall J because many internal J peaks are substantially reduced in the KO cells and disappear almost completely in the KO+BrdU cells, implying >99% loss of internal J. However, as the dot blots and the IPs are both semiquantitative (van Leeuwen et al., 1997van Leeuwen F. Wijsman E.R. Kieft R. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Borst P. Localization of the modified base J in telomeric VSG gene expression sites of Trypanosoma brucei.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3232-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the decrease illustrated in Figure 2 (and Data S2) cannot be interpreted in a strictly quantitative fashion. Because internal J is predominantly found at transcription termination sites and is lost from these sites in JBP2 KO mutants, we tested whether the loss of J affects transcription termination. As synthesis of mature mRNAs requires processing sequences that might be underrepresented in abnormal RNA produced by readthrough of termination sites, we initially looked at the small RNA fraction, as this might contain a complete set of antisense RNA degradation products. The high-throughput RNA sequencing method used in this analysis will capture all RNA degradation products with 5′-P and 3′-OH ends. Because Leishmania appears to have few (if any) microRNAs (miRNAs), most sequences obtained by this analysis will be derived from degradation of (pre-)mRNAs. More than 99% of the small RNAs found in WT cells correspond to the coding strand predicted from the preliminary map of L. tarentolae (see Table S1). The result is a rough picture of the primary transcript map of L. tarentolae, as reflected in small degradation products (see Figure 2 and Data S2). However, there is a striking change in strand specificity in the JBP2 KO mutant (where 7% of all the small RNAs are antisense), and this is exacerbated when these cells are grown in the presence of BrdU (KO+BrdU) (9.6% is antisense). We attribute this profound change primarily to readthrough of convergent transcription termination regions, when these regions lose their J, rather than false starts on the wrong strand. First, the area between protein-coding genes at large convergent transcription termination regions fills up with transcripts from both strands (see Data S2 for an example on chromosome 14). Second, the frequency of antisense small RNA fragments decreases with increasing distance from the convergent transcription termination region. This is illustrated in Figure 3A, in which we plot the average transcript level on the same strand before and after the transcription stop site. Whereas this level drops to near zero in RNA from WT cells directly after the transcription stop site, it remains high in the JBP2 KO and KO+BrdU samples and then gradually tapers off. Finally, the amount and extent of readthrough is generally inversely related to the amount of J at the convergent transcription termination regions; i.e., the more J is reduced, the more readthrough is seen and the further it extends from the transcription stop site (see Data S2). The transcript analysis of JBP2 KO cells presented here was done with a KO clone analyzed >100 passages after its generation. This clone had lost nearly all internal J. To test whether a more limited loss of internal J would also lead to (more modest) readthrough, we made use of our observation that the JBP2 KO cells lose J over time (Vainio et al., 2009Vainio S. Genest P.A. ter Riet B. van Luenen H.G.A.M. Borst P. Evidence that J-binding protein 2 is a thymidine hydroxylase catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of DNA base J.Mol. Biochem.

Chronic stress induces catecholamine biosynthesis and release, stimulating β-adrenergic receptors and activating cAMP signaling pathways in neurons. In a murine chronic restraint stress model, neuronal RyR2 were phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), oxidized, and nitrosylated, resulting in depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the channel complex and intracellular calcium leak. Stress-induced cognitive dysfunction, including deficits in learning and memory, and reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 connection were rescued by oral administration of S107, a compound developed in our laboratory that stabilizes RyR2-calstabin2 interaction, or by genetic ablation of the RyR2 PKA phosphorylation site at serine 2808. Thus, neuronal RyR2 remodeling contributes to stress-induced cognitive dysfunction. Leaky RyR2 could be a therapeutic target for treatment of stress-induced cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2011378590,"Ciliopathies are caused by alterations in the development and function of cilia. Now Jeffrey Martens and his colleagues demonstrate anatomic and functional rescue of cilia development in mature, differentiated neurons by adenovirus-mediated restoration of expression of the wild-type protein intraflagellar transport protein 88 (Ift88) and show restoration of olfactory function in a mouse model of ciliopathy. A loss-of-function mutation in IFT88 is also identified in individuals with ciliopathies. Cilia are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based organelles that are crucial for diverse biological functions, including motility, cell signaling and sensory perception1. In humans, alterations in the formation and function of cilia manifest clinically as ciliopathies, a growing class of pleiotropic genetic disorders2,3,4. Despite the substantial progress that has been made in identifying genes that cause ciliopathies, therapies for these disorders are not yet available to patients. Although mice with a hypomorphic mutation in the intraflagellar transport protein IFT88 (Ift88Tg737Rpw mice, also known as ORPK mice)5 have been well studied, the relevance of IFT88 mutations to human pathology is unknown. We show that a mutation in IFT88 causes a hitherto unknown human ciliopathy. In vivo complementation assays in zebrafish and mIMCD3 cells show the pathogenicity of this newly discovered allele. We further show that ORPK mice are functionally anosmic as a result of the loss of cilia on their olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Notably, adenoviral-mediated expression of IFT88 in mature, fully differentiated OSNs of ORPK mice is sufficient to restore ciliary structures and rescue olfactory function. These studies are the first to use in vivo therapeutic treatment to reestablish cilia in a mammalian ciliopathy. More broadly, our studies indicate that gene therapy is a viable option for cellular and functional rescue of the complex ciliary organelle in established differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023651356,"DEAD-box proteins are the largest family of nucleic acid helicases, and are crucial to RNA metabolism throughout all domains of life. They contain a conserved 'helicase core' of two RecA-like domains (domains (D)1 and D2), which uses ATP to catalyse the unwinding of short RNA duplexes by non-processive, local strand separation. This mode of action differs from that of translocating helicases and allows DEAD-box proteins to remodel large RNAs and RNA-protein complexes without globally disrupting RNA structure. However, the structural basis for this distinctive mode of RNA unwinding remains unclear. Here, structural, biochemical and genetic analyses of the yeast DEAD-box protein Mss116p indicate that the helicase core domains have modular functions that enable a novel mechanism for RNA-duplex recognition and unwinding. By investigating D1 and D2 individually and together, we find that D1 acts as an ATP-binding domain and D2 functions as an RNA-duplex recognition domain. D2 contains a nucleic-acid-binding pocket that is formed by conserved DEAD-box protein sequence motifs and accommodates A-form but not B-form duplexes, providing a basis for RNA substrate specificity. Upon a conformational change in which the two core domains join to form a 'closed state' with an ATPase active site, conserved motifs in D1 promote the unwinding of duplex substrates bound to D2 by excluding one RNA strand and bending the other. Our results provide a comprehensive structural model for how DEAD-box proteins recognize and unwind RNA duplexes. This model explains key features of DEAD-box protein function and affords a new perspective on how the evolutionarily related cores of other RNA and DNA helicases diverged to use different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2048824067,"Tafazzin, the mitochondrial transacylase that is deficient in Barth syndrome, selects lipid substrates in the inverted hexagonal phase but does not react with bilayer lipids. Cardiolipin is a mitochondrial phospholipid with a characteristic acyl chain composition that depends on the function of tafazzin, a phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase, although the enzyme itself lacks acyl specificity. We incubated isolated tafazzin with various mixtures of phospholipids and lysophospholipids, characterized the lipid phase by 31P-NMR and measured newly formed molecular species by MS. Substantial transacylation was observed only in nonbilayer lipid aggregates, and the substrate specificity was highly sensitive to the lipid phase. In particular, tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin, a prototype molecular species, formed only under conditions that favor the inverted hexagonal phase. In isolated mitochondria, <1% of lipids participated in transacylations, suggesting that the action of tafazzin was limited to privileged lipid domains. We propose that tafazzin reacts with non–bilayer-type lipid domains that occur in curved or hemifused membrane zones and that acyl specificity is driven by the packing properties of these domains."

The authors show that Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1) regulates leptin signaling by increasing activation of signaling molecules downstream of leptin receptor. Deletion of ROCK1 from POMC or AgRP neurons leads to obesity and reduced leptin sensitivity. Leptin regulates energy balance. However, knowledge of the critical intracellular transducers of leptin signaling remains incomplete. We found that Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1) regulates leptin action on body weight homeostasis by activating JAK2, an initial trigger of leptin receptor signaling. Leptin promoted the physical interaction of JAK2 and ROCK1, thereby increasing phosphorylation of JAK2 and downstream activation of Stat3 and FOXO1. Mice lacking ROCK1 in either pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or agouti-related protein neurons, mediators of leptin action, displayed obesity and impaired leptin sensitivity. In addition, deletion of ROCK1 in the arcuate nucleus markedly enhanced food intake, resulting in severe obesity. Notably, ROCK1 was a specific mediator of leptin, but not insulin, regulation of POMC neuronal activity. Our data identify ROCK1 as a key regulator of leptin action on energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2078318584,"Kelps, brown algae of the order Laminariales, dominate rocky shores and form huge kelp beds which provide habitat and nurseries for various marine organisms. Whereas the basic physiological and ecophysiological characteristics of kelps are well studied, the molecular processes underlying acclimation to different light and temperature conditions are still poorly understood. Therefore we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological acclimation to light and temperature stress. Sporophytes of S. latissima were exposed to combinations of light intensities and temperatures, and microarray hybridizations were performed to determine changes in gene expression patterns. This first large-scale transcriptomic study of a kelp species shows that S. latissima responds to temperature and light stress with a multitude of transcriptional changes: up to 32% of genes showed an altered expression after the exposure experiments. High temperature had stronger effects on gene expression in S. latissima than low temperature, reflected by the higher number of temperature-responsive genes. We gained insights into underlying molecular processes of acclimation, which includes adjustment of the primary metabolism as well as induction of several ROS scavengers and a sophisticated regulation of Hsps. We show that S. latissima, as a cold adapted species, must make stronger efforts for acclimating to high than to low temperatures. The strongest response was caused by the combination of high temperatures with high light intensities, which proved most harmful for the alga."
https://openalex.org/W2071342914,"Cholesterol is a ubiquitous hydrocarbon compound that can serve as substrate for microbial growth. This steroid and related cyclic compounds are recalcitrant due to their low solubility in water, complex ring structure, the presence of quaternary carbon atoms, and the low number of functional groups. Aerobic metabolism therefore makes use of reactive molecular oxygen as co-substrate of oxygenases to hydroxylate and cleave the sterane ring system. Consequently, anaerobic metabolism must substitute oxygenase-catalyzed steps by O(2)-independent hydroxylases. Here we show that one of the initial reactions of anaerobic cholesterol metabolism in the β-proteobacterium Sterolibacterium denitrificans is catalyzed by an unprecedented enzyme that hydroxylates the tertiary C25 atom of the side chain without molecular oxygen forming a tertiary alcohol. This steroid C25 dehydrogenase belongs to the dimethyl sulfoxide dehydrogenase molybdoenzyme family, the closest relative being ethylbenzene dehydrogenase. It is a heterotrimer, which is probably located at the periplasmic side of the membrane and contains one molybdenum cofactor, five [Fe-S] clusters, and one heme b. The draft genome of the organism contains several genes coding for related enzymes that probably replace oxygenases in steroid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2050829925,"A growing body of evidence from community genetics studies suggests that ecosystem functions supported by plant species richness can also be provided by genetic diversity within plant species. This is not yet true for the diversity-resistance relationship as it is still unclear whether damage by insect herbivores responds to genetic diversity in host plant populations. We developed a manipulative field experiment based on a synthetic community approach, with 15 mixtures of one to four oak (Quercus robur) half-sib families. We quantified genetic diversity at the plot level by genotyping all oak saplings and assessed overall damage caused by ectophagous and endophagous herbivores along a gradient of increasing genetic diversity. Damage due to ectophagous herbivores increased with the genetic diversity in oak sapling populations as a result of higher levels of damage in mixtures than in monocultures for all families (complementarity effect) rather than because of the presence of more susceptible oak genotypes in mixtures (selection effect). Assemblages of different oak genotypes would benefit polyphagous herbivores via improved host patch location, spill over among neighbouring saplings and diet mixing. By contrast, genetic diversity was a poor predictor of the abundance of endophagous herbivores, which increased with individual sapling apparency. Plant genetic diversity may not provide sufficient functional contrast to prevent tree sapling colonization by specialist herbivores while enhancing the foraging of generalist herbivores. Long term studies are nevertheless required to test whether the effect of genetic diversity on herbivory change with the ontogeny of trees and local adaptation of specialist herbivores."

Methods Cohort study of 5506 community-dwelling men aged 69 to 87 years followed for up to 8.5 years. Use of computers measured as daily, weekly, less than weekly and never. Participants also reported their use of email, internet, word processors, games or other computer activities. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICD-10 diagnosis of dementia as recorded by the Western Australian Data Linkage System. Results 1857/5506 (33.7%) men reported using computers and 347 (6.3%) received a diagnosis of dementia during an average follow up of 6.0 years (range: 6 months to 8.5 years). The hazard ratio (HR) of dementia was lower among computer users than non-users (HR = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.47–0.81, after adjustment for age, educational attainment, size of social network, and presence of depression or of significant clinical morbidity). The HR of dementia appeared to decrease with increasing frequency of computer use: 0.68 (95%CI = 0.41–1.13), 0.61 (95%CI = 0.39–0.94) and 0.59 (95%CI = 0.40–0.87) for less than weekly, at least weekly and daily. The HR of dementia was 0.66 (95%CI = 0.50–0.86) after the analysis was further adjusted for baseline cognitive function, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Conclusion Older men who use computers have lower risk of receiving a diagnosis of dementia up to 8.5 years later. Randomised trials are required to determine if the observed associations are causal."
https://openalex.org/W1984706454,"Background Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas but also has extra-pancreatic effects. GLP-1 may stimulate glucose uptake in cultured muscle cells but the mechanism is not clearly defined. Furthermore, while the pancreatic effects of GLP-1 are glucose-dependent, the glucose-dependency of its extra-pancreatic effects has not been examined. Methods Skeletal muscle satellite cells isolated from young (22.5±0.97 yr), lean (BMI 22.5±0.6 kg/m2), healthy males were differentiated in media containing either 22.5 mM (high) or 5 mM (normal) glucose for 7 days in the absence or presence of insulin and/or various GLP-1 concentrations. Myocellular effects of GLP-1, insulin and glucose were assessed by western-blot, glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Results We firstly show that the GLP-1 receptor protein is expressed in differentiated human muscle satellite cells (myocytes). Secondly, we show that in 5 mM glucose media, exposure of myocytes to GLP-1 results in a dose dependent increase in glucose uptake, GLUT4 amount and subsequently glycogen synthesis in a PI3K dependent manner, independent of the insulin signaling cascade. Importantly, we provide evidence that differentiation of human satellite cells in hyperglycemic (22.5 mM glucose) conditions increases GLUT1 expression, and renders the cells insulin resistant and interestingly GLP-1 resistant in terms of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Hyperglycemic conditions did not affect the ability of insulin to phosphorylate downstream targets, PKB or GSK3. Interestingly we show that at 5 mM glucose, GLP-1 increases GLUT4 protein levels and that this effect is abolished by hyperglycemia. Conclusions GLP-1 increases glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis into fully-differentiated human satellite cells in a PI3-K dependent mechanism potentially through increased GLUT4 protein levels. The latter occurs independently of the insulin signaling pathway. Attenuation of both GLP-1 and insulin-induced glucose metabolism by hyperglycemia is likely to occur downstream of PI3K."
https://openalex.org/W2057020886,"Glial activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling has been shown in animals to play an important role in the initiation and establishment of chronic pain. However, our ability to assess this central immune reactivity in clinical pain populations is currently lacking. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are an accessible source of TLR expressing cells that may mirror similarities in TLR responsiveness of the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to characterize the IL-1β response to various TLR agonists in isolated PBMCs from chronic pain sufferers (on and not on opioids) and pain-free controls. Venous blood was collected from 11 chronic pain sufferers on opioids (≥ 20 mg of morphine / day), 8 chronic pain sufferers not on opioids and 11 pain-free controls. PBMCs were isolated and stimulated in vitro with a TLR2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR4 (LPS) or TLR7 (imiquimod) agonist. IL-1β released into the supernatant was measured with ELISA. Significantly increased IL-1β expression was found in PBMCs from chronic pain sufferers (on and not on opioids) compared with pain-free controls for TLR2 (F((6, 277)) = 15, P<0.0001), TLR4 (F((8, 263)) = 3, P = 0.002) and TLR7 (F((2,201)) = 5, P = 0.005) agonists. These data demonstrate that PBMCs from chronic pain sufferers were more responsive to TLR agonists compared with controls, suggesting peripheral cells may have the potential to become a source of biomarkers for chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2033108103,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is mostly produced in the cell by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K) and has a crucial role in numerous signaling events. Here we demonstrate that in vitro all three isoforms of PIP5K, α, β, and γ, discriminate among substrates with different acyl chains for both the substrates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) although to different extents, with isoform γ being the most selective. Fully saturated dipalmitoyl-PtdIns4P was a poor substrate for all three isoforms, but both the 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl and the 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl forms of PtdIns4P were good substrates. V(max) was greater for the 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl form compared with the 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl form, although for PIP5Kβ the difference was small. For the α and γ isoforms, K(m) was much lower for 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl PtdIns4P, making this lipid the better substrate of the two under most conditions. Activation of PIP5K by phosphatidic acid is also acyl chain-dependent. Species of phosphatidic acid with two unsaturated acyl chains are much better activators of PIP5K than those containing one saturated and one unsaturated acyl chain. PtdIns is a poor substrate for PIP5K, but it also shows acyl chain selectivity. Curiously, there is no acyl chain discrimination among species of phosphatidic acid in the activation of the phosphorylation of PtdIns. Together, our findings indicate that PIP5K isoforms α, β, and γ act selectively on substrates and activators with different acyl chains. This could be a tightly regulated mechanism of producing physiologically active unsaturated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate species in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1980023350,"Morphogen gradients pattern tissues and organs during development. When morphogen production is spatially restricted, diffusion and degradation are sufficient to generate sharp concentration gradients. It is less clear how sharp gradients can arise within the source of a broadly expressed morphogen. A recent solution relies on localized production of an inhibitor outside the domain of morphogen production, which effectively redistributes (shuttles) and concentrates the morphogen within its expression domain. Here, we study how a sharp gradient is established without a localized inhibitor, focusing on early dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo, where an active ligand and its inhibitor are concomitantly generated in a broad ventral domain. Using theory and experiments, we show that a sharp Toll activation gradient is produced through “self-organized shuttling,” which dynamically relocalizes inhibitor production to lateral regions, followed by inhibitor-dependent ventral shuttling of the activating ligand Spätzle. Shuttling may represent a general paradigm for patterning early embryos.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2NTA5YjQwNTVkNmJjMTUyYmY3OTk1NTk2NjQyYTIyZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NjM4MDI5fQ.jMX3810THq-02kTle6JOUVKqdLrEznt_0wRmYlMX2wXbYkYqmoXdoX1Yn0QjaNhTB5plXgDfpynq5yQBOwjkUb69Iwafij3u3KoFLkHqdGcwejDdkHyEpFlla-3Hv2XWxE2zwCfH4fcGv_Vn9JRcWOc3I-AbITLo2xJuutVwJASeCDPe47FCkEHPvJ5pl95EXcZjRsLcmidMGHitVG_QnpZhtUCELojkBq5MvCLaMa44Az9Qj2YT7a6LNmujPu_qQq_49Y7mmf3_ixE61XpV6_JjKHnBeLn6q6ObC4_-sQiZ2GYf8P3UoMXNe7ZzugiCuLOZ0FV9CcLtZfOBeB4F4w(mp4, (8.34 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2052535135,"Adult cigarette smokers usually become dependent on cigarettes during adolescence. Despite recent advances in addiction genetics, little data delineates the genetic factors that account for the vulnerability of humans to smoke tobacco. We studied the operant nicotine self-administration (SA) behavior of six inbred strains of adolescent male rats (Fisher 344, Brown Norway, Dark Agouti, Spontaneous Hypertensive Rat, Wistar Kyoto and Lewis) and six selected F1 hybrids. All rats were trained to press a lever to obtain food starting on postnatal day (PN) 32, and then nicotine (0.03 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) reinforcement was made available on PN41-42 (10 consecutive daily 2 h sessions). Of the 12 isogenic strains, Fisher rats self-administered the fewest nicotine infusions (1.45 ± 0.36/d) during the last 3 d, while Lewis rats took the most nicotine (13.0 ± 1.4/d). These strains sorted into high, intermediate and low self-administration groups in 2, 2, and 8 strains, respectively. The influence of heredity on nicotine SA (0.64) is similar to that reported for humans. Therefore, this panel of isogenic rat strains effectively models the overall impact of genetics on the vulnerability to acquire nicotine-reinforced behavior during adolescence. Separate groups of rats responded for food starting on PN41. The correlation between nicotine and food reward was not significant. Hence, the genetic control of the motivation to obtain nicotine is distinctly different from food reward, indicating the specificity of the underlying genetic mechanisms. Lastly, the behavior of F1 hybrids was not predicted from the additive behavior of the parental strains, indicating the impact of significant gene-gene interactions on the susceptibility to nicotine reward. Taken together, the behavioral characteristics of this model indicate its strong potential to identify specific genes mediating the human vulnerability to smoke cigarettes."
https://openalex.org/W2130770309,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) A or E and tetanus toxin (TeTx) bind to motor-nerve endings and undergo distinct trafficking; their light-chain (LC) proteases cleave soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) peripherally or centrally and cause flaccid or spastic paralysis, respectively. To seek protein domains responsible for local blockade of transmitter release (BoNTs) rather than retroaxonal transport to spinal neurons (TeTx), their acceptor-binding moieties (HC)—or in one case, heavy chain (HC)—were exchanged by gene recombination. Each chimera, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, entered rat cerebellar neurons to cleave their substrates, blocked in vitro nerve-induced muscle contractions, and produced only flaccid paralysis in mice. Thus, the local cytosolic delivery of BoNT/A or BoNT/E proteases and the contrasting retrograde transport of TeTx are not specified solely by their HC or HC; BoNT/A LC translocated locally irrespective of being targeted by either of the latter TeTx domains. In contrast, BoNT/E protease fused to a TeTx enzymatically inactive mutant (TeTIM) caused spastic paralysis and cleaved SNAP-25 in spinal cord but not the injected muscle. Apparently, TeTIM precludes cytosolic release of BoNT/E protease at motor nerve endings. It is deduced that the LCs of the toxins, acting in conjunction with HC domains, dictate their local or distant destinations.—Wang, J., Zurawski, T. H., Meng, J., Lawrence, G. W., Aoki, K.

The purposes of this study were to test the sufficiency of RA to induce tooth development and to assess its role in evolution. We found that exposure of embryos to exogenous RA induces a dramatic anterior expansion of the number of pharyngeal teeth that later form and shifts anteriorly the expression patterns of genes normally expressed in the posterior tooth-forming region, such as pitx2 and dlx2b. After RA exposure, we also observed a correlation between cartilage malformations and ectopic tooth induction, as well as abnormal cranial neural crest marker gene expression. Additionally, we observed that the RA-induced zebrafish anterior teeth resemble in pattern and number the dentition of fish species that retain anterior pharyngeal teeth such as medaka but that medaka do not express the aldh1a2 RA-synthesizing enzyme in tooth-forming regions. We conclude that RA is sufficient to induce anterior ectopic tooth development in zebrafish where teeth were lost in evolution, potentially by altering neural crest cell development, and that changes in the location of RA synthesis correlate with evolutionary changes in vertebrate dentitions.—Seritrakul, P., Samarut, E., Lama, T.

Transfection of uveal melanoma cells with a small interfering RNA against Notch1 (siNotch1) effectively suppressed Notch1 expression, resulting in significant cell growth inhibition when combined with H101 treatment. Combined treatment with siNotch1 and H101 (H101-Notch1-siRNA) greatly enhanced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro as compared to treatment with H101 or siNotch1 alone. For in vivo treatments, the combined treatment of siNotch1 and H101 showed remarkable tumor growth inhibition and prolonged mouse survival in the OCM1 xenograft model. We predict that Notch pathway deregulation could be a feature of uveal melanoma, and could be a therapeutic target, especially if p53 is concurrently targeted."

Light-driven proton pumps in chloroplasts and phototropic bacteria or respiratory-chain enzymes in mitochondria and aerobic bacteria generate a proton gradient across the membrane, resulting in a positively charged p-side 3The abbreviations used are: p-sidepositive side of the membranen-sidenegative side of the membraneMDmolecular dynamicsNPATconstant area isobaric-isothermal ensembleNPTisobaric-isothermal ensembleNVTcanonical ensembler.m.s.d.root mean square deviation(s)TMHtransmembrane helixPDBProtein Data Bank. and a negatively charged n-side (p-side and n-side refer to lumen and stroma in chloroplasts, intermembrane space and matrix in mitochondria, and periplasm and cytoplasm in bacteria, respectively). The resulting proton motive force drives the c8–15γϵ rotor, which induces conformational changes in the β subunits of the stator and, hence, provides the energy to produce ATP. Some fermenting bacteria use sodium ions instead of protons to drive ATP synthesis (16Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Energy transduction in the sodium F-ATPase of Propionigenium modestum.Proc.

Subunits a and c of the transmembrane Fo domain are directly involved in proton transport.

F1Fo-ATP synthases can also catalyze the reverse reaction driven by ATP hydrolysis and pump protons from the n-side to the p-side of the membrane via the same half-channels, resulting in a counterclockwise rotation of the c-ring rotor (23Börsch M. Diez M. Zimmermann B. Reuter R. Gräber P. Stepwise rotation of the γ-subunit of EF0F1-ATP synthase observed by intramolecular single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer.FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Preventing a nonproductive shortcut between the p-side and the n-side half-channels is an essential prerequisite for the transformation of proton flux into mechanical energy (26Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. ATP synthase: an electrochemical transducer with rotatory mechanics.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). A conserved positively charged side chain in subunit a (Arg193 in chloroplasts and Arg210 in Escherichia coli) isolates the two half-channels by preventing any protonated (and thus uncharged) Glu61 of subunit c to pass the positively charged guanidinium group of the aArg193 side chain (30Cain B.D.

J. 2010; 430: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, aArg193 prevents the futile counterclockwise rotation in ATP synthesis mode. However, the structure of the a/c interface and how the protein complex maintains isolation between the half-channels, i.e. how the nonrotating shortcut of protons is prevented, has remained elusive so far. Although it is established that the n-side half-channel is water-accessible, the pathway of the protons has not yet been identified. Here we resolve this pathway at atomic resolution by MD simulations of the structure of the c14 rotor ring of the chloroplast ATP synthase (7Vollmar M. Schlieper D. Winn M. Büchner C. Groth G. Structure of the c14 rotor ring of the proton translocating chloroplast ATP synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18228-18235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in a lipid bilayer surrounded by water. The carboxylate cGlu61 of one of the protomers was deprotonated, thus mimicking the protomer facing the a subunit in the intact Fo domain. We identified a water-accessible region inside the lipid bilayer at the periphery of the c-ring rotor. This water channel runs from the n-side of the membrane to the deprotonated carboxylate cGlu61 in the middle of the membrane. The aqueous n-side half-channel is not parallel to the axis of the c-ring rotor but rather inclined, which may enhance the isolation between the half-channels and may contribute to a favorable clockwise rotation in ATP synthesis mode. The MD results also give a plausible explanation of the peculiar properties of the double mutant cP24D/E61G, which, in E. coli, is fully functional despite lacking the essential Asp61 side chain (36Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. The essential carboxyl group in subunit c of the F1F0 ATP synthase can be moved and H+ translocating function retained.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); the water channel now reaches deep between two c-protomers, thus enabling the repositioning of the reversibly protonated carboxyl group of the suppressor mutant. Starting structures for MD simulations of the c14 rotor ring in a membrane environment were generated from the crystal structure of the c-ring from spinach chloroplasts (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2w5j) (7Vollmar M. Schlieper D. Winn M. Büchner C. Groth G. Structure of the c14 rotor ring of the proton translocating chloroplast ATP synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18228-18235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It comprises 14 identical c-subunits, each of which forms a hairpin structure consisting of two TMHs. Missing amino acids and side chains were added manually in the most plausible rotamer conformations and refined as described (7Vollmar M. Schlieper D. Winn M. Büchner C. Groth G. Structure of the c14 rotor ring of the proton translocating chloroplast ATP synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18228-18235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The c-ring structure was oriented with respect to a lipid bilayer according to information provided by the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes database (37Lomize M.A. Lomize A.L. Pogozheva I.D. Mosberg H.I. OPM: orientations of proteins in membranes database.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The protein structure was then embedded in a bilayer of 288 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine lipids, which itself was embedded in 20 Å layers of water molecules above and below. The pre-equilibrated configuration of the lipid bilayer and the water layers was taken from Rosso and Gould (38Rosso L. Gould I.R. Structure and dynamics of phospholipid bilayers using recently developed general all-atom force fields.J. Comput. Chem. 2008; 29: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ninety-nine lipids that were sterically overlapping with the protein structure were removed. The center of the c-ring was filled with 12 lipids to model the lipid plug seen in isolated rings (39Meier T. Matthey U. Henzen F. Dimroth P. Müller D.J. The central plug in the reconstituted undecameric c cylinder of a bacterial ATP synthase consists of phospholipids.FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). From this system, the following starting structures were generated. I) All but one of the Glu61 residues of the subunits c were protonated (hitherto referred to as “13protonated”). II) All Glu61 residues were protonated (“14protonated”). III) All Glu61 residues were deprotonated (“0protonated”). IV) The double mutant cP24D/E61G was generated by pruning the side chain of Glu61 and replacing Pro24 with the most plausible rotamer of Asp, as provided by Coot (40Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17079) Google Scholar). In this system, all but one of the Asp24 residues were then protonated (double mutant). To reach electroneutrality for each of these starting structures, sodium ions were added by the leap program of the Amber package (41Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The Amber biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6519) Google Scholar) as required. This resulted in system sizes of ∼78,000 atoms. MD simulations were performed with the Amber 10 suite of programs (41Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The Amber biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6519) Google Scholar). For the protein and ions, the force field by Cornell et al. (42Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. A second generation force field for the simulation of proteins, nucleic acids, and organic molecules.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11553) Google Scholar) was used with modifications suggested by Simmerling et al. (43Simmerling C. Strockbine B. Roitberg A.E. All-atom structure prediction and folding simulations of a stable protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11258-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). TIP3P was used as a water model (44Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water.J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29892) Google Scholar). For the lipids, force field parameters and charges derived by Rosso and Gould (38Rosso L. Gould I.R. Structure and dynamics of phospholipid bilayers using recently developed general all-atom force fields.J. Comput. Chem. 2008; 29: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were used, which are based on the General Amber Force Field (45Wang J. Wolf R.M. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Development and testing of a general amber force field.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 (Correction (2004) J. Comput. Chem.26, 114): 1157-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (11698) Google Scholar) and the RESP procedure (46Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. A well-behaved electrostatic potential based method using charge restraints for deriving atom charges: the RESP model.J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5634) Google Scholar), respectively. These parameters have been shown to yield area per lipid values, peak distances, and lipid volumes that converge around values close to experimental ones when simulations were performed under the condition of an isobaric-isothermal ensemble (NPT) with anisotropic pressure control (38Rosso L. Gould I.R. Structure and dynamics of phospholipid bilayers using recently developed general all-atom force fields.J. Comput. Chem. 2008; 29: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). That way, a restraining of the area as in a constant area isobaric-isothermal (NPAT) ensemble can be avoided, which may lead to simulation artifacts (47Tieleman D.P. Marrink S.J. Berendsen H.J. A computer perspective of membranes: molecular dynamics studies of lipid bilayer systems.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 235-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Accordingly, after minimization of the systems for 2000 steps with the protein atom positions restrained, canonical ensemble (NVT) MD was carried out for 50 ps, during which the system was heated from 100 to 300 K, applying harmonic restraints with force constants of 5 kcal mol−1 Å−2 to the protein atoms. Subsequent NPT-MD was used for 150 ps to adjust the density. After gradually reducing the force constants of the harmonic restraints on solute atom positions to zero during 250 ps of NPT-MD, the following 20 ns of NPT-MD at 300 K were used to further equilibrate the system. Equilibration times of this length were shown to be necessary for typical simulation studies involving lipid bilayers (48Anézo C. de Vries A.H. Höltje H.-D. Tieleman D.P. Marrink S.-J. Methodological issues in lipid bilayer simulations.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 9424-9433Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Finally, the following trajectories of 30 ns length generated by NPT-MD were used as production runs with conformations extracted every 20 ps. This resulted in ∼250 ns of total simulation time. Throughout the simulations, the particle mesh Ewald method (49Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. Particle mesh Ewald: an N · log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20829) Google Scholar) was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions, and bond lengths involving bonds to hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE (50Ryckaert J.-P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J. Numerical integration of the Cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of n-alkanes.J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16906) Google Scholar). The time step for all MD simulations was 2 fs, with a direct space, nonbonded cutoff of 8 Å. The temperature was controlled using the Berendsen thermostat (51Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. Molecular dynamics with coupling to an external bath.J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23458) Google Scholar) with a time constant of 10 ps, and the Berendsen barostat (51Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. Molecular dynamics with coupling to an external bath.J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23458) Google Scholar) was used for anisotropic pressure control with a time constant of 2 ps. The production runs were analyzed with ptraj of the Amber suite of programs (41Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The Amber biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6519) Google Scholar). The “watershell” command was used for analyzing the first and second solvation shells with respect to the oxygen atoms of Glu61 (13protonated, 14protonated, 0protonated) or of Asp24 (double mutant) using lower and upper distances of 3.4 and 5.0 Å, respectively. Water densities were determined with the “grid” command using a cubic grid that encompasses the whole simulation cell with a spacing of 1 Å in each direction. Depicted contour surfaces encompass regions with at least 50 counts of water molecules over the 1,500 snapshots analyzed. Prior to calculating root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) and an average structure, the c-ring structure was superimposed with respect to all Cα atoms. A snapshot with a minimal Cα atom r.m.s.d. to the average structure was then taken as the representative structure depicted in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2. χ1 and χ2 angles of residues Glu61 were determined as the torsion angles involving atoms N-Cα-Cβ-Cγ and Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ, respectively. The kink of the outer helices of the c-ring was determined as the angle of the point triple (center of mass of Cα atoms of residues 48–50; Cα atom of residue 61; center of mass of Cα atoms of residues 74–76). The S.E. was determined as the S.D. divided by the square root of the number of independent snapshots. The number of independent snapshots was determined from the time correlation function for the respective analysis. The correlation time was 200 ps in the case of the watershell analysis and 2.2 ns in the case of the analysis of the χ1 and χ2 torsion angles of Glu61. To analyze possible conformational changes of the c-ring, an elastic network model analysis was performed with the ElNémo webserver (52Suhre K. Sanejouand Y.H.

https://openalex.org/W2009777937,"The endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is a selective substrate for the inducible isoform of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS), PGHS-2. Its turnover leads to the formation of glyceryl esters of prostaglandins (PG-Gs), a subset of which elicits agonism at unique, as yet unidentified, receptors. The k(cat)/K(m) values for oxygenation of arachidonic acid (AA) and 2-AG by PGHS-2 are very similar, but the sensitivities of the two substrates to peroxide-dependent activation have not been compared. 15-Hydroperoxy derivatives of AA and 2-AG were found to be comparable in their ability to serve as substrates for the peroxidase activities of PGHS-2, PGHS-1, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). They also were comparable in the activation of AA oxygenation by cyanide-inhibited PGHS-2. However, oxygenation of 2-AG was significantly suppressed relative to AA by the presence of GPx and GSH. Furthermore, 2-AG oxygenation by peroxidase-deficient H388YmPGHS-2 was much less efficient than AA oxygenation. Wild-type rates of 2-AG oxygenation were restored by treatment of H388YmPGHS-2 with hydroperoxide derivatives of AA or 2-AG. RNAi silencing of phospholipid hydroperoxide-specific GPx (GPx4) in NIH/3T3 cells led to increases in cellular peroxidation and in the levels of the isoprostane product, 8-epi-PGF(2α). GPx4 silencing led to 2-4-fold increases in PG-G formation but no change in PG formation. Thus, cellular peroxide tone may be an important determinant of the extent of endocannabinoid oxygenation by PGHS-2."
