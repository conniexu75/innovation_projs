https://openalex.org/W2800142021,"Deep neural networks have achieved impressive successes in fields ranging from object recognition to complex games such as Go1,2. Navigation, however, remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents, with deep neural networks trained by reinforcement learning3-5 failing to rival the proficiency of mammalian spatial behaviour, which is underpinned by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex 6 . Grid cells are thought to provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for coding space7,8 and is critical for integrating self-motion (path integration)6,7,9 and planning direct trajectories to goals (vector-based navigation)7,10,11. Here we set out to leverage the computational functions of grid cells to develop a deep reinforcement learning agent with mammal-like navigational abilities. We first trained a recurrent network to perform path integration, leading to the emergence of representations resembling grid cells, as well as other entorhinal cell types 12 . We then showed that this representation provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in challenging, unfamiliar, and changeable environments-optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep reinforcement learning. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Furthermore, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuroscientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation7,10,11, demonstrating that the latter can be combined with path-based strategies to support navigation in challenging environments."

By contrast, in multiple system atrophy α-Syn accumulates mainly in oligodendrocytes as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) 3 . Here we report that pathological α-Syn in GCIs and Lewy bodies (GCI-α-Syn and LB-α-Syn, respectively) is conformationally and biologically distinct. GCI-α-Syn forms structures that are more compact and it is about 1,000-fold more potent than LB-α-Syn in seeding α-Syn aggregation, consistent with the highly aggressive nature of multiple system atrophy. GCI-α-Syn and LB-α-Syn show no cell-type preference in seeding α-Syn pathology, which raises the question of why they demonstrate different cell-type distributions in Lewy body disease versus multiple system atrophy. We found that oligodendrocytes but not neurons transform misfolded α-Syn into a GCI-like strain, highlighting the fact that distinct α-Syn strains are generated by different intracellular milieus. Moreover, GCI-α-Syn maintains its high seeding activity when propagated in neurons. Thus, α-Syn strains are determined by both misfolded seeds and intracellular environments."
https://openalex.org/W2799705126,"The dense microbial ecosystem in the gut is intimately connected to numerous facets of human biology, and manipulation of the gut microbiota has broad implications for human health. In the absence of profound perturbation, the bacterial strains that reside within an individual are mostly stable over time 1 . By contrast, the fate of exogenous commensal and probiotic strains applied to an established microbiota is variable, generally unpredictable and greatly influenced by the background microbiota2,3. Therefore, analysis of the factors that govern strain engraftment and abundance is of critical importance to the emerging field of microbiome reprogramming. Here we generate an exclusive metabolic niche in mice via administration of a marine polysaccharide, porphyran, and an exogenous Bacteroides strain harbouring a rare gene cluster for porphyran utilization. Privileged nutrient access enables reliable engraftment of the exogenous strain at predictable abundances in mice harbouring diverse communities of gut microbes. This targeted dietary support is sufficient to overcome priority exclusion by an isogenic strain 4 , and enables strain replacement. We demonstrate transfer of the 60-kb porphyran utilization locus into a naive strain of Bacteroides, and show finely tuned control of strain abundance in the mouse gut across multiple orders of magnitude by varying porphyran dosage. Finally, we show that this system enables the introduction of a new strain into the colonic crypt ecosystem. These data highlight the influence of nutrient availability in shaping microbiota membership, expand the ability to perform a broad spectrum of investigations in the context of a complex microbiota, and have implications for cell-based therapeutic strategies in the gut."
https://openalex.org/W2799333965,"The generation of mitochondrial superoxide (O2−·) by reverse electron transport (RET) at complex I causes oxidative damage in pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion injury, but also provides the precursor to H2O2 production in physiological mitochondrial redox signaling. Here, we quantified the factors that determine mitochondrial O2−· production by RET in isolated heart mitochondria. Measuring mitochondrial H2O2 production at a range of proton-motive force (Δp) values and for several coenzyme Q (CoQ) and NADH pool redox states obtained with the uncoupler p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, we show that O2−· production by RET responds to changes in O2 concentration, the magnitude of Δp, and the redox states of the CoQ and NADH pools. Moreover, we determined how expressing the alternative oxidase from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis to oxidize the CoQ pool affected RET-mediated O2−· production at complex I, underscoring the importance of the CoQ pool for mitochondrial O2−· production by RET. An analysis of O2−· production at complex I as a function of the thermodynamic forces driving RET at complex I revealed that many molecules that affect mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production do so by altering the overall thermodynamic driving forces of RET, rather than by directly acting on complex I. These findings clarify the factors controlling RET-mediated mitochondrial O2−· production in both pathological and physiological conditions. We conclude that O2−· production by RET is highly responsive to small changes in Δp and the CoQ redox state, indicating that complex I RET represents a major mode of mitochondrial redox signaling.

The production of O2−· at complex I can be driven by reverse electron transport (RET) by a highly reduced coenzyme Q (CoQ) pool and a large proton-motive force (Δp), which together drive electrons backward through complex I and lead to a dramatic increase in O2−· production (Fig. 1) (9Pryde K.R.

A particularly intriguing aspect of RET is that it does not require damage to, or inhibition of, the respiratory chain (1Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem.

As RET responds sensitively to physiological variables, O2−· production by complex I can be modulated under physiological conditions (1Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417 (19061483): 1-1310.1042/BJ20081386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5238) Google Scholar, 9Pryde K.R. Hirst J.

Hence, there is considerable interest in understanding the mechanisms by which mitochondria regulate O2−· production at complex I by RET as a physiological signaling process. Here, we quantified the factors that determine RET in isolated heart mitochondria. To do this, we measured H2O2 generation as a function of the membrane potential (Δψ) and of the reduction state of the CoQ and NADH pools. This was done by altering Δψ with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and also oxidizing the CoQ pool by ectopic expression within heart mitochondria of the alternative oxidase (AOX) from Ciona intestinalis (16Szibor M. Dhandapani P.K. Dufour E. Holmström K.M. Zhuang Y. Salwig I. Wittig I. Heidler J. Gizatullina Z. Gainutdinov T. Fuchs H. Gailus-Durner V. de Angelis M.H. Nandania J.

Mech. 2017; 10 (28067626): 163-17110.1242/dmm.027839Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed the dependence of RET O2−· production on O2 concentration, [O2], and last, we determined how compounds known to alter mitochondrial ROS production affect RET. Together, these data provide a complete description of mitochondrial O2−· production by RET and indicate how this process contributes to oxidative damage and redox signaling. To assess the factors that determine O2−· production by RET at complex I, we used isolated heart mitochondria. H2O2 efflux from mitochondria is proportional to O2−· production, assuming that O2−· is converted to H2O2 by matrix MnSOD and that H2O2 degradation by peroxidases is similar across all conditions assessed (1Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417 (19061483): 1-1310.1042/BJ20081386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5238) Google Scholar). Whereas H2O2 movement across the plasma membrane is facilitated by aquaporins (17Bienert G.P. Møller A.L. Kristiansen K.A. Schulz A. Møller I.M. Schjoerring J.K. Jahn T.P. Specific aquaporins facilitate the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide across membranes.J. Biol.

Evidence against functionally significant aquaporin expression in mitochondria.J. Biol.

Thus, measuring H2O2 efflux enables us to infer how O2−· production by RET at complex I responds to mitochondrial state. Three factors are critical in determining O2−· production by RET: the Δp and the redox states of the mitochondrial CoQ and NADH pools (Fig. 1) (1Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417 (19061483): 1-1310.1042/BJ20081386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5238) Google Scholar). The O2 concentration is also likely to affect O2−· production (1Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417 (19061483): 1-1310.1042/BJ20081386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5238) Google Scholar); however, these experiments were in air-saturated incubation medium ([O2] ∼200 μm); the dependence of O2−· production on [O2] was determined later. The dependence of mitochondrial H2O2 production on these three variables was measured in parallel (Fig. 2). Δp was measured as Δψ from the distribution of the lipophilic methyltriphenylphosphonium (TPMP) cation (21Ross M.F. Prime T.A. Abakumova I. James A.M. Porteous C.M. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. Rapid and extensive uptake and activation of hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium cations within cells.Biochem. J. 2008; 411 (18294140): 633-64510.1042/BJ20080063Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Whereas this does not measure the pH gradient (ΔpH) across the inner membrane, ΔpH is a smaller (∼10–20%) component of Δp than Δψ and here is assumed to be invariant. The redox state of the CoQ pool was assessed by measuring its percentage reduction by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2C). The redox state of the NADH pool was inferred from NAD(P)H fluorescence. Although this cannot distinguish between NADH and NADPH, the mitochondrial NADPH pool is thought to contribute less to changes in this variable (22Murphy M.P. Mitochondrial thiols in antioxidant protection and redox signaling: distinct roles for glutathionylation and other thiol modifications.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2012; 16 (21954972): 476-49510.1089/ars.2011.4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar); hence, this method gives a reasonable assessment of the NADH pool redox state (Fig. 2D). The addition of succinate to heart mitochondria led to extensive H2O2 production (Fig. 2A), a large Δψ (Fig. 2B), and highly reduced CoQ (Fig. 2C) and NAD(P)H (Fig. 2D) pools. The addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone decreased H2O2 production without affecting Δψ (Fig. 2B) or the CoQ pool (Fig. 2C), but there was oxidation of the NAD(P)H pool (Fig. 2D). These findings are consistent with H2O2 production originating from complex I by RET (1Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417 (19061483): 1-1310.1042/BJ20081386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5238) Google Scholar). To explore the dependence of RET on Δψ and the redox state of the CoQ and NAD(P)H pools, we measured these variables with increasing amounts of the uncoupler FCCP. The gradual decrease in H2O2 production that resulted (Fig. 2A) was associated with a decrease in Δψ (Fig. 2B) and oxidation of the CoQ (Fig. 2C) and NAD(P)H (Fig. 2D) pools. The matrix pH has been suggested to alter RET directly at complex I, independently of its role as the ΔpH component of Δp (23Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Inhibitors of the quinone-binding site allow rapid superoxide production from mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I).J. Biol.

Hence, we next used the K+/H+ exchanger nigericin to decrease the matrix pH from ∼7.7 to that of the incubation medium (pH 7.4), thereby abolishing the ΔpH component of Δp. Importantly, the magnitude of Δp will not change, due to a compensatory increase of ∼20 mV in Δψ (Fig. 2B). Nigericin resulted in an oxidation of the CoQ (Fig. 2C) and NAD(P)H pools (Fig. 2D) and a decrease in H2O2 efflux (Fig. 2A). Together, these data show a strong dependence of RET at complex I on the magnitude of Δp and on the CoQ and NAD(P)H redox states. To analyze the effects of CoQ pool redox state on O2−· production by RET, independently of effects on Δp, we utilized mice expressing the AOX from C. intestinalis (16Szibor M. Dhandapani P.K.

AOX transfers electrons from CoQH2 directly to O2, bypassing complex IV, and thus acts as a safety valve to prevent the excessive reduction of the CoQ pool (25El-Khoury R. Dufour E. Rak M.

The AOX protein was present in heart mitochondria from AOX+/− knock-in mice (Fig. 3A) and was catalytically active, as respiration in mitochondria from WT mice was inhibited by cyanide, whereas mitochondria from AOX mice continued to respire, but this residual respiration was sensitive to the AOX inhibitor N-propyl gallate (Fig. 3B). Mitochondrial H2O2 efflux during succinate oxidation was decreased by AOX expression as shown previously (16Szibor M. Dhandapani P.K. Dufour E. Holmström K.M. Zhuang Y. Salwig I. Wittig I. Heidler J.

This was not due to a decrease in Δψ (Fig. 3D); however, the CoQ pool was more oxidized in mitochondria containing AOX (27Dry I.B. Moore A.L. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Regulation of alternative pathway activity in plant mitochondria: nonlinear relationship between electron flux and the redox poise of the quinone pool.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273 (2757390): 148-15710.1016/0003-9861(89)90173-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E). These findings show that the expression of AOX affects O2−· production by RET at complex I by oxidizing the CoQ pool and further support the importance of CoQ pool redox state in determining mitochondrial O2−· production by RET. As the generation of O2−· by mitochondria requires that O2 react with a protein-bound electron carrier, the rate of O2−· production will probably depend on the [O2] (1Murphy M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species.Biochem. J. 2009; 417 (19061483): 1-1310.1042/BJ20081386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5238) Google Scholar). To assess this dependence, we measured mitochondrial H2O2 efflux at different [O2] (Fig. 4). As the apparent Km of cytochrome oxidase for O2 is very low (< 1 μm) (28Wikstrom M. Krab K. Saraste M. Cytochrome Oxidase: A Synthesis. Academic Press, London1981Google Scholar), Δp and the redox state of the CoQ and NADH pools will not vary with [O2]. The assessment of H2O2 efflux at different [O2] relies on the conversion of Amplex Red to its fluorescent product resorufin catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP); hence, we first demonstrated that the fluorescence of resorufin (Fig. 4A, inset) and the conversion of Amplex Red to resorufin (Fig. 4A) were both independent of [O2]. We then measured mitochondrial H2O2 generation by RET and showed that it was proportional to [O2] and was abolished by excess FCCP (Fig. 4B). In contrast, production of H2O2 by NADH-linked substrates in the presence of rotenone (Fig. 4C) or from complex III upon inhibition of succinate respiration by antimycin (Fig. 4C) also showed increased H2O2 production with [O2], but in this case ROS production reached a plateau as [O2] increased. Thus, production of O2−· by RET at complex I is proportional to [O2]. A number of potentially therapeutic compounds are thought to act, at least in part, by decreasing mitochondrial ROS production. Therefore, we set out to assess some of these compounds to determine whether they altered RET at complex I. The compounds tested were as follows: MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant based on ubiquinone (29Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Selective targeting of a redox-active ubiquinone to mitochondria within cells: antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties.J. Biol.

J. 2008; 411 (18294140): 633-64510.1042/BJ20080063Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); SS31, a peptide composed of d-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH2 (30Szeto H.H. Schiller P.W. Novel therapies targeting inner mitochondrial membrane–from discovery to clinical development.Pharm.

Jones A.J. Pollak M.N. Hirst J. Effects of metformin and other biguanides on oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.Biochem. J. 2014; 462 (25017630): 475-48710.1042/BJ20140620Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 32Owen M.R. Doran E. Halestrap A.P.

J. 2000; 348 (10839993): 607-61410.1042/bj3480607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). We first assessed whether these compounds affected H2O2 efflux by RET at complex I. All of the compounds, except SS31, decreased mitochondrial O2−· production by RET to some extent (Fig. 5A). As RET at complex I is very sensitive to the magnitude of Δψ and redox state of the CoQ pool, these compounds may affect RET indirectly by altering these bioenergetic variables rather than by directly interacting with complex I to block RET-dependent O2−· production. Consistent with this interpretation, all of the compounds decreased Δψ (Fig. 5B), and some affected the redox states of the CoQ and NAD(P)H pools (Fig. 5, C and D). Together, these findings suggest that the effects of these compounds on RET at complex I may be indirect due to effects on Δψ and perhaps on the redox states of the NAD(P)H and CoQ pools. Measuring H2O2 production by mitochondria in parallel with Δψ and the redox state of the CoQ pool indicated that O2−· production by RET at complex I was very sensitive to both variables (Figure 2, Figure 3). To illustrate the dependence of RET on Δψ and redox state of the CoQ pool, we replotted the data from Fig. 2 to show H2O2 production as a function of both Δψ and CoQ redox state (Fig. 6). This 3D plot makes evident the very steep dependence of H2O2 production on Δψ and on CoQ redox state, confirming the exquisite sensitivity of O2−· production by RET at complex I to these two physiological variables. Whereas Fig. 6 shows clearly that decreasing Δψ and oxidizing the CoQ pool lowers RET, it does not provide a quantitative basis to allow us to infer whether the effects of nigericin shown in Fig. 2A and those of the various compounds shown in Fig. 5A are due to direct interactions with complex I itself or are indirect effects due to altering the d"

However, resistance to trastuzumab-based therapy remains a major clinical problem for women with HER2+ breast cancer. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are suggested to be responsible for drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Notch signaling has been shown to promote BCSC survival and self-renewal. Trastuzumab-resistant cells have increased Notch-1 expression. Notch signaling drives cell proliferation in vitro and is required for tumor recurrence in vivo. We demonstrate herein a mechanism by which Notch-1 is required for trastuzumab resistance by repressing PTEN expression to contribute to activation of ERK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, Notch-1-mediated inhibition of PTEN is necessary for BCSC survival in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells mimics effects of Notch-1 knockdown on bulk cell proliferation and BCSC survival. These findings suggest that Notch-1 contributes to trastuzumab resistance by repressing PTEN and this may lead to hyperactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, high Notch-1 and low PTEN mRNA expression may predict poorer overall survival in women with breast cancer. Notch-1 protein expression predicts poorer survival in women with HER2+ breast cancer. These results support a potential future clinical trial combining anti-Notch-1 and anti-MEK/ERK therapy for trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer."

By estimating pooled OLS regressions with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors in order to account for cross-sectional dependence, the results confirm the EKC hypothesis in the case of emissions of sulfur oxides and emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds. In addition to pooled estimations, the output of fixed-effects regressions with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors support the EKC hypothesis for greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas emissions intensity of energy consumption, emissions of nitrogen oxides, emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds and emissions of ammonia. Additionally, the empirical findings from panel vector error correction model reveal a short-run unidirectional causality from GDP per capita growth to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a bidirectional causal link between primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, since there occurred no causal link between economic growth and primary energy consumption, the neo-classical view was confirmed, namely the neutrality hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2799281626,"The stem cell transcription factor Sox2 is highly expressed in many cancers where it is thought to mark cancer stem cells (CSCs). In osteosarcomas, the most common bone malignancy, high Sox2 expression marks and maintains a fraction of tumor-initiating cells that show all the properties of CSC. Knockdown of Sox2 expression abolishes tumorigenicity and suppresses the CSC phenotype. Here we show that, in a mouse model of osteosarcoma, osteoblast-specific Sox2 conditional knockout (CKO) causes a drastic reduction in the frequency and onset of tumors. The rare tumors detected in the Sox2 CKO animals were all Sox2 positive, indicating that they arose from cells that had escaped Sox2 deletion. Furthermore, Sox2 inactivation in cultured osteosarcoma cells by CRISPR/CAS technology leads to a loss of viability and proliferation of the entire cell population. Inactivation of the YAP gene, a major Hippo pathway effector which is a direct Sox2 target, causes similar results and YAP overexpression rescues cells from the lethality caused by Sox2 inactivation. These effects were osteosarcoma-specific, suggesting a mechanism of cell “addiction” to Sox2-initiated pathways. The requirement of Sox2 for osteosarcoma formation as well as for the survival of the tumor cells suggests that disruption of Sox2-initiated pathways could be an effective strategy for the treatment of osteosarcoma."

Here, we show that a potent GC, dexamethasone (Dex), activates transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling, leading to GC-induced ECM accumulation, ER stress, and IOP elevation. Dex increased both the precursor and bioactive forms of TGFβ2 in conditioned medium and activated TGFβ-induced SMAD signaling in primary human TM cells. Dex also activated TGFβ2 in the aqueous humor and TM of a mouse model of Dex-induced ocular hypertension. We further show that Smad3−/− mice are protected from Dex-induced ocular hypertension, ER stress, and ECM accumulation. Moreover, treating WT mice with a selective TGFβ receptor kinase I inhibitor, LY364947, significantly decreased Dex-induced ocular hypertension. Of note, knockdown of the ER stress–induced activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), or C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), completely prevented Dex-induced TGFβ2 activation and ECM accumulation in TM cells.

However, the diversity and virulence profiles of L. monocytogenes isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 L. monocytogenes isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, Listeria pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the L. monocytogenes present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease."

The aim of this study was to experimentally investigate this multifactorial problem throughout the laying period and to compare the prevalence and severity in different layer lines and different housing systems. High performing white (WLA) and brown (BLA) pure bred layer lines and low performing white (R11, G11) and brown layer lines (L68) were kept in both single cages and a floor housing system. A total of 97 hens (19 or 20 from each line, respectively) were repeatedly radiographed in the 35th, 51st and 72nd week of age. Fracture prevalence increased with age (p<0.001). The proportion of deviated keel bone area increased only for caged BLA, WLA and R11 hens (p<0.05) and was significantly higher for caged WLA and R11 hens compared to floor-housed WLA and R11 hens in the 72nd week of age (p<0.05). In the 72nd week of age hens in the floor housing system showed significantly more fractures than hens kept in cages (p<0.05). Prevalence of keel bone deviations was significantly higher in the white layer line R11 but significantly lower in the white layer line G11 compared to both brown layer lines and WLA (p<0.05). Brown layers showed significantly more fractures than white layers (p<0.05) in the 51st and 72nd week of age. Within the brown layers there was a significantly lower prevalence of deviations (p<0.05) and fractures (p<0.05) in the low performing (L68) compared to the high performing line (BLA).

https://openalex.org/W2801550495,"MASTL kinase is essential for correct progression through mitosis, with loss of MASTL causing chromosome segregation errors, mitotic collapse and failure of cytokinesis. However, in cancer MASTL is most commonly amplified and overexpressed. This correlates with increased chromosome instability in breast cancer and poor patient survival in breast, ovarian and lung cancer. Global phosphoproteomic analysis of immortalised breast MCF10A cells engineered to overexpressed MASTL revealed disruption to desmosomes, actin cytoskeleton, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and p38 stress kinase signalling pathways. Notably, these pathways were also disrupted in patient samples that overexpress MASTL. In MCF10A cells, these alterations corresponded with a loss of contact inhibition and partial epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition, which disrupted migration and allowed cells to proliferate uncontrollably in 3D culture. Furthermore, MASTL overexpression increased aberrant mitotic divisions resulting in increased micronuclei formation. Mathematical modelling indicated that this delay was due to continued inhibition of PP2A-B55, which delayed timely mitotic exit. This corresponded with an increase in DNA damage and delayed transit through interphase. There were no significant alterations to replication kinetics upon MASTL overexpression, however, inhibition of p38 kinase rescued the interphase delay, suggesting the delay was a G2 DNA damage checkpoint response. Importantly, knockdown of MASTL, reduced cell proliferation, prevented invasion and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, indicating the potential of future therapies that target MASTL. Taken together, these results suggest that MASTL overexpression contributes to chromosome instability and metastasis, thereby decreasing breast cancer patient survival."

Phosphorylation of Thr-186 on the activation loop (T-loop) of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is essential for its kinase activity and assembly of CDK9 and cyclin T1 (CycT1) to form functional P-TEFb. Phosphorylation of a second highly conserved T-loop site, Ser-175, alters the competitive binding of Tat and the host recruitment factor bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) to P-TEFb. Here, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms that regulate these key phosphorylation events required for HIV transcription. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the CDK9/CycT1 interface is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding of pThr-186 by an arginine triad and Glu-96 of CycT1. Arginine triad substitutions that disrupted CDK9/CycT1 assembly accumulated Thr-186–dephosphorylated CDK9 associated with the cytoplasmic Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone. The Hsp90/Cdc37/CDK9 complex was also present in resting T cells, which lack CycT1. Hsp90 inhibition in primary T cells blocked P-TEFb assembly, disrupted Thr-186 phosphorylation, and suppressed proviral reactivation. The selective CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 blocked CDK9 phosphorylation at Ser-175, and in vitro kinase assays confirmed that CDK7 activity is principally responsible for Ser-175 phosphorylation. Mutation of Ser-175 to Lys had no effect on CDK9 kinase activity or P-TEFb assembly but strongly suppressed both HIV expression and BRD4 binding.

The overall effect of these phospho-modifications by P-TEFb is to remove the blocks to elongation imposed by NELF and DSIF and to stimulate efficient elongation and co-transcriptional processing of proviral transcripts.

Thus, the 7SK snRNP complex provides an exchangeable pool of P-TEFb that can be readily utilized to stimulate gene transcription (30Mbonye U. Karn J.

In a recent proteomics study designed to identify modifications on HEXIM1 that regulate the sequestration of P-TEFb by 7SK snRNP, we found that 7SK snRNP also serves to retain P-TEFb in the nucleus, suggesting that exchange of P-TEFb subunits between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is a regulatory feature of this system (31Mbonye U.R.

Mechanisms in primary T cells that govern the activation of P-TEFb and promote its assembly with Tat for efficient reactivation of latent HIV are incompletely understood. Here, we studied the impact of key phosphorylation events on the control of P-TEFb at two key steps. Step 1 is the exchange of CDK9 from an Hsp90/Cdc37 cytoplasmic complex to the 7SK RNP complex that requires Thr-186 phosphorylation. In resting memory CD4+ T cells, which form the bulk of the latent HIV reservoir (32Finzi D. Blankson J. Siliciano J.D. Margolick J.B. Chadwick K. Pierson T. Smith K. Lisziewicz J. Lori F. Flexner C.

Here, we demonstrated that in resting CD4+ T cells Hsp90/Cdc37 stabilizes the basal expression of CDK9 prior to the elevation of CycT1 protein levels.

Using molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis approaches, we demonstrated that an intramolecular Arg-65/Arg-148/Arg-172 hydrogen bond network coordinated by pThr-186 and extending to Glu-96 of CycT1 is required for heterodimer formation. Dephosphorylation of pThr-186 releases CDK9 from CycT1 and permits its interactions with the Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone complex in the cytoplasm of T cells. Conversely, the disruption of the CDK9/Hsp90/Cdc37 complex is associated with phosphorylation of Thr-186, reassembly with CycT1, and incorporation of P-TEFb into 7SK snRNP. Step 2 is the exchange of P-TEFb between the 7SK RNP complex and Tat, and/or Brd4 is regulated by CDK7 phosphorylation of Ser-175. Although Tat forms the majority of its contacts with the CycT1 subunit, the N-terminal end of its activation domain can potentially form two hydrogen-bonding interactions with the T-loop of CDK9 (38Tahirov T.H. Babayeva N.D. Varzavand K. Cooper J.J. Sedore S.C. Price D.H.

These CDK9–Tat intermolecular interactions can potentially be further strengthened by an additional hydrogen bond between pSer-175 and Lys-12 of Tat (36Mbonye U.R. Gokulrangan G. Datt M. Dobrowolski C. Cooper M. Chance M.R. Karn J. Phosphorylation of CDK9 at Ser-175 enhances HIV transcription and is a marker of activated P-TEFb in CD4(+) T lymphocytes.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 (23658523)e100333810.1371/journal.ppat.1003338Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have previously identified Ser-175 to be a CDK9 phosphorylation site marking activated P-TEFb in T cells that is excluded from 7SK snRNP (36Mbonye U.R. Gokulrangan G. Datt M. Dobrowolski C. Cooper M. Chance M.R. Karn J. Phosphorylation of CDK9 at Ser-175 enhances HIV transcription and is a marker of activated P-TEFb in CD4(+) T lymphocytes.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 (23658523)e100333810.1371/journal.ppat.1003338Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the kinase(s) responsible for this key regulatory event has not been identified. Here, we present evidence that CDK7 is responsible for this modification based on cell-based studies in T cells using the selective inhibitor THZ1 and in vitro kinase assays. Ser-175 also mediates the interaction between P-TEFb and BRD4, a bromodomain extra-terminal protein that is a major recruiter of P-TEFb to cellular genes. Immunoprecipitation of P-TEFb from HIV-infected T cells and studies of the Ser-175 to Lys mutation substantiated the hypothesis that pSer-175 favors Tat's interaction with P-TEFb over BRD4. We have found previously that blocking the phosphorylation of Thr-186 by site-directed mutagenesis not only abrogates in vitro CDK9 kinase activity but also severely disrupts its heterodimer interactions with the CycT1 subunit (36Mbonye U.R. Gokulrangan G. Datt M. Dobrowolski C. Cooper M. Chance M.R. Karn J.

Our findings were inconsistent with reports that while mutations of Thr-186 (T186A or T186E) clearly abolished incorporation of CDK9 into 7SK snRNP, they did not disrupt CDK9-CycT1 heterodimer assembly (22Li Q.

In all published P-TEFb X-ray structures, phosphorylated Thr-186 is positioned to coordinate an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network containing three arginine residues (Arg-65, Arg-148, and Arg-172). In addition, Arg-65 and Arg-172 are positioned to form intermolecular salt bridge interactions with Glu-96 of CycT1 (Fig. 1A). This hydrogen bond network, nucleated at the phospho-Thr, therefore extends to the CDK/cyclin dimer interface. A homologous interface is observed in the CDK2/cyclin A X-ray structure, where it was first proposed to be important for stabilizing heterodimer assembly (41Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Structural basis of cyclin-dependent kinase activation by phosphorylation.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3 (8756328): 696-70010.1038/nsb0896-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Thr-186 phosphorylation in its coordination with the Arg triad, we performed 100-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of energy-minimized structures for both the phosphorylated and mutated form of Thr-186 using the CDK9/CycT1 PDB code 3BLQ X-ray structure as template (42Baumli S. Lolli G. Lowe E.D. Troiani S. Rusconi L. Bullock A.N. Debreczeni J.E. Knapp S. Johnson L.N. The structure of P-TEFb (CDK9/cyclin T1), its complex with flavopiridol and regulation by phosphorylation.EMBO J. 2008; 27 (18566585): 1907-191810.1038/emboj.2008.121Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Results from MD simulations revealed that the T186A mutation destabilizes the triad network (Arg-65, Arg-148, and Arg-172), evidenced by its increase in radius of gyration (Rg), compared with the phosphorylated form (Fig. 1B). The greater fluctuation of Rg observed in the T186A simulation further showed that the Arg triad experienced increased structural flexibility due to the loss of the phosphate at Thr-186. Although T186A did not appear to significantly affect dynamic interactions at the dimer interface between CDK9 Arg-65 and CycT1 Glu-96, it clearly caused an increased perturbation of the intermolecular distance between CDK9 Arg-172 and CycT1 Glu-96 (Fig. S1). Thus, these simulation results suggest that phosphorylation of CDK9 at Thr-186 is critical in coordinating and stabilizing the Arg network to enable proper dimer interactions with CycT1. To confirm that pThr-186 functions to promote the assembly of P-TEFb by positioning Arg-65 and Arg-172 to favorably interact with CycT1, mutagenesis experiments were performed. Cells were infected with retroviral vectors expressing FLAG–CDK9. Complexes containing the FLAG–CDK9 were purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by Western blots using antibodies to CDK9, pThr-186 CDK9, and CycT1; the 7SK RNP complex components HEXIM1 and LARP7; and Hsp90 and Cdc37 (Fig. 2). Mutation of CDK9 at either Arg-65, Arg-148, or Arg-172 to Ala disrupted intracellular P-TEFb assembly resulting in the loss of association with CycT1, HEXIM1, and LARP7. These phenotypes were equivalent to the T186A mutant (Fig. 2, A–C, and Fig. S2, A and C). Interestingly, in addition to disrupting heterodimer assembly and 7SK snRNP association, the R65A and R172A point mutations also caused a loss of the phosphate at Thr-186 but, importantly, retained CDK9 interactions with the Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. S2C). It is also noteworthy that 7SK snRNP dissociation to free up P-TEFb can be triggered by the transient dephosphorylation of Thr-186 (43Chen R. Liu M. Li H. Xue Y. Ramey W.N. He N. Ai N. Luo H. Zhu Y. Zhou N. Zhou Q. PP2B and PP1alpha cooperatively disrupt 7SK snRNP to release P-TEFb for transcription in response to Ca2+ signaling.Genes Dev. 2008; 22 (18483222): 1356-136810.1101/gad.1636008Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 44Gudipaty S.A.

A modest, but statistically significant, enhancement of CDK9 association with Hsp90/Cdc37 was observed with the T186A mutant (Fig. 2C). CDK9 mutants that did not stably interact with CycT1 and were not phosphorylated at Thr-186 (R65A, R172A, and T186A) were found to be catalytically inactive (Fig. S3). Mutation of CycT1 at Glu-96 to Ala had a modest disruptive effect on P-TEFb assembly and interactions with 7SK snRNP, but P-TEFb assembly and interactions with 7SK snRNP were abolished upon mutation of Glu-96 to Lys (Fig. S2B). Similarly, mutation of CDK9 at Lys-164, located right near the start of the activation loop and that was identified by tandem MS to be subject to acetylation (Fig. S4), resulted in the loss of P-TEFb assembly coupled with the dephosphorylation of Thr-186 (Fig. S5, A and B). None of these CDK9 mutations had an adverse effect on the extent of proviral reactivation in Jurkat 2D10 T cells (Fig. S6). It seems likely that because these mutants fail to interact with CycT1, they are unable to disrupt formation of functional P-TEFb with the endogenous CDK9, which remains at sufficient levels to support proviral transcription. The mutagenesis studies described above confirm that the coordination of an intramolecular CDK9 Arg hydrogen-bonding network by pThr-186, which extends to Glu-96 of CycT1, is critical for stable heterodimer interactions. We therefore hypothesized that in the absence of P-TEFb assembly, CDK9 becomes bound to Hsp90/Cdc37 and that the phosphorylation of CDK9 at Thr-186 is required for the de novo assembly of catalytically competent P-TEFb. Unstimulated memory CD4+ T cells, are highly restricted for CycT1 expression (Fig. 3) (28Dow E.C. Liu H. Rice A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2802787510,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of several human cancers such as Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), which represents the most common AIDS-associated malignancy that lacks effective treatment options. Despite its clear role in AIDS malignancies, the fact that only a small set of KSHV-infected patients will eventually develop these tumors implies that additional co-factors are required for the development of KSHV-related cancers. In the current study, we demonstrate for the first time that KSHV de novo infection or viral latent proteins are able to transactivate human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) through a variety of cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional factors. Moreover, we found that HERV-K transactivation, particularly activation of its encoded oncogenic NP9 protein, plays an important role in KSHV pathogenesis and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide innovative insights into the mechanisms of HERV-K transactivation contributing to viral oncogenesis, which may represent a promising target for KS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2802189820,"The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity.

In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cell migration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This is accompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the associated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 is particularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancer patients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulation of α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cells demonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1 expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promote the migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identify α-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2799601876,"To fertilize an egg, sperm must reside in the female reproductive tract to undergo several maturational changes that are collectively referred to as capacitation. From a molecular point of view, the HCO3−-dependent activation of the atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (ADCY10) is one of the first events that occurs during capacitation and leads to the subsequent cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Capacitation is also accompanied by hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane. We previously reported that PKA activation is necessary for CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel) activity and for the modulation of membrane potential (Em). However, the main HCO3− transporters involved in the initial transport and the PKA-dependent Em changes are not well known nor characterized. Here, we analyzed how the activity of CFTR regulates Em during capacitation and examined its relationship with an electrogenic Na+/HCO3− cotransporter (NBC) and epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs). We observed that inhibition of both CFTR and NBC decreased HCO3− influx, resulting in lower PKA activity, and that events downstream of the cAMP activation of PKA are essential for the regulation of Em. Addition of a permeable cAMP analog partially rescued the inhibitory effects caused by these inhibitors. HCO3− also produced a rapid membrane hyperpolarization mediated by ENaC channels, which contribute to the regulation of Em during capacitation. Altogether, we demonstrate for the first time, that NBC cotransporters and ENaC channels are essential in the CFTR-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and Em regulation during human sperm capacitation.

Mammalian sperm are unable to fertilize an egg soon after they are ejaculated. Fertilization only becomes possible after the sperm have spent time in the female reproductive tract. During this time, sperm undergo several molecular and cellular changes in a process known as capacitation (1Austin C.R. Observations on the penetration of the sperm in the mammalian egg.Aust. J. Sci.

At the cellular level, capacitation prepares sperm to develop hyperactivated motility and to undergo acrosomal exocytosis (3Buffone M.G. Hirohashi N. Gerton G.

In mice, it is postulated that a Na+-dependent electrogenic HCO3− incorporation through members of the Na+/HCO3− cotransporter (NBC) is responsible for the initial anion entrance (11Demarco I.A.

It is also claimed that in mice the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel (CFTR) works in association with other Cl−/HCO3− cotransporters to provide a sustained uptake of HCO3− (13Chávez J.C.

Recent evidence from our group demonstrated that inhibition of CFTR affects HCO3− uptake resulting in low PKA activity and inhibition of cAMP/PKA-downstream events such as the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr), hyperactivated motility, and acrosome reaction (9Puga Molina L.C.

For this reason, we postulated that an initial increase in PKA activity is necessary to activate CFTR channels and produce a sustained increase in HCO3− and cAMP.

In addition, it has been demonstrated that ENaC is involved in controlling Em in mouse sperm (28Hernández-González E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. López-González I.

Thus, we hypothesize that CFTR activity is necessary for ENaC inhibition, and therefore, for maintaining of lower Na+ permeability and regulation of Em during capacitation. Our working hypothesis is that HCO3− is initially and rapidly incorporated in human sperm by NBC, leading to activation of PKA and CFTR during capacitation. Activation of CFTR is coupled to the inhibition of Na+ transport by ENaC, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization (27Berdiev B.K. Qadri Y.J. Benos D.J.

Thus, our goal is to study the role of NBC and ENaC in the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway associated with capacitation and its participation in the regulation of Em in human sperm. We have previously demonstrated the role of CFTR in the uptake of HCO3− during capacitation (9Puga Molina L.C. Pinto N.A. Torres Rodríguez P. Romarowski A. Vicens Sanchez A. Visconti P.E. Darszon A. Treviño C.L. Buffone M.G. Essential role of CFTR in PKA-dependent phosphorylation, alkalinization, and hyperpolarization during human sperm capacitation.J. Cell Physiol. 2017; 232 (27714810): 1404-141410.1002/jcp.25634Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, because CFTR requires phosphorylation by PKA to be active, we postulate that an initial HCO3− transport occurs in human sperm to stimulate ADCY10 and produce the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA. Previous studies in mice postulated that NBC cotransporters are responsible for the initial HCO3− entrance during capacitation (11Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. De La Vega-Beltrán J.L. Hockensmith J.W. Kopf G.S. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. Involvement of a Na+/HCO cotransporter in mouse sperm capacitation.J. Biol.

To test this hypothesis in human sperm, we used a specific and reversible NBC inhibitor, S0859 (31Ch'en F.F. Villafuerte F.C. Swietach P. Cobden P.M. Vaughan-Jones R.D. S0859, an N-cyanosulphonamide inhibitor of sodium-bicarbonate cotransport in the heart.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153 (18204485): 972-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this inhibitor has never been used in sperm. We first evaluated the effect of NBC inhibition in mouse sperm, where there is previous evidence of its function during capacitation. As shown in Fig. 1A, there was a concentration-dependent decrease in the levels of phosphorylation in PKA substrates (pPKA) and tyrosine residues (pTyr) with S0859. Similarly, human sperm incubated with an increasing concentration of S0859 also displayed lower levels of pPKA and pTyr (Fig. 1B). This effect was not due to an impairment in viability as shown in Fig. 1C. To evaluate if inhibition of NBC affects the human sperm Em, sperm were incubated in medium that supports capacitation in the presence of increasing concentrations of S0859. As shown in Fig. 1D, a concentration above 5 μm S0859 caused the maximum depolarization effect. The concentration of 5 μm for S0859 was chosen for all the following experiments because the levels of pTyr and pPKA were significantly decreased, and there is a maximum effect in Em depolarization without affecting viability with respect to the control condition. These results suggest that NBC are involved in HCO3− uptake to trigger activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and regulation on Em. Previous reports indicate that human SLO3 and SLO1 K+ channels participate in the regulation of sperm Em (22Mannowetz N. Naidoo N.M. Choo S.-A. Smith J.F. Lishko P.V. Sara Choo S.-A. Smith J.F.

Thus, we determined whether SLO3 and SLO1 channel activity could be nonspecifically altered by the NBC inhibitor S0859. We tested the effect of 5 μm S0859 on heterologously expressed human SLO3 and SLO1 channels. Our results showed that SLO3 and SLO1 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes were not significantly inhibited by 5 μm S0859 (Fig. 2, A–F). As a control, trimethylammonium (TEA) and Ba2+ (two well-known inhibitors o SLO1 and SLO3 channels, respectively) decreased the recorded currents. We next aimed to determine whether inhibition of NBC by S0859 resulted in lower levels of [Na+]i, as described under “Experimental procedures,” sperm were loaded with the Na+ probe CoroNa Red and BCECF-AM were then analyzed by flow cytometry as shown in Fig. 3, A–D. CoroNa Red was concentrated in the equatorial and postacrosomal regions of human sperm (Fig. 3E) as previously reported in mouse sperm (33Escoffier J. Krapf D. Navarrete F. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. Flow cytometry analysis reveals a decrease in intracellular sodium during sperm capacitation.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 (22302997): 473-48510.1242/jcs.093344Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because CoroNa Red detects mitochondrial [Na+] in other cells (34Baron S. Caplanusi A. van de Ven M. Radu M. Despa S. Lambrichts I. Ameloot M. Steels P. Smets I. Role of mitochondrial Na+ concentration, measured by CoroNa Red, in the protection of metabolically inhibited MDCK cells.J. Am. Soc.

As shown in Fig. 3F, addition of 1 μm CCCP did not significantly affect CoroNa Red fluorescence. Because Na+/K+-ATPase pumps Na+ out of cells while pumping K+ into cells, both against their concentration gradients, we incubated sperm cells with different concentrations of ouabain to increase [Na+]i. As expected, CoroNa Red fluorescence increased after addition of ouabain (Fig. 3G). The maximum effect was observed at 1 μm ouabain, a concentration that affects both α1 and α4 isoforms (35Sanchez G. Nguyen A.-N. Timmerberg B. Tash J.S. Blanco G. The Na,K-ATPase α4 isoform from humans has distinct enzymatic properties and is important for sperm motility.Mol. Hum.

Finally, it was observed that 5 μm S0859 resulted in lower levels of [Na+]i as indicated by CoroNa Red fluorescence assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3H). To further support the role of Na+/HCO3− cotransporters in human sperm, we replaced NaCl in capacitation medium with choline chloride. As shown in Fig. 4A, reducing the Na+ concentration resulted in decreased levels of pPKA and pTyr. Decreasing the [Na+] to 58 mm did not significantly affect the viability of the cells (Fig. 4B). To demonstrate that reducing [Na+]e resulted in lower [Na+]i, we used flow cytometry to assess the levels of [Na+]i in sperm incubated in 58 mm Na+ in the capacitating medium. As shown in Fig. 4C, sperm exposed to lower levels of extracellular Na+ ([Na+]e) displayed lower CoroNa Red fluorescence. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of the cAMP/PKA pathway causes a depolarization in human sperm (9Puga Molina L.C. Pinto N.A. Torres Rodríguez P. Romarowski A. Vicens Sanchez A. Visconti P.E. Darszon A. Treviño C.L. Buffone M.G. Essential role of CFTR in PKA-dependent phosphorylation, alkalinization, and hyperpolarization during human sperm capacitation.J. Cell Physiol. 2017; 232 (27714810): 1404-141410.1002/jcp.25634Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To evaluate if decreasing the [Na+]e impacts the human sperm Em, incubations in medium that supports capacitation with decreasing [Na+]e were performed. Estimation of the sperm Em was assessed by flow cytometry using DISC3(5) as previously described (9Puga Molina L.C. Pinto N.A. Torres Rodríguez P. Romarowski A. Vicens Sanchez A. Visconti P.E. Darszon A. Treviño C.L. Buffone M.G. Essential role of CFTR in PKA-dependent phosphorylation, alkalinization, and hyperpolarization during human sperm capacitation.J. Cell Physiol. 2017; 232 (27714810): 1404-141410.1002/jcp.25634Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4D decreasing the [Na+]e concentration produced Em depolarization in a concentration-dependent manner. Altogether, these results may suggest the participation of an electrogenic NBC in the activation of PKA, and hence CFTR. The presence of NBC inhibitor S0859 during capacitation reduced both pPKA and pTyr levels (Fig. 1B). Addition of permeable cAMP analogs (Br-cAMP) in combination with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (IBMX) restored phosphorylation of PKA substrates (Fig. 5A) and pTyr (Fig. 5B) affected by the presence of S0859. These results are in accordance with the role of NBC upstream PKA activation. Similarly, Br-cAMP/IBMX rescued the depolarization caused by NBC inhibition using S0859 (Fig. 5C). Altogether, these results suggest that NBC participate in the initial uptake of HCO3− upstream for the activation of PKA. When human sperm were incubated in medium lacking HCO3−, the population showed a more depolarized Em compared with the capacitating control condition. Addition of HCO3− to these HCO3−-deprived cells hyperpolarized the plasma membrane to a similar extent to that observed in a capacitated population where HCO3− was present in the medium during incubation (Fig. 6A). To determine the kinetics of this hyperpolarization, we monitored the changes in DISC3(5) upon addition of HCO3− by flow cytometry. In these experiments, as soon as the initial fluorescence value was registered (time = 0 s, prior to the addition of HCO3−), the cells were continuously monitored within the following 4 min after addition of 25 mm HCO3−. In each experiment, the fluorescence median was relativized to maximum fluorescence reached after addition of 1 μm valinomycin, because this Em is assumed to correspond to a constant K+ equilibrium potential value under our conditions. As shown in Fig. 6B, the membrane hyperpolarization caused by addition of HCO3− was noticeable within the first 4 min. Some isoforms of NBC are electrogenic such as NBC1 (SLC4A4, 2HCO3−:1Na+) and NBC2 (SLC4A5, 2HCO3−:1Na+), whereas some are electroneutral such as NBCn1 (SLC4A7) and NBCn2 (SLC4A10), and an electroneutral Na+-driven Cl−/HCO3− exchanger NDCBE (SLC4A8 2 HCO3−:1 Na+). To investigate if an electrogenic NBC contributes to the observed membrane hyperpolarization, cells were incubated with the NBC inhibitor S0859 and challenged with HCO3−. In this condition, the rapid membrane hyperpolarization was inhibited (Fig. 6B, blue line). Furthermore, when sperm were preincubated with CFTR and PKA inhibitors (inh-172 and H89, respectively), hyperpolarization of Em in response to HCO3− was also inhibited (Fig. 6B, green and red lines). This observation indicates that events downstream from NBC activation are required for the HCO3−-mediated rapid hyperpolarization. To further support these observations, human sperm incubated in the absence of HCO3− were challenged with cAMP analogs. According to our hypothesis, the analogs would act downstream of NBC and upstream of PKA and CFTR. As expected, addition of Br-cAMP/IBMX partially rescued the depolarization caused by the absence of HCO3− (Fig. 6C). Quantification of these results are summarized in Fig. 6D. Although CFTR is a Cl− channel, because the Cl− equilibrium potential is close to the sperm resting Em, the opening of CFTR cannot explain a hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane by itself. As we mentioned before (24Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K.

https://openalex.org/W2799992779,"Evaluation of agricultural intensification requires comprehensive analysis of trends in farm performance across physical and socio-economic aspects, which may diverge across farm types. Typical reporting of economic indicators at sectorial or the ""average farm"" level does not represent farm diversity and provides limited insight into the sustainability of specific intensification pathways. Using farm business data from a total of 7281 farm survey observations of English and Welsh dairy farms over a 14-year period we calculate a time series of 16 key performance indicators (KPIs) pertinent to farm structure, environmental and socio-economic aspects of sustainability. We then apply principle component analysis and model-based clustering analysis to identify statistically the number of distinct dairy farm typologies for each year of study, and link these clusters through time using multidimensional scaling. Between 2001 and 2014, dairy farms have largely consolidated and specialized into two distinct clusters: more extensive farms relying predominantly on grass, with lower milk yields but higher labour intensity, and more intensive farms producing more milk per cow with more concentrate and more maize, but lower labour intensity. There is some indication that these clusters are converging as the extensive cluster is intensifying slightly faster than the intensive cluster, in terms of milk yield per cow and use of concentrate feed. In 2014, annual milk yields were 6,835 and 7,500 l/cow for extensive and intensive farm types, respectively, whilst annual concentrate feed use was 1.3 and 1.5 tonnes per cow. For several KPIs such as milk yield the mean trend across all farms differed substantially from the extensive and intensive typologies mean. The indicators and analysis methodology developed allows identification of distinct farm types and industry trends using readily available survey data. The identified groups allow the accurate evaluation of the consequences of the reduction in dairy farm numbers and intensification at national and international scales."
https://openalex.org/W2800695245,"End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D3-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D3-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60-70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans."

Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with Citrobacter rodentium. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with C. rodentium or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and C. rodentium-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of Lactobacillus being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. Lactobacillus abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that Lactobacillus helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses. Our data indicates that restraint stressor can have significant effects on pathogen-induced colonic inflammation and suggest that stressor-induced changes in the microbiota, microbial-produced SCFAs and their receptors may be involved."

First, nucleophilic sulfate needs to attack the α-phosphorus of ATP, catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase, resulting in the formation of APS (adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate) and the release of pyrophosphate (6Mueller J.W. Shafqat N. Adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate: a multifaceted modulator of bifunctional 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate synthases and related enzymes.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (23517310): 3050-305710.1111/febs.12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This reaction lies heavily on the educt side, with an equilibrium constant for APS formation of 10−8 (7Lipmann F.

To pull the reaction toward product formation, pyrophosphatases swiftly cleave the pyrophosphate and APS kinase phosphorylates APS at its ribose 3′ position, resulting in the formation of PAPS (6Mueller J.W.

Crucially, the phenotype of human PAPSS2 deficiency proves that with regard to DHEA sulfation and bone and chondrocyte development, human PAPSS1, the gene encoding the only other PAPS synthase, appears not to be able to compensate for the loss of PAPSS2 gene function. There has been considerable debate about the cause of the divergent functions of the two PAPS synthase isoforms. Differences in subcellular localization have been suggested as an underlying mechanism, with PAPSS1 reported as nuclear protein and PAPSS2 as primarily located in the cytoplasm (17Besset S. Vincourt J.B. Amalric F. Girard J.P.

However, this was recognized as oversimplification as both enzymes actively shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm, guided by conserved nuclear localization and nuclear export signals (18Schröder E. Gebel L. Eremeev A.A. Morgner J. Grum D. Knauer S.K. Bayer P. Mueller J.W.

Another aspect was an apparent difference in specific enzymatic activity. When assayed as pseudo one-step enzymes, PAPSS2 was reported to display a much higher kcat/Km value than PAPSS1 (19Fuda H. Shimizu C. Lee Y.C. Akita H. Strott C.A. Characterization and expression of human bifunctional 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulphate synthase isoforms.Biochem. J. 2002; 365 (11931637): 497-50410.1042/bj20020044Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When assaying only the rate-limiting step of overall PAPS biosynthesis, the APS kinase-catalyzed reaction, this difference was no longer observed (20Grum D. van den Boom J. Neumann D. Matena A. Link N.M. Mueller J.W. A heterodimer of human 3′-phospho-adenosine-5′-phosphosulphate (PAPS) synthases is a new sulphate activating complex.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Differences in tissue-specific distribution of the two PAPS synthases have also been reported (13Noordam C. Dhir V. McNelis J.C. Schlereth F. Hanley N.A. Krone N. Smeitink J.A. Smeets R. Sweep F.C.

Nevertheless, none of those studies could sufficiently explain why the PAPSS1 gene cannot compensate for the loss of PAPSS2 due to inactivating PAPSS2 mutations. Here we report experimental evidence for nonoverlapping functionality of PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 with regard to DHEA sulfation by SULT2A1 (Fig. 1A). Proximity ligation assays (PLAs) detect a novel protein–protein interaction between SULT2A1 and PAPSS2 and molecular docking suggests SULT2A1 contacts the APS kinase domain of PAPSS2. This newly described protein–protein interaction, specific to the PAPSS2 and SULT2A1 isoforms, may guide the directionality of sulfation pathways in tissues with equal expression of PAPS synthases and high expression levels of various sulfotransferases. The adrenal cortex is a major site of DHEA sulfation. We used human adrenocortical NCI-H295R1 cells, which we found to express high levels of SULT2A1 mRNA (ΔCT value 13.4 ± 1.3 relative to 18S rRNA, ± S.D., see also Table S1) and almost identical mRNA levels of PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 (ΔCT values 16.1 ± 0.8 and 15.8 ± 0.9, respectively). We separately targeted SULT2A1 and both PAPS synthase isoforms by siRNA-mediated knockdown, achieving knockdown efficiencies of up to 90% at mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein levels (Fig. 1C). We then carried out functional assays and found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SULT2A1 and PAPSS2 reduced DHEA sulfation rates to 19 and 30%, respectively, whereas depletion of PAPSS1 showed no discernable effect on DHEA sulfation (Fig. 1D). This suggests nonoverlapping functionality of the two human PAPS synthase proteins with regard to DHEA sulfation. To determine whether different enzyme activities may explain the above described differences in functionality, we determined specific APS kinase activities of recombinant PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 proteins in a coupled spectrophotometric assay. APS kinase activity is known to be the rate-limiting step of overall PAPS biosynthesis (12Lansdon E.B. Fisher A.J. Segel I.H. Human 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthetase (isoform 1, brain): kinetic properties of the adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase domains.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15065880): 4356-436510.1021/bi049827mCrossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using two different enzyme batches, performing multiple repeat measurements (Fig. 2A), specific APS kinase activities appeared nondistinguishable, 34.9 ± 17.0 nmol min−1 mg−1 for PAPSS1 and 31.6 ± 10.6 nmol min−1 mg−1 for PAPSS2 (Table 1), in line with previous findings (20Grum D. van den Boom J. Neumann D. Matena A. Link N.M. Mueller J.W. A heterodimer of human 3′-phospho-adenosine-5′-phosphosulphate (PAPS) synthases is a new sulphate activating complex.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Open table in a new tab * Assuming a single nucleotide binding site. ** EC50 was measured in the presence of 50 μM PAPSS protein and 1 μM mant-APS. The nucleotide APS has been reported to be a highly effective modulator of PAPS synthase proteins (4van den Boom J. Heider D. Martin S.R. Pastore A. Mueller J.W. 3′-Phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) synthases, naturally fragile enzymes specifically stabilized by nucleotide binding.J. Biol.

Hence, we determined binding affinity (KD) of a fluorescently labeled APS derivative (mant-APS) to recombinant PAPS synthase proteins (Fig. 2B). Theoretically, APS could bind to all six nucleotide-binding sites of dimeric PAPS synthase proteins (6Mueller J.W. Shafqat N. Adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate: a multifaceted modulator of bifunctional 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate synthases and related enzymes.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (23517310): 3050-305710.1111/febs.12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); but fitting to the Hill equation resulted in very weak cooperativity with Hill coefficients close to 1 (1.09 ± 0.02 and 1.22 ± 0.05 for PAPSS1 and PAPSS2, respectively). Hence, data were fitted assuming one binding site, resulting in apparent KD values of 13.2 ± 0.3 and 23.0 ± 1.6 μm for PAPSS1 and PAPSS2, respectively. Titrations of preformed PAPS synthase–mant-APS complexes with APS confirmed that both nucleotides actually bound to the same site(s) within the enzyme (Fig. 2C). We also attempted to determine ATP sulfurylase activity; however, this was hindered by considerable batch-to-batch variability in PAPSS2 (data not shown). Without any significant differences in the APS kinase activity of PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 and very similar affinities for the modulating APS nucleotide, we conclude that differences in enzymatic activity cannot explain the above described functional differences. To determine whether different cellular localization of PAPS synthases might contribute to their functional differences, we examined subcellular localization variants of PAPS synthases 1 and 2 with preferential nuclear or cytoplasmic localization (18Schröder E. Gebel L. Eremeev A.A. Morgner J. Grum D. Knauer S.K. Bayer P. Mueller J.W. Human PAPS synthase isoforms are dynamically regulated enzymes with access to nucleus and cytoplasm.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (22242175)e2955910.1371/journal.pone.0029559Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for their ability to support DHEA sulfation by SULT2A1 (Fig. 3A). A nonsteroidogenic HEK293 cellular background with no notable expression of these sulfation enzymes was used to co-express PAPS synthase protein variants with cytoplasmic SULT2A1; activity of this sulfation pathway was then tested in DHEA sulfation assays (Fig. 3B). Cytoplasmic PAPSS1 expression only supported DHEA sulfation to 61% of WT protein activity (conversion rates in (nmol DHEA/h) are given in Table S2). Both nuclear PAPS synthases showed less DHEA sulfation than the respective WT protein (72 and 82% of WT for PAPSS1 and PAPSS2, respectively). Only cytoplasmic PAPSS2 was as effective in supporting DHEA sulfation as WT PAPSS2 (Fig. 3B). This effect of subcellular location on the ability of PAPSS2 to support DHEA sulfation by SULT2A1 led us to hypothesize that these sulfation pathway proteins might physically interact. To test for a physical interaction between PAPSS2 and SULT2A1, we employed PLA technology after demonstrating that this putative interaction was not amenable to detection by GFP-trap pulldown (Fig. S1A). Hypothesizing that the putative PAPSS2–SULT2A1 interaction is of transient character, we employed PLA technology, which is well-suited to capture transient interactions (22Weibrecht I. Leuchowius K.J. Clausson C.M. Conze T. Jarvius M. Howell W.M. Kamali-Moghaddam M. Söderberg O. Proximity ligation assays: a recent addition to the proteomics toolbox.Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2010; 7 (20536310): 401-40910.1586/epr.10.10Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). DNA-linked secondary antibodies and a linker oligo enable rolling circle amplification and signal generation (“foci”) only if the primary antibodies against SULT2A1 and PAPSS1/PAPSS2 have bound less than 40 nm apart. One “focus” is assumed to correspond to one ligation event and the average number of “foci per cell” is interpreted as binding strength (23Sundqvist A. Zieba A. Vasilaki E. Herrera Hidalgo C. Söderberg O. Koinuma D. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Landegren U. Ten Dijke P. van Dam H. Specific interactions between Smad proteins and AP-1 components determine TGFβ-induced breast cancer cell invasion.Oncogene. 2013; 32 (22926518): 3606-361510.1038/onc.2012.370Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PLA technology combined with automated cell, nucleus, and foci recognition (Fig. 4A) allows for the analysis of large numbers of cells per staining, more than 400 cells per condition in our analysis. Foci per cell were clearly elevated in the staining for PAPSS2 and SULT2A1, indicative of a physical interaction between these proteins (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, foci per cell were significantly higher for PAPSS2–SULT2A1 than for a corresponding staining of SULT2A1 and PAPSS1 (Fig. 4C). To examine the newly detected PAPSS–SULT2A1 complex on a molecular level, we used different available crystal structures of human SULT2A1 and structural information about PAPS synthases for protein–protein docking using ClusPro (24Kozakov D. Hall D.R. Xia B. Porter K.A. Padhorny D. Yueh C. Beglov D. Vajda S. The ClusPro web server for protein-protein docking.Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 (28079879): 255-27810.1038/nprot.2016.169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). This procedure revealed a novel protein–interaction interface at the APS kinase domain of PAPSS2, where SULT2A1 binds (Fig. 5A). Considering the almost perfect C2 symmetry of the APS kinase domain, we regarded two binding sites as equivalent. Docking SULT2A1 to PAPSS1 resulted in more diffuse complexes, as SULT2A1 populated additional binding sites at the ATP sulfurylase of PAPSS1 (Fig. 5B). Statistical analysis of the ensembles of docked complexes confirm this observation (Fig. 5C). For PAPSS2, all amino acids found most often at the interface with SULT2A1 cluster within the APS kinase domain, whereas interacting amino acids of PAPSS1 seem to be scattered over the entire protein (Fig. 5C). Looking from the SULT2A1 side, the mode of binding to PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 appears to be very similar, involving the substrate-binding loops. One notable difference is that amino acids from the cap, the major substrate-binding loop, are involved in binding to PAPSS1, whereas these amino acids do not play a role in binding to PAPSS2 (Fig. 5D). Best scoring complexes were then subjected to local docking and re-scoring using RosettaDock (25Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Protein-protein docking with simultaneous optimization of rigid-body displacement and side-chain conformations.J. Mol.

The resulting complexes are described by their structural similarity to an average complex (interface r.m.s. deviation) and a docking score representing an energy term (Fig. 6A). Docking of PAPSS2 and SULT2A1 resulted in a cloud of docking experiments with a clearly visible funnel toward low r.m.s. deviations and low Rosetta energies (Fig. 6A). The corresponding PAPSS1/SULT2A1 docking neither showed such a trend nor was it characterized by similarly favorable Rosetta scores (Fig. 6A). To explore isoform specificity also for the sulfotransferase, we repeated the entire docking procedure with the sulfotransferase SULT2B1 most closely related to SULT2A1 (51% amino acid identity). Although PAPSS1 docking gave similar ensembles both for SULT2A1 and SULT2B1, the PAPSS2–SULT2B1 pairing only gave nonpreferable scores (Fig. 6A). Best-scoring complexes from each of these combinations were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. R.m.s. deviation trajectories showed that all these complexes are stable and converge toward an equilibrium state within the simulation t"
https://openalex.org/W2802765315,"When standing dead trees (snags) fall, they have major impacts on forest ecosystems. Snag fall can redistribute wildlife habitat and impact public safety, while governing important carbon (C) cycle consequences of tree mortality because ground contact accelerates C emissions during deadwood decay. Managing the consequences of altered snag dynamics in changing forests requires predicting when snags fall as wood decay erodes mechanical resistance to breaking forces. Previous studies have pointed to common predictors, such as stem size, degree of decay and species identity, but few have assessed the relative strength of underlying mechanisms driving snag fall across biomes. Here, we analyze nearly 100,000 repeated snag observations from boreal to subtropical forests across the eastern United States to show that wood decay controls snag fall in ways that could generate previously unrecognized forest-climate feedback. Warmer locations where wood decays quickly had much faster rates of snag fall. The effect of temperature on snag fall was so strong that in a simple forest C model, anticipated warming by mid-century reduced snag C by 22%. Furthermore, species-level differences in wood decay resistance (durability) accurately predicted the timing of snag fall. Differences in half-life for standing dead trees were similar to expected differences in the service lifetimes of wooden structures built from their timber. Strong effects of temperature and wood durability imply future forests where dying trees fall and decay faster than at present, reducing terrestrial C storage and snag-dependent wildlife habitat. These results can improve the representation of forest C cycling and assist forest managers by helping predict when a dead tree may fall."

Pharmacists are supported in this aspect by clinical information agencies (e.g. MotherSafe, a telephone-based teratogen information service) and reference texts. To what extent and for what reasons Australian pharmacists utilise these services/resources are yet unknown. Further, debate on replacement of conventionally defined medication safety in pregnancy categories (A, B1-3, C, D, X) by narratively stated safety evidence may affect pharmacists’ routine practice. This study aimed to gauge pharmacists’ experiences and resource needs in undertaking support roles regarding gestational drug use. Methods Semi-structured interviews (audio-recorded or documented using field notes) were performed with community pharmacists in Australia and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted using the NVivo software (Version 11, QSR International). Results Data saturation was achieved with 24 interviews. Qualitative data yielded 5 emergent themes: barriers to effective counselling, patient trust, risk perception, role definition and practice support needs. Overall, participants relied on pregnancy categories, were risk averse and cautious in offering advice. Currently available data for unclassified and category B therapeutic agents (limited human data) were deemed inadequate. Reluctance to use the proposed narrative system was also expressed. Discussion This study highlights key barriers in the provision of maternal care by pharmacists and the potential tension present if the existing category system is replaced by a narrative one. These need to be addressed through training and development of practice support resources to enhance pharmacists’ skills in evidence-based risk estimation and communication."
https://openalex.org/W2802334782,"The RAS proteins are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in cancer, with highest frequency found in pancreatic, lung, and colon tumors. Moreover, the activity of RAS is required for the proliferation and/or survival of these tumor cells and thus represents a high-value target for therapeutic development. Direct targeting of RAS has proven challenging for multiple reasons stemming from the biology of the protein, the complexity of downstream effector pathways and upstream regulatory networks. Thus, significant efforts have been directed at identifying downstream targets on which RAS is dependent. These efforts have proven challenging, in part due to confounding factors such as reliance on two-dimensional adherent monolayer cell cultures that inadequately recapitulate the physiologic context to which cells are exposed in vivo. To overcome these issues, we implemented a high-throughput screening (HTS) approach using a spheroid-based 3-dimensional culture format, thought to more closely reflect conditions experienced by cells in vivo. Using isogenic cell pairs, differing in the status of KRAS, we identified Proscillaridin A as a selective inhibitor of cells harboring the oncogenic KRasG12V allele. Significantly, the identification of Proscillaridin A was facilitated by the 3D screening platform and would not have been discovered employing standard 2D culturing methods."

The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate the MPT64 test in routine diagnostics in a low-resource setting. Methods Patients with presumptive EPTB were prospectively enrolled at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar, and followed to the end of treatment. Specimens collected were subjected to routine diagnostics, GeneXpert® MTB/RIF assay and the MPT64 test. The performance of the MPT64 test was assessed using a composite reference standard, defining the patients as tuberculosis (TB) cases or non-TB cases. Results Patients (n = 132) were classified as confirmed TB (n = 12), probable TB (n = 34), possible TB (n = 18), non-TB (n = 62) and uncategorized (n = 6) cases. Overall, in comparison to the composite reference standard for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of the MPT64 test was 69%, 95%, 94%, 75% and 82%, respectively. The MPT64 test performance was best in TB lymphadenitis cases (n = 67, sensitivity 79%, specificity 97%) and in paediatric TB (n = 41, sensitivity 100%, specificity 96%). Conclusions We show that the MPT64 test can be implemented in routine diagnostics in a low-resource setting and improves the diagnosis of EPTB, especially in TB lymphadenitis and in children."

https://openalex.org/W2801917002,"Resistance to apoptosis and uncontrolled proliferation are two hallmarks of cancer cells. p53 is crucial for apoptosis triggered by a broad range of stresses and a well-known gatekeeper for neoplastic transformation. Here we show that oncogenic IDH1 R132H/R132Q mutants robustly inhibit p53 expression and such an effect is attributed to 2-HG production. Mechanistically, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-2α, which in turn activates the expression of miR-380-5p, a characterized microRNA against p53 expression. Rescue expression of p53 can inhibit the proliferation rate and impair the resistance of apoptosis induced by doxorubicin in IDH1 R132Q mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Furthermore, p53 protein levels correlates negatively with IDH1 R132H levels in human glioma samples. Our results thus shed a new light on how p53 is down-regulated by 2-HG and suggests that impairment of p53-mediated apoptosis contributes to the tumorigenesis driven by IDH1 mutants."

Finally, we are discovering how alterations in protein methylation pathways can lead to human pathology, particularly in cancer (13Yang Y. Bedford M.T.

The collection of over 60 human protein arginine and lysine methyltransferases that leave histone “marks” recognized by reader proteins to guide gene expression are perhaps the poster children for the importance of protein methyltransferases (16Di Lorenzo A.

Furthermore, the methylation of lysine and arginine residues represents just the tip of the iceberg in protein methylation, and modifications have also been established at histidine, modified histidine (diphthamide), glutamate, glutamine, asparagine, l-isoaspartate, d-aspartate, cysteine, isoprenylcysteine, methionine, and N- and C-terminal residues (1Walsh C.T.

Recent work has demonstrated how methylated residues can be recognized by protein interaction domains for transcriptional control (13Yang Y. Bedford M.T.

An important recent discovery is that the three hydrogen atoms on methyl groups bound to positively charged nitrogen or sulfur atoms may themselves be able to serve as hydrogen bond donors, greatly expanding the possibilities for interactions (Fig. 1) (25Horowitz S.

There are presently few systems where the full physiological role of protein methylation is understood. The question then arises of how useful is it to discover new types of protein methylation reactions when we do not fully understand the systems already described. Do such discovery efforts represent mere cataloging of modification enzymes and their substrates? The fact that the proteins are methylated by the products of genes that have often been conserved throughout the evolutionary development of organisms suggests that a full understanding of the biology of an organism needs to include an appreciation of these modifications and their functions. As we learn more from each new protein methylation system described, the range of functional roles also increases, and we are provided new targets for therapeutic intervention into human diseases (13Yang Y.

In recent years, it has been recognized that proteins of the translational apparatus, including both ribosomal proteins and elongation factors, are major substrates for methylation reactions (5Couttas T.A.

These proteins, and the enzymes that modify them, have been extensively studied from the intersection of two research directions.

Importantly, the ability of S. cerevisiae to transport S-adenosylmethionine across its plasma membrane (36Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D.

Significantly, the availability of gene-knockout strains of yeast allows for biochemical analyses of mutants to identify the methyltransferases responsible for each of the modifications. Second, mass spectrometric analyses, particularly top-down intact mass measurements, have allowed the location of methylated residues in the amino acid sequence of the modified proteins (23Young B.D.

The identification of the modifying enzymes can then allow for the study of the physiological effects of each methylation reaction by examining the biology of the mutant strains lacking the methyltransferase. My attention to translation was initiated by the discovery in the Tam laboratory (38Chern M.K. Chang K.N. Liu L.F. Tam T.C. Liu Y.C. Liang Y.L. Tam M.F. Yeast ribosomal protein L12 is a substrate of protein-arginine methyltransferase 2.J. Biol.

This arginine residue is modified by the addition of a methyl group to the bridging δ-nitrogen atom of its side chain guanidino group by a methyltransferase identified subsequently and designated Rmt2 (protein arginine methyltransferase 2) (31Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: identification of a novel protein arginine methyltransferase.J. Biol.

All other protein arginine methyltransferases studied to date monomethylate or dimethylate only the terminal ω-nitrogen atoms of the guanidino side chain (40Bedford M.T. Clarke S.G.

When we later sought out new substrates for uncharacterized family members of the yeast SET-domain proteins (a family that includes the previously known protein lysine methyltransferases that modify histones and cytochrome c), we discovered that the large subunit protein Rpl23ab was also modified by methylation. We initially found that methylation of a 15-kDa protein was lost in a strain with a deletion in the YPL208W gene encoding one of the 12 SET-domain family members in S. cerevisiae (41Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Miranda T.B. Clarke S. A novel SET domain methyltransferase modifies ribosomal protein Rpl23ab in yeast.J. Biol.

Through mass spectrometric analyses, the methylated protein was identified as Rpl23ab, and the formation of the two dimethylated lysine sites was shown to be dependent upon the YPL208W gene (subsequently designated Rkm1 for ribosomal lysine (K) methyltransferase 1) (41Porras-Yakushi T.R.

Importantly, we then became aware of previous work using advanced methods for high-resolution intact mass spectrometric analyses of ribosomal proteins (42Louie D.F. Resing K.A. Lewis T.S. Ahn N.G.

This work had identified the S. cerevisiae proteins that were unmodified (with intact masses corresponding to the expected amino acid sequence), and the proteins that were modified by additional masses corresponding to methylation (14-Da increases) and/or acetylation (42-Da increases) (43Lee S.W.

This study had already identified six large subunit ribosomal proteins as possible methylated species, including Rpl12ab and Rpl23ab (43Lee S.W. Berger S. Jn A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D.

It gave us the impetus to focus on determining the sites of potential methylation of the other four candidate proteins (as well as additional methylation sites on Rpl12ab) and to characterize their methyltransferases and functions by the approach described above. The result of this work was the identification of four additional protein lysine methyltransferases, three from the SET domain family (Rkm2, Rkm3, and Rkm4 (44Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P.

Significantly, this work also identified four additional novel and/or unusual types of methyltransferases that are described below. Table 1 summarizes the sites of yeast methylated ribosomal proteins that occur at positions other than those modified by well-established protein lysine and arginine methyltransferases and the enzymes responsible for their formation. The success of the work identifying these sites and enzymes depended upon the combined bioinformatic, genetic, biochemical, and mass spectrometric approaches described above. In the process, we used high-capacity, high-resolution chromatographic assays to detect radiolabeled methylated amino acid residues based on sulfonated polystyrene cation-exchange resins. Using in vivo and in vitro methyl labeling with high-specific activity, S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine labeled with three tritium atoms per methyl group (giving a specific activity of about 100 cpm per femtomole of methyl groups), and our ability to detect less than 10 cpm by extended liquid scintillation counting, we can detect attomole levels of methyl groups in mg or larger amounts of protein (23Young B.D.

This extraordinary sensitivity allows us to detect modifications that would be missed by other commonly used approaches. Additionally, we can separate very similar methylated amino acid derivatives. The resolution of this chromatography is so high that we generally see a difference in elution position between the tritiated and hydrogen forms of an amino acid (47Gottschling H. Freese E.

Goats are particularly susceptible to TB and, in endemic areas, vaccination may be a valuable measure to control the disease. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of parenteral vaccination of goats with a heat-inactivated Mycobacterium bovis (HIMB) vaccine, and compare it to M. bovis Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Twenty-four goat kids were divided in 3 groups as following: HIMB vaccinated group (n = 8), BCG vaccinated group (n = 8) and unvaccinated group (n = 8). Afterwards, goats were experimentally challenged with Mycobacterium caprae by the endobronchial route. Antigen specific interferon-γ release assays and serology were performed after vaccination and challenge. Pathological and bacteriological parameters were evaluated after necropsy at 9 weeks post-challenge (p.c.). HIMB vaccine showed similar levels of protection to BCG in terms of volume reduction of thoracic TB lesions, presence of extra-pulmonary lesions, as well as a slight reduction of bacterial load in pulmonary lymph nodes. Moreover, HIMB vaccine did not induce interferences on the interferon-γ release assay based on reagents previously developed to differentiate infected from BCG vaccinated individuals. The results indicate that HIMB is a suitable vaccine candidate for further larger-scale trials under field conditions in goats."
https://openalex.org/W2802681825,"Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell's machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp, and Bartonella spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins."

PGF is primarily expressed in placental trophoblasts, and its expression decreases in preeclampsia, associated with placental hypoxia. The transcription factors glial cells missing 1 (GCM1) and metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1) have been implicated in the regulation of PGF gene expression through regulatory elements upstream and downstream of the PGF transcription start site, respectively. Here, we clarified the mechanism underlying placenta-specific PGF expression. We demonstrate that GCM1 up-regulates PGF expression through three downstream GCM1-binding sites (GBSs) but not a previously reported upstream GBS. Interestingly, we also found that these downstream GBSs also harbor metal-response elements for MTF1. Surprisingly, however, we observed that MTF1 is unlikely to regulate PGF expression in the placenta because knockdown or overexpression of GCM1, but not MTF1, dramatically decreased PGF expression or reversed the suppression of PGF expression under hypoxia, respectively. We also demonstrate that another transcription factor, Distal-less homeobox 3 (DLX3), interacts with the DNA-binding domain and the first transactivation domain of GCM1 and that this interaction inhibits GCM1-mediated PGF expression. Moreover, the GCM1–DLX3 interaction interfered with CREB-binding protein–mediated GCM1 acetylation and activation. In summary, we have identified several GBSs in the PGF promoter that are highly responsive to GCM1, have demonstrated that MTF1 does not significantly regulate PGF expression in placental cells, and provide evidence that DLX3 inhibits GCM1-mediated PGF expression.

https://openalex.org/W2802143352,"Introduction Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) is a promising tool for the evaluation of brachial plexus pathology. Therefore, we introduce and evaluate a fast DT-MRI protocol (8min33s scanning with 5–10 min postprocessing time) for the brachial plexus. Materials and methods Thirty healthy volunteers within three age-groups (18–35, 36–55, and > 56) received DT-MRI of the brachial-plexus twice. Means of fractional-anisotropy (FA), mean-diffusivity (MD), axial-diffusivity (AD), and radial-diffusivity (RD) for the individual roots and trunks were evaluated. A stepwise forward approach was applied to test for correlations with age, sex, body-mass-index (BMI), bodysurface, height, and bodyweight. Within-subject, intra-rater, and inter-rater repeatability were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass-correlation (ICC), and minimal detectable difference (MDD). Results No differences between sides and root levels were found. MD, AD, and RD correlated (P < 0.05) with bodyweight. Within-subject quantification proved repeatable with CVs for FA, MD, AD, and RD of 16%, 12%, 11%, and 14%, respectively. Discussion The DT-MRI protocol was fast and repeatable. Found correlations should be considered in future studies of brachial plexus pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2800534005,"The isozymes of photosynthetic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from C4 plants (PEPC-C4) play a critical role in their atmospheric CO2 assimilation and productivity. They are allosterically activated by phosphorylated trioses or hexoses, such as d-glucose 6-phosphate, and inhibited by l-malate or l-aspartate. Additionally, PEPC-C4 isozymes from grasses are activated by glycine, serine, or alanine, but the allosteric site for these compounds remains unknown. Here, we report a new crystal structure of the isozyme from Zea mays (ZmPEPC-C4) with glycine bound at the monomer-monomer interfaces of the two dimers of the tetramer, making interactions with residues of both monomers. This binding site is close to, but different from, the one proposed to bind glucose 6-phosphate. Docking experiments indicated that d/l-serine or d/l-alanine could also bind to this site, which does not exist in the PEPC-C4 isozyme from the eudicot plant Flaveria, mainly because of a lysyl residue at the equivalent position of Ser-100 in ZmPEPC-C4 Accordingly, the ZmPEPC-C4 S100K mutant is not activated by glycine, serine, or alanine. Amino acid sequence alignments showed that PEPC-C4 isozymes from the monocot family Poaceae have either serine or glycine at this position, whereas those from Cyperaceae and eudicot families have lysine. The size and charge of the residue equivalent to Ser-100 are not only crucial for the activation of PEPC-C4 isozymes by neutral amino acids but also affect their affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and their allosteric regulation by glucose 6-phosphate and malate, accounting for the reported kinetic differences between PEPC-C4 isozymes from monocot and eudicot plants."

However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice."
https://openalex.org/W2799483782,"The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL7RA) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between IL7RA polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 IL7RA polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience's MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: <7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1-9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for IL7RA genotypes (p>0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p<0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding IL7RA rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between IL7RA rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The IL7RA rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients. Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression."
https://openalex.org/W2799987488,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, rdPde6b-/- (rd1). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated rd1 retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P<0.0001) and P45 (P<0.05) than in saline-treated rd1 retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated rd1 retinas (P<0.05). In later degenerative stages of rd1 retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated rd1 retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated rd1 retinas (P<0.05). Our findings demonstrate that TIMP1 delays photoreceptor cell death. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into how TIMP1 works in the mouse animal model of RP."

It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan."

There is an increasing demand for rapid and economical methods for detection CIT residues in fruit. In this study, we developed an immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for detection of citrinin (CIT) residues in fruit for the first time. Anti-CIT monoclonal antibody (McAb) 2B9 was prepared, with a binding affinity of 9.39 × 108 L/moL. Conjugates CIT-BSA and McAb 2B9 were used to develop the ICS which could be completed in 5 min, with the detection limit of 50 ng/mL and no cross reactivity with other mycotoxins. Analysis of CIT in 64 fruit samples revealed that data obtained from the ICS test were in good agreement with indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ic-ELISAs) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This result demonstrated that the ICS test could be used as a rapid, reliable, cost-effective and user-friendly qualitative tool for detection of CIT residues on-site."
https://openalex.org/W2802919625,"High numbers of seabirds are killed annually worldwide in longline fisheries. In the Mediterranean, this mortality is seriously affecting the viability of seabird populations, in particular of the three endemic shearwaters. Even so, there is currently no specific seabird mitigation requirements for the longline fleet operating in this area. From 2013 to 2014, we assessed the efficiency and practical applicability of four mitigation measures on artisanal demersal longliners targeting European hake (Merluccius merluccius) in the western Mediterranean: night setting, tori line, weighted lines and artificial baits. We performed fifty-two pairs of experimental (with the tested mitigation measure) and control settings (without any measure), and compared their effects on seabird interactions and fish catches. In addition, we estimated the longline sink rates and the seabird access area to baited hooks in different longline configurations. Night setting reduced bycatch risk without affecting target and non-commercial fish catches. The tori line may have reduced the bycatch risk by displacing bait attacks beyond the end of the line, but at this distance shearwaters could still access to the baits and the streamers did not deter birds under calm wind conditions. Weighted lines increased sink rate, but it resulted in only a minor reduction of the seabird access window to baited hooks and led to some operational problems during the setting. Artificial baits substantially reduced commercial catches. Moreover, the seabird access to the baited hooks was influenced by the longline configuration, the setting speed and the relative position to the floats and weights. So far, night setting stands out as the best mitigation measure for reducing bycatch levels without compromising target catches in demersal longliners. Ideally, these results should be confirmed in longliners targeting species other than European hake."

The present study therefore examined the role of specific MEC-4 and MEC-10 TM2 residues in the channel's response to LSS. We found that introducing mutations within the TM2 of MEC-4 or MEC-10 not only altered channel activity, but also affected the channel's response to LSS. This response was enhanced by Cys substitutions at selected MEC-4 sites (Phe715, Gly716, Gln718, and Leu719) between the degenerin and the putative amiloride-binding sites in this subunit. In contrast, the LSS response was largely blunted in MEC-10 variants bearing single Cys substitutions in the regions preceding and following the amiloride-binding site (Gly677–Leu681), as well as with four MEC-10 touch-deficient mutations that introduced charged residues into the TM2 domain. An enhanced response to LSS was observed with a MEC-10 mutation in the putative selectivity filter. Overall, MEC-4 or MEC-10 mutants that altered the channel's LSS response are primarily clustered between the degenerin site and the selectivity filter, a region that probably forms the narrowest portion of the channel pore.

The introduction of bulky residues to this site in ENaC subunits, MEC-4, and acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) subunits result in a dramatic increase in channel open probability (Po). Strikingly, a large number of touch-deficient alleles have mutations within the pore-lining region of MEC-4 (16 alleles at 13 sites) and MEC-10 (five alleles), highlighting the importance of the channel's gate and pore in sensing mechanical stimuli (23Hong K. Driscoll M. A transmembrane domain of the putative channel subunit MEC-4 influences mechanotransduction and neurodegeneration in C. elegans.Nature. 1994; 367 (8107806): 470-47310.1038/367470a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Additionally, pore-lining residues within the second transmembrane domain (TM2) of ENaC subunits are important for modulating channel gating in response to flow-mediated laminar shear stress (LSS) (24Carattino M.D. Sheng S.

However, the role of the pore-ling residues of MEC-4 or MEC-10 in mechanosensation has not been systemically examined in worms. The present study used the LSS response to examine the role of TM2 domains of the two pore-forming subunits, MEC-4 and MEC-10, in channel gating by a mechanical force. We found that the LSS response was reversible in oocytes expressing both MEC-10 and MEC-4d (A713T, a gain-of-function mutation at the MEC-4 degenerin site). The LSS response was largely diminished by touch-deficient mec-10 alleles that introduce charged residues into the channel's pore, as well as by Cys substitution at five sites within TM2 of MEC-10. In contrast, we observed an enhanced LSS response with five MEC-4 mutants, as well as one MEC-10 mutant. In addition, MEC-4 or MEC-10 mutants that altered the LSS response are primarily clustered between the degenerin site and the selectivity filter, a region that forms the narrowest portion of the channel pore in the related channel, ASIC1 (17Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Structure of acid-sensing ion channel 1 at 1.9 Å resolution and low pH.Nature. 2007; 449 (17882215): 316-32310.1038/nature06163Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 27Baconguis I. Bohlen C.J.

Together, our data support the hypothesis that pore-lining residues within the TM2 domain of MEC-4 or MEC-10 have important yet different roles in accommodating conformational rearrangements within the channel pore during channel gating in response to mechanical forces. C. elegans MEC-4/MEC-10 channels are activated by flow-mediated LSS in Xenopus oocytes, and MEC-10 is required for a robust LSS response (14Shi S. Luke C.J. Miedel M.T. Silverman G.A. Kleyman T.R. Activation of the Caenorhabditis elegans degenerin channel by shear stress requires the MEC-10 subunit.J. Biol.

In oocytes expressing MEC-4 A713T (MEC-4d) with MEC-10, MEC-2, and MEC-6, the LSS response is reversible, as the currents returned to the baseline when the vertical flow was stopped (Fig. 1a). Worms bearing mec-10 alleles that introduce charged residues within the TM2 of MEC-10 (see Fig. 1b, G676R (u20), L679R (u390), G680E (u332), and G684R (e1715)) are defective in their response to gentle body touch (16Arnadóttir J. O'Hagan R. Chen Y. Goodman M.B. Chalfie M. The DEG/ENaC protein MEC-10 regulates the transduction channel complex in Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons.J.

We therefore examined whether these touch-deficient mutations of MEC-10 also blunt the channel's LSS response when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. An individual MEC-10 mutant or WT MEC-10 was co-expressed with MEC-4d as well as MEC-6 and MEC-2. Whole-cell Na+ currents were measured just before the initiation of LSS (Ibasal) and at 40 s after initiation of LSS (ILSS). The applied shear stress (0.12 dynes/cm2) is comparable with the external force required to evoke mechanoreceptor currents in the worm's touch receptor neurons (13O'Hagan R. Chalfie M. Goodman M.B. The MEC-4 DEG/ENaC channel of Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons transduces mechanical signals.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8 (15580270): 43-5010.1038/nn1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In response to LSS of 0.12 dynes/cm2, ILSS/Ibasal was 2.0 ± 0.4 in oocytes expressing WT MEC-10 (Fig. 1d). The LSS response was significantly diminished by each of the four MEC-10 mutations (Fig. 1). In addition, time constants of the LSS response (τ) were also reduced by each MEC-10 mutant (Fig. 1d), suggesting a faster but diminished channel activation by LSS relative to the WT channel. The blunted response and faster kinetics (Fig. 1) recapitulate the LSS response of channels lacking MEC-10 (i.e. MEC-4d homomeric channels) (14Shi S. Luke C.J. Miedel M.T. Silverman G.A. Kleyman T.R. Activation of the Caenorhabditis elegans degenerin channel by shear stress requires the MEC-10 subunit.J. Biol.

This observation raises the question whether the individual MEC-10 mutants are, like WT MEC-10, present in the functional channel complex. It has been shown that the association of MEC-10 with MEC-4d in the channel complex reduces channel activity and enhances the channel's sensitivity to pore blockers (28Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagan R. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. MEC-2 regulates C. elegans DEG/ENaC channels needed for mechanosensation.Nature. 2002; 415 (11875573): 1039-104210.1038/4151039aCrossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the inhibitory effect of benzamil on channels containing WT or mutant MEC-10. As shown in Fig. 2, co-expression of WT MEC-10 with MEC-4d resulted in a left shift in the benzamil dose-response curve, indicating enhanced sensitivity to benzamil. We then used the difference in benzamil sensitivity as a readout to determine whether MEC-10 mutants with blunted LSS responses were present within functional channel complexes. The dose-response curves for G676R and G680E fell between those for MEC-4d alone (no MEC-10) and MEC-4d with MEC-10 (WT MEC-10) curves (Fig. 2). The dose-response curves for L679R and G684R were similar to that of channels with MEC-10 (Fig. 2). Our data showing that these touch-deficient MEC-10 mutants were able to confer higher benzamil sensitivity as compared with MEC-4d alone channels (no MEC-10) suggest that the mutant MEC-10 subunits are a part of the functional complex. In addition, co-expression of these MEC-10 mutants reduced baseline whole-cell Na+ currents, when compared with either homomeric MEC-4d channels (no MEC-10) or channels with WT MEC-10 (Table 1). Taken together, our results suggest that these touch-deficient MEC-10 mutants are components of channel complexes that are deficient in their response to LSS.Table 1Select MEC-10 mutations alter channel activityMutationINa+S.D.npμAμAWT MEC-10−2.522.4992No MEC-10−4.282.9284*G676R−0.720.3014****L679R−0.510.1915****G680R−0.590.1815****G684E−0.430.1415****A673C−4.082.8115NSD674C−1.081.1410**F675C−2.111.4310NSG676C−2.141.5611NSG677C−0.800.719**H678C−0.600.3313****L679C−0.960.9611**G680C−0.520.1510***L681C−1.581.1515*W682C−1.610.7415*S683C−1.401.6915**G684C−0.300.1615****V685C−1.520.5710NSS686C−0.360.2812****V687C−1.861.0410NS Open table in a new tab As the LSS response was largely lost with MEC-10 touch-deficient mutations located within the channel's pore (Fig. 1), we decided to systematically investigate the role of the pore-forming region of MEC-10 in the channel's response to LSS. We introduced Cys residues at individual sites within MEC-10 TM2, from the degenerin site (Ala673) through the putative selectivity filter to Val687 (Fig. 3a). We chose to introduce Cys substitutions to allow us to perform additional studies with Cys reactive reagents, if warranted. Each mutant MEC-10 subunit was co-expressed with MEC-4d, MEC-2, and MEC-6 in Xenopus oocytes, and the LSS response was examined 4–7 days after cRNA injection. As shown in Fig. 3, the magnitude of channel activation was significantly reduced in five mutants (G677C, H678C, L679C, G680C, and L681C). These reduced LSS responses were characterized by faster kinetics (smaller τ values). Strikingly, LSS of 0.12 dynes/cm2 elicited a 7.1 ± 2.8-fold increase of whole-cell Na+ currents in oocytes expressing MEC-10 S683C, compared with the 2.9 ± 1.8-fold increase of whole-cell Na+ currents with WT MEC-10 (Fig. 3c). This greater LSS response was characterized by slower kinetics, as was the LSS response of the V685C mutant (Fig. 3c). Our results suggest that key sites within the pore segment of MEC-10 accommodate conformational changes during channel gating in response to LSS. As shown in Fig. 3, the LSS response was blunted by mutations at a stretch of residues (Gly677–Leu681) adjacent to the putative amiloride binding site (Gly680) of MEC-10. It is possible that the blunted LSS response resulted from the absence of mutant MEC-10 in the channel complex. To test this possibility, we probed whether these MEC-10 mutants sensitized the channel to external cadmium (Cd2+). Multiple endogenous Cys residues are present within the pore-lining segments of MEC-4 and MEC-10, which are potentially accessible to Cd2+. Increased concentrations of Cd2+ were applied to oocytes expressing MEC-4d or MEC-4d/MEC-10 channels via basal perfusion (Fig. 4a). We found that the presence of WT MEC-10 in channel complexes increased the channel's sensitivity to Cd2+ (Fig. 4a). For example, 0.1 mm Cd2+ reduced whole-cell Na+ currents by 26.1 ± 11.6% in oocytes co-expressing WT MEC-10 and MEC-4d (Fig. 4b). This inhibition was completely reversible (Fig. 4a). In contrast, perfusion with 0.1 mm Cd2+ had minimal effect on whole-cell currents of homomeric MEC-4d channels (no MEC-10, 4.4 ± 7.7% inhibition), suggesting that MEC-10 is required for higher Cd2+ sensitivity. The difference in Cd2+ sensitivity provided us with an approach to test whether certain MEC-10 mutants were present in the channel complex. Indeed, we observed that 0.1 mm Cd2+ inhibited the currents of oocytes expressing each of the LSS-deficient MEC-10 mutants (G677C, H678C, L679C, G680C, and L681C) to a similar or greater magnitude than that seen with oocytes expressing WT MEC-10 (Fig. 4b). These data suggest that these MEC-10 mutants were present in channel complexes that failed to respond to shear stress. In addition, Cd2+ also inhibited LSS-activated currents in oocytes expressing MEC-4d/MEC-10 channels (19.3 ± 4.8%; Fig. 4, c and d). LSS activates ENaC by increasing channel Po (29Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. Epithelial Na+ channels are activated by laminar shear stress.J. Biol.

Accordingly, this response was diminished in ENaCs that were “locked open” (e.g. bearing a Lys substitution at the degenerin site of the β subunit (βS518K) or modification of an introduced Cys near the degenerin site of the α subunit (αS580C)) (29Carattino M.D. Sheng S.

There are three gain-of-function mec-4 alleles, e1611 (MEC-4 A713V), u231 (MEC-4 A713T), and u56 (MEC-4 A713D), that cause degeneration of touch receptor neurons and loss of touch sensitivity in worms by increasing channel Po, leading to excess Ca2+ and/or Na+ influx (9Driscoll M. Chalfie M. The mec-4 gene is a member of a family of Caenorhabditis elegans genes that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration.Nature. 1991; 349 (1672038): 588-59310.1038/349588a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 31Bianchi L.

We therefore examined the LSS response of each gain-of-function MEC-4 variant (A713D, A713T, and A713V) as well as A713C. As shown in Fig. 5, the magnitude of the LSS response was not altered by A713C, A713T, or A713V but was nearly abolished by the A713D mutant, as compared with WT MEC-4. These results are consistent with previous reports that channels with an A713D mutation have the highest channel Po (∼0.76) at baseline among MEC-4 degenerin site mutants (22Brown A.L. Fernandez-Illescas S.M. Liao Z. Goodman M.B. Gain-of-function mutations in the MEC-4 DEG/ENaC sensory mechanotransduction channel alter gating and drug blockade.J. Gen.

We also screened the TM2 of MEC-4 (residues Asn710–Thr729) for sites that are important for the LSS response. We generated each Cys mutant in the MEC-4d background, as oocytes expressing WT MEC-4 exhibited very low currents even after prolonged incubation (14Shi S. Luke C.J. Miedel M.T. Silverman G.A. Kleyman T.R. Activation of the Caenorhabditis elegans degenerin channel by shear stress requires the MEC-10 subunit.J. Biol.

Each MEC-4d mutant was co-expressed with WT MEC-10, MEC-2, and MEC-6 in Xenopus oocytes. Five MEC-4d mutations increased the magnitude of channel activation (ILSS/Ibasal): F715C, G716C, Q718C, L719C, and L728C (Fig. 6c). Partially overlapping with this group, five MEC-4d mutations reduced the rate of the LSS response: N710C, Q718C, L719C, I725C, and L728C (Fig. 6d). The most striking changes were observed with Q718C, L719C, and L728C, where the magnitude of the LSS response was nearly doubled (Fig. 6c). These results contrast with the effect of mutating the sites equivalent to Gln718 and Leu719 in MEC-10 (His678 and Leu679), which blunted the LSS response (Fig. 3). Na+ currents were not detected in channels bearing Cys substitutions at Gly720, Trp722, Gly724, Ser726, or Thr729 of MEC-4d, even after prolonged incubation (Table 2). We therefore examined whether MEC-4d mutations near the putative selectivity filter affect the channel's permeability to Na+. MEC-4d/MEC-10 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes are selective to Na+, but also permeable to K+ (Table 3). We did not detect benzamil-sensitive currents in oocytes expressing MEC-4d G720C, W722C, G724C, or S726C when Li+ or K+ (100 mm) was the major carrying ion in the buffer. Only modest changes in cation selectivity were found for channels with the I725C or L728C mutant (Table 3).Table 2Mutations of the pore-lining residues of MEC-4 alter channel activityMutationINa+S.D.npμAμAAla713 (WT)−0.120.0812****A713C−0.480.8517****A713D−0.830.9618****A713V−0.590.2618****A713T (MEC-4d)−4.312.9090N710C/A713T−1.130.5120****L711C/A713T−4.191.9622NSL712C/A713T−2.761.3922**A713T/D714C−0.600.3917****A713T/F715C−1.511.1916****A713T/G716C−1.661.4111****A713T/G717C−0.420.1819****A713T/Q718C−2.913.0716NSA713T/L719C−5.623.4016NSA713T/G720C−0.030.0212****A713T/L721C−1.771.3816****A713T/W722C−0.050.0811****A713T/G724C−0.020.0212****A713T/I725C−2.311.6420***A713T/S726C−0.020.0212****A713T/F727C−0.540.4612****A713T/L728C−2.261.2812**A713T/T729C0.000.0111**** Open table in a new tab Table 3Ion selectivity of MEC-4 Cys mutants ne"
https://openalex.org/W2802329124,"The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the Leishmania infantum infection. In contrast, an antibody response against Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-Lu. longipalpis salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included CD180 (RP105) and MITF related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The findings pointed to chromosomal segments useful for functional confirmation studies and a search for adjuvant molecules of the anti-saliva response."

We investigated the proportion and clinical characteristics of non-smokers among middle-aged to elderly subjects with airflow obstruction.We retrospectively analyzed 1,892 subjects aged 40-89 years who underwent routine preoperative spirometry at a tertiary university hospital in Japan. Airflow obstruction was defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity < 0.7 or as the lower limit of the normal.Among 323 patients presenting with FEV1/forced vital capacity < 0.7, 43 had asthma and 280 did not. Among the non-asthmatic patients with airflow obstruction, 94 (34%) were non-smokers. A larger number of women than men with airflow obstruction had asthma (26% vs. 7.6%, p < 0.001), or were non-smokers among non-asthmatics (72% vs. 20%, p < 0.001). Non-asthmatic non-smokers, rather than non-asthmatic smokers, asthmatic non-smokers, and asthmatic smokers, exhibited better pulmonary function (median FEV1: 79% of predicted FEV1 vs. 73%, 69%, and 66%, respectively, p = 0.005) and less dyspnea on exertion (1% vs. 12%, 12%, and 28%, respectively, p = 0.001). Pulmonary emphysema on thoracic computed tomography was less common in non-smokers (p < 0.001). Using the lower limit of the normal to define airflow obstruction yielded similar results.There are a substantial number of non-smokers with airflow obstruction compatible with COPD in Japan. In this study, airflow obstruction in non-smokers was more common in women and likelier to result in mild functional and pathological abnormalities than in smokers. Further studies are warranted to investigate the long-term prognosis and appropriate management of this population in developed countries, especially in women."
https://openalex.org/W2730177847,"Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic and political implications. In the present study, we use population census data in Japan to examine contributors to the population growth of residential clusters between years 2005 and 2010. The data set covers the entirety of Japan and has a high spatial resolution of 500$\times$500$\textrm{m}^2$, enabling us to examine population dynamics in various parts of the country (urban and rural) using statistical analysis. We found that, in addition to the area, population density, and age, the shape of the cluster and the spatial distribution of inhabitants within the cluster are significantly related to the population growth rate of a residential cluster. Specifically, the population tends to grow if the cluster is ""round"" shaped (given the area) and the population is concentrate near the center rather than periphery of the cluster."

Methods Three backpack positions were tested: no backpack (NB), a 12.5% body-weight backpack carried bilaterally (BB) or unilaterally (UB), at rest and during a 10 minute walk. Primary outcome was forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary outcomes included comparison of cardio-respiratory variables within and between groups. Results Nine children with CF (13.3±2.6 years; FEV1 66±22%) and 18 healthy children (13.8±1.8 years; FEV1 107±30%) were included. FVC was reduced with UB compared to NB (68.5±23.3% vs 72.1±24.3%, p = 0.024) in children with CF. FEV1, MIP and MEP decreased more with UB in children with CF than in healthy peers. Increases in VO2, VCO2 and minute ventilation with UB were greater in the CF group during walking. Conclusions Unilateral backpack wearing affects FVC in children with CF and requires greater cardio-respiratory adjustments compared to healthy peers."
https://openalex.org/W2802539799,"The incidence of the High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion of the vulva, formerly vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia is progressively increasing. Today, an early detection and a precise localization of vulvar lesions are still problematic issues, due to the lack of accuracy of the available diagnostic tool. A new approach is the photodynamic diagnosis based on the fluorescence detection of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in cancer cells after topical application of a cream of methyl amino-levulinic acid. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of photodiagnosis in order to discriminate the intensity of PpIX fluorescence between vulvar tumor and healthy skin. After topical application of the cream, the fluorescence on xenografted A431 tumor and adjacent skin was non-invasively measured with optical fiber. The tumor to skin fluorescence ratios were 1.38 and 1.41 at respectively 3h and 6h after application, which were significantly higher compared to those observed before application. PpIX accumulation at different depths of the tumor was investigated by spectrofluorimetry after PpIX chemical extraction from tumor sections at 3h and 6h post-application. It was noticed at both application times that the concentration of PpIX within the tumor progressively decreased. However PpIX fluorescence was always detectable up to 2.5 mm, a depth equivalent to more than three quarters of the tumor. The tumor to exposed skin ratios of PpIX fluorescence showed a good selectivity up to1mm depth at 3h post-application and up to 1.5mm at 6h post-m-ALA. Thus, the photodynamic diagnosis using in vivo topical methyl amino-levulinic acid appears to be a promising way to detect the intraepithelial lesions of the vulva. Our results open the possibility for implementation of topical methyl amino-levulinic acid in clinical settings for recognition of vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions."
