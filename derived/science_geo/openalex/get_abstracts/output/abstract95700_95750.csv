https://openalex.org/W2011389479,"Cells in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans arise from invariant cell lineages. Mutations in two genes, unc-86 and lin-4, alter multiple and mutually exclusive sets of these lineages. In these mutants, particular cells repeat division patterns normally associated with their parental or grandparental progenitors. The effects of unc-86 are highly specific, altering in equivalent ways the lineages of three post-embryonic neuroblasts that in the wild-type undergo similar division patterns. The effects of lin-4 are more varied, resulting in a number of types of lineage reiterations as well as in supernumerary molts and the continued synthesis of larval-specific cuticle. The reiteration of a given cell division or pattern of cell divisions leads to the repeated generation of cells indistinguishable (by both light and electron microscopy) from those produced after the same division or pattern of cell divisions in the wild-type. This correlation between lineage history and cell fate suggests that in C. elegans a particular sequence of cell divisions may be necessary for the generation of a particular cell type. Reiterative lineages, often referred to as stem cell lineages, may be basic to the development of nematodes and other organisms. We suggest that the wild-type unc-86 and lin-4 genes act to modify latent reiterative cell lineages, which are revealed when the activity of one of these genes is eliminated."

https://openalex.org/W2046399641,"We have analyzed the chromosome structure and expression of the α-gene cluster in developing chicken embyros. Using recombinant λ clones ( Dodgson and Engel, 1980 Dodgson J. Engel J.D. Analysis of the closely linked adult chicken α-globin genes in recombinant DNAs. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 77. 1980: 2597-2599 Google Scholar ), we show a striking relationship between chromosomal regions that are unmethylated, regions that are DNAase I-sensitive and regions that are transcribed. Adjacent regions at both the 5′ and 3′ sides of the active α genes are methylated and relatively insensitive to DNAase I. The active α subdomain defined by these assays begins right at the 5′ side of the first α gene (αD) in the active cluster in definitive red cells and extends through a 1.5 kb spacer, into the second α gene (αA), and 1.5 kb beyond the 3′ side of that gene. The sharp boundaries of this subdomain suggest that specific DNA sequences may establish its borders. The extension of the active chromosomal domain beyond the most stable nuclear transcript suggests that transcription may proceed beyond the 3′ ends of both αA and αD. This has been verified by in vitro runoff nuclear transcription. Presumably, poly(A) addition occurs before transcription is terminated. During the switch from the primitive to definitive lineage of erythroblasts, the so-called U gene becomes inactive. This inactivity is reflected in its assembly into a more DNAase-resistant structure. The associated DNA also becomes methylated, and no transcription is detectable by endogenous RNA polymerases. A DNAase I-hypersensitive region at the 5′ side of the U gene also becomes buried when the gene becomes inactivated after the switch to the definitive lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2088420183,"The exogenous Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was inserted into the germ line of mice by exposing embryos to virus at different stages of embryogenesis. Mice derived from exposed embryos were mosaics with respect to integrated virus. Nine new substrains, designated Mov-5 to Mov-13, were derived, each of which carries a single M-MuLV genome at a different chromosomal position in its germ line. Four substrains, Mov-1 to Mov-4, were derived previously. Restriction enzyme analyses demonstrated that, with the exception of Mov-4 and Mov-6 mice, no major rearrangements or deletions have occurred in the integrated proviral genomes. Infectious virus is not activated in the majority of substrains (Mov-4 to Mov-8 and Mov-10 to Mov-12), whereas the other mice develop viremia. A detailed comparison between Mov-1 and Mov-13 mice demonstrated that the time of virus activation is different. Mov-13 mice activate infectious virus during embryogenesis, leading to a distinct pattern of virus expression in all tissues of the adult, but the viral genome in Mov-1 mice is activated only during the first two weeks after birth, leading to virus expression predominantly in lymphatic organs. Together with previous observations, at least four different phenotypes of virus expression-that is, early virus activation during embryogenesis, virus activation after birth, virus activation late in life and no expression of infectious virus at all-can be distinguished among the 13 substrains. Our results suggest that the chromosomal region at which a viral genome is integrated influences its expression during development and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2068183546,"tDNA sequences essential for promotion of transcription have been identified for a tRNA1met gene of X. laevis. A cloned tRNA gene unit was altered by resection of the 5' flanking sequences or by specific deletions of gene and trailing sequences. Gene internal sequences were also substituted by unrelated sequences. The gene units mutated in this way were coinjected into the oocyte together with cloned X. laevis 5S DNA, or were transcribed in vitro, in order to assess the effects of the sequence manipulation on transcription. We find major control sequences to be located near the 5' and the 3' ends of the sequences coding for the mature tRNA. A first such control sequence, having profound effects on the rate of tRNA production, has been mapped to sequence position 8-13 within the structural gene. A second regulatory sequence occurs within the region 51 to 72, that is, in or near the sequence coding for the pseudouridine loop of the tRNA. The sequences pinpointed in this way coincide with highly conserved sequences found in most, if not all, eucaryotic tRNAs. The anterior and the posterior control elements can be moved apart from one another without affecting the rate or points ot initiation and termination of transcription. While all deletions within the sequence coding for the mature tRNA led to inactivity of the mutated genes, substitution of the central portion by concatenated Hind III linkers produced gene units active in transcription. We postulate that the middle portion of the gene has a function in keeping the two control elements at sequence positions 8-30 and 51-72 at a critical distance from one another, a distance that can be enlarged but not shortened without obliterating the activity of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2073785437,"Attachment of rat hepatocytes to collagen, which occurs without the aid of fibronectin, was found to be a time-dependent reaction characterized by an initial lag phase of 10–20 min before stable attachment bonds began to form. Increasing the density of molecules in the collagen substrates enhanced the rate of cell attachment. The hepatocytes attached essentially equally well to all the collagen types tested (types I, II, III, IV and V). The initial rate of cell attachment was more rapid to native collagen than to denatured collagen or α1(I) chains, apparently indicating different affinities of the cells for these substrates. However, if cells were incubated for 60 min or more, efficient attachment occurred to the α1(I) chain and to all cyanogen-bromide-treated peptides tested (α1-CB2, α1-CB3, α1-CB4, α1-CB5, α1-CB6A, α1-CB7, α1-CB8, α2-CB2, α2-CB3 and α2-CB4) but not to the aminopropeptide of type I procollagen. A low but significant degree of attachment also took place to substrates made of synthetic peptides with the collagen-like structures (Gly-Ala-Pro)n, (Gly-Pro-Pro)n and (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n, whereas no attachment was observed to polyproline. We suggest that the cell-binding sites in collagen have a simple structure and occur in multiple copies along the collagen molecule. Addition of collagen in solution inhibited intial cell attachment, an effect that persisted longer on substrates made of α1(I) chain than on denatured collagen. The collected data are interpreted in terms of a model for cell-to-collagen adhesion where the formation of stable attachment bonds requires the binding of several low-affinity receptors, clustered at the site of adhesion, to collagen molecules in the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1538569506,"The neutral amino acid transport systems A, ASC, and L have been characterized in the Chinese hamster ovary cell. System A, defined by its sodium ion dependency and inhibition by 2-methylaminoisobutyric acid, was found to be extremely sensitive to the pH of the external medium and to increase in response to starvation for amino acids. System ASC, identified by its sodium ion dependency and intolerance of N-methylation of substrates, was found to be relatively insensitive to external pH and nutrient limitation. System ASC in Chinese hamster ovary cells has been shown to be the major mode of entry of neutral amino acids. A much broader substrate specificity was observed for System ASC than has been reported for other mammalian cell types, with nearly every amino acid tested showing significant uptake by this system. In addition, the highest observed velocities of uptake were for System ASC. System L, defined by its sodium ion independency and inhibition by 2-aminobicyclo-[2,2,2]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, was enhanced in activity by lowered pH. The starvation-induced enhancement in System A activity was prevented by the presence of a single substrate of this system, the nonmetabolizable analog 2-methylaminoisobutyric, or by the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide."
https://openalex.org/W1599081564,"Cholesterol appears to be abundant on both sides of the human erythrocyte membrane, but its precise distribution and rate of transmembrane movement are undetermined. Although the cholesterol in the intact cell normally was resistant to cholesterol oxidase, enrichment of cells with exogenous cholesterol or preincubation at very low ionic strength rendered the entire cholesterol pool susceptibility to attack. Under these experimental conditions, all of the membrane cholesterol was oxidized in a strictly first order fashion with a half-time as short as 10 s at 37 degrees C. Since the enzyme had access only to the outer membrane surface, these data suggest that the transmembrane movement (flip-flop) of cholesterol is extremely rapid. From an error analysis, we estimate an upper bound on the half-time of the transmembrane movement of cholesterol of 3 s at 37 degrees C. A physiological function for rapid sterol flip-flop is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2001019121,Hb first appears in the developing chicken blastoderm at 35 hr of incubation. We have isolated the presumptive Hb-forming area of the embryo at 20–23 hr and shown that most of the cells in this region are red cell precursors. The structure and activity of the globin genes in these precursors have been assayed in three ways: by runoff nuclear transcription to measure the number of initiated RNA polymerases present on the globin genes; by measuring the degree of methylation of these genes with methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes; and by monitoring the DNAase I sensitivity and the generation of DNAase I-hypersensitive sites in the globin chromatin. All these assays show the globin genes to be inactive in precursor cells. Additional experiments focusing on the mechanism of the transition from an inactive to an active chromosome structure indicate that DNA replication but not cytokinesis is intimately coupled to the transition process.

In a social setting, subjects made partially deaf by hypnotic suggestion, but kept unaware of the source of their deafness, became more paranoid as indicated on a variety of assessment measures. The results support a hypothesizes cognitive-social mechanism for the clinically observed relationship between paranoia and deafness in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2124627130,"The human alpha-globin genes are duplicated and encode identical polypeptides. Recently we detected in cloned genomic DNAs characteristic sequence differences between the 3' untranslated regions of the 5' (alpha 2) and 3' (alpha 1) genes, not previously recognized by direct analysis of mRNA and cDNA transcripts. Based on these untranslated region differences, we have now used S1 nuclease mapping of RNA to detect and quantitate the two predicted alpha-mRNA species. With this assay we have examined the relative expression of the alpha-globin genes during normal development and in alpha-thalassemia syndromes. In normal adult reticulocytes, alpha 2 RNA is slightly more abundant than the alpha 1 species (ratio 60:40). This relative abundance of the alpha RNAs was consistently observed in fetal blood and liver RNA samples from 10 weeks of gestation to birth. In both deletion and nondeletion forms of alpha thalassemia, only the alpha 1 RNA and establish the normal pattern of relative alpha-gene expression during development independent of protein variants. RNA analysis also permits for the first time identification of the mutant genes in nondeletion forms of thalassemia."

It is a 75-residue protein (computed Mr = 8501), contains a single Tyr, and is devoid of Cys, Met, Trp, His, and Arg. The bulk of the sequence was determined by automated sequencing of: (i) the intact protein for 20 cycles; (ii) a large N-bromosuccinimide peptide for 37 cycles; (iii) a tryptic peptide (29 cycles), isolated by high performance liquid chromatography. Also described is a highly sensitive and rapid procedure for peptide mapping by high performance liquid chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1584587121,"The subunit structure and complete amino acid sequence of the lectin extracted from Lens culinaris (LcL) seeds was determined. In previous studies, the primary structure of the alpha-chain (Mr = 5,710) was shown to be homologous to the alpha-chain of the lectin from Pisum sativum, the Vicia cracca glucose-specific lectin, and a region in the middle of the concanavalin A sequence (residues 70-121). The complete amino acid sequence of the beta-chain (Mr = 17,572) has been determined from 11 tryptic peptides, 4 peptides derived by chemical cleavage of the beta-chain at its three tryptophan residues, 11 peptides obtained after digestion with Staphylococcus aureus protease, and 5 tryptic peptides from the succinylated polypeptide chain. The extensive homologies by alignment of the alpha- and beta-chains of the L. culinaris lectin with portions of concanavalin A situated between 1 to 45 and 70 to 237, suggest that the L. culinaris and Canavalia ensiformis lectins have evolved from each other. A comparison was made between the secondary structure of the C. ensiformis lectin and the probable secondary structure of the L. culinaris lectin as predicted by two different methods. The results indicate that the folding of these two polypeptides has been particularly well conserved during evolution. It is suggested that the L. culinaris lectin is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain and cleaved subsequently into two or possibly three fragments, two of which would be alpha and beta and the third a fragment homologous to portion 46 to 69 in concanavalin A. As in favin, the amino acids postulated to be involved in the formation of the hydrophobic cavity and the sugar and metal binding sites are highly conserved in L. culinaris lectin."
https://openalex.org/W2149252348,"The reiteration frequency of the genes that encode the structural proteins of the mammalian ribosome was studied with a set of cloned cDNA probes containing several different mouse r-protein mRNA sequences. Results from a reassociation kinetics analysis, Southern blotting experiments and gene cloning studies collectively indicate that each individual r-protein species is represented by multiple genes in mammals. Among the examples studied, the multiplicity of mouse r-protein genes varied from about 7 to 20, a striking contrast to the low copy numbers observed in less evolutionarily advanced eucaryotes. The multiplicity of individual r-protein genes in humans and rodents is similar."
https://openalex.org/W1968640903,"The SV40 large T antigen is a multifunctional protein presumed to represent a single translation product of the early viral genes. A wide range of biological controls including the regulation of viral DNA replication, transcription and cell transformation has been attributed to T antigen. Previous evidence has indicated that large T antigen is modified in at least two ways, N-terminal acetylation and amino acid phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate a novel modification of a population of SV40 T antigen molecules by poly ADP-ribosylation. The covalent linkage of this oligonucleotide side chain to large T antigen, but not small t antigen, was demonstrated in experiments in which SV40-infected cells were labeled in vivo with 32P-orthophosphate or 14C-adenosine. Treatment of this labeled T antigen with snake venom phosphodiesterase released iso-ADP-ribose or treatment with ADP-ribose glycohydrolase released ADP-ribose. A method has been developed for the in vitro ADP-ribosylation of T antigen present in an infected cell nuclear extract with radiolabeled NAD. Since this type of modification is known to affect enzyme activity, its presence on T antigen suggests a similar role in the regulation of certain biological functions under the control of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1989171920,"Rats experienced both morphine and an environmental cue, but the cue always signaled a drug-free period. They were subsequently administered morphine in the presence of the cue, and the development of analgesic tolerance was assessed. The prior experience retarded such tolerance. The finding that a procedure of opiate administration can retard opiate tolerance suggests that an association between cues preceding the drug and the drug itself contributes to tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2030223167,"Pregnant rats were intubated with alcohol (ethanol, 3 grams per kilogram) twice daily throughout gestation. Control animals received solutions of isocaloric sucrose. At birth, offspring were placed with untreated surrogate dams. Beginning at 6 months of age, the offspring were tested for their thermogenic responsiveness to various drugs and to cold. Prenatal exposure to alcohol resulted in tolerance to alcohol and cross-tolerance to pentobarbital and diazepam but did not affect responsiveness to cold. This pattern of effects suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol produces specific long-term effects on the neural mechanisms underlying drug tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1986680736,"We have analyzed the molecular components of cytoplasmic microtubules in situ in several types of cultured cells. Our approach makes use of preparations of detergent-extracted cytoskeletons that contain the original cellular microtubules. Identification of microtubule components is based on two criteria: their presence in the cytoskeleton preparations is dependent upon the presence of intact microtubules, and they are released from such preparations by buffers that depolymerize microtubules. Proteins that meet these criteria are described. Some of them are restricted to cells of certain species or tissues of origin. Others appear to be of widespread distribution. Among the latter is a protein homologous to one of the tau polypeptides in brain microtubule protein."
https://openalex.org/W2036461709,"Conditional mutations and drugs that specifically block DNA synthesis and cell division in Caulobacter crescentus have been used to analyze the role of the cell cycle in differentiation. The results suggest that the DNA synthetic pathway, and not an intact cell division pathway, acts to time the periodic synthesis of flagellin A, flagellin B and the hook protein. The expression of these flagellar genes is apparently controlled at the level of transcription, with initiation of the synthetic periods dependent on a specific stage of chromosome replication. The required stage of replication, or DNA execution point, occurs near mid-S phase at approximately 0.65 of the swarmer cell cycle. Examination of a C. crescentus polyhook mutant PCM103 indicates, however, that the DNA synthetic pathway is only one level of regulation over flagellum formation. In the mutant, hook protein synthesis is coupled to DNA synthesis and is initiated at the expected time in the cell cycle, but hook protein synthesis is not repressed at the normal time, hook assembly fails to terminate and only a low level of flagellin is detected. Thus the defect in this strain, which grows and divides normally, appears to affect a sequence of developmental events at a point after the induction of the hook protein. These findings are consistent with a hierarchy of controls that regulates the periodic synthesis of flagellar proteins and their assembly in the flagellum. Initiation of hook protein and flagellin synthesis requires a specific stage of chromosome replication, while later stages of flagellum formation, including the termination of hook protein synthesis, also require a second level of regulation that is defective in strain PCM 103."

https://openalex.org/W1547430155,"A soluble erythrocyte cytochrome b5 was purified as the substrate of methemoglobin reductase and an electron carrier to methemoglobin. The isoelectric point of this protein was at pH 4.3, and E0' was -0.010 at pH 7.0.. The Km value of the enzyme for this protein was 1 x 10(-4) M, and the turnover number (k5) was 3.4 x 10(4) min-1, with NADH as an electron donor at pH 7.0. The optimum pH of the enzyme was pH 4.6 for ferricyanide and pH 5.5 for cytochrome b5, with a shoulder of activity at pH 7 to 9 for both substrates. The rate equation which represents the reduction of either methemoglobin or cytochrome c was obtained as a function of methemoglobin or cytochrome c, methemoglobin reductase, and cytochrome b5 by considering the E . S complex for both reductase and cytochrome b5, and the rate constants involved were determined. The rate constants between methemoglobin and reduced cytochrome b5 (k1, M-1 min-1) were 1.6 x 10(4), 3.1 x 10(6), and 4.1 x 10(6) at pH 7.0, pH 5.2, and pH 5.0, respectively. The rate constants between the reduced enzyme and oxidized cytochrome b5 (k'3, M-1 min-1) were 4.3 x 10(8), 12 x 10(8), and 9.3 x 10(8) at pH 7.0, pH 5.2, and pH 5.0, respectively. The rate constant between reduced hemoglobin and oxidized cytochrome b5 (k2) was 35 M-1 min-1 at pH 7.0. The theoretical Km for methemoglobin was 2.1 M at an infinite enzyme concentration at pH 7.0"
https://openalex.org/W1990370909,"Flagellar excision in Chlamydomonas reinhardii triggers a rapid and extensive induction of tubulin synthesis. Cloned plasmids, pFT beta 1 and pFT beta 2, carrying cDNA inserts complementary to beta-tubulin mRNA, have been prepared and used to demonstrate a direct requirement for tubulin mRNA synthesis during tubulin induction. Increased tubulin mRNA synthesis is detected within 5 min after deflagellation. During the 45 min peak period of tubulin synthesis, tubulin mRNA accumulates to levels 15- to 35-fold higher than those found in control (non-deflagellated) cells. In addition, there appears to be a direct correlation between tubulin mRNA concentrations and the levels of tubulin production during the induction and deinduction cycle that accompanies flagellar regeneration. Amiprophosmethyl (APM), a compound we reported earlier as a selective inhibitor of tubulin synthesis in deflagellated cells, is shown to block the accumulation of tubulin mRNA following flagellar excision and to cause the rapid loss of tubulin mRNA from cells treated at the peak of induction."

Our results indicated that members of a particular family are often located on more than one chromosome, that extensive clustering of many r-protein gene families on a few chromosomes is unlikely, and that there is no obligatory linkage of r-protein and rRNA genes."

https://openalex.org/W2084072584,"We have isolated a metaphase chromosome fraction highly enriched in double minutes (dm) from a mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line (Y1-DM). We have cloned DNA from this dm-enriched fraction in the lambda vector Charon 4A, and have characterized two randomly chosen recombinant bacteriophage clones from this dm DNA library. When 32 P-labeled DNA from each recombinant was hybridized to Southern blots of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA from different mouse cell lines, large differences were seen in the intensity of the resulting autoradiographic images, depending on the source of the genomic DNA. A very strong signal was obtained with DNA from the Y1-DM cells and with DNA from a related Y1 subline that lacks dm but contains a marker chromosome bearing a large homogeneously staining region (HSR). Hybridization to DNA from parental inbred mice and from two unrelated mouse cell lines produced a significantly weaker signal than that obtained with DNA from the Y1 cells, but the DNA fragments from the sources were of similar size. Based on results from filter hybridization analysis, we estimate that sequences homologous to the cloned fragments are approximately 100- to 200-fold more abundant in the genome of the Y1-DM cells than in the parental mouse cells. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that dm and HSRs in these cells contain amplified genes."
https://openalex.org/W1486734647,"Five hundred-MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy was employed to study a monofucosylated tetra-antennary glycopeptide fraction which was derived from human plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. This fraction was earlier judged to be homogeneous by 360-MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopic analysis (Fournet, B., Montreuil, J., Strecker, G., Dorland, L., Haverkamp, J., Vliegenthart, J. F. G., Binette, J. P., and Schmid, K. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 5206-5214). The combination of the improved resolving power and the enhanced sensitivity of the 500-MHz 1H-NMR spectrometer afforded the elucidation of a new type of microheterogeneity with regard to the position of attachment of Fuc. Three isomeric compounds were identified. The major form contains Fuc alpha-(1 leads to 3) linked to GlcNac 7 of the tetra-antennary structure, as shown earlier. The two minor compounds, representing new structures, possess Fuc attached in alpha-(1 leads to 3) linkage to GlcNAc 7‘ or 5‘. It is thus noteworthy that this spectral technique allows elucidation of structures of very closely related carbohydrate chains in a glycopeptide mixture."

https://openalex.org/W1541737343,"The synthesis and phosphorylation of influenza virus nucleoprotein and nonstructural protein were analyzed. The nucleoprotein (NP) was found to be phosphorylated in both infected cells and in isolated virions. The phosphate is in a monoester linkage to a serine residue. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of the 32P-labeled protein, as well as measurements of specific activity, suggests that NP is phosphorylated at one site per molecule. The viral nonstructural (NS 1) protein is also phosphorylated, but on threonine residues. Up to a maximum of two sites per NS 1 molecule could be so modified in infected cells, as demonstrated by two different methods of tryptic peptide analysis and by measurements of the ratio of 32P to 3H-amino-acids incorporated into NS 1 protein species. The NS 1 protein is resolved into four major species of differing isoelectric point in a two-dimensional electrophoretogram. The most acidic species was found to have two phosphorylated sites per molecule, and the next most acidic species contained on the average one phosphate per molecule. Treatment of the phosphorylated species with bacterial alkaline phosphatase demonstrated that the level of phosphorylation is the only identifiable difference between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated NS 1 species. The distinction between the two unphosphorylated species could not be determined. The distribution of the un-, mono-, and diphosphorylated NS 1 species was characterized at different times after synthesis. These modifications were found to occur very rapidly after translation (30 to 60 s), after transport of the unmodified species from cytoplasm to nucleus of the infected cell. The phosphorylation of NP also takes place rapidly after its synthesis; the site within the cell of the NP phosphorylation has not been unambiguously determined."

The two genes, designated beta s and beta t, were physically mapped onto a 32 kb segment of the chromosome carried by the four clones. Beta s and beta t form a stable heteroduplex 1850 bp long, indicating that they are intact and conserved at this level of resolution throughout their length, including their intervening sequences. The beta s gene allelic with the beta dmaj gene of the BALB/c mouse (genotype Hbbd/Hbbd). These two alleles, as well as their surrounding sequences, are highly conserved. In contrast, heteroduplexes of beta t with its BALB/c allele, beta dmin, revealed three extensive but localized rearrangements. One region of non-homology falls within the large intervening sequence, IVS2. To the 5' side of the beta/beta dmin gene position two unequal substitutions were observed; each results in the net insertion of about 1000 bp into the Hbbd chromosome. The beta/b dmin gene position is bracketed by a 1450 bp inverted repeat. One of the 1000 bp substitutions maps within this inverted repeat."
https://openalex.org/W1650312208,"Equilibrium constants for the binding of cyanide to the ferric heme c octapeptide in 20% ethylene glycol, 50% buffer were measured spectrophotometrically. The equilibrium constant for cyanide binding at 20 degrees C and pH 7.4 is 3.47 X 10(7), which is approximately 15-fold lower than that observed for cyanide binding to methemoglobin or metmyoglobin. Equilibrium constants at several temperatures exhibited an apparent van't Hoff relationship, yielding thermodynamic values of delta H degrees = -79,000 J/mol (-18,900 cal/mol) and delta S degrees = J/degrees K mol (-30.1 e.u.). Comparison of the ratio of equilibrium constants for cyanide ligation to methemoglobin the heme octapeptide with the ratio of equilibrium constants for azide ligation to methemoglobin and the heme octapeptide suggests that cyanide binding to the methemoproteins is much smaller than expected by comparison to azide binding. The differences in the ratios, the thermodynamic values, and the preferred binding geometries suggest that CN- ligation, like CO ligation, is sterically hindered. A comparison of these ratios to similar ratios for CO, O2, and NO binding suggests that the Fe-CN bond angle is less subject to distortion than the Fe-CO bond and/or additional binding interactions contribute to N3- but not to CN-binding to the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1592815834,"Purified ovalbumin from hen egg white was fractionated by concanavalin A (Con A)/Sepharose chromatography. Four major fractions were separated, one unadsorbed fraction OA, followed by a minor fraction OA', and three adsorbed fractions OB, OC, and OD. The recovery was over 90%. Fractional ratios (OA:OB:OC:OD) were 16:6:37:41. The amino acid composition of the four fractions were quite similar. Galactose was only detected in OA, and the mannose content in OD was high as compared to that of the other fractions. The glycopeptide resulting from pepsin digestion of ovalbumin was also fractionated by Con A/Sepharose. Four fractions were obtained, and they corresponded to fractions OA, OB, OC, and OD. The amino acid compositions of the peptides were identical, indicating that they were derived from the same region in ovalbumin. In order to study individual differences in ovalbumin microheterogeneity, ovalbumin samples prepared from individual eggs were subfractionated on Con A/Sepharose. Four ovalbumin samples prepared from the eggs of a single hen revealed the same elution profile and the same fractional ratios. Fractional ratios of 17 individual preparations varied from 7:2:19:72 to 27:5:40:28 (OA:OB:OC:OD). A constant relation was found among the fractional ratios: the OB, OC and OD contents were dependent on the OA content, and the proportion of OD was in inverse relation to those of OA and OC. The OB content was low and did not change in all ranges of OA content. The present observations indicate that a single hen produces ovalbumin with qualitatively and quantitatively similar carbohydrate chains by unknown mechanisms; moreover, individual differences exist in ovalbumin microheterogeneity which follow constant patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2010681290,A single motoneuron provides multiterminal innervation to the limb accessory flexor muscle in lobster. Its nerve terminals and synapses relocate to more distal sites during primary development and growth beyond sexual maturity. This remodeling of multiterminal innervation occurs by sprouting of nerve terminals and synapses from preexisting ones.
https://openalex.org/W2101718765,The major coat protein (gene 8 product) of bacteriophage M13 is an integral membrane protein during infection of host cells. It is synthesized as a larger precursor (procoat) with a leader sequence of 23 amino acids at its amino terminus. In vivo studies have shown that procoat only inserts into the host-cell plasma membrane after its synthesis is completed. We now demonstrate that procoat can post-translationally insert into inverted cytoplasmic membrane vesicles from E. coli and can be processed proteolytically to yield coat protein. Procoat changes from an assembly-competent substrate to an incompetent (denatured) form within minutes after its synthesis; much of the procoat that accumulates during an hour of in vitro synthesis is therefore denatured. These studies emphasize the importance of stringent criteria for the demonstration of obligate cotranslational assembly.
https://openalex.org/W1603822106,"The kinetic behavior of the carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase was studied in isolated rat heart mitochondria. The kinetic parameters, Km(apparent) and Vmax, for carnitine were determined by measuring the rates of influx of [14C]carnitine using two different methods to quench the exchange reaction. The range of the Km(app) was 0.38-1.50 mM and the Vmax was 0.20-0.34 nmol/mg . min by both methods. Carnitine esters of acetyl isobutyryl, and octanoyl groups were competitive with carnitine for uptake and Ki values for these esters were 1.1, 2.6, and 0.10 mM, respectively. The Km(app) for carnitine was increased in the presence of these carnitine esters, while the Vmax for carnitine was unchanged. Distribution of radiolabel from free [14C]carnitine into acetylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, and octanoylcarnitine during the incubations was examined by thin layer chromatography and was negligible. The Km values for carnitine and the Ki value for acetylcarnitine are within the concentration ranges of these compounds in the intact heart (Idell-Wenger, J. A., Grotyohann, L. W., and Neely, J. R. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4310-4318). the Ki values for isobutyrylcarnitine and octanoylcarnitine may also be within their concentration ranges in vivo, but exact concentrations in heart muscle are not known. These data support the concept that carnitine esters of short (acetylcarnitine), branched (isobutyrylcarnitine), and medium (octanoylcarnitine) chain acyl groups compete with free carnitine for transport into the mitochondria under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W36236453,"Oleic acid and oleoyl coenzyme A were found to be inhibitors of microsomal and purified 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) activities. Inhibition of the microsomal enzyme was time-dependent and complete in 10 min. The addition of oleic acid, but not of oleoyl-CoA, resulted in gross morphological changes in the microsomal vesicles. Purification of the enzyme increased its sensitivity to both inhibitors, indicating that the microsomal membrane was not a necessary component of the inhibition. In all instances, oleoyl-CoA was a more potent inhibitor than oleic acid. Either of the two substrates, HMG-CoA or NADPH, could prevent the inhibition significantly when present prior to addition of the lipids. However, the substrates could not reverse the inhibition once it had occurred. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, coenzyme A, or both together had no preventive effect. The presence of HMG-CoA did not prevent the morphological changes seen in the presence of oleic acid, yet the enzyme activity was protected. Phosphatidylcholine or bovine serum albumin, both capable of binding to the lipids, were able to prevent the inhibition but were unable to reverse it. By contrast, crude rat liver cytosol reversed the inhibition completely. In the absence of NADPH, the incubation of purified enzyme with HMG-CoA resulted in inhibition of the enzyme; on the other hand, incubation of the purified reductase with NADPH, in the absence of HMG-CoA, resulted in an activation of the enzyme. These data strongly indicate that substrates (or inhibitors) may induce conformational changes in the enzyme molecule and that a regulatory mechanism possibly exists in the cell involving substrate levels, cytosolic factors, and naturally occurring inhibitors such as fatty acids and their acyl-CoA derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W1554996438,"Antisera against a Mr = 60,000 peptide containing the gelatin-binding domain of human plasma fibronectin (McDonald, J. A., and Kelley, D. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8848-8858) bound the Mr = 60,000 peptide and intact fibronectin but not three other fragments released by leukocyte elastase proteinolysis (the Mr = 25,000 amino-terminal sequence, Mr = 140,000 sequence containing cell adhesive activity, and a Mr = 31,000 fragment). Affinity-purified Fab' blocked Mr = 60,000 peptide binding to gelatin and inhibited plasma and cellular fibronectin gelatin binding without affecting fibronectin-mediated cell spreading. In contrast, antifibronectin Fab' absorbed with the gelatin-binding fragment completely blocked fibronectin-mediated cell spreading. These data indicate that the gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin is immunogenic, and antisera against this domain recognize cellular fibronectin gelatin-binding sites. Inhibition of gelatin binding but not cell spreading by anti-gelatin binding domain Fab' confirms the hypothesis that fibronectin has separate sites mediating these activities. Selective inhibition of fibronectin-collagen binding by domain-specific antisera may help elucidate the role of fibronectin in organization of the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1578587693,"Exogenously administered heme is incorporated into rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 in vivo (Correia, M. A., Farrell, G. C. Schmid, R. S., Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., Yost, G. S., and Mico, B. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 15-17). This was demonstrated in allylisopropylacetamide (AIA)-treated rats by the formation of a radioactive adduct derived from the porphyrin of the administered [3H]heme and AIA. Formation of such adducts requires catalytic participation of cytochrome P-450 in oxidative metabolism of AIA to an active species which subsequently alkylates the prosthetic heme moiety of the cytochrome. These results suggested that the exogenous heme had been incorporated prosthetically into cytochrome P-450 prior to generation of the adduct. However, the possibility remained that a minute portion of the inactivating AIA-species escaped the catalytic site of the generating hemoprotein and alkylated the nonprosthetically bound isotopic heme. To examine this critical possibility, we have employed a chemical derivative of heme which binds to the microsomal membrane. Although this heme derivative is a structurally suitable target for attack by the inactivating drug species, we found that it was unsuitable for incorporation into the prosthetic site of cytochrome P-450. The findings of this study provide irrefutable evidence that the label recovered in drug-porphyrin adducts is derived exclusively from radioactive heme incorporated prosthetically into cytochrome P-450. Drug-porphyrin adducts can therefore be used as reliable probes to follow the transfer of heme from the hepatic free heme pool into cytochrome P-450."

https://openalex.org/W1978549714,"We measured lipid lateral diffusion rates for a series of teratocarcinoma-derived and embryo-derived cell lines, using the technique of fluorescence photobleaching recovery with a fluorescent lipid probe, C16dil. The probe diffuses more rapidly in plasma membranes of embryonal carcinoma cells than in plasma membranes of teratocarcinoma-derived endodermal cell lines. When embryonal carcinoma cells are induced to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid, diffusion constants of C16dil are reduced to levels typical of endoderm. These changes are paralleled by differences in membrane cholesterol content; membrane free cholesterol levels in embryonal carcinoma lines are approximately half those found in endodermal lines, and are markedly increased upon retinoic-acid-induced differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1826387611,"The rho globin is the major beta-like chain found in 5-day-old chick embryos. In association with two unique early embryonic alpha-like globins, it forms the two major hemoglobins of early chick development. This paper presents the complete amino acid sequence of the rho globin. There are no amino acid differences between the rho chain and the adult chicken beta chain at known Bohr effect or organophosphate-binding positions, and there are only 19 differences altogether. The rho globin ought to be functionally equivalent to the adult chicken beta globin. Since the adult and embryonic chains are very similar in sequence, they may be products of a relatively recent gene duplication in the chicken beta globin gene family. The possibility of a gene correction event is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1490798236,Addition of a substoichiometric amount of podophyllotoxin to microtubules which are at steady state decreases the rate of incorporation of radioactive subunits into the microtubules. The magnitude of this effect depends on the fraction of the total number of each of the microtubule ends which is capped by tubulin-podophyllotoxin subunits; these fractions depend on the concentration of podophyllotoxin used. A quantitative relationship is presented which correlates the extent of tubulin-podophyllotoxin capping of the microtubule ends with alterations in the rate for steady state subunit incorporation. An analysis based upon this relationship reveals that tubulin-podophyllotoxin caps both ends of the microtubule. Previously proposed mechanisms which involve tubulin-podophyllotoxin capping at only one end of the microtubule are analyzed.

Plasma calcium concentrations of vitamin D3-deficient or normal birds, 1.68 and 3.47 mM, respectively, do not change significantly in response to the two thyroid hormones. However, plasma phosphorus concentration in the vitamin D3-deficient birds increases markedly from 1.47 to 2.70 mM. A slight increase was noted in the plasma phosphorus level of normal birds receiving the hormones. The present study suggests that alterations in the enzymatic metabolism of vitamin D3 in the kidney are responsible for the disturbances of mineral balance in hyperthyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W1600134793,"Abstract The appearance of an immune response in some sickle cell anemia patients to reinfused autologous erythrocytes which had been treated with methyl acetimidate (Gabuzda, T. G., Chao, T. L., Berenfeld, M. R., and Gelbart, T. (1980) Blood 56, 1041--1047) was a serious impediment to the clinical application of this reagent as an extracorporeal antisickling agent. The immune reaction was doubtlessly due to acetamidination of membrane protein amino groups. Protection of these amino groups with a reversible reagent prior to treatment of the cells with methyl acetimidate should prevent the antigenic reaction. This result was realized by preequilibration of erythrocytes with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate prior to addition of methyl acetimidate. Subsequent washing of the cells to remove excess reagents and to hydrolyze the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate/membrane protein Schiff base adduct regenerates native protein amino groups of the erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1610941740,"DNase a has a broad, asymmetric fluorescence emission peak centered at 341 nm. Binding of Ca2+ of Mg2+ to DNase shifted the peak to 342 nm and caused a 10% fluorescence enhancement. Half of the maximum change occurred at 6 x 10(-5) M Ca2+ or at 6 x 10(-4) M Mg2+. The change in fluorescence is most likely due to a conformational change in DNase which occurs when Ca2+ or Mg2+ is bound to the nonspecific tight Ca2+ binding site on DNase. The kinetics of the fluorescence change, followed by stopped flow techniques, show a fast phase (65%) and a slow phase (35%). At 1 mM Ca2+, the half-time for the fast phase is 17 ms, and for the slow phase, 3.5 min. Both phases of the reaction are first order in DNase and independent of Ca2+ at concentrations above 1 mM. DNase incubated with Ca2+ undergoes a slow (t 1/2 approximately equal to 6 min) 1.5-fold increase in activity. This activation follows pseudo-first order kinetics and is not due to the presence of additional Ca2+ in the substrate. The simplest hypothesis which accounts for these data, and previously reported studies on the effect of Ca2+ on DNase, is that DNase exists in 3 conformational states at 25 degrees C and pH 7.5. The kinetics are consistent with a mechanism which can be diagrammed as: (formula: see text) where A, A, and B represent three conformational states of DNase."
