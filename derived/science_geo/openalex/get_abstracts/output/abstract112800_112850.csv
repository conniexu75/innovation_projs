https://openalex.org/W2004152842,"Annexins are a family of calcium- and phospholipid-binding proteins implicated in mediating membrane-related processes such as secretion, signal transduction, and ion channel activity. The crystal structure of rat annexin V was solved to 1.9 angstrom resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement. Unlike previously solved annexin V structures, all four domains bound calcium in this structure. Calcium binding in the third domain induced a large relocation of the calcium-binding loop regions, exposing the single tryptophan residue to the solvent. These alterations in annexin V suggest a role for domain 3 in calcium-triggered interaction with phospholipid membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1643583901,"Insulin stimulation of glucose transport involves the translocation of vesicles containing the glucose transporter Glut 4 to the plasma membrane. Rab proteins, which have been implicated in the regulation of vesicular traffic, were studied in adipocytes. Rab3B, Rab3C, Rab4, and Rab8 were detected, but Rab3A was not. In the absence of insulin, Rab3B and Rab3C were cytosolic, while Rab4 and Rab8 were associated with membranes. Only Rab4 distribution was modified by insulin. In unstimulated adipocytes, most of Rab4 was found in a low density microsomal fraction, which also contained the majority of Glut 4. After insulin treatment, a 50% decrease in Rab4 content was observed, concomitantly with a departure of transporters to the plasma membrane. The dose responses for the departure of Glut 4 and Rab4 from the microsomal fractions were superimposable, half-maximal effects being obtained with 0.1 nM insulin. Rab4 was redistributed to the cytosol and its movement was reversed by insulin withdrawal. When Glut 4-containing vesicles were immunopurified with antibodies to Glut 4, Rab4 was found in the immune pellets, suggesting that Rab4 was tightly associated with the vesicles. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A that is known to stimulate Glut 4 translocation, caused the same movement of Rab4 from low density microsomal fraction to the cytosol, while the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate had no effect. We suggest that insulin and okadaic acid induce a cycling of Rab4 from a vesicular fraction containing the Glut 4 transporter to the cytosol and that this cycling may participate in the insulin stimulatory action on glucose transporter translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2135579781,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a multifunctional protein resident in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum that facilitates protein folding via disulfide bond isomerization. Previously we determined that PDI binds a variety of peptides that can be covalently attached to this protein via a photoreactive cross-linker. We have now investigated the relationship between the peptide binding site and the ability of PDI to catalyze disulfide bond isomerization. PDI has two identical sequences, -WCGHCK-, that have been demonstrated to be important in PDI-catalyzed disulfide isomerization. We have found that other proteins containing these thioredoxin-like active site sequences do not bind the photoreactive peptide probes. Moreover, although chemical modification of the 2 cysteines within the thioredoxin-like active site regions completely inhibits PDI-catalyzed disulfide isomerization, these modifications do not affect peptide binding by PDI. Both of these observations suggest that peptide binding occurs at a site other than the putative PDI active sites. To localize the site in PDI at which binding occurs, we used a radiolabeled peptide photoaffinity probe. Peptide fragments generated by cleavage of 125I-peptide-labeled PDI with cyanogen bromide yielded a single 8-kDa polypeptide fragment containing the 125I-labeled peptide site, but neither of the putative catalytic sites of PDI. An 125I-labeled tryptic peptide was generated from this cyanogen bromide fragment and determined by microsequencing to contain residues 451-476 of PDI; this 26-residue peptide is noteworthy because of its extremely high content of acidic amino acids. Based on these findings we conclude that the peptide binding site is located in the COOH-terminal domain of the protein, and it is distinct from the two active sites for PDI-catalyzed disulfide isomerization and from the region of PDI that has estrogen receptor sequence similarity."
https://openalex.org/W1520251373,"Global (all cells in an acinus) and focal (1-2 out of 10-15 cells) stimulation of pancreatic acini with bombesin or t-butyloxycarbonyl-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-Tyr-Asp-2-phenylethyl ester (CCKJ) together with modulation of gap junction (GJ) permeability by octanol and NO2- was used to study the role of GJ permeability in controlling [Ca2+]i oscillations and enzyme secretion. GJ permeability was quantitated by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Octanol at 0.5 mM markedly reduced, whereas 15 mM NO2- increased GJ permeability. Focal application of bombesin caused synchronized oscillations in the entire acinus, whereas global stimulation resulted in asynchronous oscillations. Increasing GJ permeability with NO2- had no effect on bombesin-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations. Octanol inhibited ongoing oscillations evoked by focal or global bombesin stimulation. However, when GJ were blocked prior to stimulation, subsequent global stimulation with bombesin induced long-lasting oscillations in all cells. Re-establishing GJ communication for as little as 37.5 s conferred GJ dependence on the order and time of [Ca2+]i spiking evoked by global bombesin stimulation. Focal and global stimulation with CCKJ gave different patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations. However, in contrast to bombesin, inhibition of GJ with octanol had no effect on oscillations induced by global CCKJ stimulation. Increasing GJ permeability with NO2- synchronized CCKJ-stimulated oscillations by equalizing the amplitude and increasing the frequency in all cells within an acinus. These observations suggest that amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations can be regulated independently of each other, and that GJ permeable molecules modulate the frequency of [Ca2]i oscillation in an agonist-specific manner. Regardless of the agonist, increasing the frequency of oscillations by modulation of GJ permeability correlated with an increased enzyme secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1480346494,"Pollen from trees of the order Fagales (e.g. birch, alder, hazel, oak, and hornbeam) are a major cause of Type I allergies observed in early spring. Previously, we reported the cloning and sequencing of Bet v I, the major birch pollen allergen, which showed high sequence similarities to a family of plant pathogen-activated genes (Breiteneder, H., Pettenburger, K., Bito, A., Valenta, R., Kraft, D., Rumpold, H., Scheiner, O., and Breitenbach, M. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 1935-1938). Here, we present the results on the expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant Bet v I produced in Escherichia coli as fusion and non-fusion protein, respectively. The purified recombinant proteins were analyzed to verify purity and structural integrity, and their immunological properties were compared to those of Bet v I isolated from birch pollen (natural Bet v I). Immunoblot analyses showed that the recombinant proteins are specifically recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against natural Bet v I as well as by IgE from birch pollen-allergic patients. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed a decreased IgE-binding activity of the recombinant fusion Bet v I compared to the non-fusion and natural Bet v I proteins, which probably results from conformational changes due to the fusion tail. Recombinant non-fusion Bet v I was equivalent to natural Bet v I with respect to IgE-binding properties, the ability to induce in vitro proliferation of allergen-specific T-cell clones, and the ability to release histamine from basophils derived from birch pollen-allergic patients."
https://openalex.org/W1560316172,"Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells. To examine whether repression by chromatin proteins could contribute to the low level of Alu expression, a conserved Alu element from the fourth intron of the human alpha-fetoprotein gene was reconstituted with purified octamer or tetramer particles. Analysis of reconstitutes revealed that this Alu element directed translational and rotational positioning of octamers as well as tetramers. In vitro transcription experiments with reconstituted templates demonstrated that RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription of the Alu element was profoundly repressed by positioned octamer particles. Furthermore, complete CpG methylation of this template enhanced the capacity of tetramers to repress transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1498184124,"Thyroid hormone receptors are transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent manner. Although thyroid hormone receptors are known to bind to the hexamer 5'-AGGTCA, it is not known if this represents the optimal binding site. Therefore, a nonbiased strategy was used to identify DNA sequences which bind thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 with high affinity. Such DNA sequences were isolated from a pool of random sequences using a strategy combining an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the polymerase chain reaction. It was found that thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 binds with highest affinity to the octamer 5'-TAAGGTCA. Mutation of the two 5'-nucleotides decreased the affinity of thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 for this DNA sequence approximately 5-fold, and the importance of those nucleotides in receptor binding was confirmed by DNA footprinting. A single copy of the octamer sequence (but not the hexamer AGGTCA) could impart T3 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in a transient transfection assay. The results indicate that the optimal binding site for thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 is 2 base pairs larger than previously thought, and that a single binding site can function as a response element. In addition, we speculate that the optimal binding sites for thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and retinoic acid receptors may not be identical, as had previously been thought."
https://openalex.org/W1505146479,"The rat alpha 1-1 glutathione S-transferase (GST) contains a single, non-essential tryptophan and only 8 tyrosines in each subunit. One of these tyrosines, Tyr-9, hydrogen bonds to the substrate glutathione and stabilizes the nucleophilic thiolate anion. Two mutant proteins that allow for the spectrocopic determination of the pKa of this catalytic residue have been constructed. The W21F mutant provides a fully active GST with no tryptophans, and the double mutant W21F/Y9F lacks both tryptophan and the active site tyrosine. The intrinsic fluorescence and absorbance properties of these mutants are dominated by tyrosine. Fluorescence emission, fluorescence excitation, and absorbance spectral changes of samples containing the W21F mutant at several pH values in the range 6.8-9.0 reveal a pH-dependent increase in the contribution of tyrosinate. No spectral changes are observed with the W21F/Y9F protein in this pH range. At pH 12.5, both proteins exhibit complete deprotonation of all tyrosines. The pKa of Tyr-9 determined from these spectroscopic changes is 8.3-8.5. The changes in absorbance at 250 and 295 nm correspond to titration of 0.95 +/- 0.29 tyrosines/subunit in the W21F protein between pH 6.9 and 9.3. Moreover, addition of the inhibitor S-hexylglutathione results in an apparent increase in the pKa of Tyr-9. Together, these results indicate that the catalytically active Tyr of GSTs has a pKa value that is 1.8-2.0 pKa units below tyrosine in solution. It is likely that this decrease in the pKa of Tyr-9 contributes to catalysis by altering the equilibrium position of the proton shared between Tyr-9 and GSH, and this active site residue may function as a general base catalyst in addition to a hydrogen bond donor."
https://openalex.org/W1531791809,"It has been proposed that the binding of Zn2+ to alpha-lactalbumin switches the conformation to one akin to a state intermediate in the folding of the protein. However, the high resolution x-ray crystal structure of human alpha-lactalbumin-Zn2+ complex at 1.7-A resolution (pH 7.6) does not reveal any significant change in conformation from the native state. The Zn2+ ion binds specifically in the cleft of alpha-lactalbumin (the region which forms the active site of the homologous protein lysozyme). This may suggest a possible role for Zn2+ binding in lactose synthase complex. The coordination of the Zn2+ ion involves a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal, the crystal contacts being stabilized by a SO4(2-) ion bound at the interface between three molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1863556096,"Ribosomal protein L32 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulates the splicing of its own transcript (1, 2) apparently by interacting with a structure composed largely of the 5' exon. However, even in strains overproducing L32 mRNA, e.g. from a cDNA copy of the gene, little accumulation of L32 is observed after a brief pulse label. When the 5' leader of the RPL32 mRNA is replaced by an exogenous leader, the amount of pulse-labeled L32 increases severalfold, suggesting that L32 regulates the translation of its own mRNA, acting through sequences in the 5' region. This conclusion was confirmed by the observation that in cells carrying a chimeric gene in which the L32 leader is fused to LacZ coding sequences, the presence of a second gene that overexpresses L32 itself reduces the level of beta-galactosidase by 50%, in spite of a doubling of L32-lacZ fusion mRNA, presumably due to stabilization of the message. Mutations within the 5' leader that abolish the regulation of splicing also abolish the regulation of translation, suggesting that the regulation of translation by L32 involves a structure similar to that proposed for the regulation of splicing. In cells overproducing L32-mRNA about half the excess mRNA was found in ribonucleoproteins of < 25 S, unassociated with ribosomal particles. Much of the rest was found in ribonucleoproteins of 80-120 S."
https://openalex.org/W1874789872,"The PMA2 gene is a presumed isogene of the PMA1 gene, encoding the major yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. When controlled by its own promoter, PMA2 in multiple copies does not complement a deficient PMA1 gene. Under the control of the PMA1 promoter, however, and expressed on a centromeric plasmid in yeast strains specially designed for stable expression, the PMA2 gene replaces the PMA1 gene to some extent, allowing growth on standard medium but not on acidic media. Plasma membranes of cells expressing only the PMA2 enzyme display low ATPase activity correlating with low amounts of PMA2 protein. This low activity is maintained throughout growth and does not increase when overexpression is favored by increased gene dosage. Immunoelectron microscopy reveals a dramatic proliferation of intracellular structures (probably endoplasmic reticulum) in which overexpressed PMA2 protein accumulates. Overexpression of PMA1 ATPase causes a similar phenomenon, but quantitative effects are lower compared to PMA2. These results indicate that the PMA2 gene encodes a functional plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase and suggest a specific control of the intracellular traffic of plasma membrane ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2111688750,"Functions of potA and -D proteins in the spermidine-preferential uptake system, which consists of potA, -B, -C, and -D proteins, were studied. Spermidine uptake activity was lost when the gene for potA or potD protein was disrupted, and transformation of the cells with potA or potD gene recovered the uptake activity. PotD protein was found to bind spermidine with a 3.2 microM dissociation constant. Spermidine uptake by membrane vesicles prepared from Escherichia coli DR112 containing the genes for potA, -B, and -C proteins was strongly dependent on the addition of potD protein, and its optimal concentration was 5 microM when 10 microM spermidine was used as substrate. The ATP dependence of spermidine uptake was examined with the atp mutant of E. coli. The uptake was completely dependent on ATP. When the membrane potential was extinguished by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the uptake activity was decreased by 60% even if ATP existed. This suggests that the membrane potential is also involved in the spermidine uptake. ATP was found to bind to potA protein. In the spermidine transport-deficient mutant E. coli NH1596, valine 135 of potA protein, which is located between two consensus amino acid sequences for nucleotide binding, was replaced by methionine. Although the amount of mutated potA protein expressed in E. coli cells was the same as that of normal potA protein and the mutated protein was membrane-associated, no significant spermidine uptake was observed. The results taken together indicate that potA and -D proteins are absolutely necessary for spermidine uptake in conjunction with the two channel forming proteins (potB and -C)."
https://openalex.org/W1548287977,"The folding of influenza hemagglutinin was analyzed after in vitro translation and translocation into dog pancreas microsomes. Ectodomain folding of this membrane glycoprotein involves the formation of six intrachain disulfide bonds. After translation under reducing conditions, the folding process was initiated by the addition of oxidized glutathione or diamide. For correct folding a reduction-oxidation potential of -310 to -210 mV had to be reached in the bulk solution. At lower values, or after addition of other oxidants such as NAD or NADP, no HA disulfides formed. At more oxidizing values interchain disulfide-cross-linked aggregates were generated. Judging by their electrophoretic gel mobility and immunoreactivity, the folding intermediates observed in microsomes were indistinguishable from those previously seen in the endoplasmic reticulum of live cells. The kinetics of folding was also similar, but the efficiency being 43% was somewhat lower. The folding process was dependent on lumenal factors within the rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles and also on some macromolecular component(s) present in the reticulocyte lysate. The results showed that dog pancreas microsomes provide a useful system for protein folding studies."
https://openalex.org/W1502501056,"Abstract We prepared discoidal and spherical model high density lipoprotein (HDL) with apolipoprotein A-I and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine at various lipid:protein ratios and compared their reactivity with exo- and endopeptidases to that of human HDL2 and HDL3. Limited proteolysis with trypsin, Staphylococcus V8 protease, and elastase yielded a major stable peptide of 11,000-11,500 daltons under conditions which completely degraded lipid-free A-I. By Western blotting this protease-resistant fragment was shown to consist of the amino-terminal 90-100 residues of the A-I protein; the residues on the carboxyl side of this peptide are therefore protease-sensitive and appear to correlate with the putative hinge region, which is especially reactive with antibodies. The amino terminus was very resistant to digestion with a variety of aminopeptidases, whereas carboxypeptidases could remove up to 70 residues from the lipid-free A-I protein or 12-24 residues from A-I in various HDL. When these truncated forms of A-I, in combination with lipid, were used to examine binding interactions with rat hepatic plasma membranes, it was found that removal of up to 20-24 residues from the carboxyl terminus had no significant effect on binding, whereas removal of 70 residues completely eliminated specific binding to the membranes. Taken together, our data indicate that there is a protease-resistant domain constituted by the first 90 residues of A-I, which, in HDL, contain little of the class of amphipathic helix characteristic of the rest of the molecule and most likely form a structure dominated by protein-protein interactions. At the carboxyl end of the protein, there is a functional domain constituted by residues 149-219 that possesses the capacity to bind to proteins on hepatic membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1536698642,"NGFI-A is an immediate early gene, encoding a zinc finger protein, rapidly activated after mitogenic stimulation. NGFI-A gene expression was found to be rapidly and transiently induced after interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation of G1 lymphoblasts, as well as during the G0/G1 transition, when stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA). Activation of both Ca2+ and protein kinase C pathways, separately, in quiescent T lymphocytes produced a partial induction of this gene; however, both stimuli together are necessary to obtain a full response. ConA-induced activation of NGFI-A in quiescent cells was inhibited by immunosuppressors. 8-Bromo-cAMP was able to inhibit the expression of this gene in G1 lymphoblasts after IL-2 stimulation, but failed to interfere with the ConA-induced expression in quiescent T lymphocytes. Exposure of T cells to an NGFI-A antisense oligonucleotide blocked the ConA- and IL-2-induced proliferation of the cells, measured as thymidine incorporation and cell number. This inhibition provides direct evidence that the early gene NGFI-A plays a regulatory role in growth control processes of lymphocytes and that its expression is essential for cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1493801575,"We report here the sequence of the RPM2 gene which codes for the 105-kDa protein previously purified from the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown by genetic techniques to be required for mitochondrial RNase P activity. The sequence predicts a primary translation product of 1202 residues with a molecular mass of 139 kDa and no obvious sequence similarity to any known protein in the data bases. There are 122 amino-terminal amino acids predicted by the gene that are not found in the purified protein, some of which may play a role in mitochondrial targeting of the protein. Antibodies raised against a trpE-105-kDa fusion protein recognize a 105-kDa protein in wild-type cells but not in cells carrying a disruption of the RMP2 gene. Immune, but not preimmune serum, immunoprecipitates the RNase P RNA and the mitochondrial RNase P activity. Thus, the 105-kDa protein forms a complex with RNase P RNA and is required for RNase P activity as predicted for a bona fide subunit of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2105474743,"Neocarzinostatin chromophore (NCS chrom) was found to induce site-specific cleavage at the 3' side of a bulge in single-stranded DNA in the absence of thiol. This reaction involved the oxidative formation of a DNA fragment with a nucleoside 5'-aldehyde at its 5' terminus and generated an ultraviolet light-absorbing and fluorescent species of post-activated drug containing tritium abstracted from the carbon at the 5' position of the target nucleotide. The DNAs containing point mutations that disrupt the bulge were not cleavage substrates and did not generate this drug product. Thus, DNA is an active participant in its own destruction, and NCS chrom may be useful as a probe for bulged structures in nucleic acids."

https://openalex.org/W1585812111,"Assembly of the Escherichia coli primosome requires six proteins, PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT, acting at a primosome assembly site (pas) on an SSB-coated single-stranded (ss) DNA. Assembly is initiated by interactions of PriA and PriB with ssDNA and the pas. PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT then act on the PriA-PriB-DNA complex to yield the primosome. In the primosome, the dATPase (ATPase) of PriA becomes hyper-activated. In addition, the assembled primosome appears to block the pas, preventing it from activating additional PriA molecules. Either ATP alone or dATP in combination with GTP is sufficient for primosome assembly, while ATP or GTP provides for its maintenance during isolation. These nucleotide requirements can be reconciled with the need for ATP or dATP for DnaB-DnaC complex formation and hydrolysis of ATP or GTP by DnaB when it binds ssDNA. Such isolated primosomes contain a dATPase, the hallmark of PriA, and a GTPase indicative of DnaB. Further studies indicate that the isolated primosome contains the PriB replication activity in addition to PriA and DnaB."
https://openalex.org/W1577198464,"Targeting of preproteins to mitochondria is mediated by the receptor complex in the outer membrane that contains two import receptors and the general insertion pore with MOM38 (38-kDa mitochondrial outer membrane protein) as major constituent. As all components of the receptor complex have to be imported from the cytosol themselves, the specificity of their targeting is fundamental for the correct assembly of mitochondria. None of the receptors is involved in its own import; the precursor of the main receptor MOM19 is even targeted without any surface receptor but directly assembles with MOM38. We report that import of the precursor of MOM38 strictly depended on surface receptors. The import followed a new highly selective mechanism in that both receptors together were needed for the specific binding of the preprotein to the outer membrane surface, which was followed by its assembly into the receptor complex. These findings suggest that targeting of the mitochondrial targeting components involves a complex system of mutual specificity control, ensuring a selective assembly of the components into preexisting import sites."
https://openalex.org/W2152064372,"Abstract Adenylosuccinate adenosine 5'-monophosphate lyase (EC 4.3.2.2; ASL) catalyzes two distinct reactions in adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) biosynthesis. A S413P mutation in ASL segregates with mental retardation in an affected family (Stone, R. L., Aimi, J., Barshop, B. A., Jaeken, J., Van den Berghe, G., Zalkin, H., and Dixon, J. E. (1992) Nature Genet. 1, 59-63). ASL and S413P ASL have been expressed, purified, and kinetically characterized. Lowering the Escherichia coli growth temperature to 25 degrees C and the concentration of inducer, isopropyl-1-thio-beta,D-galactopyranoside, to 40 microM was necessary for synthesis of soluble, tetrameric enzymes. The recombinant enzymes were purified to homogeneity using anion exchange chromatography followed by chromatography on Blue 2A Sepharose. At pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C, the kcat for cleavage of 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide ribotide (SAI-CAR) by ASL was 90 s-1 with a Km of 2.35 microM. The kcat for adenylosuccinate (SAMP) cleavage was 97 s-1 with a Km of 1.79 microM. The catalytic mechanism involved one general base catalyst (pK alpha = 6.4) and one general acid catalyst (pK alpha = 7.5). ASL follows an ordered uni-bi reaction mechanism with fumarate released first. 5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and AMP were competitive with SAICAR and SAMP (Ki[AICAR] = 11.3 microM; Ki[AMP] = 9.2 microM), whereas fumarate inhibited noncompetitively (Kii = 2.3 mM, Kis = 2.8 mM). The competitive inhibition by AICAR and AMP suggests a single active site that binds both SAICAR and SAMP. The kinetic constants at pH 7.0, 25 degrees C and the kcat/Km versus pH profiles for ASL and S413P ASL were very similar. These results are consistent with S413P being a structural rather than a catalytic defect."

https://openalex.org/W2106698084,"The mechanism and energetics of the secondary Pi transport system of A. johnsonii were studied in membrane vesicles and proteoliposomes in which the transport protein was functionally reconstituted. Pi uptake is strictly dependent on the presence of divalent cations, like Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, or Co2+. These cations form a MeHPO4 complex with up to 87% of the Pi present in the incubation mixture, suggesting that divalent cations and Pi are co-transported via a metal-phosphate chelate. Metal-phosphate uptake is driven by the proton motive force (interior negative and alkaline). The metal-phosphate/proton stoichiometry was close to unity. The transport system mediates efflux and homologous exchange of metal-phosphate, but not heterologous exchange of metal-phosphate and glycerol-3-P or glucose-6-P. Exchange and counterflow were essentially pH-independent while efflux and uptake increased with increasing pH. Efflux was inhibited by the proton motive force, whereas exchange was inhibited by the membrane potential only. These observations are consistent with an ordered mechanism for binding and dissociation of metal-phosphate and proton to and from the carrier protein and point to the recycling of a positively charged, protonated carrier protein during exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1604367031,"Microspectrofluorometry (fura-2) was combined with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to study bradykinin-activated calcium (Ca2+) influx in single control or v-Ki-ras-transformed NIH/3T3 (DT) fibroblasts. Application of bradykinin on DT cells, but not on control NIH/3T3 cells, evoked cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, but not in the absence of external Ca2+. This effect of zero external Ca2+ concentration could be mimicked by holding at depolarized membrane potentials. Cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations observed at holding potentials of -20 to -80 mV were terminated by holding at -10 mV or more depolarized potentials. The frequency of Ca2+ oscillations increased with membrane hyperpolarization. Bradykinin significantly enhanced the hyperpolarization-induced increases in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) upon membrane hyperpolarization only in DT cells but not in control cells. No [Ca2+]i increase upon hyperpolarization was observed in bradykinin-stimulated DT cells in the absence of external Ca2+, suggesting that bradykinin activates Ca2+ influx. [Ca2+]i increased upon application of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) into control and DT cells in an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner, indicating that NIH/3T3 fibroblasts have an Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-gated Ca2+ influx pathway. Ins-(1,3,4,5)P4, however, produced the sustained [Ca2+]i increase in DT cells, but not in control NIH/3T3 cells, suggesting that ras may lock the Ca2+ influx pathway at the activated state. Cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, bradykinin-enhanced Ca2+ influx, and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-induced Ca2+ influx were all similar in that activity was increased by membrane hyperpolarization. The results suggest that bradykinin-induced cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells are maintained by bradykinin-activated continuous Ca2+ influx which may use Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as an intracellular messenger."
https://openalex.org/W1556017763,"Mutations of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LOS1 gene cause the accumulation of end matured intron-containing pre-tRNAs at elevated temperatures. In an effort to decipher the role of the LOS1 protein in pre-tRNA splicing, we have analyzed the LOS1 gene and its protein product. The LOS1 gene is located on the left arm of chromosome XI and the order of genes in this area of the chromosome is .... URA1 ... SAC1 TRP3 UBA1 STE6 LOS1 .... FAS1..... The LOS1 open reading frame encodes a putative protein of 1100 amino acids that shows no significant homology to other genes. The LOS1 open reading frame was tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope recognized by the 12CA5 antibody. The 12CA5 antibody recognizes an epitope-tagged protein of the size predicted by the LOS1 open reading frame. Using this antibody for indirect immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies we show that the LOS1 protein is located in nuclei. Los1p cannot be extracted from nuclei by treatment with nucleases, salts, or Triton X-100. This insolubility suggests that Los1p is a component of the nucleoskeleton. We propose that LOS1 mutations may affect pre-tRNA processing via alteration of the nuclear matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1503006919,"Abstract The gene encoding surfactant protein A (SP-A) is expressed in type II pneumonocytes and is developmentally and hormonally regulated in fetal lung. In the present study, rabbit lung nuclear proteins were found to bind to two genomic elements within the 5'-flanking region of the rabbit SP-A gene, termed distal binding element (DBE; -986 to -977 base pairs) and proximal binding element (PBE; -87 to -70 base pairs). Binding activity was enriched in type II pneumonocytes as compared with whole lung tissue. Although binding activity was undetectable in nuclear proteins from rabbit liver and kidney, low levels of binding activity were detected in nuclear proteins from cardiac and skeletal muscle. DNase I footprinting indicated that lung nuclear proteins protected the palindromic sequence CCCACGTGGG in the DBE. The underlined core sequence is an E box motif; a similar sequence (CCCTCGTG) is present within the PBE. Both elements competed for binding to the same size species of nuclear proteins of M(r) approximately 69,000, 45,000, and 22,000. In type II cells transfected with fusion genes containing SP-A 5'-flanking DNA linked to the human growth hormone structural gene, mutagenesis of the DBE or PBE resulted in a marked reduction of basal and cyclic AMP-stimulated fusion gene expression. These findings suggest that the DBE and PBE act as enhancers that interact with the same or related trans-acting proteins and serve an important role in type II cell-specific, cyclic AMP-mediated regulation of SP-A gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1576699875,"Abstract In many cell types, membrane proteins are specifically segregated to particular areas of the cell surface. It is known that this segregation is stabilized by anchorage proteins which interact with the cytoskeleton. However, the mechanism by which the interactions with anchorage proteins occur, as well as whether they may also play a role in the process of sorting, is not known. Using differentiated murine erythroleukemic cells, we have investigated the association between band 3 (a major transmembrane anion exchanger), and ankyrin (a cytoplasmic protein that links band 3 to the cytoskeleton). Our data demonstrate that the association between band 3 and ankyrin occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum or the first Golgi compartment. These data support a model in which the band 3-ankyrin complex is inserted as a cassette at the plasma membrane into the cytoskeletal network. Biosynthetic studies on cotransfected 293 cells with cDNAs encoding band 3 and the band 3 binding fragment of ankyrin (AnK-90), suggest that ankyrin is not only responsible for the anchorage of band 3 to the cytoskeleton but is also involved in the exit of band 3 out of the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1527875970,"Abstract The membrane topology of the NH2-terminal portion of human thromboxane synthase (TXS), a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, has been investigated. By sequence alignment, the first 6 residues of the mature TXS polypeptide are likely to form a distinctive tail structure not found in many other mammalian cytochromes P450 in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Peptides with either the ultimate 10 or 15 residues of the NH2 terminus of TXS were synthesized and used to produce site-directed antibodies. The resulting peptide antibodies were highly specific and recognized human TXS, as shown by binding assays and Western blot analysis. Binding of the peptide antibodies to recombinant TXS in transfected COS-1 and to endogenous TXS in THP-1 cells was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane to immunoglobulin was achieved with streptolysin O; general permeabilization, including the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, was accomplished with Triton X-100. Permeabilization of the plasma membrane was sufficient to produce binding of both peptide antibodies to their epitopes, indicating that the epitopes for both of the peptide antibodies were exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The results with the peptide antibodies provide direct experimental evidence supporting the topological model for membrane-bound cytochrome P450 proposed by Nelson and Strobel (Nelson, D. R., and Strobel, H. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6038-6050), in which the NH2 terminus is oriented toward the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1035342878,"Abstract A cDNA clone encoding a cognate 70-kDa heat shock protein from the spinach chloroplast outer envelope (SCE70) was recently characterized (Ko, K., Bornemisza, O., Kourtz, L., Ko, Z. W., Plaxton, W. C., and Cashmore, A. R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2986-2993). Initial studies revealed that SCE70 is targeted to the chloroplast outer envelope membrane without further processing. To determine whether SCE70 possesses a domain, we tested the targeting ability of SCE70 proteins with various carboxyl- and amino-terminal deletions. Carboxyl-terminal deletions of up to 60% of the protein had no apparent effect on the targeting ability of SCE70. Amino-terminal deletions abolished targeting to the chloroplast except when the extreme NH2-terminal 48-amino acid sequence was retained. We further assessed the chloroplast-targeting ability of the NH2-terminal 48 amino acids by fusing to the foreign protein, mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The resulting fusion protein, SCE70-DHFR, was localized to the outer envelope membrane of isolated chloroplasts. SCE70-DHFR exhibited targeting characteristics similar to native SCE70. The targeting of SCE70-DHFR was inhibited effectively by anti-SCE70 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking experiments revealed that SCE70-DHFR is targeted to the same complex as SCE70 in the chloroplast envelope. These results suggest that the extreme NH2 terminus of SCE70 is required for directing SCE70 to a destination in the chloroplast outer envelope membrane, possibly through assembling the polypeptide into a protein complex."

https://openalex.org/W1539812302,"In the troponin C (TnC) dumbbell, the NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes are well delineated, but the role of the central helix and especially the function of its long length remain doubtful. To study this, we used a cDNA construct encoding rabbit fast-twitch muscle TnC, comprising multiple restriction sequences to facilitate mutagenesis (Babu, A., Su, H., Ryu, Y. & Gulati, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15469-15474). Systematically, we have deleted 3-12 amino acid residues from the central helix and examined their effects in maximally activated skinned muscle fibers. Limiting the deletions to 7 amino acid residues manifested little change in maximal force development (Sheng, Z., Francois, J. M., Hitchcock, S. E. & Potter, J. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5711-5715). However, with further deletions, we now find that contractility was inhibited pari passu; by 12 deletions, the inhibition was complete. The critical minimum length for the central helix is thereby estimated as 27 A. The Ca2+ binding capacity (4 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein) as well as the structural characteristics (alpha-helicity by CD measurements and the fluorescence emitted by Tyr-109) indicated a well preserved global conformation of the short mutant. However, surprisingly, two of these short mutants filled each TnC slot under highly specific superloading conditions: one short molecule was taken up in EGTA solution, and the second molecule was captured and retained with Ca2+. They also rescued the contractile switch, evidently in a bimolecular reaction. Another short variant (putative skeletal fast muscle TnC-I-II), in which the NH2-terminal Ca(2+)-binding sites were incapacitated, failed to respond to superloading, indicating that sites III and IV could not substitute for sites I and II. The results suggest that a critical role of the central helix linker in TnC is to keep the two lobes optimally apart, evidently in proximity of their respective target sites on troponin I in the fiber."

https://openalex.org/W1606298493,"We have identified in mammalian cells a novel cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein of molecular mass 47 kDa. This protein was not recognized by either the CREB-327/341 or c-Jun antisera, and its tissue distribution did not overlap with those of the CREB and Jun families. For example, hepatoma and placental tissue did not contain the 47-kDa DNA-binding protein, but did contain the CREB isoforms. On the other hand, S49 lymphoma cells contained a high level of the 47-kDa DNA-binding protein but did not contain a 47-kDa Jun-related protein which was found in normal liver and hepatoma. This new 47-kDa factor bound to the CRE in the dephosphorylated form, and phosphorylation of the protein by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A completely abolished its DNA-binding activity. The isoforms of the CREB-327/341 family, on the other hand, bound to DNA in the phosphorylated form, and alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced significantly their interaction with CRE sequence. This reverse effect of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on the DNA-binding property of this new 47-kDa protein in particular distinguishes it from other known CREB factors and suggests that the protein might play a unique role in the regulation of cAMP-mediated transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1662080870,"Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic data were used to determine the kinetic mechanism for bovine liver dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPDase). Steady-state kinetic data suggested a random rapid-equilibrium mechanism with Km values for NADPH and uracil of 0.12 microM and 0.8 microM, respectively, and a kcat of 1.6 s-1 in Tris buffer at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C. The dissociation constant of DPDase for NADPH at 25 degrees C in the absence of uracil (0.09 microM) was similar to the Km for NADPH. DPDase also catalyzed the exchange of tritium in [4S-3H,4R-1H]NADP3H with solvent protons in the absence of uracil. DPDase inactivated by 5-ethynyluracil, which covalently modifies the enzyme at the uracil binding site, catalyzed the exchange reaction at the same rate (1 s-1) as native enzyme. Thus, the interaction of NADPH with DPDase was independent of the uracil binding site. Because DPDase catalyzed the exchange of deuterium in [4S-2H,4R-1H]NADP2H with solvent protons with a rate constant of 5.4 s-1, which was significantly larger than that for tritium, the analogous rate constant for exchange of the 4-hydrogen in NADPH must be significantly larger than 5 s-1. Consequently, intermediates on the exchange pathway were kinetically competent to participate in the reduction of uracil by NADPH (kcat = 1.6 s-1). Rate constants for reduction of DPDase by NADPH and 5,6-dihydrouracil were several orders of magnitude greater than kcat. The rate constants for dissociation of E.NADP+ (15 s-1) and for dissociation of E.5,6-dihydrouracil (> 250 s-1) were also greater than kcat. These results supported a random rapid-equilibrium kinetic mechanism and suggested kcat was an internal electron transfer between enzymic prosthetic groups."

https://openalex.org/W1647380057,"The lysosomal alpha-mannosidase gene in Dictyostelium discoideum is representative of a small group of genes that are expressed under two different conditions: 1) immediately upon removal of the bacterial food source from exponentially growing cells at 5 x 10(5) cells/ml. In this report we show that transcription of the alpha-mannosidase gene induced by starvation did not require protein synthesis in axenic wild-type strains, whereas protein synthesis was required for the transcriptional induction observed in response to PSF. Northern blot analysis was also done using mRNA from G alpha 1 and G alpha 2 gene disruption mutants. These genes encode subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins found at the cell surface in growing cells and cells early in development. The pattern of alpha-mannosidase gene expression was normal in these mutants as well as in mutants unable to produce the secreted glycoprotein conditioned medium factor or the cAMP receptor-1 protein. These genes have been shown to regulate the expression of many genes during early development. Promoter analysis studies identified a 145-base pair sequence element containing a TTG box which was required for alpha-mannosidase transcriptional induction under both starvation conditions and in response to PSF. The TTG box identified is an important regulatory element in the promoter of another prestarvation response gene, the discoidin I gamma gene. A ts mutant was found to misregulate the expression of both discoidin I and alpha-mannosidase expression at restrictive temperatures. Taken together these results suggest that the prestarvation response genes may be coordinately regulated possibly through the TTG box."
https://openalex.org/W1586021065,"Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human lysozyme cDNA encoding Asn instead of Gly22 synthesize a mutant lysozyme, [Asn22]lysozyme, with about 60% of the molecules bearing carbohydrate. This carbohydrate is predominantly of the complex type and contains a varied number of lactosamine repeats. In this study we show that the glycosylation of [Asn22] lysozyme fused to human cathepsin D is altered relative to [Asn22]lysozyme alone. The fusion protein is synthesized as a 66-kDa precursor that is cleaved to enzymatically active and antigenically positive cathepsin D and lysozyme. As compared with [Asn22]lysozyme the lysozyme moiety of the fusion protein shows an increased N-glycosylation and a decreased synthesis of lactosamine repeats. Cleavage of the precursor with cathepsin L has revealed that the lysozyme portion of the secreted fusion protein bears a complex type carbohydrate. The intracellularly released lysozyme portion of the fusion protein contains trimmed oligosaccharides. In the presence of NH4Cl the lysosomal targeting of the fusion protein is inhibited. The secreted protein is then enriched in molecules bearing phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharides in their lysozyme moiety. Our results indicate that carbohydrate processing in [Asn22]lysozyme, including the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate residues and of lactosamine repeats, is altered by the attached cathepsin D. The phosphorylation of the carbohydrate on the lysozyme portion results in a very efficient lysosomal targeting of the concerned fusion protein molecules."
