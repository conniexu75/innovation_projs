https://openalex.org/W2042652332,"Snowy tree crickets synchronize their chirps by responding to the preceding chirp of their neighbors. If a neighbor's chirp precedes his own, a cricket shortens his chirp and the following interval. If it follows his own, he lengthens his chirp interval and sometimes the following chirp. A single response of the first type may advance his phase of chirping 160 degrees and one of the second type may retard it 200 degrees ."
https://openalex.org/W2080792039,"A new genus and family of rhachitomous labyrinthodont amphibian, related to the Upper Paleozoic Dissorophidae and Trematopsidae, may be ancestral to some or all of the modern Amphibia. Doleserpeton occurs in Lower Permian fissure fill deposits in southwestern Oklahoma. It is unique among nonlissamphibian tetrapods in that it possesses pedicellate, bicuspid teeth together with nearly monospondylous vertebrae in which the main central element is a pleurocentrum. Doleserpeton may have been utilizing the food resources of the upland, terrestrial environment in a novel fashion for rhachitomes."
https://openalex.org/W2000520164,"Multiple generations of earthquake-induced sand blows in Quaternary sediments and soils near Charleston, South Carolina, are evidence of recurrent moderate to large earthquakes in that area. The large 1886 earthquake, the only historic earthquake known to have produced sand blows at Charleston, probably caused the youngest observed blows. Older (late Quaternary) sand blows in the Charleston area indicate at least two prehistoric earthquakes with shaking severities comparable to the 1886 event."
https://openalex.org/W1987792638,"Liquid cloud droplets supercooled to temperatures approaching -40°C have been detected at the base of a cirrostratus cloud through a combination of ground-based, polarization laser radar (lidar) and in situ aircraft measurements, Solar and thermal infrared radiative budget calculations based on these observations indicate that significant changes in the atmospheric heating distribution and the surface radiative budget may be attributed to liquid layers in cirrus clouds."
https://openalex.org/W1989286605,"The hypothesis of sea floor spreading and lithosphere plates seems to unify the origins of both oceanic ridges and volcanic arc-trench systems; therefore knowledge of well-known land areas should shed light upon sea floor tectonics. Impressive evidence of a major mid-Cenozoic discontinuity in the tectonic history of circum-Pacific land areas suggests a roughly synchronous change in sea floor development, more evidence for which may be anticipated in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2049906555,"A broadly tunable picosecond laser source and an ultrafast streak camera were used to measure temporally and spectrally resolved emission from intact phycobilisomes and from individual phycobiliproteins as a function of excitation wavelength. Both wild-type and mutant phycobilisomes of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6701 were examined, as well as two biliproteins, R-phycoerythrin (240 kilodaltons, 34 bilins) and allophycocyanin (100 kilodaltons, 6 bilins). Measurements of intact phycobilisomes with known structural differences showed that the addition of an average of 1.6 phycoerythrin disks in the phycobilisome rod increased the overall energy transfer time by 30 ± 5 picoseconds. In the isolated phycobiliproteins the onset of emission was as prompt as that of a solution of rhodamine B laser dye and was independent of excitation wavelength. This imposes an upper limit of 8 picoseconds (instrument-limited) on the transfer time from ""sensitizing"" to ""fluorescing"" chromophores in these biliproteins. These results indicate that disk-to-disk transfer is the slowest energy transfer process in phycobilisomes and, in combination with previous structural analyses, show that with respect to energy transfer the lattice of approximately 625 light-harvesting chromophores in the Synechocystis 6701 wild-type phycobilisome functions as a linear five-point array."
https://openalex.org/W2130102688,"The pheromone mask released by female Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopk. after the male stridulates stops aggregation of beetles in flight, but not arrestment of males, in an interaction of chemically and sonically induced behavior. This masking is viewed as a mechanism for survival through the regulation of attack and as a critical part of premating behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2003385997,"Swimming whirligig beetles (Dineutes carolinus) either make no waves at all or make conspicuous circular or vee-shaped patterns of capillary waves. The beetle's swimming speed can be determined from these wave patterns (or lack of them). Capillary waves precede the beetle for several body lengths, and their reflections may help the beetle avoid solid objects by echolocation. The gravity waves produced by a beetle are always longer than the beetle's hull length. Hence the waves do not interact with the hull to impose an upper limit on speed as they do with conventional ships. Although the beetles swim at high speeds, they apparently do not hydroplane."
https://openalex.org/W1984997910,"The sharply defined optical and radio pulses from pulsars make possible a test of the variation of the speed of light with frequency, and of the possible existence of a photon mass. The data indicate that the mass of a real photon is less than 10(-44) gram. Detection of extragalactic pulsars could allow a substantial improvement of this limit."
https://openalex.org/W2014401141,"Columbia River water is supersaturated with respect to atmospheric carbon dioxide by 200 to 870 parts per million. An equilibrium exists between the carbon dioxide partial pressure and pH, and Henry's law is obeyed in this natural water. The carbon dioxide pressure can be calculated by a determination of the pH, total carbon dioxide, and temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2055079082,"In summary, it now seems possible to obtain accurate ages for many of the common rock types. When rocks have been affected by metamorphic episodes after the time of crystallization, it is possible to recognize this from the age values and, in some cases, to date both the time of crystallization and the time of metamorphism. Work is under way that will make it possible to draw accurate geochronological maps of the continents. An impressive regularity is already evident in the map for North America. Knowledge of the temporal and areal distribution of ages should have an important bearing on theories of the origin of continents and of mountain-building processes."
https://openalex.org/W1983206792,"The variation in carbon dioxide abundances detected in the 1.05-micron band over small, discrete areas on Mars indicates that larger-scale topographical differences are present than had previously been believed. Spectroscopic mapping of the surface also indicates no apparent correlation between albedo and height; the results are in good agreement with topographical data derived from the range-gated rodar scan along +21 degrees N. High and low areas are found in both the major equatorial maria and the bright deserts in the northern hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W1989528259,"Experiments with sands chemically similar to graywackes produced ""matrix"" minerals at 250°C and a water pressure of 1 kilobar. Starting materials were moderately well sorted sands containing abundant volcanic rock fragments and no detectable clay minerals. The results support the concept that graywacke matrix may form diagenetically by hydration and recrystallization of unstable clasts. Matrix need not be a recrystallized detrial fine fraction. Texture, therefore, is not a reliable criterion for sandstone classification. For graywackes, chemical composition may be more significant."
https://openalex.org/W2080272379,"At latitudes north of the Arctic Circle the diel range of sun altitude declines progressively, reducing the frequency of temperature inversions over level, unshaded ground in summer and extending the frost-free season. North of about 70 degrees north, the potential number of inversion-free days increases rapidly with latitude; this ameliorates the microclimate close to the ground-the zone to which terrestrial organisms are increasingly restricted in higher latitudes. The relation between screen and ground-surface temperatures differs north and south of about 70 degrees north; north of that latitude there are progressively more frost-free days than would be inferred from screen temperatures, were no allowance made for this latitude-dependent change."

https://openalex.org/W2037710470,The transition of a cylinder of water with a vertical density gradient between convective and viscous spindown occurs near the point at which the maximum buoyancy force equals the radial pressure gradient that is driving the convection. A similar analysis applied to the sun shows the maximum buoyancy force to be 1500 times the convective force. A rapidly rotating solar interior would not be damped by largescale convection.

The binary period is increasing, probably as a result of mass lost from the system."

https://openalex.org/W2032307023,"An aluminum conductor moving into and out of a magnetic field of 75 gauss traps within itself for varying lengths of time a detectable fraction of the encountered flux, which subsequently decays. A time constant of about 0.005 second, which is the order of magnitude predicted by classical electrodynamics, is measured. The result is of interest in connection with the ""frozen-in field"" concept of Babcock's sunspot model."
