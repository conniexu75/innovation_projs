https://openalex.org/W1983932066,"The presence of cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) has been detected in a range of body fluids. The miRNA content of plasma/serum in particular has been proposed as a potential source of novel biomarkers for a number of diseases. Nevertheless, the quantification of miRNAs from plasma or serum is made difficult due to inefficient isolation and lack of consensus regarding the optimal reference miRNA. The effect of haemolysis on the quantification and normalisation of miRNAs in plasma has not been investigated in great detail. We found that levels of miR-16, a commonly used reference gene, showed little variation when measured in plasma samples from healthy volunteers or patients with malignant mesothelioma or coronary artery disease. Including samples with evidence of haemolysis led to variation in miR-16 levels and consequently decreased its ability to serve as a reference. The levels of miR-16 and miR-451, both present in significant levels in red blood cells, were proportional to the degree of haemolysis. Measurements of the level of these miRNAs in whole blood, plasma, red blood cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that the miRNA content of red blood cells represents the major source of variation in miR-16 and miR-451 levels measured in plasma. Adding lysed red blood cells to non-haemolysed plasma allowed a cut-off level of free haemoglobin to be determined, below which miR-16 and miR-451 levels displayed little variation between individuals. In conclusion, increases in plasma miR-16 and miR-451 are caused by haemolysis. In the absence of haemolysis the levels of both miR-16 and miR-451 are sufficiently constant to serve as normalisers."
https://openalex.org/W2014882257,"Background Circulating DNA (ctDNA) is acknowledged as a potential diagnostic tool for various cancers including colorectal cancer, especially when considering the detection of mutations. Certainly due to lack of normalization of the experimental conditions, previous reports present many discrepancies and contradictory data on the analysis of the concentration of total ctDNA and on the proportion of tumour-derived ctDNA fragments. Methodology In order to rigorously analyse ctDNA, we thoroughly investigated ctDNA size distribution. We used a highly specific Q-PCR assay and athymic nude mice xenografted with SW620 or HT29 human colon cancer cells, and we correlated our results by examining plasma from metastatic CRC patients. Conclusion/Significance Fragmentation and concentration of tumour-derived ctDNA is positively correlated with tumour weight. CtDNA quantification by Q-PCR depends on the amplified target length and is optimal for 60–100 bp fragments. Q-PCR analysis of plasma samples from xenografted mice and cancer patients showed that tumour-derived ctDNA exhibits a specific amount profile based on ctDNA size and significant higher ctDNA fragmentation. Metastatic colorectal patients (n = 12) showed nearly 5-fold higher mean ctDNA fragmentation than healthy individuals (n = 16)."
https://openalex.org/W2001336488,"The inability of neutrophils to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway eventually results in chronic infection by the bacteria in nearly 80 percent of patients. Phagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa by CF neutrophils is impaired due to decreased cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function and virulence factors acquired by the bacteria. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), extracellular structures composed of neutrophil chromatin complexed with granule contents, were identified as an alternative mechanism of pathogen killing. The hypothesis that NET-mediated killing of P. aeruginosa is impaired in the context of the CF airway was tested. P. aeruginosa induced NET formation by neutrophils from healthy donors in a bacterial density dependent fashion. When maintained in suspension through continuous rotation, P. aeruginosa became physically associated with NETs. Under these conditions, NETs were the predominant mechanism of killing, across a wide range of bacterial densities. Peripheral blood neutrophils isolated from CF patients demonstrated no impairment in NET formation or function against P. aeruginosa. However, isogenic clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained from CF patients early and later in the course of infection demonstrated an acquired capacity to withstand NET-mediated killing in 8 of 9 isolates tested. This resistance correlated with development of the mucoid phenotype, but was not a direct result of the excess alginate production that is characteristic of mucoidy. Together, these results demonstrate that neutrophils can kill P. aeruginosa via NETs, and in vitro this response is most effective under non-stationary conditions with a low ratio of bacteria to neutrophils. NET-mediated killing is independent of CFTR function or bacterial opsonization. Failure of this response in the context of the CF airway may occur, in part, due to an acquired resistance against NET-mediated killing by CF strains of P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2022314272,"Glycosylation is one of the most common modifications of proteins and lipids and also a major source of biological diversity in eukaryotes. It is critical for many basic cellular functions and recognition events that range from protein folding to cell signaling, immunological defense, and the development of multicellular organisms. Glycosylation takes place mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and involves dozens of functionally distinct glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. How the functions of these enzymes, which act sequentially and often competitively, are coordinated to faithfully synthesize a vast array of different glycan structures is currently unclear. Here, we investigate the supramolecular organization of the Golgi N- and O-glycosylation pathways in live cells using a FRET flow cytometric quantification approach. We show that the enzymes form enzymatically active homo- and/or heteromeric complexes within each pathway. However, no complexes composed of enzymes that operate in different pathways, were detected, which suggests that the pathways are physically distinct. In addition, we show that complex formation is mediated almost exclusively by the catalytic domains of the interacting enzymes. Our data also suggest that the heteromeric complexes are functionally more important than enzyme homomers. Heteromeric complex formation was found to be dependent on Golgi acidity, markedly impaired in acidification-defective cancer cells, and required for the efficient synthesis of cell surface glycans. Collectively, the results emphasize that the Golgi glycosylation pathways are functionally organized into complexes that are important for glycan synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007759293,"There is growing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction, and more specifically fatty acid β-oxidation impairment, is involved in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The goal of the present study was to achieve more understanding on the modification/s of carnitinepalmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, during steatohepatitis. A high fat/methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet, administered for 4 weeks, was used to induce NASH in rats.We demonstrated that CPT-I activity decreased, to the same extent, both in isolated liver mitochondria and in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes from MCD-diet fed rats.At the same time, the rate of total fatty acid oxidation to CO(2) and ketone bodies, measured in isolated hepatocytes, was significantly lowered in treated animals when compared to controls. Finally, an increase in CPT-I mRNA abundance and protein content, together with a high level of CPT-I protein oxidation was observed in treated rats. A posttranslational modification of rat CPT-I during steatohepatitis has been here discussed."

How this single motor protein performs so many functions has remained a major outstanding question for many years. Part of the answer is thought to lie in the diversity of dynein regulators, but how the effects of these factors are coordinated in vivo remains unexplored. We previously found NudE to bind dynein through its light chain 8 (LC8) and intermediate chain (IC) subunits (1Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the latter of which also mediates the dynein-dynactin interaction (2Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We report here that NudE and dynactin bind to a common region within the IC, and compete for this site. We find LC8 to bind to a novel sequence within NudE, without detectably affecting the dynein-NudE interaction. We further find that commonly used dynein inhibitory reagents have broad effects on the interaction of dynein with its regulatory factors. Together these results reveal an unanticipated mechanism for preventing dual regulation of individual dynein molecules, and identify the IC as a nexus for regulatory interactions within the dynein complex.

Cytoplasmic dynein is a 1.2 MDa protein complex that functions as the predominant microtubule minus end-directed molecular motor in most cell types. It is involved in a very wide range of cellular roles, but the underlying basis for its great functional diversity is poorly understood. A variety of regulatory factors appear to tailor the motor protein for specific cellular roles. These factors are responsible for recruitment of dynein to appropriate sites within the cell, proper temporal activation of motor activity, and modulation of mechanochemical behavior to accommodate different cellular tasks. The most well-studied dynein regulatory factors are dynactin (3Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 4Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I.

Each of these systems is involved both in dynein cargo recruitment and mechanochemical regulation, though via different mechanisms. Dynactin is itself a ∼1 MDa multi-subunit complex. It was initially found to be required for dynein vesicular transport in vitro (4Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1639-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 16Schroer T.A. Sheetz M.P. J.

Dynactin has also been found to increase dynein processivity by up to 2-fold in single molecule in vitro assays (7Culver-Hanlon T.L. Lex S.A. Stephens A.D. Quintyne N.J. King S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18King S.J. Schroer T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 19Kardon J.R.

Processivity of mammalian dynein is stimulated in both the plus- and minus-end directions along microtubules (20Ross J.L. Wallace K. Shuman H. Goldman Y.E. Holzbaur E.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Dixit R. Ross J.L. Goldman Y.E. Holzbaur E.L. Science. 2008; 319: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), though yeast dynein with or without dynactin is primarily unidirectional (19Kardon J.R. Reck-Peterson S.L. Vale R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5669-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the microtubule binding CAP-Gly domain of the dynactin p150Glued subunit had been assumed to contribute to the enhancement of dynein processivity, recent studies showed no effect after its removal. Nonetheless, it was still required for complete dynactin function in vivo (6Kim H. Ling S.C. Rogers G.C. Kural C. Selvin P.R. Rogers S.L. Gelfand V.I. J.

LIS1 and NudE/L play critical roles in a subset of dynein functions, many of which appear to involve high-load dynein mediated transport. LIS1 is required for nuclear migration in neural progenitors and post mitotic neurons in vertebrates, and for nucleokinesis in several organisms (24Lee W.L. Oberle J.R. Cooper J.A. J.

LIS1 stabilized the dynein-MT interaction during the transition state of the cross-bridge cycle, resulting in persistent force production under load. NudE alone inhibited the dynein-MT interaction. Strikingly, the tripartite complex of LIS1, NudE, and dynein transformed the motor to a persistent force-producing state and enhanced multiple motor transport under load (15McKenney R.J. Vershinin M. Kunwar A. Vallee R.B. Gross S.P. Cell. 2010; 141: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This behavior is likely to be important in cellular scenarios requiring dynein to produce force against large opposing loads, such as nuclear migration (25Tsai J.W. Bremner K.H. Vallee R.B. Nat.

Dynactin binds via the central region of its p150Glued subunit to the N terminus of the dynein intermediate chain (IC) 3The abbreviations used are: ICintermediate chainHCheavy chainLClight chain.

The current study was initiated to define the nature of the NudE-dynein interaction in greater detail. We find the primary binding site for NudE to lie within the dynein IC N terminus, the same region implicated in dynactin binding (2Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 43King S.J. Brown C.L. Maier K.C. Quintyne N.J. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol.

We observe clear competition between NudE and dynactin for dynein, identifying a novel mechanism for coordinating dynein regulators. The common interaction site is also a target for frequently used inhibitory probes, and our results, therefore, have important implications for phenotypic analysis of dynein function in vivo. Full-length mouse NudE was cloned into pGEX6P-1 (GE Biosciences) with N-terminal HA- and C-terminal His tags. NudE fragments were also cloned into this vector. p150Glued fragments were cloned from a full-length rat construct into pGEX6P-1 with an N-terminal FLAG-tag and human LC8 (accession number NM_003746) was also cloned into this vector. Dynein IC fragments from rat were also cloned into pGEX6P-1 with a Myc tag at the C terminus, or into pCDNA 3.1 (IC2C 1–260 and 123–280) or pEGFP (IC2C 1–100) for mammalian cell expression. For expression in bacteria, constructs were transformed into BL21-CodonPlus RIPL competent cells (Agilent Technologies) and expressed in Luria broth or Terrific broth. Protein production was induced by addition of 0.1–0.5 mm IPTG, and the culture was moved to 18 °C overnight. Bacteria were broken by sonication, and proteins were purified by batch incubation of a high speed supernatant with glutathione resin (GE Biosciences) in lysis buffer (PBS, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1% Triton X-100) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed extensively with lysis buffer in a column. The beads were then washed into PMEG buffer (100 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.9 m glycerol, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0) for freezing, or washed into PreScission protease cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and incubated with PreScission protease (GE Biosciences) overnight to cleave off the GST moiety according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cleaved proteins were collected, concentrated using Amicon concentrators (Amicon) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. For full-length NudE, the protein was then incubated with Talon resin for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively and eluted in PMEG containing 350 mm imidazole. Protein containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cytoplasmic dynein was purified from rat brain tissue as described (47Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. This dynein preparation is essentially free of dynactin (15McKenney R.J.

Protein interaction experiments were performed in buffer A: 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For GST pull-downs, proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose and incubated with interactors in 350 μl total volume for 1 h at 4 °C. For HA or FLAG pull-downs, tagged proteins were first incubated with an equal molar amount of monoclonal anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies for 1 h on ice. The protein-antibody complexes were then bound to protein A beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice to remove unbound protein, and then used for pull-downs as above. Beads were washed four times with 350 μl of buffer A before being processed for SDS-PAGE analysis. For pull-downs from brain lysate, a high speed supernatant (47Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) of rat brain was used. In competition experiments, beads coated with dynein interactors were incubated with ∼4 nm purified brain dynein for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by three buffer washes of 350 μl each. The beads were then resuspended to volume, and the indicated amount of competitor protein was added for an additional hour, followed by four 350 μl washes. Beads were resuspended in 50 μl and processed for gel analysis. Western blots were processed on an Odyssey IR scanner (LI-COR Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software (NIH). Antibodies used in this study were: monoclonal anti-dynein intermediate chain clone 74.1 (a gift from Dr. Kevin Pfister), or clone 70.1 (Sigma). Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-FLAG, anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-GFP, and anti-LC8 (Abcam) and monoclonal anti-LIS1 (Sigma). Polyclonal anti-p150Glued (D'art) (48Vaughan K.T. Tynan S.H. Faulkner N.E. Echeverri C.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal anti-NudE/NudEL (1Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A membrane array spotted with overlapping dodecapeptides was generated based on mouse NudE (GenBankTM accession number Q9CZA6) C-terminal residues 192–344 (JPT Peptide Techonologies, Berlin). Each spot contains ∼5 nmol of a 12-amino acid long peptide that is covalently linked to a cellulose-β-alanine membrane. The sequence of peptides in adjacent spots are shifted C-terminally by two residues such that two neighboring spots overlap by ten residues (Fig. 2B). Before use, the membrane was reconstituted at room temperature in methanol for 5 min, followed by three 10-min washes with TBS. Blocking was performed for 1 h with 5% milk in TBS-T followed by a 1-h incubation simultaneously with primary monoclonal LC8 antibody at a dilution of 1:2500 and secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen, A10043) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in 5% milk in TBS-T at room temperature. The membrane was then scanned using Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR) to assess nonspecific interactions of the antibodies. 200 nm of recombinant purified human LC8 in 5% milk in TBS-T was incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C and for 1 h at room temperature the following day, followed by three 10-min washes with TBS-T, sequential probing with primary and secondary antibodies, and scanning as before. Scans of the membrane before and after incubation with LC8 were compared to identify the residues in the C terminus of NudE that are involved in binding LC8. Monoclonal anti-dynein intermediate chain antibodies 74.1 and 70.1 were incubated with rat brain purified cytoplasmic dynein at ∼10-fold molar excess for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle rotating. Antibody-dynein complexes or dynein alone were subsequently incubated with bacterially expressed GST-CC1 or GST-NudE on glutathione beads or beads alone for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle rotating in buffer A. In a similar experiment, GST-CC1 or GST-NudE either alone or after preincubation with a polyclonal anti-NudE/L antibody for 60 min at 4 °C were incubated with rat brain purified cytoplasmic dynein for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle rotating in buffer A. After the incubation periods, unbound dynein was separated from the beads by centrifugation. The beads were washed three times with buffer (15-fold bead volume) and resuspended in protein sample buffer. Coomassie-stained gels were scanned using the Odyssey IR system. In a previous study we screened an array of dynein and dynactin subunits for NudE binding, and identified interactions with the dynein IC and LC8 subunits (1Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15McKenney R.J. Vershinin M. Kunwar A. Vallee R.B. Gross S.P. Cell. 2010; 141: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the nature of these interactions we first determined where NudE bound within the dynein IC. This subunit consists of a short N-terminal α-helical coiled-coil, followed by binding sites for dynein's three LC classes, a dimerization domain, and finally by a WD40 domain responsible for dynein heavy chain (HC) binding (49Myers K.R. Lo K.W. Lye R.J. Kogoy J.M. Soura V. Hafezparast M. Pfister K.K. J. Neurosci Res. 2007; 85: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 50Ma S. Trivinos-Lagos L. Collins C.A. Chisholm R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 155aCrossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Expression of the WD40 domain was toxic in HeLa cells, as previously reported (43King S.J. Brown C.L. Maier K.C. Quintyne N.J. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5089-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but the N-terminal fragments expressed well. Pull-downs with GST-NudE localized IC binding activity to the first 100 a.a. of rat IC2C (Fig. 1A). GST-NudE also interacted with the endogenous dynein complex as evidenced by the presence of the full-length dynein IC in the pulldowns (1Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To test for a direct NudE-IC interaction, we expressed a series of GST-tagged N-terminal IC constructs in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1B). All constructs that contained the N-terminal coiled-coil domain were capable of interacting with native dynactin complex in rat brain lysates (Fig. 1C) indicating the proteins were correctly folded. The IC constructs were screened for interactions with purified HA-NudE, which mapped NudE binding to IC amino acids 1–70 (Fig. 1, B–D). NudE bound to each of six alternatively spliced variants of rat IC1 and IC2 (supplemental Fig. S1B), which all contain a common N-terminal predicted coiled-coil sequence, but diverge immediately downstream (2Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 49Myers K.R. Lo K.W. Lye R.J. Kogoy J.M. Soura V. Hafezparast M. Pfister K.K. J. Neurosci Res. 2007; 85: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A), arguing that IC isoform composition is unlikely to affect the IC-NudE interaction. Although LC8 interacts with both NudE and dynein, the specific role of the LC in the NudE-dynein interaction is unknown. LC8 interacts with full-length NudE ((1Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); this study), but not with the truncation mutants NudE10–165, NudE10–191, and NudE1–191 (Fig. 2A and C; data not shown), consistent with binding of LC8 only to full-length, but not an N-terminal NudEL fragment (45Wang S. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To map the site of LC8 binding more precisely we probed an array of overlapping dodecapeptides covering the C-terminal region of NudE (Fig. 2A, amino acids 192–344) using purified bacterially expressed LC8 (51Rodríguez-Crespo I.

Gavilanes F. Albar J.P. Rodríguez-Crespo I. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We observed binding to 5 sequential peptides in the region amino acids 192–211, yielding a minimal binding sequence of amino acids 200–203 (KRTD) within NudE (Fig. 2B). In support of this result we found LC8 to bind NudE1–218, but not NudE1–191 (Fig. 2C). The LC8 binding sequence does not contain the canonical LC8 binding motif identified in many other LC8 interactors (53Benison G. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but whether this indicates a unique mode of LC8 binding is uncertain (Refs. 54Lightcap C.M. Sun S. Lear J.D. Rodeck U. Polenova T.

PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We also found the NudE-dynein interaction to be unaffected by exposure of NudE to LC8 before, during, or after dynein-NudE binding (Figs. 2, D and F, supplemental Figs. S2, A and B). These results contrasted with the ability of excess IC 1–250 to disrupt the dynein-NudE interaction (Fig. 2, E and F). These data reveal that LC8 can bind directly and apparently independently to the IC and NudE polypeptides. Furthermore, the data indicate that dynein interacts with NudE predominantly via the ICs, rather than LC8. Dynactin binds to dynein through a direct p150Glued-IC interaction (2Vaughan K.T.

A fundamental, unsolved problem is how to characterize the community structure of a network. Here, using both standard and novel benchmarks, we show that maximization of a simple global parameter, which we call Surprise (S), leads to a very efficient characterization of the community structure of complex synthetic networks. Particularly, S qualitatively outperforms the most commonly used criterion to define communities, Newman and Girvan's modularity (Q). Applying S maximization to real networks often provides natural, well-supported partitions, but also sometimes counterintuitive solutions that expose the limitations of our previous knowledge. These results indicate that it is possible to define an effective global criterion for community structure and open new routes for the understanding of complex networks."
https://openalex.org/W1974132683,"To date there are 9 known diseases caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, with the most prevalent being Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder for which currently no therapy is available. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which results in an expansion of a glutamine stretch at the N-terminal end of the huntingtin protein. This polyglutamine expansion plays a central role in the disease and results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates. Here, we make use of modified 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (CUG)n triplet-repeat antisense oligonucleotides to effectively reduce mutant huntingtin transcript and protein levels in patient-derived Huntington's disease fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. The most effective antisense oligonucleotide, (CUG)(7), also reduced mutant ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 mRNA levels in spinocerebellar ataxia 1 and 3, respectively, and atrophin-1 in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy patient derived fibroblasts. This antisense oligonucleotide is not only a promising therapeutic tool to reduce mutant huntingtin levels in Huntington's disease but our results in spinocerebellar ataxia and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy cells suggest that this could also be applicable to other polyglutamine expansion disorders as well."

https://openalex.org/W1990680896,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the Flaviviridae and a globally (re)emerging pathogen that causes serious human disease. There is no specific antiviral or vaccine for dengue virus infection. Flavivirus capsid (C) is a structural protein responsible for gathering the viral RNA into a nucleocapsid that forms the core of a mature virus particle. Flaviviral replication is known to occur in the cytoplasm yet a large portion of capsid protein localizes to the nucleus during infection. The reasons for the nuclear presences of capsid are not completely understood. Here, we expressed mature DENV C in a tandem affinity purification assay to identify potential binding partners in human liver cells. DENV C targeted the four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. DENV C bound recombinant histones in solution and colocalized with histones in the nucleus and cytoplasm of liver cells during DENV infection. We show that DENV C acts as a histone mimic, forming heterodimers with core histones, binding DNA and disrupting nucleosome formation. We also demonstrate that DENV infection increases the amounts of core histones in livers cells, which may be a cellular response to C binding away the histone proteins. Infection with DENV additionally alters levels of H2A phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. The interactions of C and histones add an interesting new role for the presence of C in the nucleus during DENV infection."

Thirty healthy subjects (fifteen per site) received anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the primary motor cortex (M1). We measured set shifting in both cognitive and motor tasks. The results show that both anodal and cathodal single session tDCS can modulate cognitive and motor tasks. However, an interaction was found between task and type of stimulation as anodal tDCS of DLPFC and M1 was found to increase performance in the cognitive task, while cathodal tDCS of DLPFC and M1 had the opposite effect on the motor task. Additionally, tDCS effects seem to be most evident on the speed of changing sets, rather than on reducing the number of errors or increasing the efficacy of irrelevant set filtering."
https://openalex.org/W2033442758,"Background Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. The primary triggers for motor neuron degeneration are unknown but inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial defects have been identified as potential contributing factors. Metformin is an anti-type II diabetes drug that has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, can bring about mitochondrial biogenesis and has been shown to attenuate pathology in mouse models of Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis. We therefore hypothesized that it might increase survival in the SOD1G93A murine model of ALS. Methodology/Principal Findings Treatment of male and female SOD1G93A mice (n = ≥6 per sex) with 2 mg/ml metformin in the drinking water from 35 days, resulted in a significant increase in motor unit survival, as measured by in vivo electrophysiology at 100 days, in male EDL muscles (24+/−2 vs. 14+/−2 motor units, p<0.005) and female TA muscles (21+/−1 vs. 15+/−2 motor units, P = 0.0134). We therefore continued to test the effect of 0.5, 2 and 5 mg/ml metformin in the drinking water from 35 days on disease onset and progression (identified by twice weekly determination of weight and neurological score) as well as survival in male and female SOD1G93A mice (n = ≥14 per sex). Results for all groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier time to event analyses. In this survival study, metformin was unable to reduce pathology at any dose and had an unexpected dose-dependent negative effect on the onset of neurological symptoms (P = 0.0236) and on disease progression (P = 0.0362) in female mice. Conclusions/Significance This study suggests that metformin is a poor candidate for clinical trial in ALS patients and that the possibility of harmful effects of metformin in female ALS patients with type II diabetes should be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1982732820,"Background Excessive time in front of a single or several screens could explain a displacement of physical activity. The present study aimed at determining whether screen-time is associated with a reduced level of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in Spanish adolescents living in favorable environmental conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings A multi-stage stratified random sampling method was used to select 3503 adolescents (12–18 years old) from the school population of Gran Canaria, Spain. MVPA, screen-time in front of television, computer, video game console and portable console was assessed in the classroom by fulfilling a standardized questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted by a set of social-environmental variables were carried out. Forty-six percent of girls (95% CI±2.3%) and 26% of boys (95% CI±2.1%) did not meet the MVPA recommendations for adolescents. Major gender differences were observed in the time devoted to vigorous PA, video games and the total time spent on screen-based activities. Boys who reported 4 hours•week−1 or more to total screen-time showed a 64% (OR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.44–0.86) increased risk of failing to achieve the recommended adolescent MVPA level. Participation in organized physical activities and sports competitions were more strongly associated with MVPA than screen-related behaviors. Conclusions/Significance No single screen-related behavior explained the reduction of MVPA in adolescents. However, the total time accumulated through several screen-related behaviors was negatively associated with MVPA level in boys. This association could be due to lower availability of time for exercise as the time devoted to sedentary screen-time activities increases. Participation in organized physical activities seems to counteract the negative impact of excessive time in front of screens on physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2037464775,"LIPINs have been reported to perform important roles in the regulation of intracellular lipid levels. Their mutations induce lipodystrophy, myoglobinuria, and inflammatory disorders. Recently, the phosphatidic acid phosphatase function of LIPINs has been associated with the perturbation of hepatic insulin receptor signaling via the diacylglycerol-mediated stimulation of PKCε activity. Here, we report that nuclear estrogen-related receptor (ERR) γ is a novel transcriptional regulator of LIPIN1. Overexpression of ERRγ significantly increased LIPIN1 expression in primary hepatocytes, whereas the abolition of ERRγ gene expression attenuated the expression of LIPIN1. Deletion and mutation analyses of the LIPIN1 promoter showed that ERRγ exerts its effect on the transcriptional regulation of LIPIN1 via ERRE1 of the LIPIN1 promoter, as confirmed by ChIP assay. We also determined that the gene transcription of LIPIN1 by ERRγ is controlled by the competition between PGC-1α and small heterodimer partner. Additionally, ERRγ leads to the induction of hepatic LIPIN1 expression and diacylglycerol production in vivo. Finally, an inverse agonist of ERRγ, GSK5182, restores the impaired insulin signaling induced by LIPIN1-mediated PKCε activation. Our findings indicate that the selective control of ERRγ transcriptional activity by its specific inverse agonist could provide a novel therapeutic approach to the amelioration of impaired hepatic insulin signaling induced by LIPIN1-mediated PKCε activation."
https://openalex.org/W2136675332,"Background The Hippo/MST1 signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. As a major downstream target of the Hippo/MST1 pathway, YAP2 (Yes-associated protein 2) functions as a transcriptional cofactor that has been implicated in many biological processes, including organ size control and cancer development. MST1/Lats kinase inhibits YAP2's nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity through inducing the phosphorylation at serine 127 and the sequential association with 14-3-3 proteins. However, the dephosphorylation of YAP2 is not fully appreciated. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we demonstrate that PP1A (catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1) interacts with and dephosphorylates YAP2 in vitro and in vivo, and PP1A-mediated dephosphorylation induces the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation of YAP2. Inhibition of PP1 by okadiac acid (OA) increases the phosphorylation at serine 127 and cytoplasmic translocation of YAP2 proteins, thereby mitigating its transcription activity. PP1A expression enhances YAP2's pro-survival capability and YAP2 knockdown sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. Conclusions/Significance Our findings define a novel molecular mechanism that YAP2 is positively regulated by PP1-mediated dephosphorylation in the cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2054679908,"Changes in plant diversity may induce distinct changes in soil food web structure and accompanying soil feedbacks to plants. However, knowledge of the long-term consequences of plant community simplification for soil animal food webs and functioning is scarce. Nematodes, the most abundant and diverse soil Metazoa, represent the complexity of soil food webs as they comprise all major trophic groups and allow calculation of a number of functional indices.We studied the functional composition of nematode communities three and five years after establishment of a grassland plant diversity experiment (Jena Experiment). In response to plant community simplification common nematode species disappeared and pronounced functional shifts in community structure occurred. The relevance of the fungal energy channel was higher in spring 2007 than in autumn 2005, particularly in species-rich plant assemblages. This resulted in a significant positive relationship between plant species richness and the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial feeders. Moreover, the density of predators increased significantly with plant diversity after five years, pointing to increased soil food web complexity in species-rich plant assemblages. Remarkably, in complex plant communities the nematode community shifted in favour of microbivores and predators, thereby reducing the relative abundance of plant feeders after five years.The results suggest that species-poor plant assemblages may suffer from nematode communities detrimental to plants, whereas species-rich plant assemblages support a higher proportion of microbivorous nematodes stimulating nutrient cycling and hence plant performance; i.e. effects of nematodes on plants may switch from negative to positive. Overall, food web complexity is likely to decrease in response to plant community simplification and results of this study suggest that this results mainly from the loss of common species which likely alter plant-nematode interactions."

TNFα treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells increased surface expression of high mannose/hybrid N-glycans. A role for these sugars in mediating THP-1 or primary human monocyte rolling and adhesion was indicated by competition studies in which addition of α-methylmannose, but not α-methylglucose, inhibited monocyte rolling and adhesion during flow, but not under static conditions. This result supports the notion that adhesion molecules provide scaffolds for sugar epitopes to mediate adhesion with cognate receptors. A panel of structurally distinct PPARγ agonists all decreased TNFα-dependent expression of endothelial high mannose/hybrid N-glycans. Using rosiglitazone as a model PPARγ agonist, which decreased TNFα-induced high mannose N-glycan expression, we demonstrate a role for these carbohydrate residues in THP-1 rolling and adhesion that is independent of endothelial surface adhesion molecule expression (ICAM-1 and E-selectin). Data from N-glycan processing gene arrays identified α-mannosidases (MAN1A2 and MAN1C1) as targets for down-regulation by TNFα, which was reversed by rosiglitazone, a result consistent with altered high mannose/hybrid N-glycan epitopes. Taken together we propose a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of endothelial PPARγ activation that involves targeting protein post-translational modification of adhesion molecules, specifically N-glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2124359368,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer types in developed countries. To identify molecular networks and biological processes that are deregulated in CRC compared to normal colonic mucosa, we applied Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to two independent transcriptome datasets, including a total of 137 CRC and ten normal colonic mucosa samples. Eighty-two gene sets as described by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database had significantly altered gene expression in both datasets. These included networks associated with cell division, DNA maintenance, and metabolism. Among signaling pathways with known changes in key genes, the ""Phosphatidylinositol signaling network"", comprising part of the PI3K pathway, was found deregulated. The downregulated genes in this pathway included several members of the Phospholipase C protein family, and the reduced expression of two of these, PLCD1 and PLCE1, were successfully validated in CRC biopsies (n = 70) and cell lines (n = 19) by quantitative analyses. The repression of both genes was found associated with KRAS mutations (P = 0.005 and 0.006, respectively), and we observed that microsatellite stable carcinomas with reduced PLCD1 expression more frequently had TP53 mutations (P = 0.002). Promoter methylation analyses of PLCD1 and PLCE1 performed in cell lines and tumor biopsies revealed that methylation of PLCD1 can contribute to reduced expression in 40% of the microsatellite instable carcinomas. In conclusion, we have identified significantly deregulated pathways in CRC, and validated repression of PLCD1 and PLCE1 expression. This illustrates that the GSEA approach may guide discovery of novel biomarkers in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2059737813,"The guidelines recommend that first line treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria should be second generation non-sedating H(1)-antihistamines with a positive recommendation against the use of old sedating first generation antihistamines. If standard dosing is not effective, increasing the dosage up to four-fold is recommended. The objective of this study was to obtain the chronic spontaneous urticaria-patient perspective on the effectiveness and unwanted effects of H(1)-antihistamines in standard and higher doses.This was a questionnaire based survey, initially completed by 368 individuals. 319 (248 female, 71 male, median age 42 years) had a physician-confirmed diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria and were included in the results. Participants believed standard doses (manufacturers recommended dose) of second generation antihistamines to be significantly (P<0.005) more effective than first generation drugs. Furthermore, they believed that second generation drugs caused significantly (P<0.001) fewer unwanted effects and caused significantly (P<0.001) less sedation than first generation antihistamines. Three-quarters of the patients stated that they had up-dosed with antihistamines with 40%, 42% and 54% reporting significant added benefit from taking 2, 3 or 4 tablets daily respectively. The number of reports of unwanted effects and sedation following up-dosing were not significantly different from those reported for standard doses.This survey supports the urticaria guidelines recommendations that the first line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria should be second generation rather than first generation H(1)-antihistamines and that, if standard dosing is not effective, the dosage should be increased up to four-fold."
https://openalex.org/W2008230193,"Rhodiola dumulosa (Crassulaceae) is a perennial diploid species found in high-montane areas. It is distributed in fragmented populations across northern, central and northwestern China. In this study, we aimed to (i) measure the genetic diversity of this species and that of its populations; (ii) describe the genetic structure of these populations across the entire distribution range in China; and (iii) evaluate the extent of gene flow among the naturally fragmented populations.Samples from 1089 individuals within 35 populations of R. dumulosa were collected, covering as much of the entire distribution range of this species within China as possible. Population genetic diversity and structure were analyzed using AFLP molecular markers. Gene flow among populations was estimated according to the level of population differentiation.The total genetic diversity of R. dumulosa was high but decreased with increasing altitude. Population-structure analysis indicated that the most closely related populations were geographically restricted and occurred in close proximity to each other. A significant isolation-by-distance pattern, caused by the naturally fragmented population distribution, was observed. At least two distinct gene pools were found in the 35 sampled populations, one composed of populations in northern China and the other composed of populations in central and northwestern China. The calculation of Nei's gene diversity index revealed that the genetic diversity in the northern China pool (0.1972) was lower than that in the central and northwestern China pool (0.2216). The populations were significantly isolated, and gene flow was restricted throughout the entire distribution. However, gene flow among populations on the same mountain appears to be unrestricted, as indicated by the weak genetic isolation among these populations."

IntroductionPhotosynthetic membranes are specialized structures that contain the various protein complexes that transform sunlight into an energy-rich compound. The majority of complexes within these membranes are light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) 2The abbreviations used are: LHClight-harvesting complexPSIIPhotosystem IIAFMatomic force microscopyJMjumping modeTMtapping modeOECoxygen-evolving complex. that absorb sunlight and transfer energy and reaction centers, to where this energy is directed to initiate electron transfer reactions (1Nelson N.

Under physiological conditions, part of the membranes is tightly stacked along their flat cytoplasmic surfaces, resulting in grana membranes, interconnected by stroma lamellae. Grana contain primarily Photosystem II (PSII) and its associated major light-harvesting antenna (LHCII) as well as minor LHCs (2Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Analyses of EM images of isolated complexes from grana have indicated PSII and major and minor LHCs to be present in PSII-LHCII supercomplexes (3Boekema E.J. van Roon H. Calkoen F. Bassi R.

Using the three-dimensional crystallographic structures of the PSII core complex from cyanobacteria and the trimeric LHCII complex from plants (5Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3052-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).Grana membranes can be easily prepared by solubilization of stacked chloroplasts with the relatively strong detergent Triton X-100 (7Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Structural investigations have revealed that these membranes are paired membranes with the extrinsic lumenal parts facing outwards (8Dunahay T.G. Staehelin L.A. Seibert M. Ogilvie P.D. Berg S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 179-193Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, to retain biological activity, the membranes are usually diluted in detergent-free solutions, resulting in a strong aggregation of the membranes and preventing structural analyses. For this reason, we have developed the preparation of grana membranes by a much milder detergent (α-dodecyl maltoside), which prevents the need for detergent removal. These preparations were extensively characterized by biochemical and structural methods, including EM (see, for example, Refs. 9van Roon H. van Breemen J.F. de Weerd F.L. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J.

Under certain conditions such as low temperature, low-light intensity during growth, or low pH, a tendency for ordering in crystalline arrays has been observed (10Boekema E.J. van Breemen J.F. van Roon H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)) that these membranes also are densely packed with protein (28Kirchhoff H. Lenhert S. Büchel C. Chi L. Nield J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, in this study, AFM was conducted on dried membranes in air, which prompts concerns as to dehydration and damage and prohibits high-resolution imaging.The proposed functional consequences of segregation and aggregation of photosynthetic complexes include long-distance electron transfer, regulation of energy distribution by preventing energy spillover, supplying ways to help protect vulnerable PSII from light overexposure, and allowing repair of photodamaged PSII units (2Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The packing of protein complexes observed in all photosynthetic membranes raises questions as to how diffusive processes can take place on physiological time scales under such crowded conditions (29Kirchhoff H. Haferkamp S. Allen J.F. Epstein D.B. Mullineaux C.W. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).To address these questions, detailed knowledge on the supramolecular organization of the protein complexes and the possibility for dynamic rearrangements is indispensable. AFM images may provide information on the protein organization within a single membrane in a close to native state and with high detail without image manipulation. Here, we present high-resolution AFM images of grana membranes from spinach. Adhered membranes were immersed in a liquid ionic buffer, which prevents dehydration and greatly enhances resolution. To minimize damage further, we employed a most delicate AFM mode, the so-called “jumping mode” (JM-AFM). The advantage of this method is that the lateral movement of the scanning tip with respect to the sample surface is performed when the two are not in contact. In this manner, lateral shear forces on the specimen are minimized (30Moreno-Herrero F. de Pablo P.J. Colchero J. Gomez-Herrero J. Baro A.M.

Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).To address these questions, detailed knowledge on the supramolecular organization of the protein complexes and the possibility for dynamic rearrangements is indispensable. AFM images may provide information on the protein organization within a single membrane in a close to native state and with high detail without image manipulation. Here, we present high-resolution AFM images of grana membranes from spinach. Adhered membranes were immersed in a liquid ionic buffer, which prevents dehydration and greatly enhances resolution. To minimize damage further, we employed a most delicate AFM mode, the so-called “jumping mode” (JM-AFM). The advantage of this method is that the lateral movement of the scanning tip with respect to the sample surface is performed when the two are not in contact. In this manner, lateral shear forces on the specimen are minimized (30Moreno-Herrero F. de Pablo P.J. Colchero J. Gomez-Herrero J. Baro A.M.

This is particularly important for a fragile system such as a pair of membranes, in which the lower membrane is fixed to the surface, the upper membrane is probed, and both membranes are attached to each other by weak electrostatic forces. Photosynthetic membranes are specialized structures that contain the various protein complexes that transform sunlight into an energy-rich compound. The majority of complexes within these membranes are light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) 2The abbreviations used are: LHClight-harvesting complexPSIIPhotosystem IIAFMatomic force microscopyJMjumping modeTMtapping modeOECoxygen-evolving complex. that absorb sunlight and transfer energy and reaction centers, to where this energy is directed to initiate electron transfer reactions (1Nelson N.

In green plants, the photosynthetic membranes reside inside the chloroplasts. Under physiological conditions, part of the membranes is tightly stacked along their flat cytoplasmic surfaces, resulting in grana membranes, interconnected by stroma lamellae. Grana contain primarily Photosystem II (PSII) and its associated major light-harvesting antenna (LHCII) as well as minor LHCs (2Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Analyses of EM images of isolated complexes from grana have indicated PSII and major and minor LHCs to be present in PSII-LHCII supercomplexes (3Boekema E.J. van Roon H. Calkoen F. Bassi R.

Using the three-dimensional crystallographic structures of the PSII core complex from cyanobacteria and the trimeric LHCII complex from plants (5Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X.

Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar), a detailed model has been constructed based on the structure of these PSII-LHCII supercomplexes (4Caffarri S. Kouril R. Kereïche S. Boekema E.J. Croce R. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3052-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Grana membranes can be easily prepared by solubilization of stacked chloroplasts with the relatively strong detergent Triton X-100 (7Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Structural investigations have revealed that these membranes are paired membranes with the extrinsic lumenal parts facing outwards (8Dunahay T.G. Staehelin L.A. Seibert M. Ogilvie P.D. Berg S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 179-193Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, to retain biological activity, the membranes are usually diluted in detergent-free solutions, resulting in a strong aggregation of the membranes and preventing structural analyses. For this reason, we have developed the preparation of grana membranes by a much milder detergent (α-dodecyl maltoside), which prevents the need for detergent removal. These preparations were extensively characterized by biochemical and structural methods, including EM (see, for example, Refs. 9van Roon H. van Breemen J.F. de Weerd F.L. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J.

Strong evidence exists that the PSII supercomplex is composed of a PSII core dimer with two to four LHCII trimers attached at specific binding positions. Depending on the light conditions during plant growth, about four to eight additional LHCII complexes are not directly bound to a PSII-LHCII supercomplex and reside in the so-called LHCII-only membrane domains (see Ref. 2Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and references therein). EM studies have furthermore indicated that the majority of supercomplexes are organized in a random fashion and that a small amount is organized in regular arrays. Under certain conditions such as low temperature, low-light intensity during growth, or low pH, a tendency for ordering in crystalline arrays has been observed (10Boekema E.J. van Breemen J.F. van Roon H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)) that these membranes also are densely packed with protein (28Kirchhoff H. Lenhert S. Büchel C. Chi L. Nield J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, in this study, AFM was conducted on dried membranes in air, which prompts concerns as to dehydration and damage and prohibits high-resolution imaging. The proposed functional consequences of segregation and aggregation of photosynthetic complexes include long-distance electron transfer, regulation of energy distribution by preventing energy spillover, supplying ways to help protect vulnerable PSII from light overexposure, and allowing repair of photodamaged PSII units (2Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2057142286,"Streptomyces davawensis synthesizes the antibiotic roseoflavin (RoF) (8-dimethylamino-8-demethyl-D-riboflavin). It was postulated that RoF is synthesized from riboflavin via 8-amino- (AF) and 8-methylamino-8-demethyl-D-riboflavin (MAF). In a cell-free extract of S. davawensis, an S-adenosyl methionine-dependent conversion of AF into MAF and RoF was observed. The corresponding N,N-8-amino-8-demethyl-d-riboflavin dimethyltransferase activity was enriched by column chromatography. The final most active fraction still contained at least five different proteins that were analyzed by enzymatic digestion and concomitant de novo sequencing by MS/MS. One of the sequences matched a hypothetical peptide fragment derived from an as yet uncharacterized open reading frame (sda77220) located in the middle of a (putative) gene cluster within the S. davawensis genome. Expression of ORF sda77220 in Escherichia coli revealed that the corresponding gene product had N,N-8-amino-8-demethyl-d-riboflavin dimethyltransferase activity. Inactivation of ORF sda77220 led to a S. davawensis strain that synthesized AF but not MAF or RoF. Accordingly, as the first identified gene of RoF biosynthesis, ORF sda77220 was named rosA. RosA (347 amino acids; 38 kDa) was purified from a recombinant E. coli strain (as a His(6)-tagged protein) and was biochemically characterized (apparent K(m) for AF = 57.7 ± 9.2 μm; apparent K(D) for AF = 10.0 μm; k(cat) = 0.37 ± 0.02 s(-1)). RosA is a unique enzyme and may be useful for a variety of applications."
https://openalex.org/W2170722008,"The use of biting to obtain food items attached to the substratum is an ecologically widespread and important mode of feeding among aquatic vertebrates, which rarely has been studied. We did the first evolutionary analyses of morphology and motion kinematics of the feeding apparatus in Indo-Pacific members of an iconic family of biters, the marine angelfishes (f. Pomacanthidae). We found clear interspecific differences in gut morphology that clearly reflected a wide range of trophic niches. In contrast, feeding apparatus morphology appeared to be conserved. A few unusual structural innovations enabled angelfishes to protrude their jaws, close them in the protruded state, and tear food items from the substratum at a high velocity. Only one clade, the speciose pygmy angelfishes, showed functional departure from the generalized and clade-defining grab-and-tearing feeding pattern. By comparing the feeding kinematics of angelfishes with wrasses and parrotfishes (f. Labridae) we showed that grab-and-tearing is based on low kinematics disparity. Regardless of its restricted disparity, the grab-and-tearing feeding apparatus has enabled angelfishes to negotiate ecological thresholds: Given their widely different body sizes, angelfishes can access many structurally complex benthic surfaces that other biters likely are unable to exploit. From these surfaces, angelfishes can dislodge sturdy food items from their tough attachments. Angelfishes thus provide an intriguing example of a successful group that appears to have evolved considerable trophic diversity based on an unusual yet conserved feeding apparatus configuration that is characterized by limited functional disparity."

Mite allergen Der-p2 is one of the major allergens of the house dust mite, which contributes to TLR4 expression and function in B cells in allergic patients. However, the precise mechanisms of Der-p2 on B cells remain obscure.We investigated the effects of Der-p2 on proinflammatory cytokines responses and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)-related signaling in human B cells activation. We demonstrated that Der-p2 activates pro-inflammatory cytokines, TLR4 and its co-receptor MD2. ERK inhibitor PD98059 significantly enhanced TLR4/MD2 expression in Der-p2-treated B cells. Der-p2 markedly activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and decreased p38 phosphorylation in B cells. MKP-1-siRNA downregulated TLR4/MD2 expression in Der-p2-treated B cells. In addition, Der-p2 significantly up-regulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules and increased B cell proliferation. Neutralizing Der-p2 antibody could effectively abrogate the Der-p2-induced B cell proliferation. Der-p2 could also markedly induce NF-κB activation in B cells, which could be counteracted by dexamethasone.These results strongly suggest that Der-p2 is capable of triggering B cell activation and MKP-1-activated p38/MAPK dephosphorylation-regulated TLR4 induction, which subsequently enhances host immune, defense responses and development of effective allergic disease therapeutics in B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2112239811,"Biodiversity plays an integral role in the livelihoods of subsistence-based forest-dwelling communities and as a consequence it is increasingly important to develop quantitative approaches that capture not only changes in taxonomic diversity, but also variation in natural resources and provisioning services. We apply a functional diversity metric originally developed for addressing questions in community ecology to assess utilitarian diversity of 56 forest plots in Madagascar. The use categories for utilitarian plants were determined using expert knowledge and household questionnaires. We used a null model approach to examine the utilitarian (functional) diversity and utilitarian redundancy present within ecological communities. Additionally, variables that might influence fluctuations in utilitarian diversity and redundancy—specifically number of felled trees, number of trails, basal area, canopy height, elevation, distance from village—were analyzed using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Eighteen of the 56 plots showed utilitarian diversity values significantly higher than expected. This result indicates that these habitats exhibited a low degree of utilitarian redundancy and were therefore comprised of plants with relatively distinct utilitarian properties. One implication of this finding is that minor losses in species richness may result in reductions in utilitarian diversity and redundancy, which may limit local residents' ability to switch between alternative choices. The GLM analysis showed that the most predictive model included basal area, canopy height and distance from village, which suggests that variation in utilitarian redundancy may be a result of local residents harvesting resources from the protected area. Our approach permits an assessment of the diversity of provisioning services available to local communities, offering unique insights that would not be possible using traditional taxonomic diversity measures. These analyses introduce another tool available to conservation biologists for assessing how future losses in biodiversity will lead to a reduction in natural resources and provisioning services from forests."

Long-term treatment, in particular the chronic (over-)treatment with glucocorticoids, may have an adverse effect on the cardiovascular risk profile in adult CAH patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cardiovascular risk profile of adult CAH patients. Design Case-control study. Patients and Measurements In this case-control study the cardiovascular risk profile of 27 adult CAH patients and 27 controls, matched for age, sex and body mass index was evaluated by measuring ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, albuminuria and circulating cardiovascular risk markers (PAI-1, tPA, uPA, tPA/PAI-1 complex, hsCRP, adiponectin, IL-6, IL-18 and leptin). Results 24-Hour systolic (126.3 mmHg±15.5 vs 124.8 mmHg±15.1 in controls, P = 0.019) and diastolic (76.4 mmHg±12.7 vs 73.5 mmHg±12.4 in controls, P<0.001) blood pressure was significantly elevated in CAH patients compared to the control population. CAH patients had higher HDL cholesterol levels (P<0.01), lower hsCRP levels (P = 0.03) and there was a trend toward elevated adiponectin levels compared to controls. Other cardiovascular risk factors were similar in both groups. Conclusion Adult CAH patients have higher ambulatory blood pressure compared to healthy matched controls. Other cardiovascular risk markers did not differ, while HDL-cholesterol, hsCRP and adiponectin levels tended to be more favorable."

Influenza H5N1 has been described as seasonal. Although several studies have evaluated environmental risk factors for H5N1 in poultry, none have considered seasonality of H5N1 in humans. In addition, temperature and humidity are suspected to drive influenza in temperate regions, but drivers in the tropics are unknown, for H5N1 as well as other influenza viruses. An analysis was conducted to determine whether human H5N1 cases occur seasonally in association with changes in temperature, precipitation and humidity. Data analyzed were H5N1 human cases in Indonesia (n = 135) and Egypt (n = 50), from January 1, 2005 (Indonesia) or 2006 (Egypt) through May 1, 2008 obtained from WHO case reports, and average daily weather conditions obtained from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center. Fourier time series analysis was used to determine seasonality of cases and associations between weather conditions and human H5N1 incidence. Human H5N1 cases in Indonesia occurred with a period of 1.67 years/cycle (p<0.05) and in Egypt, a period of 1.18 years/cycle (p≅0.10). Human H5N1 incidence in Egypt, but not Indonesia, was strongly associated with meteorological variables (κ2≥0.94) and peaked in Egypt when precipitation was low, and temperature, absolute humidity and relative humidity were moderate compared to the average daily conditions in Egypt. Weather conditions coinciding with peak human H5N1 incidence in Egypt suggest that human infection may be occurring primarily via droplet transmission from close contact with infected poultry."
https://openalex.org/W2056162784,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a pro-hemostatic multimeric plasma protein that promotes platelet aggregation and stabilizes coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in plasma. The metalloproteinase ADAMTS13 regulates the platelet aggregation function of VWF via proteolysis. Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, but does not always correlate with its clinical course. Therefore, other proteases could also be important in regulating VWF activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that VWF is cleaved by the cytotoxic lymphocyte granule component granzyme M (GrM). GrM cleaved both denaturated and soluble plasma-derived VWF after Leu at position 276 in the D3 domain. GrM is unique in that it did not affect the multimeric size and pro-hemostatic platelet aggregation ability of VWF, but instead destroyed the binding of VWF to FVIII in vitro. In meningococcal sepsis patients, we found increased plasma GrM levels that positively correlated with an increased plasma VWF/FVIII ratio in vivo. We conclude that, next to its intracellular role in triggering apoptosis, GrM also exists extracellularly in plasma where it could play a physiological role in controlling blood coagulation by determining plasma FVIII levels via proteolytic processing of its carrier VWF."
https://openalex.org/W1988216234,"Allergic airway inflammation, including asthma, is usually characterized by the predominant recruitment of eosinophils. However, neutrophilia is also prominent during severe exacerbations. Cell surface-expressed glycans play a role in leukocyte trafficking and recruitment during inflammation. Here, the involvement of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:α-6-D-mannoside β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5)-modified N-glycans in eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment during allergic airway inflammation was investigated. Allergen-challenged Mgat5-deficient (Mgat5(-/-)) mice exhibited significantly attenuated airway eosinophilia and inflammation (decreased Th2 cytokines, mucus production) compared with WT counterparts, attributable to decreased rolling, adhesion, and survival of Mgat5(-/-) eosinophils. Interestingly, allergen-challenged Mgat5(-/-) mice developed airway neutrophilia and increased airway reactivity with persistent elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, TNFα, IFNγ)). This increased neutrophil recruitment was also observed in LPS- and thioglycollate (TG)-induced inflammation in Mgat5(-/-) mice. Furthermore, there was significantly increased recruitment of infused Mgat5(-/-) neutrophils compared with WT neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity of TG-exposed WT mice. Mgat5(-/-) neutrophils demonstrated enhanced adhesion to P-selectin as well as increased migration toward keratinocyte-derived chemokine compared with WT neutrophils in vitro along with increased calcium mobilization upon activation and expression of elevated levels of CXCR2, which may contribute to the increased neutrophil recruitment. These data indicate an important role for MGAT5-modified N-glycans in differential regulation of eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment during allergic airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1988867141,"Androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. Upon binding to androgens, AR becomes transcriptionally active to regulate the expression of target genes that harbor androgen response elements (AREs) in their promoters and/or enhancers. AR is essential for the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells and is therefore a target for current and next-generation therapeutic modalities against prostate cancer. Pathophysiologically relevant protein-protein interaction networks involving AR are, however, poorly understood. In this study, we identified the protein FUsed/Translocated in LipoSarcoma (FUS/TLS) as an AR-interacting protein by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. The hormonal response of FUS expression in LNCaP cells was shown to resemble that of other AR co-activators. FUS displayed a strong intrinsic transactivation capacity in prostate cancer cells when tethered to basal promoters using the GAL4 system. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that FUS was recruited to ARE III of the enhancer region of the PSA gene. Data from ectopic overexpression and ""knock-down"" approaches demonstrated that AR transcriptional activity was enhanced by FUS. Depletion of FUS reduced androgen-dependent proliferation of LNCaP cells. Thus, FUS is a novel co-activator of AR in prostate cancer cells."

The α isoform is expressed ubiquitously, whereas the β and γ isoforms are expressed restrictedly in the brain, heart, testis, and skeletal muscle (12Matsumoto A. Onoyama I. Nakayama K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Intriguing characteristics of Fbw7α (encoded by the isoform1 of Fbxw7) have recently been described by Ericsson et al. (13Punga T. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ericsson J. J. Biol.

SREBPs, belonging to the bHLH-Zip transcription factor family, are established regulators of lipid synthesis. The unique features of SREBPs are their rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound transcription factors. These factors need to undergo proteolytic cleavage for nuclear transport to activate the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. This represents the crucial step for sterol and fatty acid synthetic gene regulation (15Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 16Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The SREBP family includes three isoforms as follows: SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2 (18Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

SREBP-2 governs cellular sterol regulation, whereas hepatic SREBP-1c (encoded by the isoformb of Srebf1) controls fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis depending on the nutritional state of the liver. SREBP-1a is highly expressed in growing cells and contributes to the synthesis of cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and phospholipid for the supply of membrane lipids during cell growth (21Horton J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 22Shimano H. Vitam. Horm. 2002; 65: 167-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear SREBP-1a regulates the cell cycle and growth by itself, indicating its strong association with cell growth (23Inoue N. Shimano H. Nakakuki M. Matsuzaka T. Nakagawa Y. Yamamoto T. Sato R.

Without a proteasome inhibitor such as calpain inhibitor I in cell cultures, nuclear SREBPs are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after cleavage. Recently, Fbw7 was reported to be the key factor for this degradation of SREBPs in cultured cells (14Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a is phosphorylated at several sites depending on the cell cycle and then degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. During mitosis, nuclear SREBP-1a is stabilized, and it activates lipid synthesis to supply membrane lipids (25Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Punga T. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11681-11686Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, Fbw7 controls the degradation of SREBPs in cultured cells in relation to the cell cycle and growth. However, its physiological roles in vivo have yet to be determined. In this study, the effects of Fbw7α modification on SREBPs and lipid metabolism in the liver were investigated. Antibodies to phosphorylated, c-Jun (Ser-63) and lamin A/C, were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); antibodies to SREBP-1, c-Jun, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5, encoded by Klf5), and α-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibody to Fbw7/hCdc4 was purchased from Abcam (Tokyo, Japan). N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal-CHO (ALLN; calpain inhibitor I) and fenofibrate were purchased from Sigma; Redivue [α-32P]dCTP was from GE Healthcare, and [1-14C]palmitate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan), and plasmid DNAs for transfection were prepared using the Qiagen plasmid midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Tsukuba. Male C57BL/6J mice (9 and 14 weeks old) were purchased from Clea (Tokyo, Japan), and male B6.V-Lep ob/J (ob/ob) mice (7 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River (Kanagawa, Japan). SREBP transgenic mice (13 weeks old) overexpressing the active form of human SREBP-1c under the control of the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter (SREBP1c-Tg) were generated as described previously (26Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In addition, SREBP-1 knock-out mice (SREBP1-KO) (6–8 weeks old) were generated as described previously (27Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin.

Ema, manuscript in preparation. The mice were housed in colony cages, maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and given free access to water and standard chow diet (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan); the mice were adapted to their new environment for at least 1 week prior to the experiments. After the adenovirus injection, the mice were housed during the periods indicated and then sacrificed in the nonfasted state. Tissues were isolated immediately, weighed, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Plasma metabolic parameters were measured by using commercial kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (all test kits were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). We subcloned Fbw7-specific RNAi constructs using the Fbw7-coding sequence 5′-GCTGAAACTGGAGAGTGTA-3′ into a U6 entry vector (Invitrogen). We then generated the recombinant adenoviral plasmid by homologous recombination with a pAd promoterless vector (Invitrogen). Next, we subcloned peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ2-specific RNAi constructs using the PPARγ2-coding sequence, 5′-GCCTATGAGCACTTCACAA-3′, and generated the recombinant adenoviral plasmid as described above. We subcloned hemagglutinin-tagged mouse Fbw7α cDNA into the pENTR4 vector (Invitrogen) and generated a recombinant adenoviral plasmid by homologous recombination with a pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen). We produced recombinant adenoviruses in HEK-293 cells and purified them by CsCl gradient centrifugation, as described previously (28Matsuzaka T. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Kato T. Atsumi A. Yamamoto T.

The recombinant adenovirus expressing the Cre recombinase AxCANCre was produced by Dr. Izumu Saito (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan) and was obtained from Riken DNA Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers and primary hepatocytes using the Sepasol-RNA I super reagent (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Northern blot analysis was performed using the indicated 32P-labeled probe, as described previously (28Matsuzaka T. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Kato T. Atsumi A. Yamamoto T. Inoue N. Ishikawa M. Okada S.

First strand cDNA was synthesized using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and comparative analysis of mRNA levels was performed using fluorescence-based real time PCR. Real time PCR analyses were performed using the ABI 7300 PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of fat-specific protein 27 (Cidec) was performed using a TaqMan gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems), whereas quantification of other genes was performed using the SYBR Green dye (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The relative abundance of each transcript was calculated using a standard curve of cycle thresholds for serial dilutions of a cDNA sample and then normalized to cyclophilin levels (31Kato T.

The expression levels of cyclophilin used as an internal control in each experiment were not affected by procedures such as siRNA transfection. Primer sequences are described in supplemental Table S1. We measured the plasma levels of glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acid, TG, total cholesterol (TC), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase as well as the levels of TG and TC in the liver, as described previously (32Yahagi N.

The expression plasmid for the human nuclear form of SREBP-1c has been described previously (33Kumadaki S. Matsuzaka T. Kato T. Yahagi N. Yamamoto T. Okada S. Kobayashi K. Takahashi A. Yatoh S. Suzuki H. Yamada N. Shimano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding mouse Fbw7α and Klf5 were generated by PCR amplification, followed by the insertion of cDNAs into pcDNA3.1(+) (Promega). The following primers were used: Fbw7α, 5′-primer 5′-CTTAAGCTTGCCACCATGAATCAGGAACTGCTCTCTGT-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATTTCATGTCCACATCAAAGTCCAG-3′, and Klf5, 5′-primer 5′-CTTAAGCTTGCCACCATGCCCACGCGGGTGC-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAGTTCTGGTGGCGCT-3′. Restriction sites HindIII and EcoRI were added to each 5′-primer and 3′-primer, respectively. PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRI and then inserted into the respective sites of pcDNA3.1(+). Ligation was performed using a Quick Ligation kit (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA). COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). For the KLF5 degradation assay, COS-7 cells were seeded 24 h before transfection in 6-cm plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/plate. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6J mice, as described previously (28Matsuzaka T. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Kato T. Atsumi A. Yamamoto T. Inoue N. Ishikawa M. Okada S. Ishigaki N. Iwasaki H. Iwasaki Y. Karasawa T. Kumadaki S. Matsui T. Sekiya M. Ohashi K. Hasty A.H. Nakagawa Y. Takahashi A. Suzuki H. Yatoh S. Sone H. Toyoshima H. Osuga J. Yamada N. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and seeded into 10-cm plates for adenovirus infection and measurement of palmitate uptake. [1-14C]Palmitate uptake by primary hepatocytes was measured as described previously but with some modifications (34Li L.O. Mashek D.G. An J. Doughman S.D. Newgard C.B. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37246-37255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, the isolated hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus for 60 h and incubated for 3 h in a culture medium containing 200 μm palmitate, radiolabeled [1-14C]palmitate (0.1 μCi/ml), 2 μm insulin, and 1% BSA (Sigma). After the 3-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then scraped into it. Cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol as described by Bligh and Dyer (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), and the residual radioactivity of each sample was then determined. Each indicated expression plasmid (3 μg) was transfected into COS-7 cells using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) to stop protein synthesis and then incubated with or without ALLN for the indicated times. We performed an immunoblot analysis using the antibodies indicated as described previously (29Nakagawa Y. Shimano H. Yoshikawa T. Ide T. Tamura M. Furusawa M. Yamamoto T. Inoue N. Matsuzaka T.

The intensity of each detected band was quantified using the image processing software ImageJ (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). Mouse livers were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. The sections were subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student's t test, one sample t test, or two-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's procedure. To estimate the contribution of Fbw7 to the physiological regulation of hepatic SREBP-1c and hepatic lipogenesis, Fbw7 was knocked down in murine livers by intravenous injection of adenovirus producing Fbw7 siRNA (Fbw7i). We confirmed that only the Fbw7α isoform was expressed in murine livers and cultured hepatoma cells, and Fbw7i fully suppressed Fbw7α expression in cultured hepatoma cells, as estimated by quantitative real time PCR (data not shown). In livers of mice infected with Fbw7i, the decrease in Fbw7α level was ∼70% (Fig. 1A). This hepatic Fbw7 knockdown caused fatty liver and a slight, but significant, enlargement of the liver (Fig. 1, B and C). These mice exhibited no significant changes in food intake, white adipose tissue weight, or body weight compared with animals infected with adenovirus producing LacZ siRNA (LacZi) as a control (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Of the plasma metabolic parameters, TG, glucose, and insulin levels were reduced significantly by infection with Fbw7i (Table 1). These data indicated that fatty liver was not likely to be associated with overnutrition or obesity. Hepatosteatosis was confirmed by liver histology (Fig. 1E) with a marked increase in the liver content of TG (Fig. 1F) but not TC (Fig. 1G).TABLE 1Plasma metabolic parameters in the Fbw7 knockdown miceParameterLacZiFbw7iBody weight25.3 ± 0.47 g24.6 ± 0.15 gGlucose252 ± 8.3 mg/dl191 ± 14 mg/dlap < 0.05 (versus each respective LacZi control).Insulin0.30 ± 0.083 pg/ml0.057 ± 0.036 pg/mlap < 0.05 (versus each respective LacZi control).TG151 ± 6.4 mg/dl92 ± 1.2 mg/dlbp < 0.01 (versus each respective LacZi control).TC67.4 ± 6.9 mg/dl88.2 ± 6.7 mg/dlNonesterified fatty acid1.21 ± 0.04 mEq/liter1.14 ± 0.08 mEq/literAlanine aminotransferase30 ± 1.6 Karmen units42 ± 1.0 Karmen unitsbp < 0.01 (versus each respective LacZi control).Aspartate aminotransferase63 ± 4.8 Karmen units114 ± 5.4 Karmen unitsbp < 0.01 (versus each respective LacZi control).a p < 0.05 (versus each respective LacZi control).b p < 0.01 (versus each respective LacZi control). Open table in a new tab Immunoblot analysis of hepatic nuclear extracts demonstrated that the increase in nuclear SREBP-1 protein by Fbw7 knockdown was minimal, whereas c-Jun protein, another target of Fbw7, accumulated markedly without a change in its mRNA level (Fig. 2, A and B). This finding confirmed Fbw7 inactivation. The precursor form of SREBP-1c in the whole cell fraction did not change noticeably. Lack of hepatic SREBP-1 activation by Fbw7α suppression was confirmed by the gene expression pattern estimated by real time PCR (Fig. 2C). With the exception of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), mRNA levels of SREBP-1c and SREBP-1 target genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acaca), fatty-acid synthase (Fasn), and long chain fatty acid elongase 6 (Elovl6), were not up-regulated. There were no changes in the expression of carbohydrate response element-binding protein (Mlxipl), another transcription factor that controls fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 2C). The mRNA levels of Ppara (which encodes PPARα, a crucial regulator of hepatic fatty acid oxidation enzymes) and the PPARα target genes acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1) and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm) did not change (Fig. 2D). In contrast, hepatic expression of PPARγ2 (isoform2 of Pparg) increased significantly by Fbw7 knockdown, although expression of PPARγ1 (isoform1 of Pparg) increased minimally. Consistent with these findings, the expression of aP2 (Fabp4), another PPARγ2 target gene, was also up-regulated (Fig. 2E). We observed marked increases in the mRNA levels of Cd36, a transporter involved in the hepatic uptake of plasma fatty acids, mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (Gpam), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1), an enzyme in TG synthesis (Fig. 2F). Fsp27/CIDE-C (encoded by Cidec), a lipid droplet binding protein known to promote lipid accumulation in adipocytes, has recently been reported to contribute to hepatosteatosis as a PPARγ target (38Matsusue K.

These data indicated that fatty liver induced by Fbw7 knockdown was caused by an elevation in fatty acid uptake, TG synthesis, and lipid accumulation, rather than by an increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis or a decrease in fatty acid degradation. These genes involved in the accumulation of TG are direct targets of PPARγ2. Consistent with the liver cholesterol content remaining unchanged, SREBP-2 target genes involved in cholesterol metabolism such as low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) and HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr) did not change with Fbw7 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Apolipoprotein B (Apob) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp) involved in TG secretion did not decrease (Fig. 3B). Expression of gluconeogenic genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc), and glucose transporter 2 (Slc2a2) did not change, although glucokinase (Gck) expression decreased significantly by Fbw7 knockdown (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylated protein levels of c-Jun increased by Fbw7 knockdown (Fig. 2A). Expression of cytokines such as Il1b and Il6 did not change (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Effects of Fbw7 knockdown on gene expression in the livers of C57BL/6J mice. All mice were infected with Fbw7i or LacZi adenovirus. After 4 days of standard chow feeding, the mice were sacrificed in the nonfasted state. mRNA levels of LDL receptor (Ldlr) and HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr) (A), apolipoprotein B (Apob) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp) (B), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1), glucose transporter 2 (Slc2a2), and glucokinase (Gck) (C), and Il1b and Il6 (D) in the livers of mice infected with LacZi or Fbw7i were determined by real time PCR. The quantities of mRNA were calculated as the ratio of the cyclophilin level in each cDNA sample. mRNA levels are shown as the expression ratio relative to the LacZi control group. n = 4 per group in A and C, and n = 8 or 9 per group in B and D. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test; **, p < 0.01, and *, p < 0.05 (versus LacZi control group).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The possibility that SREBP-1 did not contribute to fatty liver induced by Fbw7 knockdown was investigated further in SREBP1-KO. Littermates and SREBP1-KO had similar basal mRNA levels of Fbw7α (Fig. 4A). After Fbw7 knockdown, the TG content of SREBP1-KO livers increased to levels comparable with littermates (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of Fbw7 function by knockdown was confirmed by the increased levels of c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun proteins in nuclear extracts (Fig. 4C). Lipogenic enzyme genes such as Fasn and Scd1 were not affected by Fbw7 knockdown in SREBP1-KO livers (Fig. 4D). Fbw7 knockdown did not alter Hmgcr expression or liver cholesterol content (Fig. 4E and data not shown). Meanwhile, PPARγ2 and Cd36 were up-regulated by Fbw7 knockdown irrespective of the presence or absence of SREBP-1 (Fig. 4F), indicating SREBP-1c-independent and PPARγ2-mediated TG accumulation. Besides its stability in the nucleus, nuclear SREBP-1c protein level is regulated mainly by its mRNA level and cleavage activity of the precursor SREBP-1c protein for nuclear transport. To exclude the possibility that the lack of change in the nuclear SREBP-1 protein by Fbw7 knockdown was attributable to changes in mRNA expression and cleavage activity of the precursor protein, we tested the effect of Fbw7 inhibition on the overexpressed nuclear form of the SREBP-1c protein in transgenic livers (Fig. 5). Production of nuclear SREBP-1c was stabilized by the transgene under the control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. However, the amount of transgene SREBP-1c protein in liver nuclei was not elevated"
https://openalex.org/W2023054904,"Commensal organisms are frequent causes of pneumonia. However, the detection of these organisms in the airway does not mean that they are the causative pathogens; they may exist merely as colonizers. In up to 50% cases of pneumonia, the causative pathogens remain unidentified, thereby hampering targeting therapies. In speculating on the role of a commensal organism in pneumonia, we devised the battlefield hypothesis. In the “pneumonia battlefield,” the organism-to-human cell number ratio may be an index for the pathogenic role of the organism. Using real-time PCR reactions for sputum samples, we tested whether the hypothesis predicts the results of bacteriological clinical tests for 4 representative commensal organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas spp., and Moraxella catarrhalis. The cutoff value for the organism-to-human cell number ratio, above which the pathogenic role of the organism was suspected, was set up for each organism using 224 sputum samples. The validity of the cutoff value was then tested in a prospective study that included 153 samples; the samples were classified into 3 groups, and each group contained 93%, 7%, and 0% of the samples from pneumonia, in which the pathogenic role of Streptococcus pneumoniae was suggested by the clinical tests. The results for Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas spp., and Moraxella catarrhalis were 100%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The battlefield hypothesis enabled legitimate interpretation of the PCR results and predicted pneumonia in which the pathogenic role of the organism was suggested by the clinical test. The PCR reactions based on the battlefield hypothesis may help to promote targeted therapies for pneumonia. The prospective observatory study described in the current report had been registered to the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) registry before its initiation, where the UMIN is a registry approved by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). The UMIN registry number was UMIN000001118: A prospective study for the investigation of the validity of cutoff values established for the HIRA-TAN system (April 9, 2008)."
https://openalex.org/W2031480894,"Background This study is to determine the seroprevalence of the pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus (pH1N1) in Taiwan before and after the 2009 pandemic, and to estimate the relative severity of pH1N1 infections among different age groups. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1544 and 1558 random serum samples were collected from the general population in Taiwan in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Seropositivity was defined by a hemagglutination inhibition titer to pH1N1 (A/Taiwan/126/09) ≥1:40. The seropositivity rate of pH1N1 among the unvaccinated subjects and national surveillance data were used to compare the proportion of infections that led to severe diseases and fatalities among different age groups. The overall seroprevalence of pH1N1 was 0.91% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43–1.38) in 2007 and significantly increased to 29.9% (95% CI 27.6–32.2) in 2010 (p<0.0001), with the peak attack rate (55.4%) in 10–17 year-old adolescents, the lowest in elderly ≥65 years (14.1%). The overall attack rates were 20.6% (188/912) in unvaccinated subjects. Among the unvaccinated but infected populations, the estimated attack rates of severe cases per 100,000 infections were significantly higher in children aged 0–5 years (54.9 cases, odds ratio [OR] 4.23, 95% CI 3.04–5.90) and elderly ≥ 65years (22.4 cases, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.99–3.83) compared to adolescents aged 10–17 years (13.0 cases). The overall case-fatality rate was 0.98 per 100,000 infections without a significant difference in different age groups. Conclusions/Significance Pre-existing immunity against pH1N1 was rarely identified in Taiwanese at any age in 2007. Young children and elderly – the two most lower seroprotection groups showed the greatest vulnerability to clinical severity after the pH1N1 infections. These results imply that both age groups should have higher priority for immunization in the coming flu season."
https://openalex.org/W2048103232,"Yeast SUV3 is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial RNA helicase that complexes with an exoribonuclease, DSS1, to function as an RNA degradosome. Inactivation of SUV3 leads to mitochondrial dysfunctions, such as respiratory deficiency; accumulation of aberrant RNA species, including excised group I introns; and loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Although intron toxicity has long been speculated to be the major reason for the observed phenotypes, direct evidence to support or refute this theory is lacking. Moreover, it remains unknown whether SUV3 plays a direct role in mtDNA maintenance independently of its degradosome activity. In this paper, we address these questions by employing an inducible knockdown system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with either normal or intronless mtDNA background. Expressing mutants defective in ATPase (K245A) or RNA binding activities (V272L or ΔCC, which carries an 8-amino acid deletion at the C-terminal conserved region) resulted in not only respiratory deficiencies but also loss of mtDNA under normal mtDNA background. Surprisingly, V272L, but not other mutants, can rescue the said deficiencies under intronless background. These results provide genetic evidence supporting the notion that the functional requirements of SUV3 for degradosome activity and maintenance of mtDNA stability are separable. Furthermore, V272L mutants and wild-type SUV3 associated with an active mtDNA replication origin and facilitated mtDNA replication, whereas K245A and ΔCC failed to support mtDNA replication. These results indicate a direct role of SUV3 in maintaining mitochondrial genome stability that is independent of intron turnover but requires the intact ATPase activity and the CC conserved region."
https://openalex.org/W2069896336,"An upregulation of the astrocytic proteins GFAP and bFGF within area 2 of the cingulate cortex (Cg2) occurs within 3 hours of parturition in rats. These changes are the result of an interaction between hormonal state and maternal experience and are associated with increased dendritic spine density in this area. Here, we examined whether this upregulation of astrocytic proteins generalized to other glial markers and, in particular those associated with glutamate metabolism. We chose glial markers commonly used to reflect different aspects of glial function: vimentin, like GFAP, is a marker of intermediate filaments; glutamine synthetase (GS), and S-100beta, are used as markers for mature astrocytes and GS has also been used as a specific marker for glutamatergic enzymatic activity. In addition, we examined levels of proteins associated with glutamine synthetase, glutamate, glutamine and two excitatory amino acid transporters found in astrocytes, glt-1 and glast. S100beta immunoreactivity did not vary with reproductive state in either Cg2 or MPOA suggesting no change in the number of mature astrocytes across these conditions. Vimentin-ir did not differ across groups in Cg2, but expression of this protein decreased from Day 1 postpartum onwards in the MPOA. By contrast, GS-ir was increased within 24 h postpartum in Cg2 but not MPOA and similarly to GFAP and bFGF this upregulation of GS resulted from an interaction between hormonal state and maternal experience. Within Cg2, upregulation of GS was not accompanied by changes in the astrocytic glutamatergic transporters, glt-1 and glast, however, an increase in both glutamate and glutamine proteins were observed within the Cg2 of postpartum animals. Together, these changes suggest postpartum upregulation of glutamatergic activity and metabolism within Cg2 that is stimulated by pregnancy hormones and maternal experience."
https://openalex.org/W2009668207,"The response to oxidative stress involves numerous genes and mutations in these genes often manifest in pleiotropic ways that presumably reflect perturbations in ROS-mediated physiology. The Drosophila melanogaster SOD1-null allele (cSODn108) is proposed to result in oxidative stress by preventing superoxide breakdown. In SOD1-null flies, oxidative stress management is thought to be reliant on the glutathione-dependent antioxidants that utilize NADPH to cycle between reduced and oxidized form. Previous studies suggest that SOD1-null Drosophila rely on lipid catabolism for energy rather than carbohydrate metabolism. We tested these connections by comparing the activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, lipid and triglyceride concentration, and steady state NADPH:NADP(+) in SOD1-null and control transgenic rescue flies. We find a negative shift in the activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in SOD1-nulls and the NADP(+)-reducing enzymes were found to have significantly lower activity than the other enzymes assayed. Little evidence for the catabolism of lipids as preferential energy source was found, as the concentration of lipids and triglycerides were not significantly lower in SOD1-nulls compared with controls. Using a starvation assay to impact lipids and triglycerides, we found that lipids were indeed depleted in both genotypes when under starvation stress, suggesting that oxidative damage was not preventing the catabolism of lipids in SOD1-null flies. Remarkably, SOD1-nulls were also found to be relatively resistant to starvation. Age profiles of enzyme activity, triglyceride and lipid concentration indicates that the trends observed are consistent over the average lifespan of the SOD1-nulls. Based on our results, we propose a model of physiological response in which organisms under oxidative stress limit the production of ROS through the down-regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in order to moderate the products exiting the electron transport chain."
https://openalex.org/W2033414229,"Apoptosis is a natural process during animal development for the programmed removal of superfluous cells. During apoptosis general protein synthesis is reduced, but the synthesis of cell death proteins is enhanced. Selective translation has been attributed to modification of the protein synthesis machinery to disrupt cap-dependent mRNA translation and induce a cap-independent mechanism. We have previously shown that disruption of the balance between cap-dependent and cap-independent C. elegans eIF4G isoforms (IFG-1 p170 and p130) by RNA interference promotes apoptosis in developing oocytes. Germ cell apoptosis was accompanied by the appearance of the Apaf-1 homolog, CED-4. Here we show that IFG-1 p170 is a native substrate of the worm executioner caspase, CED-3, just as mammalian eIF4GI is cleaved by caspase-3. Loss of Bcl-2 function (ced-9ts) in worms induced p170 cleavage in vivo, coincident with extensive germ cell apoptosis. Truncation of IFG-1 occurred at a single site that separates the cap-binding and ribosome-associated domains. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that CED-3 processes IFG-1 at a non-canonical motif, TTTD456. Coincidentally, the recognition site was located 65 amino acids downstream of the newly mapped IFG-1 p130 start site suggesting that both forms support cap-independent initiation. Genetic evidence confirmed that apoptosis induced by loss of ifg-1 p170 mRNA was caspase (ced-3) and apoptosome (ced-4/Apaf-1) dependent. These findings support a new paradigm in which modal changes in protein synthesis act as a physiological signal to initiate cell death, rather than occur merely as downstream consequences of the apoptotic event."
https://openalex.org/W2039938559,"In social groups where relatedness among interacting individuals is low, cooperation can often only be maintained through mechanisms that repress competition among group members. Repression-of-competition mechanisms, such as policing and punishment, seem to be of particular importance in human societies, where cooperative interactions often occur among unrelated individuals. In line with this view, economic games have shown that the ability to punish defectors enforces cooperation among humans. Here, I examine a real-world example of a repression-of-competition system, the police institutions common to modern human societies. Specifically, I test evolutionary policing theory by comparing data on policing effort, per capita crime rate, and similarity (used as a proxy for genetic relatedness) among citizens across the 26 cantons of Switzerland. This comparison revealed full support for all three predictions of evolutionary policing theory. First, when controlling for policing efforts, crime rate correlated negatively with the similarity among citizens. This is in line with the prediction that high similarity results in higher levels of cooperative self-restraint (i.e. lower crime rates) because it aligns the interests of individuals. Second, policing effort correlated negatively with the similarity among citizens, supporting the prediction that more policing is required to enforce cooperation in low-similarity societies, where individuals' interests diverge most. Third, increased policing efforts were associated with reductions in crime rates, indicating that policing indeed enforces cooperation. These analyses strongly indicate that humans respond to cues of their social environment and adjust cheating and policing behaviour as predicted by evolutionary policing theory."

Although much progress has been achieved through the understanding of prions from organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Podospora anserina, or Aplysia californica, the criteria that qualify a protein module as a prion are still unclear. In addition, the functionality of known prion domains fails to provide clues to understand the first identified prion, the mammalian infectious prion protein, PrP. To address these issues, we generated mammalian cellular models of expression of the C-terminal two helices of PrP, H2 and H3, which have been hypothesized, among other models, to hold the replication and conversion properties of the infectious PrP. We found that the H2H3 domain is an independent folding unit that undergoes glycosylations and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring similar to full-length PrP. Surprisingly, in some conditions the normally folded H2H3 was able to systematically go through a conversion process and generate insoluble proteinase K-resistant aggregates. This structural switch involves the assembly of amyloid structures that bind thioflavin S and oligomers that are reactive to A11 antibody, which specifically detects protein oligomers from neurological disorders. Overall, we show that H2H3 is a conformational switch in a cellular context and is thus suggested to be a candidate for the conversion domain of PrP.

Prion diseases are unique mammalian neurodegenerative diseases because their infectivity is mediated by the misfolding of an endogenous protein PrPC into an amyloid-structured conformer PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B.

Prions are therefore defined as “infectious proteins” that are able to switch between at least two states, the prion state being able to replicate and propagate. This prion concept was successfully extended to a variety of proteins, mainly from yeast but also from fungi and marine mollusk, to explain non-Mendelian inheritance of phenotypes. In yeast, for example, the Sup35 and Ure2 proteins are considered to be the molecular determinants of the prion states [PSI+] and [URE3], respectively (5Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

Similarly, in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, the prion properties of Het-s protein explained the heterokaryon incompatibility phenotype of [Het-s] (8Coustou V. Deleu C. Saupe S.

In all of these cases, identification of a minimal prion-determining region was a strong asset for dissecting the role of the different domains in the proteins and for understanding their functions. Prion-determining regions appear to be an unstructured stretch of ∼70–200 amino acids that are, apart from Het-s, rich in glutamine/asparagine residues and have a bias against polar residues (9Si K.

No definite region has been clearly identified as responsible for the change of conformation and the replication of PrP, dragging down attempts to understand both physiological and pathological function(s) of PrP and its subdomains. Although the putative replicative and templating prion domain of PrP is thought to be located in the globular C-terminal region, the unstructured N terminus (amino acids 23–89) is excluded from the infectious core of PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B.

More recent biophysical studies provided insights into brain-derived PK-resistant PrP and also implicated a conformational conversion of H2H3, which extends over the whole C-terminal region (amino acids ∼80–231) (21Smirnovas V.

As shown by the apparent contradiction between these models, a consensus has yet to be found that should be based on in vivo studies. In favor of the H2H3 hypothesis, we have previously shown that (i) H2H3 can be independently generated in an Escherichia coli system and retain its native secondary and tertiary structure (23Adrover M.

P. (2011) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar). These results led to the hypothesis that H2H3 could be the minimal region involved in the change of conformation of PrP. In contrast to other prion-determining regions, H2H3 is natively structured. Unexpectedly, we observed that there was no natural propensity for the primary sequence of H2H3 to fold into helices and that the disulfide bond and the rest of the proteins are essential in its stabilization (23Adrover M.

It is not unusual for globular proteins to form amyloids (26Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The metastable property of the structured H2H3 is consistent with amyloid misfolding of globular proteins under native conditions where environmental fluctuation may lead to local unfolding and cooperative restructuration (26Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, we need to establish conclusively whether, in vivo, H2H3 displays these alternative structures that are necessary, although not sufficient, to qualify it as a prion domain. Whether H2H3, when expressed in isolation in mammalian cells, retains its native structure and how the post-translational modifications may affect its stability are not known either. Here, we generated cellular models expressing of GPI-anchored H2H3. Different H2H3- or H2H3Flag-expressing clones were selected and displayed membrane-anchored glycosylated H2H3. We then showed that the structured H2H3 could be induced to misfold into highly PK-resistant aggregate. Analysis of the aggregation process highlighted prion properties such as PK resistance, detergent insolubility, oligomers, and amyloid structures. The aggregation was confluence-dependent. We conclude that H2H3 presents a bistable structure in which the switch is controlled by the state of the cellular environment. Hence, this work supports a conformational switch function of H2H3 and casts new light onto the molecular bases of the pathogenesis of prion diseases and onto our fundamental understanding of the prion concept in general.

For transient transfection studies, the cells were recovered after 24 h and analyzed. Stable transfectants were selected using G418 (Invitrogen) at 0.3 mg/ml for 2 weeks. After cell sorting and cloning, medium containing G418 was replaced by normal medium. The cells were removed from culture plates using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and lysed for 10 min at 4 °C (lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100). Nuclei and cellular remnants were removed by centrifugation at 104 × g for 2 min. The amount of protein was determined and normalized to 200 μg/sample using bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Uptima). For PK digestion experiments, the samples were PK-treated (standard concentration: 3 μg/mg of total protein) for 30 min at 37 °C, 1 mm PMSF was added to block enzymatic reaction, and proteins were centrifuged at 2 × 104 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended and heated for 5 min at 100 °C in Laemmli buffer. For other experiments, lysates (10–40 μg of total protein, as indicated) were not PK-digested but directly diluted in 2× Laemmli buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (CriterionXT precast gel; Bio-Rad) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer (12 mm Tris, 80 mm glycine, 10% isopropanol), at 70 V for 90 min. The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) fat-free milk, processed with the indicated antibody and anti-mouse horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). Revelation was performed using ECL kit (Millipore) by autoradiographic method. For deglycosylation, proteins from cell lysates were denatured by heating in 2% SDS buffer and incubated at 37 °C overnight in buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 with 2 units of PNGase F/100 μg of total proteins. PIPLC treatment was performed on a single layer of live cells in 6-well plates in PBS (pH 7.4) by incubating at 37 °C for 2 h with 1 unit of PIPLC per ml. Supernatants were collected, and proteins were precipitated by adding four volumes of acetone at −20 °C. The samples were then stored at −20 °C for 2 h and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were washed in cold acetone, centrifuged again, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. F6 cells from a 6-well plate were recovered at the indicated confluence, extensively washed in cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were normalized at 2 mg/ml. After a short centrifugation at 104 × g for 2 min to remove nuclei and cellular remnants, supernatant was centrifuged at 2 × 104 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted in 2× Laemmli buffer, and pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer; both were heated for 5 min at 100 °C. 10 μl of supernatant and pellet samples were loaded in SDS-PAGE gel. Confluent monolayer cells were recovered with nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich) treatment and extensively washed with cold PBS. E1 and F6 cells were respectively labeled with 3F4 and M2 antibodies (5 μg/ml) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody (Dako) detection. We used mouse IgG2a and IgG1 (Dako) as isotype controls for 3F4 and M2 antibodies, respectively. For quantification of dead cells, propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) (1 μg/ml) was incubated with cells at 4 °C for 20 min, and cells were counted by flow cytometry. Small cellular remnants (<1 μm) were gated out. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACScan device. Cell sorting and cloning were performed on a inFlux Cell Sorter (Alliance Biosecure Foundation). Cells within the fluorescence gate were cloned in 96-well plates with 1 cell/well in culture medium. The data were analyzed with FlowJo version 8.8.6 software. The cells were grown in Lab-Tek slides (Nunc) following the cell culture procedure. For immunofluorescent labeling of PrP or H2H3Flag, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, unless stated otherwise. 3F4 and M2 monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PrP and H2H3Flag, respectively. Overconfluent (100% + 4d) F6 cells were more sensitive to the immunofluorescent labeling protocol, and many dissociated from the slide. A11 antibody (Invitrogen) (32Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) detecting protein oligomers implicated in different neurodegenerative disorders was also tested. Fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used for detection. Thioflavin S (ThS) staining followed the protocol of Kimura et al. (33Kimura Y. Koitabashi S. Fujita T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, when applicable, after secondary antibody incubation, the cells were washed three times with G1T (1% gelatin, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 0.1% Tween 20), stained in 0.001% ThS for 20 min, and washed three times with G1T. The coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Labs). Image acquisition was performed on a Leica DM6000B fluorescence microscope or on a Leica confocal SPE with a 40× ACS APO objective and a 1.15 numerical overture. Bright field microscopy observations were taken from Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope, with a 10× objective. The CD experiment was performed in a Jasco 810 device with a 0.01-cm circular quartz cuvette. Recombinant murine H2H3 was used at 100 μm in 5 mm citrate buffer adjusted to pH 3.5, at 25 °C. The spectrum was recorded from 260 to 195 nm and averaged from four scans collected at 200 nm·min−1. The plot was normalized by molarity for the ellipticity. We previously showed by NMR that recombinant ovine H2H3 naturally acquires the same structure as the native H2H3 in full-length PrP (23Adrover M. Pauwels K. Prigent S. de Chiara C. Xu Z. Chapuis C. Pastore A. Rezaei H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21004-21012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We first verified whether the murine sequence is also able to generate an α-helical recombinant H2H3. As shown by circular dichroism, mouse H2H3 displays a typical α-helix spectrum characterized by local minima at 209 and 220 nm (Fig. 1A), consistently with the in vitro results on ovine H2H3. To check whether H2H3 can be independently expressed in mammalian cells with processing and post-translational modifications similar to PrPC, we built a cellular expression model of a GPI-anchored H2H3 in a rabbit kidney cell line RK13, which does not express endogenous PrP and allows prion replication when expressing PrP (28Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). RK13 cells were transfected with four different constructs, including the empty plasmid pcDNA3 as a control (Fig. 1B). The inserts coding for H2H3 and an N-terminally FLAG-tagged H2H3 included the N-terminal signal peptide sequence and the C-terminal propeptide sequence of full-length PrP (GPI signal) (Fig. 1B), allowing correct localization and anchoring to the membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. As a control, the sequence of mouse full-length PrP was used, containing the 3F4 epitope at position amino acids 109–112 (Fig. 1B) (34Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kascsak R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (author reply le6): le5Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were recovered and analyzed by Western blot for transient expression of the different constructs (Fig. 1C). Despite our efforts in testing a large panel of antibodies, we could not find an efficient one specifically recognizing the C terminus of PrP. We thus used Pri-917 monoclonal antibody (36Demart S. Fournier J.G. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Lamoury F. Marce D. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Grassi J. Deslys J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which we found was able to detect H2H3. As shown in Fig. 1C (left panel, lane 0), Pri-917 detects the mixture of recombinant full-length PrP and H2H3. We were able to detect a band around 17 kDa in lane 3 corresponding to the H2H3-transfected cells. When probed with 3F4 monoclonal antibody, the typical glycoforms of full-length PrP was detected only in PrP-transfected cells, with a molecular mass ranging from 19–21 kDa to up to ∼40 kDa (Fig. 1C, center panel, lane 2). The signal was much stronger than with Pri-917, indicating a very low sensitivity of the latter. Because we could not get a clear signal for H2H3Flag with Pri-917 antibody (Fig. 1C, left panel, lane 4), we used the M2 monoclonal antibody raised against the FLAG tag and showed the expression of a ∼18-kDa protein only in H2H3Flag-transfected cells (Fig. 1C, right panel, lane 4), which corresponded to a glycosylated form of H2H3Flag as shown in subsequent deglycosylation experiments (Fig. 2A) and when compared with the theoretical molecular mass of the protein, which is 9–10 kDa. In each case, cells transfected with the empty vector did not show any specific signal (Fig. 1C, lanes 1). To select stable clonal cell lines, we used a cell sorting strategy. MoPrP RK13, H2H3Flag RK13, and H2H3 RK13 cell surfaces were respectively labeled with 3F4, M2, Pri-917 antibodies and then with Alexa 488-coupled secondary antibody. The selected population corresponded to the uppermost 0.16, 0.055, and 0.037% fluorescent cells of MoPrP RK13, H2H3Flag RK13, and H2H3 RK13 cultures, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1A). As shown in supplemental Fig. S1B, clones with a detectable level of expression could be found, although probing with Pri-917 required more effort to reveal acceptable signal. Overall, we were able to generate, through a cell sorting selection and cloning strategy, clonal cell lines stably expressing different levels of expression for the three constructs of interest at the cell surface. In PrPC, the glycosylation process and the addition of a GPI anchor is associated with a stabilized membrane-bound α-helical structure of the H2H3 domain (37Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 38Cancellotti E. Barron R.M. Bishop M.T. Hart P. Wiseman F. Manson J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To explore the processing of H2H3, we first assessed the glycosylation pattern by PNGase F treatment. As expected, full-length PrP in both D6 and E1 clones was glycosylated (Fig. 2A) and, after PNGase treatment, revealed the unglycosylated PrP at ∼28 kDa and a faint signal at 19 kDa, corresponding to the truncated C-terminal C2 fragment (39Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Similarly, for the 3 H2H3Flag clones B7, F6 and D3, removal of glycosylation by PNGase F allowed the detection of a single band at ∼14 kDa, slightly above recombinant H2H3 migration band caused by the presence of the FLAG tag (Fig. 2A and supplemental S1C). The three selected clones displayed different expression levels. For the F6 clone, which has the highest expression level, we could also detect higher molecular mass bands up to ∼33 kDa, which could correspond to other glycoforms (Fig. 2A). They were, however, present at a low proportion, giving rise to an original pattern, although similar to full-length PrP: no detectable unglycosylated, a strong intermediately glycosylated, and minor hyperglycosylated forms. We compared the expression of all selected clones, after PNGase F treatment, using the only common antibody Pri-917 and found similar level of expression for E1 and F6 and a slightly weaker expression for D6 and B5 (supplemental Fig. S1C). These data prompted us to verify whether the protein could be ultimately localized on the outer plasma membrane. Using both immunofluorescent microscopy on nonpermeabilized cells and flow cytometry on surface-labeled cells (Fig. 2, B–D), we demonstrated that PrP-expressing E1 clone and H2H3Flag-expressing F6 clone displayed surface fluorescent labeling of their respective protein. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the protein content in the supernatant of E1 or F6 cells with or without phospholipase C treatment (PIPLC), which released GPI-anchored proteins in the medium, indicated that at least a proportion of PrP in E1 and H2H3Flag in F6 were anchored on the plasma membrane through a GPI anchor (Fig. 2E), consistent with the localization results. Evaluation of the resistance of H2H3 to PK digestion showed that at 100% confluence + 2 days, B5 (expressing H2H3 without the FLAG tag), D3 and F6 cells generated a PK-resistant form of H2H3 (Fig. 3A), hereafter called H2H3res, whereas before and at 100% confluence, H2H3 remained PK-sensitive. As a control, in the same conditions, PrP-expressing E1 cells did not show this phenomenon (Fig. 3A). Thus generation of PK-resistant species was specific to H2H3 and was not due to the FLAG tag. When compared with classical scrapie prion from infected SN56 cells, H2H3res from F6 cells displayed a much higher resistance to PK digestion (Fig. 3B). As negative controls for PK digestion, uninfected SN56 and 100% confluent F6 cells were used, whereas Chandler-infected SN56 (ScSN56) and overconfluent (100% + 2 days) F6 cells were used as PK-resistant samples (Fig. 3B). For B5, D3 and F6 clones, at 100% confluence + 2 days, refringent cells began to appear in the culture in contrast to the PrP-expressing E1 clone (Figs. 3C and 4, A and B). Quantification of the ratio of dead cells in F6 cultures indicated an increase up to ∼25% (Fig. 4B). H2H3res was generated in live cells, because with the extensive wash with PBS, most of the dead cells were not analyzed in the PK resistance Western blot assay. We then analyzed the electrophoretic profile of H2H3 as a function of confluence (Fig. 4C). F6 cells were plated at day 0 by serial dilution and incubated until day"

So far only the 3q21-q25 region has repeatedly been indicated as a susceptibility region for DN. The aim of this study was to search for new DN susceptibility loci in Finnish, Danish and French T1D families.We performed a genome-wide linkage study using 384 microsatellite markers. A total of 175 T1D families were studied, of which 94 originated from Finland, 46 from Denmark and 35 from France. The whole sample set consisted of 556 individuals including 42 sib-pairs concordant and 84 sib-pairs discordant for DN. Two-point and multi-point non-parametric linkage analyses were performed using the Analyze package and the MERLIN software. A novel DN locus on 22q11 was identified in the joint analysis of the Finnish, Danish and French families by genome-wide multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis using the Kong and Cox linear model (NPL(pairs) LOD score 3.58). Nominal or suggestive evidence of linkage to this locus was also detected when the three populations were analyzed separately. Suggestive evidence of linkage was found to six additional loci in the Finnish and French sample sets.This study identified a novel DN locus at chromosome 22q11 with significant evidence of linkage to DN. Our results suggest that this locus may be of importance in European populations. In addition, this study supports previously indicated DN loci on 3q21-q25 and 19q13."
https://openalex.org/W1988068519,"Informative genes from microarray data can be used to construct prediction model and investigate biological mechanisms. Differentially expressed genes, the main targets of most gene selection methods, can be classified as single- and multiple-class specific signature genes. Here, we present a novel gene selection algorithm based on a Group Marker Index (GMI), which is intuitive, of low-computational complexity, and efficient in identification of both types of genes. Most gene selection methods identify only single-class specific signature genes and cannot identify multiple-class specific signature genes easily. Our algorithm can detect de novo certain conditions of multiple-class specificity of a gene and makes use of a novel non-parametric indicator to assess the discrimination ability between classes. Our method is effective even when the sample size is small as well as when the class sizes are significantly different. To compare the effectiveness and robustness we formulate an intuitive template-based method and use four well-known datasets. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the template-based method in difficult cases with unbalanced distribution. Moreover, the multiple-class specific genes are good biomarkers and play important roles in biological pathways. Our literature survey supports that the proposed method identifies unique multiple-class specific marker genes (not reported earlier to be related to cancer) in the Central Nervous System data. It also discovers unique biomarkers indicating the intrinsic difference between subtypes of lung cancer. We also associate the pathway information with the multiple-class specific signature genes and cross-reference to published studies. We find that the identified genes participate in the pathways directly involved in cancer development in leukemia data. Our method gives a promising way to find genes that can involve in pathways of multiple diseases and hence opens up the possibility of using an existing drug on other diseases as well as designing a single drug for multiple diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1963689972,"Upon starvation, individual Dictyostelium discoideum cells enter a developmental program that leads to collective migration and the formation of a multicellular organism. The process is mediated by extracellular cAMP binding to the G protein-coupled cAMP receptor 1, which initiates a signaling cascade leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase A (ACA), the synthesis and secretion of additional cAMP, and an autocrine and paracrine activation loop. The release of cAMP allows neighboring cells to polarize and migrate directionally and form characteristic chains of cells called streams. We now report that cAMP relay can be measured biochemically by assessing ACA, ERK2, and TORC2 activities at successive time points in development after stimulating cells with subsaturating concentrations of cAMP. We also find that the activation profiles of ACA, ERK2, and TORC2 change in the course of development, with later developed cells showing a loss of sensitivity to the relayed signal. We examined mutants in PKA activity that have been associated with precocious development and find that this loss in responsiveness occurs earlier in these mutants. Remarkably, we show that this loss in sensitivity correlates with a switch in migration patterns as cells transition from streams to aggregates. We propose that as cells proceed through development, the cAMP-induced desensitization and down-regulation of cAMP receptor 1 impacts the sensitivities of chemotactic signaling cascades leading to changes in migration patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1988407124,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) make cell fate decisions based on intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The decision of ESC to differentiate to multiple lineages in vitro occurs during the formation of embryoid bodies (EB) and is influenced by cell-environment interactions. However, molecular mechanisms underlying cell-environmental modulation of ESC fate decisions are incompletely understood. Since adhesion molecules (AM) influence proliferation and differentiation in developing and adult tissues, we hypothesized that specific AM interactions influence ESC commitment toward hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Expression of AM in the adherens, tight and gap junction pathways in ESC subpopulations were quantified. E-cadherin (E-cad), Claudin-4 (Cldn4), Connexin-43 (Cx43), Zona Occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Zona Occludens-2 (ZO-2) transcript levels were differentially expressed during early stages of hematopoietic/endothelial commitment. Stable ESC lines were generated with reduced expression of E-cad, Cldn4, Cx43, ZO-1 and ZO-2 using shRNA technology. Functional and phenotypic consequences of modulating AM expression were assessed using hematopoietic colony forming assays, endothelial sprouting assays and surface protein expression. A decrease in E-cad, Cldn4, Cx43 and ZO-1 expression was associated with less commitment to the hematopoietic lineage and increased endothelial differentiation as evidenced by functional and phenotypic analysis. A reduction in ZO-2 expression did not influence endothelial differentiation, but decreased hematopoietic commitment two-fold. These data indicate that a subset of AM influence ESC decisions to commit to endothelial and hematopoietic lineages. Furthermore, differentially expressed AM may provide novel markers to delineate early stages of ESC commitment to hematopoietic/endothelial lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2075416531,"The pan-protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor sotrastaurin (AEB071) is a novel immunosuppressant currently in phase II trials for immunosuppression after solid organ transplantation. Besides T-cell activation, PKC affects numerous cellular processes that are potentially important for the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), major blood-borne pathogens prevalent in solid organ transplant recipients. This study uses state of the art virological assays to assess the direct, non-immune mediated effects of sotrastaurin on HBV and HCV. Most importantly, sotrastaurin had no pro-viral effect on either HBV or HCV. In the presence of high concentrations of sotrastaurin, well above those used clinically and close to levels where cytotoxic effects become detectable, there was a reduction of HCV and HBV replication. This reduction is very likely due to cytotoxic and/or anti-proliferative effects rather than direct anti-viral activity of the drug. Replication cycle stages other than genome replication such as viral cell entry and spread of HCV infection directly between adjacent cells was clearly unaffected by sotrastaurin. These data support the evaluation of sotrastaurin in HBV and/or HCV infected transplant recipients."

Thrombin activation of FV liberates the B domain and generates a Ca2+-stabilized heterodimer with a heavy chain (A1-A2) and light chain (A3-C1-C2). Thrombin-catalyzed FV activation is facilitated by exosite I and II interactions, resulting in a kinetically preferred order of cleavage where exosite I-mediated Arg709 is first, followed closely by Arg1018, and exosite I and II-mediated cleavage at Arg1545 is last (10Mann K.G.

Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The single cleavage at Arg1545 by the Russell viper venom FV-activating proteinase (RVV-V) is sufficient for generation of FVa cofactor activity (15Kane W.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

The most toxic snake venom in the world belongs to Australian snakes from the Elapidae family (17Broad A.J. Sutherland S.K. Coulter A.R. Toxicon. 1979; 17: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A member of this family is Notechis scutatus, which has a group D ProT activator in its venom called notecarin D (NotD) that is homologous to FXa (18Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. van Rijn J.L. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rao V.S. Joseph J.S. Kini R.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 635-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jobin F. Esnouf M.P. Nature. 1966; 211: 873-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NotD is a ∼47-kDa protein, and like FXa, contains a heavy chain serine proteinase domain, a light chain consisting of two epidermal growth factor-like domains and a Gla domain with 11 γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues. NotD cleaves bovine ProT at Arg274 and Arg323 through a meizothrombin intermediate in the presence of FVa and phospholipid vesicles (18Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. van Rijn J.L. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rao V.S. Joseph J.S. Kini R.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 635-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21St Pierre L. Masci P.P. Filippovich I. Sorokina N. Marsh N. Miller D.J. Lavin M.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 1853-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Like FXa, NotD is capable of cleaving ProT in the absence of FVa, which proceeds through a predominantly prethrombin-2·fragment 1.2 pathway (18Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. van Rijn J.L. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, venom-derived NotD was examined to determine the functional properties that underlie its potent procoagulant, FXa-like activity. The results demonstrate for the first time that NotD binds with very high affinity to FV and FVa in the absence of phospholipid vesicles. NotD binds to the FXa site expressed on activation of FV to FVa with a ∼80-fold higher affinity than FXa. NotD binds FV in the absence and presence of membranes with lower affinity than FVa, but still binds significantly tighter than FXa. The NotD·FVa complex activates ProT in the absence and presence of phospholipid vesicles with reduced catalytic efficiency compared with prothrombinase. NotD lacks the membrane dependence of FXa for binding to FV and FVa and, presumably without this constraint, gains unregulated control of blood coagulation during N. scutatus envenomation. Large and small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (LUVs and SUVs) were prepared with minor modifications of the published method (22Higgins D.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6503-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles were prepared with either synthetic 60% (w/w) 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 20% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine, and 20% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-ethanolamine (PC/PS/PE containing synthetic dioleoyl lipids) or 75% (w/w) hen egg l-α-phosphatidylcholine and 25% porcine brain l-α-phosphatidylserine (PC/PS vesicles containing natural lipids) (Avanti Polar Lipids) and were mixed and dried under a stream of N2 and lyophilized for ∼15 h. To prepare LUVs, the lipids were dispersed in 50 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and extruded through two back-to-back 0.4-μm filters. The vesicles were centrifuged (Beckman TL-100 or Optima MAX-XP) at 93,000 × g for 45 min and the top 70% of the mixture was used as LUVs. SUVs were prepared similarly, except the reconstituted lipid mixture was extruded through two back-to-back 0.4-μm filters followed by two back-to-back 0.1-μm filters. The lipids were sonicated (Branson Sonifier 250) continuously in an ice bath for 1 h at 30% duty cycle and 3-output control under a stream of N2. The vesicles were centrifuged initially at ∼130,000 × g for 30 min, followed by ∼206,000 × g for 4 h, and the top 20% of the mixture was used as SUVs. LUVs and SUVs were stored at 4 and 22 °C, respectively. The concentration of vesicles was determined by Stewart assay (23Stewart J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering measurements on representative lipid preparations gave diameters of 500 ± 300 Å for SUVs and 2000 ± 580 Å for LUVs, similar to previously published values (24Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human ProT, α-thrombin, and FXa were purified as described earlier (26Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). NotD was purified from lyophilized venom of N. scutatus (Latoxan). All chromatography matrices were regenerated in 0.1 m NaOH, 2.0 m NaCl, followed by buffer, and treated with 1 μm d-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl (FFR-CH2Cl), 1 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (FPR-CH2Cl), and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in their respective buffers prior to purification to prevent NotD degradation. Venom (250 mg) was reconstituted in 50 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 6.0, dialyzed against the same buffer for ∼15 h to remove excess salts, and chromatographed on a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) in the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a 50-ml gradient from 0.15 to 0.8 m NaCl. The activity of the fractions was determined by measuring the initial rate of 200 μm CH3SO2-d-Leu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (CH3SO2-LGR-pNA; Diagnostica Stago) hydrolysis at 405 nm and 25 °C using a microtiter plate reader. Fractions were pooled based on activity and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1.5 m. The pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration to <2.5 ml with a YM10 membrane and loaded onto a Sephacryl-200 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column (2.5 cm x 39 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, 1.5 m NaCl, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4. Fractions were pooled and 10% (v/v) 1 m MES, pH 6.0, was added before concentrating to <2.5 ml by ultrafiltration using a YM10 membrane. The protein was desalted using a Superdex 200 (10/300; GE Healthcare) FPLC column equilibrated with 5 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, snap-frozen in liquid N2 in PEG 20,000-coated tubes, and stored at −80 °C. The purity of the protein was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of NotD was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm, using a calculated and validated (28Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar) absorption coefficient of 1.10 mg·ml−1 cm−1 and molecular mass of 46,805 Da calculated from the amino acid sequence. A ratio of active sites to NotD protein concentration of 0.97 was determined by active site titration with p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (29Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells expressing ProTR271Q were a gift from Dr. Sriram Krishnaswamy (University of Pennsylvania). ProTR271Q was purified by a modified method based on the published procedure (24Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in a 10-story cell factory (Nunc) pretreated with poly-d-lysine. Two liters of expression medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 without phenol red containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 10 μg/ml of vitamin K, and 5 μg/ml of insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite supplement) were collected daily and frozen at −80 °C until 20 liters was obtained. The thawed media was centrifuged at 4,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, applied to a Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column (5 cm × 13 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the ProTR271Q was eluted with a 3-liter gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Na3 citrate was added at 0.425 g/100 ml of pooled protein, stirred on ice for 30 min at 4 °C, and precipitated with 1 m BaCl2 (80 ml/liter of pooled protein) over 20 min. The precipitate was centrifuged at 12,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, dissolved in 20 ml of 0.5 m EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, pH 8.0, and dialyzed ∼15 h at 4 °C against 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Recovered ProTR271Q was chromatographed on a 6-ml Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and eluted with a 120-ml gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Pooled protein was dialyzed ∼15 h at 4 °C against 1 mm NaPi, pH 6.8. ProTR271Q was loaded onto a 5-ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with dialysis buffer and eluted with a 50-ml gradient from 1 to 500 mm NaPi. The pooled protein was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 5 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. The final protein was concentrated and stored at −80 °C. FV was purified from human plasma (30Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and activated to FVa by addition of 100 nm thrombin to 12 μm FV and incubation at 37 °C for 40 min. Thrombin was inactivated with 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl and excess inhibitor was removed by dialysis. The concentration of FV and FVa was determined from the 280-nm absorbance using the 330,000 Da molecular mass and the published absorption coefficient of 0.89 mg ml−1 cm−1 (15Kane W.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1002-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for FV. An absorption coefficient for the mixture of thrombin-generated activation products (FVa) was determined. The 280-nm absorbance of 0.7 μm FV in 50 mm HEPES, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml of PEG 8000, pH 7.4 (Buffer A), was measured before and after full activation by 100 nm thrombin at 37 °C for 1 h, and the ratio (0.88) was applied to the absorption coefficient of FV to obtain 0.78 mg ml−1 cm−1 for FVa (the mixture of the two-subunit form of FVa and other activation products). Terminal activation products of FV, the two-subunit form of FVa (FVa-h·FVa-l), FVa heavy chain (FVa-h), FVa light chain (FVa-l), B710–1018, and B1019–1545 were isolated as described (31Dharmawardana K.R. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18635-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nα-[(Acetylthio)acetyl]-FFR-CH2Cl (ATA-FFR-CH2Cl) and Nα-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-Glu-Gly-Arg-CH2Cl (ATA-EGR-CH2Cl) were prepared as described (26Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bock P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 478-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). NotD active site-labeled with 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein ([5F]FFR-NotD) was prepared by inactivation of 18 μm NotD with 360 μm ATA-FFR-CH2Cl in 0.1 m 2,2′-(1,3-diyldiimino)bis[2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol]propane, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml of PEG 8000, pH 7.0, at 25 °C for 3 h, until the initial rate of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis was <0.01% of the initial activity. The free thiol group on the incorporated inhibitor was generated by addition of 1 m NH2OH in 0.1 m 2,2′-(1,3-diyldiimino)bis[2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol]propane, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0, to a 0.1 m final concentration and labeled with 600 μm 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein in the same buffer. Excess inhibitor and probe were removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography and final dialysis against 50 mm HEPES, 110 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml of PEG 8000, pH 7.4. Preparations of [5F]FFR-NotD contained 0.8 mol of 5F/mol of NotD, measured as previously described (26Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Kroh H.K. Briggs J. Tans G. Bode W. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Labeling of FXa ([OG]EGR-FXa) was achieved by inactivation with ATA-EGR-CH2Cl and labeling of the NH2OH generated a free thiol group with Oregon Green 488-maleimide (OG) following procedures as described earlier (34Nicolaes G.A. Bock P.E. Segers K. Wildhagen K.C. Dahlbäck B. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22890-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Probe incorporation was 0.92 mol of OG/mol of FXa. Active site-blocked NotD (FFR-NotD) was prepared by incubating 18 μm NotD with 360 μm FFR-CH2Cl for ∼15 h at 25 °C in Buffer A. Inactivation (<0.1% active) was confirmed from the initial rate of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis, and excess inhibitor was removed by extensive dialysis against Buffer A. Initial rates of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis by NotD at 405 nm were obtained by incubating 5 nm NotD in Buffer A with various concentrations of FV/FVa terminal activation products for 1–2 min and initiating the assays with 200 μm CH3SO2-LGR-pNA. Assays were performed at 25 °C in polystyrene cuvettes coated with PEG 20,000. The fractional increase in the initial rates of substrate hydrolysis by NotD, (vobs − vo)/vo, as a function of the total FVa or FVa-h·FVa-l concentration was analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting of the quadratic binding equation to obtain the initial velocity (vo), maximum velocity (vmax), stoichiometric factor (n), and apparent dissociation constant (KD(app)). Effects of FV and the other FVa terminal activation products were fit by linear least squares. FV (500 nm) was activated with 0.2 nm thrombin in Buffer A in the absence and presence of 10 μm thrombin exosite I DNA aptamer (GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG; Integrated DNA Technologies), 100 nm thrombin exosite II DNA aptamer (AGTCCGTGGTAGGGCAGGTTGGGGTGACT, or 10 μm Hir54–65(SO3−) at 37 °C. Aliquots from the FV/FVa reaction mixtures were removed at various time points and the initial rates of 200 μm CH3SO2-LGR-pNA hydrolysis by 6 nm NotD were measured in Buffer A containing 1 mg/ml of BSA at 25 °C. The fractional increase in initial rates, (vobs − vo)/vo, was converted to the FVa concentration using the linear portion of a reference titration obtained by titrating 5 nm NotD with FVa in Buffer A plus BSA. FVa concentrations were obtained by interpolation of the data fit by the quadratic binding equation. FVa used in the reference titration was generated by activating the same preparation of FV (500 nm) with thrombin (1 nm) for 45 min at 37 °C and quenching with 25 units/ml of hirudin (Sigma). FV activation by thrombin in the absence of inhibitors was analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting of a single exponential and results in the presence of inhibitors were fit by linear least squares. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed with a QuantaMaster 30 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) at 25 °C using acrylic cuvettes coated with PEG 20,000. Titrations were performed in Buffer A with 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl added to prevent proteolysis. Anisotropy measurements were corrected for associated total intensity changes using a rearranged form of the equation described by Lakowicz (35Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006Crossref Scopus (18179) Google Scholar) (Equation 1) to give the final anisotropy measurements (robs). robs=ro(1-A)+AFmaxFormax(1-A)+AFmaxFo(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, robs is the intensity corrected anisotropy, A is fractional saturation ([PL]/n[P]o) of n equivalent and independent sites on the probe-labeled protein (P) by an unlabeled ligand (L) obtained from fitting the quadratic binding equation to the data, Fmax/Fo is the ratio of the maximum fluorescence intensity at saturation to the initial intensity (Fo) of the probe protein alone. Before fitting Equation 1, the quadratic binding equation was fit to the intensity titration expressed as (Fobs − Fo)/Fo = ΔFobs/Fo, where ΔFmax/Fo obtained from the fit is (Fmax/Fo) − 1. [5F]FFR-NotD was titrated with FV or FVa in the presence or absence of 50 μm PC/PS SUVs with excitation at 500 nm and emission at 521 nm and band passes ranging from 4 to 10 nm depending on [5F]FFR-NotD concentration. Measurements of robs and total intensity as a function of total FV or FVa concentrations were analyzed by the quadratic binding equation (36Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to obtain the dissociation constant (KD ligand), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax/Fo), stoichiometric factor (n), initial (ro), and maximal (rmax) anisotropies, and the change in anisotropy (Δr = rmax − ro). [OG]EGR-FXa (10 nm) was titrated with FV in the presence of 350 μm PC/PS/PE SUVs. Changes in anisotropy were measured with 488 nm excitation and 520 nm emission with 4- and 8-nm band passes, respectively. Data were analyzed as described above. Competitive binding of [5F]FFR-NotD and active NotD to FVa was performed by titrating [5F]FFR-NotD (9 nm) with FVa in the absence and presence of two fixed concentrations of native NotD (9 and 102 nm). The three curves were analyzed simultaneously by nonlinear least squares fitting of the cubic equation (36Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) for tight competitive binding to obtain the dissociation constant for FVa binding to [5F]FFR-NotD (KD ligand) and for FVa binding to native NotD (KD competitor), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax/Fo), initial (ro) and maximal (rmax) anisotropies, the change in anisotropy (Δr = rmax − ro) and stoichiometry (m) for active NotD binding to FVa. To determine the effect of NotD on binding of FXa to FVa in the presence of SUVs (50 μm PC/PS), [OG]EGR-FXa (1 nm) was titrated with FVa in the absence and presence of two different concentrations of active site-blocked FFR-NotD (1.1 and 4.4 nm). Changes in anisotropy were measured and analyzed as described above. The solution of the cubic equation for tight competitive binding also yields A = [PL]/n[P]o (36Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), allowing Equation 1 to be applied to correct anisotropy data for fluorescence intensity changes. Nonlinear least squares fitting was performed in SCIENTIST (MicroMath) and error estimates represent the 95% confidence interval. Initial rates of native ProT or ProTR271Q activation by NotD or FXa with FVa in the presence or absence of PC/PS LUVs were expressed as the concentration of thrombin or meizothrombin, respectively, formed with time, determined from the initial rates of hydrolysis of 100 or 200 μm d-Phe-l-pipecolyl-l-Arg-pNA (FPR-pNA) measured at 405 nm. All rates of substrate hydrolysis experiments were normalized to a 1-cm path length by a correction factor of 1.46 for reaction volumes of 300 μl. Initial reference rates were measured for hydrolysis of 100 μm FPR-pNA by 1 nm thrombin or 200 μm FPR-pNA by 1 nm ecarin-generated meizothrombin from ProTR271Q. Reaction mixtures containing FVa (20 nm), ProT (0–1 μm), and 30 μm PC/PS LUVs in Buffer A were equilibrated at 25 °C for 10 min before initiation by addition of FXa (1 pm) or NotD (8.5 pm). Reactions with FXa contained 2 mg/ml of BSA, and reactions with NotD did not. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 10:1 (v/v) Buffer A and 50 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml of PEG 8000, 125 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor (type IIS; Sigma), pH 8.2 (Buffer B), and the assays were initiated by addition of substrate. Rates of substrate hydrolysis were measured in triplicate in PEG 20,000-coated microtiter plates in a microtiter plate reader and converted to thrombin or meizothrombin formed with time using the reference rates described above. Reactions in the absence of LUVs were performed similarly with 50 pm NotD and quenched with Buffer B containing 500 mm EDTA. To determine KD(app) for FVa binding in either the prothrombinase or NotD·FVa complexes, conditions were as described, except that reaction mixtures containing FVa (0–2 nm), PC/PS LUVs (30 μm), and ProTR271Q (1 μm) in Buffer A were equilibrated at 25 °C for 10 min before initiation by addition of 10 pm FXa or NotD. Quenching was done with Buffer B containing 300 mm EDTA and 2.5 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Reactions in the absence of LUVs were performed as described above using FVa (0–20 nm) and ProTR271Q (1 μm). The effect of FFR-NotD on thrombin generation in normal human plasma was measured by calibrated automated thrombography at 37 °C (37Hemker H.C. Giesen P. Al Dieri R. Regnault V. de Smedt E.

https://openalex.org/W2004151082,"Sigma factors, the specificity subunits of RNA polymerase, are involved in interactions with promoter DNA, the core subunits of RNA polymerase, and transcription factors. The bacteriophage T4-encoded activator, MotA, is one such factor, which engages the C terminus of the Escherichia coli housekeeping sigma factor, σ(70). MotA functions in concert with a phage-encoded co-activator, AsiA, as a molecular switch. This process, termed sigma appropriation, inhibits host transcription while activating transcription from a class of phage promoters. Previous work has demonstrated that MotA contacts the C terminus of σ(70), H5, a region that is normally bound within RNA polymerase by its interaction with the β-flap tip. To identify the specific σ(70) residues responsible for interacting with MotA and the β-flap tip, we generated single substitutions throughout the C terminus of σ(70). We find that MotA targets H5 residues that are normally engaged by the β-flap. In two-hybrid assays, the interaction of σ(70) with either the β-flap tip or MotA is impaired by alanine substitutions at residues Leu-607, Arg-608, Phe-610, Leu-611, and Asp-613. Transcription assays identify Phe-610 and Leu-611 as the key residues for MotA/AsiA-dependent transcription. Phe-610 is a crucial residue in the H5/β-flap tip interaction using promoter clearance assays with RNA polymerase alone. Our results show how the actions of small transcriptional factors on a defined local region of RNA polymerase can fundamentally change the specificity of polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2063952098,"Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases, which can be acquired, sporadic or genetic, the latter being linked to mutations in the gene encoding prion protein. We have recently described the importance of subdomain separation in the conversion of prion protein (PrP). The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of increasing the hydrophobic interactions within the H2-H3 subdomain on PrP conversion. Three hydrophobic mutations were introduced into PrP. The mutation V209I associated with human prion disease did not alter protein stability or in vitro fibrillization propensity of PrP. The designed mutations V175I and T187I on the other hand increased protein thermal stability. V175I mutant fibrillized faster than wild-type PrP. Conversion delay of T187I was slightly longer, but fluorescence intensity of amyloid specific dye thioflavin T was significantly higher. Surprisingly, cells expressing V209I variant exhibited inefficient proteinase K resistant PrP formation upon infection with 22L strain, which is in contrast to cell lines expressing wild-type, V175I and T187I mPrPs. In agreement with increased ThT fluorescence at the plateau T187I expressing cell lines accumulated an increased amount of the proteinase K-resistant prion protein. We showed that T187I induces formation of thin fibrils, which are absent from other samples. We propose that larger solvent accessibility of I187 in comparison to wild-type and other mutants may interfere with lateral annealing of filaments and may be the underlying reason for increased conversion efficiency."

Recently, TGA has been reported to impair several organs, especially reproductive ones such as testes and ovaries. The reproductive toxicity of TGA on females has become an issue that cannot be neglected. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present work, superovulated female mice were percutaneously treated with different doses of TGA (37.81, 75.62, and 151.25 mg/kg). The mice were sacrificed to collect ovulated oocytes, whose numbers were counted and compared. Immunofluorescence-stained oocytes were observed under a confocal microscope to investigate the effects of TGA on spindle morphology, distribution of cortical granules (CGs), and parthenogenetic activation. The number of ovulated oocytes was decreased by TGA. The ovulated oocytes in the 151.25 mg/kg TGA group were significantly less than in the control and in the 37.81 mg/kg TGA groups. The ovulated oocytes in the 75.62 mg/kg TGA group were less than in the 37.81 mg/kg dose group. Abnormal spindle configuration in vivo was also induced by TGA. The spindle areas in the 75.62 and 151.25 mg/kg TGA groups were significantly larger than in the control and 37.81 mg/kg TGA groups. The parthenogenetic activation of ovulated oocytes in vitro was inhibited as well. The percentage of activated oocytes in the 75.62 and 151.25 mg/kg TGA groups was significantly lower than in the control and 37.81 mg/kg TGA groups. The percentage in the 151.25 mg/kg TGA group was also less than in the 75.62 mg/kg group. CG distribution was not affected by TGA. Conclusion Mice were percutaneously treated with TGA. Consequently, the number of ovulated oocytes decreased, abnormal spindle configurations were induced, and the parthenogenetic activation of ovulated oocytes was inhibited. CG distribution was not affected."

The model comprises of a six parameter distribution that was applied to the USA suicide rates by age for the years 2001 and 2002. Posteriorly, linear extrapolations are performed of the parameter values previously obtained for these years in order to estimate the values corresponding to the year 2003. The calculated distributions agreed reasonably well with the aggregate data. The model was also used to determine the age above which suicide rates become statistically observable in USA, Brazil and Sri Lanka.The Threshold Bias Model has considerable potential applications in demographic studies of suicide. Moreover, since the model can be used to predict the evolution of suicide rates based on information extracted from past data, it will be of great interest to suicidologists and other researchers in the field of mental health."
