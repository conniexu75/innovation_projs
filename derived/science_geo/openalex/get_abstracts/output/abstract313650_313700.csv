It was readily translocated, had a long residual action, was relatively nonphytotoxic, and did not appear to affect adversely root, vegetative, or reproductive development."

https://openalex.org/W1968585569,Petrofabric examination of salt crystals in Grand Saline salt dome reveals a preferred orientation that may bear significantly on other physical properties and on the genesis of salt domes. The symmetry of the orientation patterns indicates that translation gliding in halite may occur predominantly on cubic glide planes.

The percentage of sterile eggs laid by females in cages containing normal and chemosterilized males was as high as, or higher than, would be expected from the ratio of sterile males present."

https://openalex.org/W1610529644,"In conclusion, I believe it fair to say that the marriage of ultrasonics and magnetic resonance holds promise of being a productive one. In the application of these disciplines to nuclear spins, little more has been done than to demonstrate the acoustic techniques and to apply them to a particular problem of quadrupolar coupling in the heavy alkali halides. Particularly promising is the extension of acoustic NMR techniques to bulk metals, to ferromagnetic crystals, and to the study of spin-lattice relaxation as a function of temperature. In the technique of phonon coupling to electron spins in paramagnetic materials, also, the reports to date have all been of a preliminary nature. Used in combination with the powerful new hypersonic technique of generating microwave acoustic waves, electron spin-phonon interaction measurements may help to resolve some of the present confusion regarding the mechanisms of spin-lattice relaxation in paramagnetic solids (29)."

https://openalex.org/W2060957431,"Glauconitic, quartzose sands previously modified on the continental shelf from feldspathic glacial detritus were transported through submarine canyons onto the Hudson deep-sea fan, the Hatteras abyssal plain, and the western and central Sohm abyssal plain. These feldspar-poor, quartzose sands contrast with highly feldspathic sands derived directly from a glacial source and probably transported through the Newfoundland abyssal gap onto the eastern and southern Sohm abyssal plain."

https://openalex.org/W2057756047,Aluminum phosphate in the soil can be more discretely separated from iron phosphate by extracting 1 gram of soil with 50 milliliters of neutral 0.5N ammonium fluoride solution for 1 hour than by extracting with alkaline solution for a longer period of time.
