https://openalex.org/W2895353742,"Understanding brain-wide neuronal dynamics requires a detailed map of the underlying circuit architecture. We built an interactive cellular-resolution atlas of the zebrafish brain at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) based on the reconstructions of over 2,000 individually GFP-labeled neurons. We clustered our dataset in ""morphotypes,"" establishing a unique database of quantitatively described neuronal morphologies together with their spatial coordinates in vivo. Over 100 transgene expression patterns were imaged separately and co-registered with the single-neuron atlas. By annotating 72 non-overlapping brain regions, we generated from our dataset an inter-areal wiring diagram of the larval brain, which serves as ground truth for synapse-scale, electron microscopic reconstructions. Interrogating our atlas by ""virtual tract tracing"" has already revealed previously unknown wiring principles in the tectum and the cerebellum. In conclusion, we present here an evolving computational resource and visualization tool, which will be essential to map function to structure in a vertebrate brain. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

https://openalex.org/W2947172335,"Racing to fertilization Pollen tubes, which carry plant sperm, need to grow from where they land in the flower to where the ovule is. Zhong et al. now show how pollen from related plant species race to reach the ovule first. One set of fast-evolving peptide signals is tuned to speed up growth of conspecific pollen tubes. A related set of evolutionarily ancient peptides is tuned to attract all pollen tubes. Thus, fertilization is more likely to happen through conspecific pollen tubes, but a fail-safe system encourages even the laggards to get where they need to go. Science , this issue p. eaau9564"
https://openalex.org/W2948019632,"Many studies have explored the relationship between housing prices and environmental characteristics using the hedonic price model (HPM). However, few studies have deeply examined the impact of scene perception near residential units on housing prices. This article used house purchasing records from FANG.com and open access geolocation data (including massive street view pictures, point of interest (POI) data and road network data) and proposed a framework named “open-access-dataset-based hedonic price modeling (OADB-HPM)” for comprehensive analysis in Beijing and Shanghai, China. A state-of-the-art deep learning framework and massive Baidu street view panoramas were employed to visualize and quantify three major scene perception characteristics (greenery, sky and building view indexes, abbreviated GVI, SVI and BVI, respectively) at the street level. Then, the newly introduced scene perception characteristics were combined with other traditional characteristics in the HPM to calculate marginal prices, and the results for Beijing and Shanghai were explored and compared. The empirical results showed that the greenery and sky perceptual elements at the property level can significantly increase the housing price in Beijing (RMB 39,377 and 6011, respectively) and Shanghai (RMB 21,689 and 2763, respectively), indicating an objectively higher willingness by buyers to pay for houses that provide the ability to perceive natural elements in the surrounding environment. This study developed quantification tools to help decision makers and planners understand and analyze the interaction between residents and urban scene components."
https://openalex.org/W2946859016,"Animals use global image motion cues to actively stabilize their position by compensatory movements. Neurons in the zebrafish pretectum distinguish different optic flow patterns, e.g., rotation and translation, to drive appropriate behaviors. Combining functional imaging and morphological reconstruction of single cells, we revealed critical neuroanatomical features of this sensorimotor transformation. Terminals of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DS-RGCs) are located within the pretectal retinal arborization field 5 (AF5), where they meet dendrites of pretectal neurons with simple tuning to monocular optic flow. Translation-selective neurons, which respond selectively to optic flow in the same direction for both eyes, are intermingled with these simple cells but do not receive inputs from DS-RGCs. Mutually exclusive populations of pretectal projection neurons innervate either the reticular formation or the cerebellum, which in turn control motor responses. We posit that local computations in a defined pretectal circuit transform optic flow signals into neural commands driving optomotor behavior. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2951021924,"Stone fish is an under-utilized sea cucumber with many health benefits. Hydrolysates with strong ACE-inhibitory effects were generated from stone fish protein under the optimum conditions of hydrolysis using bromelain and fractionated based on hydrophobicity and isoelectric properties of the constituent peptides. Five novel peptide sequences with molecular weight (mw) < 1000 daltons (Da) were identified using LC-MS/MS. The peptides including Ala-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Phe-Tyr (794.44 Da), Lys-Val-Pro-Pro-Lys-Ala (638.88 Da), Leu-Ala-Pro-Pro-Thr-Met (628.85 Da), Glu-Val-Leu-Ile-Gln (600.77 Da) and Glu-His-Pro-Val-Leu (593.74 Da) were evaluated for ACE-inhibitory activity and showed IC50 values of 0.012 mM, 0.980 mM, 1.310 mM, 1.440 mM and 1.680 mM, respectively. The ACE-inhibitory effects of the peptides were further verified using molecular docking study. The docking results demonstrated that the peptides exhibit their effect mainly via hydrogen and electrostatic bond interactions with ACE. These findings provide evidence about stone fish as a valuable source of raw materials for the manufacture of antihypertensive peptides that can be incorporated to enhance therapeutic relevance and commercial significance of formulated functional foods."
https://openalex.org/W2947090542,"Delayed cognitive decline commonly occurs following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain obscure. We therefore investigated the potential mechanisms responsible for impaired cognitive function in a mouse collagenase model of ICH. Following recovery of motor and sensory deficits in the chronic phase of ICH, we noted significant cognitive impairment, which was assessed by the Morris water maze. This finding was accompanied by reduced dendrite spine density of ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 neurons. Reduced synaptic plasticity, manifested by impaired long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, was also evident in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, suggesting that ICH also induces functional alterations in distal brain regions remote from the site of injury. In addition, the accumulation of microglia, infiltration of peripheral immune cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species were observed in both contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres up to 5 wk post-ICH. Furthermore, depletion of microglia using PLX3397, which inhibits colony stimulating factor 1 receptor, ameliorated this delayed cognitive impairment. Collectively, these results suggest that persistent and diffuse brain inflammation may contribute to cognitive impairment in the chronic stage of ICH recovery.-Shi, E., Shi, K., Qiu, S., Sheth, K.

https://openalex.org/W2947455606,"Ionizing radiation (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose irradiation increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from radiation-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell-like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin-induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose irradiation, and c-MYC inhibitors could be countermeasures for humans at risk of developing GIS."

https://openalex.org/W2947965727,"Aquaponics (AP) is a semi-closed system of food production that combines aquaculture and hydroponics and represents a new agricultural system integrating producers and consumers. The aim of this study was to test the effect of stocking densities (APL, 2.5 kg m-3; APH, 4.6 kg m-3) on water quality, growth performance of the European Carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), and yield of leafy vegetables (catalogna, lettuce, and Swiss Chard) in a low-technology AP pilot system compared to a hydroponic cultivation. The AP daily consumption of water due to evapotranspiration was not different among treatments with an average value of 8.2 L d-1, equal to 1.37% of the total water content of the system. Dissolved oxygen was significantly (p < 0.05) different among treatments with the lowest median value recorded with the highest stocking density of fish (5.6 mg L-1) and the highest median value in the hydroponic control (8.7 mg L-1). Marketable yield of the vegetables was significantly different among treatments with the highest production in the hydroponic control for catalogna (1.2 kg m-2) and in the APL treatment for Swiss Chard (5.3 kg m-2). The yield of lettuce did not differ significantly between hydroponic control and APL system (4.0 kg m-2 on average). The lowest production of vegetables was obtained in the APH system. The final weight (515 g vs. 413 g for APL and APH, respectively), specific growth rate (0.79% d-1 vs. 0.68% d-1), and feed conversion (1.55 vs. 1.86) of European Carp decreased when stocking density increased, whereas total yield of biomass was higher in the APH system (4.45 kg m-3 vs. 6.88 kg m-3). A low mortality (3% on average) was observed in both AP treatments. Overall, the results showed that a low initial stocking density at 2.5 kg m-3 improved the production of European Carp and of leafy vegetables by maintaining a better water quality in the tested AP system."
https://openalex.org/W2947067342,"Background Dynamic HIV transmission models can provide evidence-based guidance on optimal combination implementation strategies to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. However, these models can be extremely data intensive, and the availability of good-quality data characterizing regional microepidemics varies substantially within and across countries. We aim to provide a comprehensive and transparent description of an evidence synthesis process and reporting framework employed to populate and calibrate a dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model for six US cities. Methods We executed a mixed-method evidence synthesis strategy to populate model parameters in six categories: (i) initial HIV-negative and HIV-infected populations; (ii) parameters used to calculate the probability of HIV transmission; (iii) screening, diagnosis, treatment and HIV disease progression; (iv) HIV prevention programs; (v) the costs of medical care; and (vi) health utility weights for each stage of HIV disease progression. We identified parameters that required city-specific data and stratification by gender, risk group and race/ethnicity a priori and sought out databases for primary analysis to augment our evidence synthesis. We ranked the quality of each parameter using context- and domain-specific criteria and verified sources and assumptions with our scientific advisory committee. Findings To inform the 1,667 parameters needed to populate our model, we synthesized evidence from 59 peer-reviewed publications and 24 public health and surveillance reports and executed primary analyses using 11 data sets. Of these 1,667 parameters, 1,517 (91%) were city-specific and 150 (9%) were common for all cities. Notably, 1,074 (64%), 201 (12%) and 312 (19%) parameters corresponded to categories (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively. Parameters ranked as best- to moderate-quality evidence comprised 39% of the common parameters and ranged from 56%-60% across cities for the city-specific parameters. We identified variation in parameter values across cities as well as within cities across risk and race/ethnic groups. Conclusions Better integration of modelling in decision making can be achieved by systematically reporting on the evidence synthesis process that is used to populate models, and by explicitly assessing the quality of data entered into the model. The effective communication of this process can help prioritize data collection of the most informative components of local HIV prevention and care services in order to reduce decision uncertainty and strengthen model conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2947865249,"Exocytosis mediates the release of neurotransmitters and hormones from neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Tandem C2 domain proteins in the synaptotagmin (syt) and double C2 domain (Doc2) families regulate exocytotic membrane fusion via direct interactions with Ca2+ and phospholipid bilayers. Syt1 is a fast-acting, low-affinity Ca2+ sensor that penetrates membranes upon binding Ca2+ to trigger synchronous vesicle fusion. The closely related Doc2β is a slow-acting, high-affinity Ca2+ sensor that triggers spontaneous and asynchronous vesicle fusion, but whether it also penetrates membranes is unknown. Both syt1 and Doc2β bind the dynamically regulated plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), but it is unclear whether PIP2 serves only as a membrane contact or enables specialized membrane-binding modes by these Ca2+ sensors. Furthermore, it has been shown that PIP2 uncaging can trigger rapid, syt1-dependent exocytosis in the absence of Ca2+ influx, suggesting that current models for the action of these Ca2+ sensors are incomplete. Here, using a series of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements, we show that Doc2β, like syt1, penetrates membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, we observed that PIP2 can drive membrane penetration by both syt1 and Doc2β in the absence of Ca2+, providing a plausible mechanism for Ca2+-independent, PIP2-dependent exocytosis. Quantitative measurements of penetration depth revealed that, in the presence of Ca2+, PIP2 drives Doc2β, but not syt1, substantially deeper into the membrane, defining a biophysical regulatory mechanism specific to this high-affinity Ca2+ sensor.

Thus, although both syt1 and Doc2β are Ca2+ sensors for exocytosis, their divergent functional paradigms invite a closer comparison to establish common mechanistic principles for Ca2+-sensitive tandem C2 domain proteins. For example, although syt1 must penetrate membranes to stimulate membrane fusion, it has not been established whether—and if so, how—Doc2β penetrates membranes.

Because depletion of PIP2 substantially reduces spontaneous neurotransmitter release in cultured neurons (28Di Paolo G. Moskowitz H.S. Gipson K. Wenk M.R. Voronov S. Obayashi M. Flavell R. Fitzsimonds R.M. Ryan T.A. De Camilli P. Impaired PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis in nerve terminals produces defects in synaptic vesicle trafficking.Nature. 2004; 431 (15386003): 415-42210.1038/nature02896Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), this form of neurotransmission may depend on PIP2 binding by Doc2β, but this interaction has not been studied in detail. According to current models of tandem C2 domain protein function, Ca2+ is required for membrane penetration and thus the triggering of exocytosis. However, recent findings have challenged this model by demonstrating that rapid uncaging of PIP2 can trigger syt1-dependent exocytosis without a measurable change in [Ca2+]i (36Walter A.M. Müller R. Tawfik B. Wierda K.D. Pinheiro P.S. Nadler A. McCarthy A.W. Ziomkiewicz I. Kruse M. Reither G. Rettig J. Lehmann M. Haucke V. Hille B. Schultz C. et al.PIP2 optical uncaging potentiates exocytosis.Elife. 2017; 6 (29068313): e3020310.7554/eLife.30203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given the apparent requirement of Ca2+ for membrane penetration by syt1, how could a stepwise increase in available PIP2 evoke exocytosis? In the present study, we first demonstrate that, like syt1, Doc2β penetrates lipid bilayers upon binding Ca2+. We report the unexpected finding that, in membranes containing PS, PIP2 drives Ca2+-independent membrane penetration by both syt1 and Doc2β. This interaction stimulates Ca2+-independent fusion mediated by syt1 in vitro. Moreover, in the presence of Ca2+, PIP2 significantly increases the membrane penetration depth of Doc2β but not syt1, thus providing a mechanism by which PIP2 may selectively drive spontaneous release. Our results define key biophysical differences between syt1 and Doc2β and provide a potential molecular mechanism by which PIP2 can directly trigger exocytosis in the absence of increases in [Ca2+]i. We first sought to determine whether the tandem C2 domains of Doc2β share key biochemical properties with syt1 (Fig. 1A). We thus purified the tandem C2 domains (“C2AB”) of both proteins and used a series of assays to define their Ca2+-dependent and -independent interactions with lipid bilayers. To assess whether the Ca2+-binding loops of Doc2β C2AB penetrate membranes in a manner analogous to syt1, residues at the tips of loops 1 and 3 in each C2 domain of Doc2β (His-158 and Phe-222 in C2A and Ala-298 and Gly-361 in C2B) were individually mutated to cysteine and labeled with the environmentally sensitive probe N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (NBD) (Fig. 1B). Membrane insertion was monitored via fluorescence emission changes after adding liposomes and Ca2+ to NBD-labeled protein. Emission spectra from NBD probes at all four Ca2+-binding loops underwent hypsochromic shifts and substantial intensity increases when both Ca2+ and PS-containing liposomes were present. Ca2+ triggered these fluorescence changes only in the presence of membranes, suggesting that each probe inserts into the bilayer in response to Ca2+ (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). To confirm a direct interaction between these probes and the acyl chains in the bilayer, we used liposomes containing a membrane-embedded nitroxide (doxyl) spin label on an acyl chain of PC; this moiety quenches fluorescence largely by direct collision with excited-state fluorophores (37Chattopadhyay A. London E. Parallax method for direct measurement of membrane penetration depth utilizing fluorescence quenching by spin-labeled phospholipids.Biochemistry. 1987; 26 (3030403): 39-4510.1021/bi00375a006Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). NBD fluorescence, in each loop, was efficiently quenched by a spin label at the 12-position of the acyl chain (12-doxyl-PC, 15 mol %) (Fig. 1C), directly demonstrating that all four Ca2+-binding loops of Doc2β insert into the hydrophobic region of the bilayer. Aggregation of PS-containing liposomes is also a characteristic property of syt1 C2AB in vitro (38Hui E. Gaffaney J.D. Wang Z. Johnson C.P. Evans C.S. Chapman E.R. Mechanism and function of synaptotagmin-mediated membrane apposition.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 (21642967): 813-82110.1038/nsmb.2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This activity has not been described for Doc2β, a soluble protein whose function may also rely on its ability to juxtapose membranes. To assay for aggregation activity, Doc2β C2AB was mixed with liposomes and Ca2+, and the turbidity of the mixture was monitored by absorbance at 400 nm. As with syt1 C2AB, Doc2β C2AB rapidly and reversibly aggregated liposomes that harbored PS (Fig. S2A). Moreover, this aggregation activity was strongly enhanced when copies of Doc2β C2AB were bound to separate liposomes and thus available to interact in trans (Fig. S2, B and C). This behavior, which was also observed for syt1 (38Hui E. Gaffaney J.D. Wang Z. Johnson C.P. Evans C.S. Chapman E.R. Mechanism and function of synaptotagmin-mediated membrane apposition.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 (21642967): 813-82110.1038/nsmb.2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2), suggests a common mechanism of aggregation in which C2AB molecules, bound to liposomes via their Ca2+-binding loops, subsequently interact with other liposome-bound C2AB molecules. We next focused on the role of PIP2 in driving specific modes of membrane binding by syt1 and Doc2β. Because previous studies of membrane penetration by syt1 were performed using nonphysiologic mixtures of phospholipids (13Bai J. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R.

Indo-1 was used to verify that [Ca2+]free remained very low, i.e. ≤10 nm, upon addition of PS:PIP2 lipids (Fig. S3).

In each case, this activity, at 1 mol % PIP2, was limited to the Ca2+-binding loops of the C2B domain. Inclusion of 12-doxyl-PC in the liposomes resulted in quenching of NBD fluorescence, confirming a direct interaction of C2B loop 3 with the interior of the membrane in the case of each protein (Fig. 2, A and C). Syt1 and Doc2β C2AB diverged in terms of the behavior of C2B loop 1, which failed to penetrate in the case of syt1 but engaged in shallow penetration in the case of Doc2β (Fig. 2, A and C).

JMJD6 is also reported to catalyze N-demethylation of N-methylated (both mono- and di-methylated) arginine residues of histones and other proteins, including HSP70 (heat-shock protein 70), estrogen receptor α, and RNA helicase A. Here, we report MS- and NMR-based kinetic assays employing purified JMJD6 and multiple substrate fragment sequences, the results of which support the assignment of purified JMJD6 as a lysyl hydroxylase. By contrast, we did not observe N-methyl arginyl N-demethylation with purified JMJD6. Biophysical analyses, including crystallographic analyses of JMJD6Δ344–403 in complex with iron and 2OG, supported its assignment as a lysyl hydroxylase rather than an N-methyl arginyl-demethylase. The screening results supported some, but not all, of the assigned JMJD6 substrates and identified other potential JMJD6 substrates. We envision these results will be useful in cellular and biological work on the substrates and functions of JMJD6 and in the development of selective inhibitors of human 2OG oxygenases."

In keeping with these molecular changes, RAD-deficient mice are reported to be more susceptible to cardiac hypertrophy (19Chang L. Zhang J. Tseng Y.H. Xie C.Q. Ilany J. Brüning J.C. Sun Z. Zhu X.

These results are in agreement with earlier studies of genetically modified mouse models designed to augment trigger Ca2+. Pore-forming CaV1.2 transgenic mice exhibit increased ICa,L and develop heart failure within about 8 months (23Muth J.N. Bodi I. Lewis W. Varadi G. Schwartz A. A Ca2+-dependent transgenic model of cardiac hypertrophy: a role for protein kinase Cα.Circulation. 2001; 103 (11136699): 140-14710.1161/01.CIR.103.1.140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CaVβ2 overexpressing mice show a more rapid progression to pathological cardiac hypertrophy and death (24Chen X. Nakayama H. Zhang X. Ai X. Harris D.M. Tang M. Zhang H. Szeto C. Stockbower K.

The conclusion from these early studies is that increased ICa,L promotes pathological cardiac hypertrophy. RAD protein is expressed in myocardial and nonheart tissues including, but not limited to, vascular smooth muscle (25Fu M. Zhang J. Tseng Y.-H. Cui T. Zhu X. Xiao Y. Mou Y. De Leon H. Chang M.M. Hamamori Y. Kahn C.R. Chen Y.E. Rad GTPase attenuates vascular lesion formation by inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell migration.Circulation. 2005; 111 (15710763): 1071-107710.1161/01.CIR.0000156439.55349.ADCrossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in cells in the bone marrow (26Withers C.N. Brown D.M. Byiringiro I. Allen M.R. Condon K.W. Satin J. Andres D.A. Rad GTPase is essential for the regulation of bone density and bone marrow adipose tissue in mice.Bone. 2017; 103 (28732776): 270-28010.1016/j.bone.2017.07.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus the complex cardiac phenotype observed in gRAD−/− mice may include noncardiac influences on cardiac remodeling that are superimposed over direct positive inotropic effect arising from increased trigger Ca2+-current in the myocardium. The purpose of this study is address the key question: are pro-adaptive, positive-inotropic effects of RAD-deletion obscured by the loss of RAD in noncardiac cell types? A key hypothesis maintains that RAD deletion, by targeting LTCC downstream of β-AR signaling provides a gain of systolic function. Therefore, we engineered an inducible, myocardial-restricted RAD knockout mouse (RADΔ/Δ). Our results show that RADΔ/Δ mice have enhanced heart function into senescence without evidence for structural remodeling. These major new findings challenge the dogmatic assumption that increased myocardial Ca2+ necessarily promotes pathology, and suggests that the heart pathology observed in gRAD−/− mice are the result of noncardiac influences of RAD loss. Standard gene targeting of RRAD in the mouse results in a complex phenotype, including cardiac remodeling (21Manning J.R. Withers C.N. Levitan B. Smith J.D. Andres D.A. Satin J. Loss of Rad-GTPase produces a novel adaptive cardiac phenotype resistant to systolic decline with aging.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Heart Assoc. 2013; 2 (24334906): e000459Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine the role of RAD signaling selectively in cardiomyocytes, we used conditional gene targeting with the Cre-loxP system. To achieve cardiomyocyte-specific deletion, CRISPR/Cas9 techniques were used to genetically target RRAD, introducing loxP (flox: fl) recombination sites flanking exons 3 and 4 (RADfl/fl; Fig. 1A). These exons encode a large portion of the RAD GTPase core that directs both guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, and the C-terminal membrane targeting motif required for LTCC regulation (27Correll R.N. Pang C. Finlin B.S. Dailey A.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Plasma membrane targeting is essential for Rem-mediated Ca2+ channel inhibition.J. Biol.

Successful introduction of loxP sites was confirmed by genomic PCR (Fig. 1B). To permit cardiomyocyte-specific RAD deletion, RADfl/fl mice were crossed with a mouse line expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC-CreERT2) (28Sohal D.S.

Unless stated, all RADΔ/Δ and RADfl/fl mice were subjected to analysis >2 weeks following tamoxifen exposure. Global constitutive RAD knockout mice (gRAD−/−) showed increased ICa,L (18Manning J.R.

Res. 2011; 91 (21382976): 90-9810.1093/cvr/cvr068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By contrast, ANF and RCAN1, markers of the fetal gene program, were not altered in RADΔ/Δ (Fig. 2A). There was also no difference in the ratio of heart to body weight (Fig. 2B) and RADΔ/Δ shows no significant difference in fibrosis compared with RADfl/fl (Fig. 2, C and D). This is in stark contrast to gRAD−/− hearts, in which RAD deficiency has been found to increase connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, leading to greater extracellular matrix production and basal cardiac fibrosis (22Zhang J. Chang L. Chen C. Zhang M. Luo Y. Hamblin M. Villacorta L. Xiong J.-W. Chen Y.E. Zhang J. Zhu X. Rad GTPase inhibits cardiac fibrosis through connective tissue growth factor.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 91 (21382976): 90-9810.1093/cvr/cvr068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Importantly, cardiomyocyte-restricted RAD deletion failed to increase CTGF expression (Fig. 2, E and F). Global RADKO mice experience hypertension (50Manning J.R. Chelvarajan L. Levitan B.M. Withers C.N. Nagareddy P.R. Haggerty C.M. Fornwalt B.K. Gao E. Tripathi H. Abdel-Latif A. Andres D.A. Satin J. Rad GTPase deletion attenuates post-ischemic cardiac dysfunction and remodeling.JACC Basic Transl. Sci. 2018; 3 (29732439): 83-9610.1016/j.jacbts.2017.09.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and this may be a significant driver of the cardiac remodeling observed in these mice, as gRAD−/− hearts have likely undergone adaptive alterations secondary to pressure overload. Importantly, RADΔ/Δ showed no change in aortic pressure (Fig. 2G). Taken together, these data demonstrate that myocardial-restricted RAD deficiency improves cardiac output without instigating structural remodeling. To test the effect of myocardial-restricted RAD deficiency on heart function we longitudinally followed RADΔ/Δ mice from induced knockout in early adulthood for an additional 15 months (Fig. 3A). Ejection fraction (EF) significantly increased 7 days after tamoxifen administration and remained increased continuously for 15 months (Fig. 3B). There was no difference in heart chamber size (Fig. 3C) or in heart wall thickness (Fig. 3, D and E). Cardiomyocyte-restricted RAD deletion effects on in vivo heart function were not different between males and females (Fig. 3, F–H). EF has a shallow dependence on heart rate (HR) that is preserved in RADΔ/Δ. Regression analysis supports elevated EF in RADΔ/Δ across the range of HR measured (Fig. 3I). A straightforward explanation for enhanced heart function would be increased ICa,L in RADΔ/Δ. Previous studies of whole body, constitutive RAD knockout showed that LTCC conductance increased, voltage dependence shifted negatively, and the predicted ICaL window increased (18Manning J.R. Yin G. Kaminski C.N. Magyar J. Feng H.Z. Penn J. Sievert G. Thompson K. Jin J.P. Andres D.A. Satin J. Rad GTPase deletion increases L-type calcium channel current leading to increased cardiac contraction.J. Am. Heart Assoc. 2013; 2 (24334906): e000459Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, constitutive global RAD knockout hearts displayed structural remodeling. Thus, it is possible that changes in gRAD−/− ICa,L were secondary to myocardial remodeling. To interrogate the contribution of RAD in structurally unaltered hearts, we measured ICa,L in cardiomyocytes from mature RADΔ/Δ hearts. Fig. 4A shows representative families of ICa,L traces from RADfl/fl and RADΔ/Δ for evaluating current/voltage (I(V)) relationships, and Fig. 4B shows representative current traces generated by the steady-state availability voltage protocol. These representative traces highlight the increased current density and accelerated kinetics of RADΔ/Δ. The I(V) curves for ICa,L show that RAD loss results in a greater current density compared with RADfl/fl myocytes (Fig. 4C). RAD deficiency results in greater maximal conductance (Fig. 4, D and E; maximal conductance: RADΔ/Δ = 254 ± 19 pS/pF, n = 15; RADfl/fl = 144 ± 12 pS/pF, n = 18; p < 10−4). The normalized conductance voltage curves superimposed on the steady-state inactivation curves (Fig. 4F) highlight the selective shift of steady-state activation with RAD ablation; activation midpoint is shifted toward more negative membrane potential (Fig. 4, F and G; RADΔ/Δ = −18.3 ± 1.0 mV, n = 15; RADfl/fl = −8.1 ± 1.9 mV, n = 18; p < 10−4). Steady-state availability shows no significant difference of midpoint between RADfl/fl and RADΔ/Δ (RADΔ/Δ = −24.2 ± 1.0 mV, n = 9; RADfl/fl = −22.1 ± 1.7 mV, n = 11; p = 0.11). There is no sexual dimorphism in the effect of RAD deletion on ICa,L (data not shown). The increase in ICa,L could stem from an increase in CaV1.2. To test this, we performed qRT-PCR for CaV1.2 from RADfl/fl and RADΔ/Δ hearts and found CaV1.2 mRNA did not change (Fig. 4H). CaV1.2 protein levels from RADΔ/Δ hearts was also not significantly different from that of RADfl/fl (Fig. 4I). Taken together these data show that myocardial-restricted RAD deficiency is sufficient to increase ICa,L by modulating LTCC function. RADΔ/Δ ICa,L decay is biphasic with a prominent fast and slow decay phase compared with monophasic decaying RADfl/fl (Fig. 4A; Fig. S1). At −5 mV the fast and slow decaying amplitudes of RADΔ/Δ ICa,L are roughly similar (Fig. S1); the slow-decay component is significantly slower than RADfl/fl decay. The fast ICa,L decay is >10-fold faster than the monotonic ICa,L time constant observed in RADfl/fl (Fig. S1). In summary, myocardial RAD-reduction results in larger, but faster decaying ICa,L. ICa,L provides trigger Ca2+ for myocardial Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Whole-cell cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics are significantly larger in amplitude for RADΔ/Δ compared with RADfl/fl (Fig. 5, A and B), and the upstroke velocity of the cytosolic Ca2+-transient is accelerated in RADΔ/Δ (Fig. 5C). To assess Ca2+ re-uptake we measured th"
https://openalex.org/W2947606863,"Background Dementia caregivers describe knowing what to expect as an unmet need and many are unaware that dementia can be a terminal condition. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common neurodegenerative dementia with unique features which may affect the end of life (EOL). Given the paucity of data on EOL experiences in dementia and unique aspects of DLB affecting EOL, we investigated EOL experiences as reported by caregivers of individuals with DLB. Method We conducted telephone interviews with caregivers and family members of individuals who died with DLB in the last 5 years using a semi-structured questionnaire to identify and describe EOL experiences. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to analyze interview transcripts and identify common themes. Results Thirty individuals participated in interviews. Key themes included lack of knowledge regarding what to expect, end-of-life time course (including end-of-life symptoms, declines after hospitalization and falls, and varied EOL trajectories), advance care planning, lack of family understanding, hospice, views regarding right-to-die, medications at the end of life, approaching end of life, the death experience, and activities that enhanced end of life. Lack of communication between health care teams and families and difficulty predicting death timing were two frequently expressed challenges. Conclusions Study results emphasize the need for improved EOL counseling in DLB, recognition of EOL symptoms, earlier hospice involvement, tailoring EOL care to DLB-specific needs, and clinician-family communication. Suggestions for patient and family education are provided. Further research should confirm predictors of approaching EOL in DLB, identify strategies to improve physician recognition of EOL, and develop tools to aid communication and quality EOL care."
https://openalex.org/W2947891717,"Previous research has indicated that, compared to audio-only presentation, audio-visual congruent presentation can lead to a more intense emotional response. In the present study, we investigated the audio-visual integration effect on emotions elicited by positive or negative music and the role of visual information presentation durations. The participants were presented with audio-only condition, audio-visual congruent condition, and audio-visual incongruent condition and then required to judge the intensity of emotional experience elicited by the music. Their emotional responses to the music were measured using self-ratings and physiological aspects, including heart rate, skin temperature, EMG root mean square and prefrontal EEG. Relative to the audio-only presentation, the audio-visual congruent presentation led to a more intense emotional response. More importantly, the audio-visual integration occurred both in the positive music and in the negative music. Furthermore, the audio-visual integration effect was larger for positive music than for negative music; meanwhile the audio-visual integration effect was strongest with the visual information presented within 80s for negative music, which indicated that this integration effect was more likely to occur in the negative music. These results suggest that when the music was positive, the effect of audio-visual integration was greater. When the music was negative, the modulation effect of the presentation durations of visual information on the music-induced emotion was more significant."
https://openalex.org/W2946909347,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is caused by disruption in the homeostatic balance of muscle degeneration and regeneration under various pathophysiological conditions. We have previously reported that iron accumulation induces skeletal muscle atrophy via a ubiquitin ligase-dependent pathway. However, the potential effect of iron accumulation on muscle regeneration remains unclear. To examine the effect of iron accumulation on myogenesis, we used a mouse model with cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle regeneration in vivo and C2C12 mouse myoblast cells in vitro. In mice with iron overload, the skeletal muscles exhibited increased oxidative stress and decreased expression of satellite cell markers. Following CTX-induced muscle injury, these mice also displayed delayed muscle regeneration with a decrease in the size of regenerating myofibers, reduced expression of myoblast differentiation markers, and decreased phosphorylation of MAPK signaling pathways. In vitro, iron overload also suppressed the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells but the suppression could be reversed by superoxide scavenging using tempol. Excess iron inhibits myogenesis via oxidative stress, leading to an imbalance in skeletal muscle homeostasis.-Ikeda, Y., Satoh, A., Horinouchi, Y., Hamano, H., Watanabe, H., Imao, M., Imanishi, M., Zamami, Y., Takechi, K., Izawa-Ishizawa, Y., Miyamoto, L., Hirayama, T., Nagasawa, H., Ishizawa, K., Aihara, K.-I., Tsuchiya, K., Tamaki, T.

https://openalex.org/W2946919725,"Herein, we aimed to identify the immunomodulatory role of tumor Syndecan-1 (CD138) in the polarization of CD4+ T helper (Th) subsets isolated from the tumor microenvironment of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and non-IBC patients. Lymphocytes and mononuclear cells isolated from the axillary tributaries of non-IBC and IBC patients during modified radical mastectomy were either stimulated with the secretome as indirect co-culture or directly co-cultured with control and Syndecan-1-silenced SUM-149 IBC cells. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of normal subjects were used for the direct co-culture. Employing flow cytometry, we analyzed the expression of the intracellular IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17, and Foxp3 markers as readout for basal and co-cultured Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg CD4+ subsets, respectively. Our data revealed that IBC displayed a lower basal frequency of Th1 and Th2 subsets than non-IBC. Syndecan-1-silenced SUM-149 cells significantly upregulated only Treg subset polarization of normal subjects relative to controls. However, Syndecan-1 silencing significantly enhanced the polarization of Th17 and Treg subsets of non-IBC under both direct and indirect conditions and induced only Th1 subset polarization under indirect conditions compared to control. Interestingly, qPCR revealed that there was a negative correlation between Syndecan-1 and each of IL-4, IL-17, and Foxp3 mRNA expression in carcinoma tissues of IBC and that the correlation was reversed in non-IBC. Mechanistically, Syndecan-1 knockdown in SUM-149 cells promoted Th17 cell expansion via upregulation of IL-23 and the Notch ligand DLL4. Overall, this study indicates a low frequency of the circulating antitumor Th1 subset in IBC and suggests that tumor Syndecan-1 silencing enhances ex vivo polarization of CD4+ Th17 and Treg cells of non-IBC, whereby Th17 polarization is possibly mediated via upregulation of IL-23 and DLL4. These findings suggest the immunoregulatory role of tumor Syndecan-1 expression in Th cell polarization that may have therapeutic implications for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2946946560,"Excessive osteoclast activity can lead to an imbalance between the synthesis and breakdown of bone, with pathologic consequences that include osteoporosis and periodontitis. Thus, controlling osteoclast differentiation and function has significant therapeutic implications. In this study, we investigated the effects of dehydrocostus lactone (DL) on osteoclast differentiation and activation and elucidated the possible mechanisms underlying these processes. DL suppressed osteoclast differentiation by reducing the expression of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1. When used to challenge differentiated osteoclasts, DL also effectively inhibited their enlargement and resorption activity, and biochemical approaches revealed that DL attenuates osteoclast activation by inhibiting the migration and lysosome biogenesis and secretion via the down-regulation of integrin β3, PKC-β, and autophagy related 5 expression. Furthermore, DL prevented bone destruction in inflammation- and ovariectomy-induced osteolytic mouse models. These results indicate that DL has therapeutic potential to treat bone diseases caused by excessive or hyperactive osteoclasts.-Lee, H. I., Lee, J., Hwang, D., Lee, G.-R., Kim, N., Kwon, M., Lee, H., Piao, D., Kim, H. J., Kim, N. Y., Kim, H. S., Seo, E. K., Kang, D., Jeong, W.

https://openalex.org/W2947238987,"Objectives This study assessed the incidence of transitions in smartphone addiction proneness (SAP) among children and examined the effects of gender, use patterns (social networking sites (SNSs) use and smartphone gaming) and depression on smartphone addiction transitions. Methods A representative sample of 2,155 children from Taipei completed longitudinal surveys in both 2015 (5th grade) and 2016 (6th grade). Latent transition analysis (LTA) was used to characterize transitions in SAP and to examine the effects of gender, use patterns and depression on SAP transitions. Results LTA identified four latent statuses of SAP: about half of the children were in non-SAP status, one-fifth were in tolerance status, one-sixth were in withdrawal status, and one-seventh were in high-SAP status. Both boys and girls had a higher prevalence of high-SAP and tolerance in 6th grade than in 5th grade, whereas in both grades boys had a higher prevalence of high-SAP and withdrawal, and girls had a higher prevalence of non-SAP and tolerance. Controlling for parents’ education, family structure, and household income, higher use of SNSs by children, increasing use of mobile gaming and higher levels of depression were individually associated with increased odds of being in one of the three SAP statuses other than non-SAP. When all three covariates were jointly entered into the model, usage of SNSs and depression remained significant predictors. Conclusion Both boys and girls tended to transition to tolerance or high-SAP statuses, while children’s depression and their usage of SNSs increased the risk of smartphone addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2947011984,"The Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencing device can produce large amounts of long sequences, typically several kilobases, within a few hours. This long read capacity was exploited to detect antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in a large veterinary teaching hospital environment, and to assess their taxonomic origin, genetic organisation and association with mobilisation markers concurrently. Samples were collected on eight occasions between November 2016 and May 2017 (inclusive) in a longitudinal study. Nanopore sequencing was performed on total DNA extracted from the samples after a minimal enrichment step in broth. Many ARGs present in the veterinary hospital environment could potentially confer resistance to antimicrobials widely used in treating infections of companion animals, including aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, sulphonamides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. High-risk ARGs, defined here as single or multiple ARGs associated with pathogenic bacterial species or with mobile genetic elements, were shared between the intensive care unit (ICU) patient cages, a dedicated laundry trolley and a floor cleaning mop-bucket. By contrast, a floor surface from an office corridor without animal contact and located outside the veterinary hospital did not contain such high-risk ARGs. Relative abundances of high-risk ARGs and co-localisation of these genes on the same sequence read were higher in the laundry trolley and mop bucket samples, compared to the ICU cages, suggesting that amplification of ARGs is likely to occur in the collection points for hospital waste. These findings have prompted the implementation of targeted intervention measures in the veterinary hospital to mitigate the risks of transferring clinically important ARGs between sites and to improve biosecurity practices in the facility."
https://openalex.org/W2947015664,"The light fraction of soil organic matter (LF) has a rapid turnover and may be potentially metal-enriched, but the interaction between this pool of organic matter and trace elements has not been well studied. The present study aimed to investigate changes in LF content and its effect on heavy metals distribution and extractability in long-term contaminated soil by smelting activity. An incubation experiment was conducted on a surface horizon of Brunic Arenosol sampled from the previously-existing sanitary zone of Głogów smelter, for 450 days. The contaminated soil was divided into three combinations: with the addition of either triticate straw (at the dose of 4.5 Mg ha-1) or pig manure (at the dose of 40 Mg ha-1) or without any ""foreign"" organic materials (nil). The LF (ρ > 1.7 g cm-3) occurred to be metal-enriched and despite its low content (5.49%-nil, 7.18%-straw and 7.29%-manure combination) in the bulk soil, it was observed that initially Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn stock reached 16.2%, 11.9%, 18.0% and 32.3%, respectively. Incubation conditions where mineralization processes dominate led to a decrease in the LF share by about 12.6% in nil and 31.4-39.8% in the combinations with organic amendments. In consequence, the DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentration doubled and metal distribution had changed. The increase in water-soluble (F1) fraction was observed for all metals, additionally for Cu, Pb, Zn in exchangeable fraction (F2) and in carbonate bound (F3) fraction for Cd and Zn. These results support the view that changes in the LF content may play a key role in controlling trace metals mobility, especially in long-term contaminated soil."
https://openalex.org/W2947298362,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a heterozygous monogenic diabetes; more than 14 disease genes have been identified. However, the pathogenesis of MODY is not fully understood because the patients’ pancreatic beta cells are inaccessible. To elucidate the pathology of MODY, we established MODY3 patient-derived iPS (MODY3-iPS) cells using non-integrating Sendai virus (SeV) vector and examined the mutant mRNA and protein of HNF1A (Hepatocyte Nuclear factor 1A) after pancreatic lineage differentiation. Our patient had a cytosine insertion in the HNF1A gene (P291fsinsC) causing frameshift and making a premature termination codon (PTC). We confirmed these MODY3-iPS cells possessed the characteristics of pluripotent stem cells. After we differentiated them into pancreatic beta cells, transcripts of HNF1A gene were cloned and sequenced. We found that P291fsinsC mutant transcripts were much less frequent than wild ones, but they increased after adding cycloheximide (CHX) to the medium. These results suggested that mutant mRNA was destroyed by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Moreover, we were not able to detect any band of mutant proteins in pancreatic lineage cells which were differentiated from MODY3-iPSCs by western blot (WB) analysis. A scarcity of the truncated form of mutant protein may indicate that MODY3 might be caused by a haplo-insufficiency effect rather than a dominant negative manner."
https://openalex.org/W2947908808,"RNA methyltransferases post-transcriptionally add methyl groups to RNAs, which can regulate their fates and functions. Human BCDIN3D (Bicoid interacting 3 domain containing RNA methyltransferase) has been reported to specifically methylate the 5′-monophosphates of pre-miR-145 and cytoplasmic tRNAHis. Methylation of the 5′-monophosphate of pre-miR-145 blocks its cleavage by the miRNA generating enzyme Dicer, preventing generation of miR-145. Elevated expression of BCDIN3D has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. However, the biological functions of BCDIN3D and its orthologs remain unknown. Here we studied the biological and molecular functions of CG1239, a Drosophila ortholog of BCDIN3D. We found that ovary-specific knockdown of Drosophila BCDIN3D causes female sterility. High-throughput sequencing revealed that miRNA and mRNA profiles are dysregulated in BCDIN3D knockdown ovaries. Pathway analysis showed that many of the dysregulated genes are involved in metabolic processes, ribonucleoprotein complex regulation, and translational control. Our results reveal BCDIN3D’s biological role in female fertility and its molecular role in defining miRNA and mRNA profiles in ovaries."
https://openalex.org/W2950048479,"The incidence of child labour, especially across developing nations, is of global concern. The use of children in employment in developing economies constitutes a major threat to the societies, and concerted efforts are made by the relevant stakeholders towards addressing some of the factors and issues responsible. Significant risk factors include socio-demographic and economic factors such as poverty, neglect, lack of adequate care, exposure of children to various grades of violence, parental education status, gender, place of residence, household size, residence type or size, wealth index, parental survivorship and household size. Egypt is the largest country in Africa by population. Although UNCIF 2017 reported that the worst forms of child labour in Egypt are concentrated in domestic work, forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation, the situation has received little attention. There are still very few studies initiated specifically to look at child labour in domestic service in Egypt and those that exist have been limited in the scope of their methodology. Geographical coverage and research for child labour in Egypt is also limited, as are accurate statistics and data. There was, therefore, a strong case for looking again at the domestic child labour phenomenon in Egypt, especially after the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) released the first data about child labour in Egypt in 2014. This study builds on the few findings of earlier work, and broadens coverage by including advanced methods and geographical effects of this problem.This study focuses on identifying socio-demographic, economic and geospatial factors associated with child labour participation.We used the 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) from the Ministry of Health and Population in Egypt, with the record of 20,560 never-married children aged 5-17 years engaging in economic activities, in and out of their home. The data focused on demographic and socio-economic characteristics of household members. Multivariate Bayesian geo-additive models were employed to examine the demographical and socio-economic factors for children working less than 16 hrs; between 16 and less 45 hrs; and over 45 hrs weekly.The results showed that at least 31.6% of the children in the age group from 5-10 were working, 68.5% of children aged 11-17 years were engaged in child labour for a wage, and 44.7% of the children in the age group from 5-10 were engaged in hazardous work. From the multivariate Bayesian geo-additive models, female children (with male children as reference category) working at least 16 hrs (OR: 1.3; with 95% CI: 1.2-1.5) were more likely to be engaged in child labour than girls working 16 to 45 hrs (OR: 1; 95% CI: 0.3-1.5). Children born to women without formal education, in non-hazardous jobs, irrespective of the hours spent at work, were more likely to be involved in child labour (52.9%, 56.8%, 62.4%) compared to children of mothers with some level of education. Finally, children who have experienced psychological aggression and physical punishment are more likely to be used as child labour than those without such experience across the job types and hours spent. North-eastern Egypt has a higher likelihood of child labour than most other regions, while children who live in the Delta are more engaged in hazardous work.This study revealed a significant influence of socio-demographic and economic factors on child labour and violence against children in Egypt. Poverty, neglect, lack of adequate care and exposure of children to various grades of violence are major drivers of child labour across the country. The spatial effect suggests the need to give more attention to some areas that have high rates of child labour, such as the Nile Delta, Upper Egypt, and North-eastern Egypt."

It was uncovered that in regulatory regions only around transcription start sites (TSSs), gene expression and methylation showed negative correlation, whereas in gene bodies, positive correlation occurred. Furthermore, earlier myogenic gene demethylation around TSSs and earlier hypermethylation of myogenic genes in gene bodies were considered to trigger their earlier expression in miniature pigs. Furthermore, by analyzing the methylation pattern of the myogenic differentiation 1(MyoD) promoter and distal enhancer, we found that earlier demethylation of the MyoD distal enhancer in WZSs contributes to its earlier expression. Moreover, DNA demethylase Tet1 was found to be involved in the demethylation of the myogenin promoter and promoted immortalized mouse myoblast cell line (C2C12) and porcine embryonic myogenic cell differentiation. This study reveals that earlier demethylation of myogenic genes contributes to precocious terminal differentiation of myoblasts in miniature pigs.-Zhang, X., Nie, Y., Cai, S., Ding, S., Fu, B., Wei, H., Chen, L., Liu, X., Liu, M., Yuan, R., Qiu, B., He, Z., Cong, P., Chen, Y., Mo, D.

This study attempts to investigate the main determinants of chemical products' exports of Pakistan with 62 trading partners by applying Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) on an augmented gravity model for a period 1995-2015. The results corroborate that chemical products' exports follow gravity patterns. This study finds a negative and significant impact of import tariff on exports of chemical products while the positive impact of devaluation has been observed. Further, the estimations also take into account the impact of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTA), colonial links, common language, political disputes and contiguity by incorporating dummy variable for each variable and the expected positive effects are found except an insignificant effect of Contiguity. Further, the negative impact of political disputes is observed. The exports' efficiency analyses reveal that Pakistan's chemical exports are well below the optimal level and there exists a huge untapped exports' potential with its neighboring, Middle Eastern and European countries."
https://openalex.org/W2947175226,"For many years, tuberculosis (TB) has been a major public health problem worldwide. Advances for treatment and eradication have been very limited. Silymarin (Sm) is a natural product with antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities that has been proposed as a complementary medicine to reduce the liver injury produced by the conventional anti-TB chemotherapy. Sm also has immunoregulatory and microbicide properties. In this study, we determined the effect of Sm on the growth control of mycobacteria. In vitro studies showed that Sm and Silibinin (the principal active compound of Sm) have microbicidal activity against drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) mycobacteria, induce the production of protective cytokines from infected macrophages, and improve the growth control of mycobacteria (p ≤ 0.0001). Studies in vivo using a model of progressive pulmonary TB in BALB/c mice infected with drug-sensitive or MDR mycobacteria have shown that Sm induces significant expression of Th-1 cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-12 as well as TNFα, which produce significant therapeutic activity when administered alone and apparently have a synergistic effect with chemotherapy. These results suggest that Sm has a bactericidal effect and can contribute to the control and establishment of a TH1 protective immune response against mycobacterial infection. Thus, it seems that this flavonoid has a promising potential as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of TB."

Clusters vary in size and scope, are associated with a diverse range of aerosol-producing devices, including exposures such as whirlpool spas and hotel water systems typically associated with travel, and can occur without an easily identified exposure source. Recently, jurisdictions have begun to use SaTScan spatio-temporal analysis software prospectively as part of routine cluster surveillance. We used data collected by the Active Bacterial Core surveillance platform to assess the ability of SaTScan to detect Legionnaires’ disease clusters. We found that SaTScan analysis using traditional surveillance data and geocoded residential addresses was unable to detect many common Legionnaires’ disease cluster types, such as those associated with travel or a prolonged time between cases. Additionally, signals from an analysis designed to simulate a real-time search for clusters did not align with clusters identified by traditional surveillance methods or a retrospective SaTScan analysis. A geospatial analysis platform better tailored to the unique characteristics of Legionnaires’ disease epidemiology would improve cluster detection and decrease time to public health action."
https://openalex.org/W2947776043,"Vascular calcification is strongly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. C1q/TNF-related protein-13 (CTRP13) is a secreted adipokine that plays important roles in the cardiovascular system. However, the functional role of CTRP13 in the development of vascular calcification has yet to be explored. In this study, we collected blood samples from patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and from rats with adenine-induced CRF. We found that the serum CTRP13 levels were decreased in patients and rats with CRF and were negatively associated with calcium deposition in the abdominal aorta. Compared to those of the controls, ectopic CTRP13 treatment significantly attenuated the calcium accumulation and alkaline phosphatase activity in the abdominal aorta of CRF rats, and β-glycerophosphate induced the formation of arterial rings and of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and decreased the number of VSMCs that transitioned from a contractile to an osteogenic phenotype. The overexpression of Runx2 blocked CTRP13-reduced VSMC calcification. Mechanistically, CTRP13 repressed the phosphorylation of tristetraprolin (TTP), thereby activating TTP and increasing the TTP binding to the 3'untranslated region of the Runx2 mRNA, accelerating the Runx2 mRNA destabilization and degradation. In summary, these findings reveal that CTRP13 regulation is a novel method for the prevention of vascular calcification, representing a novel mechanism of the regulation of Runx2 expression in VSMCs.-Li, Y., Wang, W., Chao, Y., Zhang, F., Wang, C. CTRP13 attenuates vascular calcification by regulating Runx2."

Queen recognition has been broadly demonstrated and queen recognition pheromones have been identified in social hymenopterans, and in one termite species. Here we describe behaviors that are elicited in workers and soldiers by neotenic queens and kings of the subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes, and demonstrate the chemical basis for the behavior. Workers and soldiers readily perform a lateral or longitudinal shaking behavior upon antennal contact with queens and kings. When royal cuticular chemicals are transferred to live workers or inert glass dummies, they elicit antennation and shaking in a dose-dependent manner. The striking response to reproductives and their cuticular extracts suggests that royal-specific cuticular compounds act as recognition pheromones and that shaking behavior is a clear and measurable queen and king recognition response in this termite species."
https://openalex.org/W2947755285,"In this work we develop a general mathematical model and devise a practical identifiability approach for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) metastasis to the liver, with the aim of quantitatively describing therapy failure due to drug resistance. To this end, we have modeled metastatic growth and therapy failure produced by resistance to two standard treatments based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Imatinib and Sunitinib) that have been observed clinically in patients with GIST metastasis to the liver. The parameter identification problem is difficult to solve, since there are no general results on this issue for models based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) like the ones studied here. We propose a general modeling framework based on ODE for GIST metastatic growth and therapy failure due to drug resistance and analyzed five different model variants, using medical image observations (CT scans) from patients that exhibit drug resistance. The associated parameter estimation problem was solved using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, by adding a regularization term to the objective function to address model instability, and assessing the agreement of either an absolute or proportional error in the objective function. We compared the goodness of fit to data for the proposed model variants, as well as evaluated both error forms in order to improve parameter estimation results. From the model variants analyzed, we identified the one that provides the best fit to all the available patient data sets, as well as the best assumption in computing the objective function (absolute or proportional error). This is the first work that reports mathematical models capable of capturing and quantitatively describing therapy failure due to drug resistance based on clinical images in a patient-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2913147593,"Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a prominent cardiometabolic risk factor that increases cardio-metabolic disease risk independently of BMI and for which multiple genetic loci have been identified. However, WHR is a relatively crude proxy for fat distribution and it does not capture all variation in fat distribution. We here present a study of the role of coding genetic variants on fat mass in 6 distinct regions of the body, based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry imaging on more than 17k participants. We find that the missense variant CCDC92S70C, previously associated with WHR, is associated specifically increased leg fat mass and reduced visceral but not subcutaneous central fat. The minor allele-carrying transcript of CCDC92 is constitutively more highly expressed in adipose tissue samples. In addition, we identify two coding variants in SPATA20 and UQCC1 that are associated with arm fat mass. SPATA20K422R is a low-frequency variant with a large effect on arm fat only, and UQCC1R51Q is a common variant reaching significance for arm but showing similar trends in other subcutaneous fat depots. Our findings support the notion that different fat compartments are regulated by distinct genetic factors."

In this report, we present a qualitative assessment of several documents generated from the PULSE V&C Leadership Fellow Recognition Team. The Recognition Team developed two initiatives to provide departments with feedback on their change process. The first initiative, the validated PULSE V&C Rubrics, enables departments to collaboratively self-assess their progress in enacting change. The second initiative, the PULSE Recognition Program, involves completion of the aforementioned Rubrics and a site-visit by two Recognition Team members to provide external insights and suggestions to foster a department’s change process. Eight departments participated in the Recognition Program in 2014. An evaluation of the documents yielded from the Recognition Program review of seven of the eight departments and a comparison of Rubric scores from before and three years following the site-visits uncovered several common elements required for successful department level change.

In the quantitative phase, secondary data from a national survey (PMAQ-AB) was used to describe the work of 12,403 OHTs. Item response theory (IRT) was applied, to evaluate the psychometric qualities of 20 oral health questions from PMAQ-AB and to identify the performance of OHT. The quantitative results guided the selection of the qualitative sample. An extreme case sampling strategy was used (opposite results). OHTs were selected from Belo Horizonte metropolitan region in Brazil using scores measured by IRT. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was conducted using deductive and inductive thematic analysis.Quantitative results showed that there are OHT with high and low performance in Brazil. The IRT analysis showed that items related to prostheses and oral cancer tend to discriminate high-performance OHTs from other OHTs. Qualitative results deepened the understanding of accessing oral health services and found several access barriers, such as the insufficient number of OHTs for the population, and a very long waiting time for dental consultations other than urgency. The qualitative results confirmed that high-performance OHTs tend to emphasize oral cancer surveillance and deliver prostheses in PHC services.Despite the expansion of oral health in PHC in Brazil in recent years, OHTs still face many challenges such as: access barriers; failures in prevention, early diagnosis and follow-up of oral cancer cases; and insufficient rehabilitation with prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W2947491603,"Backgrounds A recent GWAS Study found a new locus (rs9810888 in CACNA1D) was associated with blood pressure (BP) in Chinese adults. But whether the association exists in children is unknown. Whether lifestyle behaviors could interact with rs9810888 on BP is not clear. This study aimed to identify the association between rs9810888 and BP in children, and also explore the gene-lifestyle interaction. Methods A case-control study was conducted among 2030 Chinese children aged 7 to 18 years. Genotyping was conducted by using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Lifestyle behaviors were investigated with questionnaire. Results With adjustment for age, age square, sex, study group and body mass index (BMI), rs9810888 was significantly associated with diastolic BP (DBP) (b = 1.69, p = 0.021) and mean arterial BP (MAP) (b = 1.56, p = 0.010). Stratified analysis showed that the rs9810888 GG genotype carriers had higher DBP than GT/TT carriers (b = 3.78, p = 0.023) in the subgroup having protein intake (meat/fish/soybeans/egg) <twice/day, but not in the subgroup ≥twice/day. In addition, in the subgroup with screen time≥2h/day, the rs9810888 GG genotype carriers had higher DBP than GT/TT carriers (b = 5.49, p = 0.012), but not in the subgroup with screen time<2h/day. For MAP, in the subgroup having either fruits or vegetables < twice/day, the rs9810888 GG genotype carriers had higher MAP than GT/TT carriers (b = 2.64, p = 0.037), but not in the subgroup with both fruits and vegetables intake ≥twice/day. Additionally, in the subgroup with screen time≥2h/day, the rs9810888 GG genotype carriers had higher MAP than GT/TT carriers (b = 4.80, p = 0.017), but not in those with screen time<2h/day. Conclusions The CACNA1D rs9810888 polymorphism was significantly associated with DBP and MAP. In addition, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and rs9810888 GG genotype had combined effects on BP level among Chinese children."
https://openalex.org/W2946847178,"During adipogenesis, preadipocytes' cytoskeleton reorganizes in parallel with lipid accumulation. Failure to do so may impact the ability of adipose tissue (AT) to shift between lipid storage and mobilization. Here, we identify cytoskeletal transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) as a protein expressed in AT and associated with obesity and inflammation, being normalized upon weight loss. TAGLN2 was primarily found in the adipose stromovascular cell fraction, but inflammation, TGF-β, and estradiol also prompted increased expression in human adipocytes. Tagln2 knockdown revealed a key functional role, being required for proliferation and differentiation of fat cells, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing Tagln2 using the adipocyte protein 2 promoter disclosed remarkable sex-dependent variations, in which females displayed healthy obesity and hypertrophied adipocytes but preserved insulin sensitivity, and males exhibited physiologic changes suggestive of defective AT expandability, including increased number of small adipocytes, activation of immune cells, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired metabolism together with decreased insulin sensitivity. The metabolic relevance and sexual dimorphism of TAGLN2 was also outlined by genetic variants that may modulate its expression and are associated with obesity and the risk of ischemic heart disease in men. Collectively, current findings highlight the contribution of cytoskeletal TAGLN2 to the obese phenotype in a gender-dependent manner.-Ortega, F. J., Moreno-Navarrete, J. M., Mercader, J.

https://openalex.org/W2947116394,"Crises and disasters affect the numbers of people traveling either for tourism or other reasons. Many studies have been published on the effects of such events on travel, especially on tourism, and based on the arrivals or departures of travelers to or from countries. Our aim was to assess the influence of these events on the demand for pre-travel medical consultation in an International Vaccination Centre (IVC). Data on 94683 international travelers who visited 113529 international destinations attended at the IVC of Malaga (Spain) during 2000-2017 were studied. A descriptive and time series analyses was conducted. The demand to IVC was 3.47 times higher in 2017 than in 2000. The increase has not been the same for all destinations: Travel to South-East Asia and Western Pacific World Health Organization (WHO) regions has multiplied by 10, while in the same period, Africa WHO region has declined from 36% to 20% of total demand. Thailand, India and Brazil were the countries with the highest demand (21% of all pre-travel consultations). We found out three periods, concurrent with some socioeconomic or health events, in which the number of travellers attend decline with respect to the previous years, or the growth was very slow. Growth in the demand for pre-travel medical advice in parallel with a foreseeable increase in the number of travelers is expected. Pre-travel medical services must be adapted to this increase. This study of the trend of demand for pre-travel medical information should new related problems to travel to be identified and quantified, and should assist improvement of policies and programs aimed at care of travelers."
https://openalex.org/W2947264544,"Computer assisted image acquisition techniques, including confocal microscopy, require efficient tools for an automatic sorting of vast amount of generated image data. The complexity of the classification process, absence of adequate tools, and insufficient amount of reference data has made the automated processing of images challenging. Mastering of this issue would allow implementation of statistical analysis in research areas such as in research on formation of t-tubules in cardiac myocytes. We developed a system aimed at automatic assessment of cardiomyocyte development stages (SAACS). The system classifies confocal images of cardiomyocytes with fluorescent dye stained sarcolemma. We based SAACS on a densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) topology. We created a set of labelled source images, proposed an appropriate data augmentation technique and designed a class probability graph. We showed that the DenseNet topology, in combination with the augmentation technique is suitable for the given task, and that high-resolution images are instrumental for image categorization. SAACS, in combination with the automatic high-throughput confocal imaging, will allow application of statistical analysis in the research of the tubular system development or remodelling and loss."
https://openalex.org/W2947874472,"Previous research has reported evidence of intergenerational transmissions of neighbourhood status and social and economic outcomes later in life. Research also shows neighbourhood effects on adult incomes of both childhood and adult neighbourhood experiences. However, these estimates of neighbourhood effects may be biased because confounding factors originating from the childhood family context. It is likely that part of the neighbourhood effects observed for adults, are actually lingering effects of the family in which someone grew up. This study uses a sibling design to disentangle family and neighbourhood effects on income, with contextual sibling pairs used as a control group. The sibling design helps us to separate the effects of childhood family and neighbourhood context from adult neighbourhood experiences. Using data from Swedish population registers, including the full Swedish population, we show that the neighbourhood effect on income from both childhood and adult neighbourhood experiences, is biased upwards by the influence of the childhood family context. Ultimately, we conclude that there is a neighbourhood effect on income from adult neighbourhood experiences, but that the childhood neighbourhood effect is actually a childhood family context effect. We find that there is a long lasting effect of the family context on income later in life, and that this effect is strong regardless the individual neighbourhood pathway later in life."

The addition of arabinose or galactose inhibited the formation of S. aureus aggregates in the silkworm plasma. Formation of the bacterial aggregates depended on S. aureus genes required for the synthesis of bacterial surface polysaccharides–ypfP and ltaA, which are involved in lipoteichoic acid synthesis, and the tagO gene, which is involved in wall teichoic acid synthesis. These findings suggest that S. aureus forms bacterial aggregates in the silkworm plasma via bacterial surface teichoic acids."

https://openalex.org/W2947393997,"Below the surface of the sun, a radical transition is afoot. In 5 years or so, the sun will be awash in sunspots and more prone to violent bursts of magnetic activity. Then, about 11 years from now, the solar cycle will conclude: Sunspots will fade away and the sun will again grow quiet. In early March, a dozen scientists, part of the Solar 25 Prediction Panel, descend on the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) here to predict how unruly the sun will become at its peak. NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have sponsored these panels since 1989, aiming to understand what drives the sun9s 11-year cycles and assess methods for predicting them. But the exercise is not just academic: the military, satellite operators, and electric utilities all want to know what the sun has in store, because of its tendency to flare up and send dangerous charged particles crashing into Earth as it approaches solar max. Sunspots can be seen with the naked eye, but it wasn9t until the mid-1800s that astronomers realized they come and go on a rough schedule. They first appear at midlatitudes and then proliferate, migrating toward the equator over about 11 years. In 1848, German astronomer Johann Rudolph Wolf published an account of the sunspot record, identifying 1755–66 as Cycle 1, the first period when counts were reliable. He then created a formula for counting the number of daily sunspots—a somewhat subjective technique that has evolved into a counting method still used today to marry data sets across the centuries. The cycles are capricious, however. Sometimes, the sun goes quiet for decades, with anemic sunspot counts across several cycles—as occurred during the 19th century9s so-called Dalton minimum. Such variations are what the scientists at NCAR have gathered to forecast. The problem is that no one—in this room or elsewhere—really knows how the sun works."
