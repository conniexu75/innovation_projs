https://openalex.org/W2140876277,"A BLUEPRINT of immune cell development To determine the epigenetic mechanisms that direct blood cells to develop into the many components of our immune system, the BLUEPRINT consortium examined the regulation of DNA and RNA transcription to dissect the molecular traits that govern blood cell differentiation. By inducing immune responses, Saeed et al. document the epigenetic changes in the genome that underlie immune cell differentiation. Cheng et al. demonstrate that trained monocytes are highly dependent on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of oxygen, which allows cells to produce the energy needed to mount an immune response. Chen et al. examine RNA transcripts and find that specific cell lineages use RNA transcripts of different length and composition (isoforms) to form proteins. Together, the studies reveal how epigenetic effects can drive the development of blood cells involved in the immune system.

https://openalex.org/W2058903813,"Differentiation rates regulate pool sizes Even though a basketball player is bigger than a gymnast, their neural tubes are organized in the same way. Studying chick and mouse embryos, Kicheva et al. show that rates of cell differentiation are key (see the Perspective by Pourquie). In a two-phase process, signaling sweeps through the neural tube early on to establish some aspects of cell fate, but later, pools of progenitor cells take on their own regulation. A progenitor that differentiates is no longer a progenitor, and thus the rate of differentiation determines the size of the progenitor pool. The relative sizes of progenitor pools shift as development progresses, to build the spinal cord so that everyone, large or small, has the right proportion of each component.

https://openalex.org/W2016254764,"Background Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) are one of the most frequent complications occurring in healthcare facilities. Contaminated environmental surfaces provide an important potential source for transmission of many healthcare-associated pathogens, thus indicating the need for new and sustainable strategies. Aim This study aims to evaluate the effect of a novel cleaning procedure based on the mechanism of biocontrol, on the presence and survival of several microorganisms responsible for HAIs (i.e. coliforms, Staphyloccus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and Candida albicans) on hard surfaces in a hospital setting. Methods The effect of microbial cleaning, containing spores of food grade Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus megaterium, in comparison with conventional cleaning protocols, was evaluated for 24 weeks in three independent hospitals (one in Belgium and two in Italy) and approximately 20000 microbial surface samples were collected. Results Microbial cleaning, as part of the daily cleaning protocol, resulted in a reduction of HAI-related pathogens by 50 to 89%. This effect was achieved after 3–4 weeks and the reduction in the pathogen load was stable over time. Moreover, by using microbial or conventional cleaning alternatively, we found that this effect was directly related to the new procedure, as indicated by the raise in CFU/m2 when microbial cleaning was replaced by the conventional procedure. Although many questions remain regarding the actual mechanisms involved, this study demonstrates that microbial cleaning is a more effective and sustainable alternative to chemical cleaning and non-specific disinfection in healthcare facilities. Conclusions This study indicates microbial cleaning as an effective strategy in continuously lowering the number of HAI-related microorganisms on surfaces. The first indications on the actual level of HAIs in the trial hospitals monitored on a continuous basis are very promising, and may pave the way for a novel and cost-effective strategy to counteract or (bio)control healthcare-associated pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2054428671,"Nicotine stimulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) powerfully inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and in experimental models of endotoxemia. A signaling pathway downstream from the α7 nAChRs, which involves the collaboration of JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB to interfere with signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been implicated in this anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine. Here, we identifiy an alternative mechanism involving interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M (IRAK-M), a negative regulator of innate TLR-mediated immune responses. Our data show that nicotine up-regulates IRAK-M expression at the mRNA and protein level in human macrophages, and that this effect is secondary to α7 nAChR activation. By using selective inhibitors of different signaling molecules downstream from the receptor, we provide evidence that activation of STAT3, via either JAK2 and/or PI3K, through a single (JAK2/PI3K/STAT3) or two convergent cascades (JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/STAT3), is necessary for nicotine-induced IRAK-M expression. Moreover, down-regulation of this expression by small interfering RNAs specific to the IRAK-M gene significantly reverses the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine on LPS-induced TNF-α production. Interestingly, macrophages pre-exposed to nicotine exhibit higher IRAK-M levels and reduced TNF-α response to an additional LPS challenge, a behavior reminiscent of the 'endotoxin tolerant' phenotype identified in monocytes either pre-exposed to LPS or from immunocompromised septic patients. Since nicotine is a major component of tobacco smoke and increased IRAK-M expression has been considered one of the molecular determinants for the induction of the tolerant phenotype, our findings showing IRAK-M overexpression could partially explain the known influence of smoking on the onset and progression of inflammatory and infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2001093010,"Insulin resistance, the diminished response of target tissues to insulin, is associated with the metabolic syndrome and a predisposition towards diabetes in a growing proportion of the worldwide population. Under insulin resistant states, the cellular response of the insulin signaling pathway is diminished and the body typically responds by increasing serum insulin concentrations to maintain insulin signaling. Some evidence indicates that the increased insulin concentration may itself further dampen insulin response. If so, insulin resistance would worsen as the level of circulating insulin increases during compensation, which could contribute to the transition of insulin resistance to more severe disease. Here, we investigated the consequences of excess insulin exposure to insulin receptor (IR) activity. Cells chronically exposed to insulin show a diminished the level of IR tyrosine and serine autophosphorylation below that observed after short-term insulin exposure. The diminished IR response did not originate with IR internalization since IR amounts at the cell membrane were similar after short- and long-term insulin incubation. Förster resonance energy transfer between fluorophores attached to the IR tyrosine kinase (TK) domain showed that a change in the TK domain occurred upon prolonged, but not short-term, insulin exposure. Even though the altered ‘insulin refractory’ IR TK FRET and IR autophosphorylation levels returned to baseline (non-stimulated) levels after wash-out of the original insulin stimulus, subsequent short-term exposure to insulin caused immediate re-establishment of the insulin-refractory levels. This suggests that some cell-based ‘memory’ of chronic hyperinsulinemic exposure acts directly at the IR. An improved understanding of that memory may help define interventions to reset the IR to full insulin responsiveness and impede the progression of insulin resistance to more severe disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2009700891,"Purpose To assess and compare the incidence of abnormal findings detected during non-contrast-enhanced whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) in the general population in two age groups: (1) 50 years old and younger; and (2) over 50 years old. Materials and Methods The analysis included 666 non-contrast-enhanced WB-MRIs performed on a 1.5-T scanner between December 2009 and June 2013 in a private hospital in 451 patients 50 years old and younger and 215 patients over 50 years old. The following images were obtained: T2-STIR (whole body-coronal plane), T2-STIR (whole spine-sagittal), T2-TSE with fat-saturation (neck and trunk-axial), T2-FLAIR (head-axial), 3D T1-GRE (thorax-coronal, axial), T2-TSE (abdomen-axial), chemical shift (abdomen-axial). Detected abnormalities were classified as: insignificant (type I), potentially significant, requiring medical attention (type II), significant, requiring treatment (type III). Results There were 3375 incidental findings depicted in 659 (98.9%) subjects: 2997 type I lesions (88.8%), 363 type II lesions (10.8%) and 15 type III lesions (0.4%), including malignant or possibly malignant lesions in seven subjects. The most differences in the prevalence of abnormalities on WB-MRI between patients 50 years old and younger and over 50 years old concerned: brain infarction (22.2%, 45.0% respectively), thyroid cysts/nodules (8.7%, 18.8%), pulmonary nodules (5.0%, 16.2%), significant degenerative disease of the spine (23.3%, 44.5%), extra-spinal degenerative disease (22.4%, 61.1%), hepatic steatosis (15.8%, 24.9%), liver cysts/hemangiomas (24%, 34.5%), renal cysts (16.9%, 40.6%), prostate enlargement (5.1% of males, 34.2% of males), uterine fibroids (16.3% of females, 37.9% of females). Conclusions Incidental findings were detected in almost all of the subjects. WB-MRI demonstrated that the prevalence of the vast majority of abnormalities increases with age."
https://openalex.org/W2016756453,"Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and sulfhydryl oxidase endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin-1α (Ero1α) constitute the pivotal pathway for oxidative protein folding in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ero1α oxidizes PDI to introduce disulfides into substrates, and PDI can feedback-regulate Ero1α activity. Here, we show the regulatory disulfide of Ero1α responds to the redox fluctuation in ER very sensitively, relying on the availability of redox active PDI. The regulation of Ero1α is rapidly facilitated by either a or a' catalytic domain of PDI, independent of the substrate binding domain. On the other hand, activated Ero1α specifically binds to PDI via hydrophobic interactions and preferentially catalyzes the oxidation of domain a'. This asymmetry ensures PDI to function simultaneously as an oxidoreductase and an isomerase. In addition, several PDI family members are also characterized to be potent regulators of Ero1α. The novel modes for PDI as a competent regulator and a specific substrate of Ero1α govern efficient and faithful oxidative protein folding and maintain the ER redox homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2009946921,"PET (positron emission tomography) imaging researches of functional metabolism using fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) of animal brain are important in neuroscience studies. FDG-PET imaging studies are often performed on groups of rats, so it is desirable to establish an objective voxel-based statistical methodology for group data analysis.This study establishes a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) toolbox (plug-ins) named spmratIHEP for voxel-wise analysis of FDG-PET images of rat brain, in which an FDG-PET template and an intracranial mask image of rat brain in Paxinos & Watson space were constructed, and the default settings were modified according to features of rat brain. Compared to previous studies, our constructed rat brain template comprises not only the cerebrum and cerebellum, but also the whole olfactory bulb which made the later cognitive studies much more exhaustive. And with an intracranial mask image in the template space, the brain tissues of individuals could be extracted automatically. Moreover, an atlas space is used for anatomically labeling the functional findings in the Paxinos & Watson space. In order to standardize the template image with the atlas accurately, a synthetic FDG-PET image with six main anatomy structures is constructed from the atlas, which performs as a target image in the co-registration.The spatial normalization procedure is evaluated, by which the individual rat brain images could be standardized into the Paxinos & Watson space successfully and the intracranial tissues could also be extracted accurately. The practical usability of this toolbox is evaluated using FDG-PET functional images from rats with left side middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in comparison to normal control rats. And the two-sample t-test statistical result is almost related to the left side MCA.We established a toolbox of SPM8 named spmratIHEP for voxel-wise analysis of FDG-PET images of rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W2040220737,"Annulus fibrosus (AF) injuries can lead to substantial deterioration of intervertebral disc (IVD) which characterizes degenerative disc disease (DDD). However, treatments for AF repair/regeneration remain challenging due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of AF tissue at cellular, biochemical, and biomechanical levels. In this study, we isolated and characterized a sub-population of cells from rabbit AF tissue which formed colonies in vitro and could self-renew. These cells showed gene expression of typical surface antigen molecules characterizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including CD29, CD44, and CD166. Meanwhile, they did not express negative markers of MSCs such as CD4, CD8, and CD14. They also expressed Oct-4, nucleostemin, and SSEA-4 proteins. Upon induced differentiation they showed typical osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis potential. Together, these AF-derived colony-forming cells possessed clonogenicity, self-renewal, and multi-potential differentiation capability, the three criteria characterizing MSCs. Such AF-derived stem cells may potentially be an ideal candidate for DDD treatments using cell therapies or tissue engineering approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2112047957,"The amounts of labile trace metals: [Co] (3 to 11 µg g−1), [Cu] (15 to 69 µg g−1), [Ni] (6 to 15 µg g−1), [Pb] (7 to 42 µg g−1), and [Zn] (65 to 500 µg g−1) in ash collected from the 2012 Williams Fire in Los Angeles, California attest to the role of fires in remobilizing industrial metals deposited in forests. These remobilized trace metals may be dispersed by winds, increasing human exposures, and they may be deposited in water bodies, increasing exposures in aquatic ecosystems. Correlations between the concentrations of these trace metals, normalized to Fe, in ash from the fire suggest that Co, Cu, and Ni in most of those samples were predominantly from natural sources, whereas Pb and Zn were enriched in some ash samples. The predominantly anthropogenic source of excess Pb in the ash was further demonstrated by its isotopic ratios (208Pb/207Pb: 206Pb/207Pb) that fell between those of natural Pb and leaded gasoline sold in California during the previous century. These analyses substantiate current human and environmental health concerns with the pyrogenic remobilization of toxic metals, which are compounded by projections of increases in the intensity and frequency of wildfires associated with climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2004804197,"Hybrid zones provide unprecedented opportunity for the study of the evolution of reproductive isolation, and the extent of hybridization across individuals and genomes can illuminate the degree of isolation. We examine patterns of interchromosomal linkage disequilibrium (ILD) and the presence of hybridization in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, in previously identified hybrid zones in the North Atlantic. Here, previously identified clinal loci were mapped to the cod genome with most (∼70%) occurring in or associated with (<5 kb) coding regions representing a diverse array of possible functions and pathways. Despite the observation that clinal loci were distributed across three linkage groups, elevated ILD was observed among all groups of clinal loci and strongest in comparisons involving a region of low recombination along linkage group 7. Evidence of ILD supports a hypothesis of divergence hitchhiking transitioning to genome hitchhiking consistent with reproductive isolation. This hypothesis is supported by Bayesian characterization of hybrid classes present and we find evidence of common F1 hybrids in several regions consistent with frequent interbreeding, yet little evidence of F2 or backcrossed individuals. This work suggests that significant barriers to hybridization and introgression exist among these co-occurring groups of cod either through strong selection against hybrid individuals, or genetic incompatibility and intrinsic barriers to hybridization. In either case, the presence of strong clinal trends, and little gene flow despite extensive hybridization supports a hypothesis of reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation in Atlantic cod. Further work is required to test the degree and nature of reproductive isolation in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1994146146,"The protein G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is a small basic protein that functions as an endogenous inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a key enzyme in intracellular lipolysis. In this study, we identified a short sequence covering residues Lys-20 to Ala-52 in G0S2 that is still fully capable of inhibiting mouse and human ATGL. We found that a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region inhibits ATGL in a noncompetitive manner in the nanomolar range. This peptide is highly selective for ATGL and does not inhibit other lipases, including hormone-sensitive lipase, monoacylglycerol lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and patatin domain-containing phospholipases 6 and 7. Because increased lipolysis is linked to the development of metabolic disorders, the inhibition of ATGL by G0S2-derived peptides may represent a novel therapeutic tool to modulate lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2025731166,"Bumblebees (Bombus species) are major pollinators of commercial crops and wildflowers but factors affecting their abundance, including causes of recent population declines, remain unclear. Investigating the ecology of species with expanding ranges provides a potentially powerful means of elucidating these factors. Such species may also bring novel pollination services to their new ranges. We therefore investigated landscape-scale habitat use and foraging preferences of the Tree Bumblebee, B. hypnorum, a recent natural colonist that has rapidly expanded its range in the UK over the past decade. Counts of B. hypnorum and six other Bombus species were made in March-June 2012 within a mixed landscape in south-eastern Norfolk, UK. The extent of different landscape elements around each transect was quantified at three scales (250 m, 500 m and 1500 m). We then identified the landscape elements that best predicted the density of B. hypnorum and other Bombus species. At the best fitting scale (250 m), B. hypnorum density was significantly positively associated with extent of both urban and woodland cover and significantly negatively associated with extent of oilseed rape cover. This combination of landscape predictors was unique to B. hypnorum. Urban and woodland cover were associated with B. hypnorum density at three and two, respectively, of the three scales studied. Relative to other Bombus species, B. hypnorum exhibited a significantly higher foraging preference for two flowering trees, Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa, and significantly lower preferences for Brassica napus, Glechoma hederacea and Lamium album. Our study provides novel, quantitative support for an association of B. hypnorum with urban and woodland landscape elements. Range expansion in B. hypnorum appears to depend, on exploitation of widespread habitats underutilised by native Bombus species, suggesting B. hypnorum will readily co-exist with these species. These findings suggest that management could target bumblebee species with distinctive habitat requirements to help maintain pollination services."
https://openalex.org/W2125080148,"Objectives Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (FB-BAL) is increasingly used for the microbiological confirmation of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in children with a chronic wet cough. At our centre, when performing FB-BAL for microbiological diagnosis we sample 6 lobes (including lingula) as this is known to increase the rate of culture positive procedures in children with cystic fibrosis. We investigated if this is also the case in children with PBB. Methods We undertook a retrospective case note review of 50 children investigated for suspected PBB between May 2011 and November 2013. Results The median (IQR) age at bronchoscopy was 2.9 (1.7–4.4) years and the median (IQR) duration of cough was 11 (8.0–14) months. Positive cultures were obtained from 41/50 (82%) and 16 (39%) of these patients isolated ≥2 organisms. The commonest organisms isolated were Haemophilus influenzae (25 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (11 patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (8 patients). If only one lobe had been sampled (as per the European Respiratory Society guidance) 17 different organisms would have been missed in 15 patients, 8 of whom would have had no organism cultured at all. The FB-BAL culture results led to an antibiotic other than co-amoxiclav being prescribed in 17/41 (41%) patients. Conclusions Bacterial distribution in the lungs of children with PBB is heterogeneous and organisms may therefore be missed if only one lobe is sampled at FB-BAL. Positive FB-BAL results are useful in children with PBB and can influence treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2038967212,"Background Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a difficult clinical challenge in colorectal cancer (CRC) because conventional treatment modalities could not produce significant survival benefit, which highlights the acute need for new treatment strategies. Our previous case-control study demonstrated the potential survival advantage of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) over CRS alone. This phase II study was to further investigate the efficacy and adverse events of CRS+HIPEC for Chinese patients with CRC PC. Methods A total of 60 consecutive CRC PC patients underwent 63 procedures consisting of CRS+HIPEC and postoperative chemotherapy, all by a designated team focusing on this combined treatment modality. All the clinico-pathological information was systematically integrated into a prospective database. The primary end point was disease-specific overall survival (OS), and the secondary end points were perioperative safety profiles. Results By the most recent database update, the median follow-up was 29.9 (range 3.5–108.9) months. The peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≤20 was in 47.0% of patients, complete cytoreductive surgery (CC0-1) was performed in 53.0% of patients. The median OS was 16.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.2–19.8) months, and the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 70.5%, 34.2%, 22.0% and 22.0%, respectively. Mortality and grades 3 to 5 morbidity rates in postoperative 30 days were 0.0% and 30.2%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified 3 parameters with significant effects on OS: PCI ≤20, CC0-1 and adjuvant chemotherapy over 6 cycles. On multivariate analysis, however, only CC0-1 and adjuvant chemotherapy ≥6 cycles were found to be independent factors for OS benefit. Discussion CRS+HIPEC at a specialized treatment center could improve OS for selected CRC PC patients from China, with acceptable perioperative safety."
https://openalex.org/W2001128489,"For decades, selenium research has been focused on the identification of active metabolites, which are crucial for selenium chemoprevention of cancer. In this context, the metabolite methylselenol (CH3SeH) is known for its action to selectively kill transformed cells through mechanisms that include increased formation of reactive oxygen species, induction of DNA damage, triggering of apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Here we reveal that CH3SeH modulates the cell surface expression of NKG2D ligands. The expression of NKG2D ligands is induced by stress-associated pathways that occur early during malignant transformation and enable the recognition and elimination of tumors by activating the lymphocyte receptor NKG2D. CH3SeH regulated NKG2D ligands both on the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional levels. CH3SeH induced the transcription of MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence MICA/B and ULBP2 mRNA. However, the induction of cell surface expression was restricted to the ligands MICA/B. Remarkably, our studies showed that CH3SeH inhibited ULBP2 surface transport through inhibition of the autophagic transport pathway. Finally, we identified extracellular calcium as being essential for CH3SeH regulation of NKG2D ligands. A balanced cell surface expression of NKG2D ligands is considered to be an innate barrier against tumor development. Therefore, our work indicates that the application of selenium compounds that are metabolized to CH3SeH could improve NKG2D-based immune therapy."

Zhong J. Gao D. Inuzuka H. Liu P. Wei W. DEPTOR ubiquitination and destruction by SCF(beta-TrCP).Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 303: E163-E169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DEPTOR levels are high in multiple myelomas, resulting in decreased mTORC1 activity, loss of mTORC1-mediated inhibition of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling, and increased cell survival (10.Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. DEPTOR is an mTOR inhibitor frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and required for their survival.Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel function for DEPTOR as a stemness factor that is important for maintenance of the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells. We show that the expression of DEPTOR is high in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells (mESCs and hESCs), and its levels are dramatically reduced in differentiated cells. No other known regulators of mTOR activity/signaling showed a similar decrease in expression during differentiation. Decrease in DEPTOR levels during differentiation of mESCs was accompanied by increased mTORC1 activity, as measured by S6 phosphorylation. More importantly, we show that knockdown of DEPTOR promoted differentiation of mESCs, even in the presence of small molecules required for maintenance of the undifferentiated state of stem cells. Our findings indicate that pluripotent stem cells employ high levels of DEPTOR to maintain stem cell renewal by limiting mTOR activity in undifferentiated cells. Upon initiation of differentiation, DEPTOR expression is down-regulated, resulting in increased mTOR activity required for efficient differentiation of stem cells. Mouse R1 ESCs cells (ATCC) and human H1 ESCs were maintained as described previously (15.Lamba D.A. Gust J. Reh T.A.

Production and transplantation of retinal cells from human and mouse embryonic stem cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 884: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% CO2, and 5% O2. HEK293T cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). Cells were grown under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Differentiation of mESCs was done in neuronal stem cell medium (17.La Torre A. Lamba D.A. Jayabalu A. Reh T.A. Production and transplantation of retinal cells from human and mouse embryonic stem cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 884: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For mRNA extractions, cells were removed from the plate using Accutase, and for protein extractions, cells were lysed directly in 1× gel loading buffer. Differentiation was done for 26 days and with medium change on alternate days. Samples were collected at the indicated times and analyzed. H1 hESCs were differentiated as described previously (16.Lamba D.A. Karl M.O. Ware C.B. Reh T.A. Efficient generation of retinal progenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12769-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells. R1 mESCs were infected with virus in the presence of 8 µg/ml Polybrene (EMD Millipore Corp.), and the medium was changed into normal growth medium 2 days after infection. Drug selection (puromycin, 2 µg/ml) was started 3 days after infection, and the cells were selected in the drug medium for at least 3 days prior to use. mRNA from R1 mESCs was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 1 µg of mRNA was amplified (Taqman RT-PCR kit from Applied Biosystems), and 1% of this reaction was analyzed in qPCR (Bioline SensiFAST Probe No-ROX mix). Primers and probe pairs for each gene were used based on recommendations from Roche Applied Science. mRNA from H1 hESCs was extracted using the RT-PCR kit from Roche Applied Science and amplified using a Bio-Rad cDNA kit. qPCR was done using gene-specific primers and SYBR Green mix from Bio-Rad. Actin was used as an internal control. Protein samples were boiled in 1× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and Western blot analysis was done as described previously (6.Agrawal P. Chen Y.T. Schilling B. Gibson B.W. Hughes R.E. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X) modulates activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).J. Biol.

R1 mESCs were plated on Matrigel-coated coverslips, and immunofluorescence analysis was done as described previously, except permeabilization and blocking was done using 0.3% Triton X-100, 5% FBS in PBS (6.Agrawal P. Chen Y.T. Schilling B. Gibson B.W. Hughes R.E. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X) modulates activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).J. Biol.

LASAGNA-Search was used to identify OCT4 binding sites in the mouse and human promoter regions up to 950 bp upstream of the transcription start sites of the DEPTOR, PRAS40, and TSC2 genes. Only sequences with p values of <0.001 were analyzed and confirmed with the UCSC Genome Browser. DEPTOR is a negative regulator of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. To determine whether DEPTOR plays a role in regulating mTOR signaling in stem cells, we measured changes in DEPTOR levels upon mESC differentiation. We differentiated mESCs toward neuronal fate using our previously published protocol using Wnt and TGF-β inhibitors along with IGF1 for 10 days as monolayers (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.) (18.Torres J. Prieto J. Durupt F.C. Broad S. Watt F.M. Efficient differentiation of embryonic stem cells into mesodermal precursors by BMP, retinoic acid and Notch signalling.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e36405Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, differentiation of R1 mESCs resulted in a dramatic decrease in DEPTOR protein levels. Similar decreases were observed for the pluripotency markers OCT4 and NANOG (Fig. 1A). We also observed a decrease in Deptor mRNA levels (Fig. 1B), suggesting that DEPTOR transcription is turned off during differentiation. Differentiation of R1 mESCs into neurons was confirmed by changes in cell morphology and immunofluorescence (Fig. 1, C and D). The differentiation was efficient, as can be seen from the loss of pluripotency marker OCT4 and the presence of differentiation markers PAX6 and DCX (Fig. 1D). Consistent with Western blot and qPCR analysis, DEPTOR was absent from the differentiated cells, whereas a high level of cytoplasmic DEPTOR was detected in mESCs (Fig. 1D). It is known that knockdown of pluripotency markers, including Oct4, results in differentiation of mESCs. Interestingly, DEPTOR transcript levels were decreased upon Oct4 knockdown in mESCs, as measured by microarray expression profiling (19.Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). We confirmed this by qPCR using gene-specific primers. As shown in Fig. 1E, knockdown of Oct4 using shRNA in R1 mESCs resulted in decreased DEPTOR expression in the cells. There was a concomitant decrease in two other pluripotency markers, Nanog and Zfp42. More importantly, the decrease in DEPTOR levels was similar in magnitude to that of Nanog and Zfp42. Fig. 2 shows time courses for DEPTOR and OCT4 mRNA (A) and protein (B) expression during differentiation toward a neural lineage over a 10-day period. Expression of the differentiation markers β3-tubulin and NeuN of these cells at day 10 is shown in Fig. 2C.FIGURE 2.Kinetics of DEPTOR and Oct4 expression during mESCs differentiation. R1 mESCs were differentiated for 10 days on Matrigel-coated plates in the presence of IGF and inhibitors of TGF-β and BMP. Cells were collected before the start of differentiation (D0) each day for 10 days after the initiation of differentiation (D1–D10). A, Deptor and Oct4 mRNA expression were measured by qPCR. B, protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis. In both cases, actin was used as a control. C, differentiation of R1 mESCs was further analyzed at day 10 by immunofluorescence for the presence of differentiation markers β-tubulin, and NeuN. Scale bar, 50 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize changes in mTOR signaling associated with ESC differentiation, we assayed mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity in cells by measuring the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and Akt (protein kinase B), respectively. Differentiation of R1 mESCs resulted in a dramatic increase in S6 phosphorylation, indicating increased mTORC1 activity. We also observed increased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 4E-BP upon differentiation (not shown). Fig. 3A shows a time course of S6 phosphorylation after 3, 6, and 10 days of differentiation. The ratios of phosphorylated S6 (pS6) to total S6 (tS6) protein at these time points are shown in Fig. 3B. Fig. 3C shows representative Western blots for mTOR substrates and interacting proteins at day 1 (Undiff.) and 10 days (Diff.) following directed differentiation. We did not observe increased AKT phosphorylation at the mTORC2 site Ser-473. However, we observed a change in AKT migration on SDS-PAGE. In differentiated cells, AKT migrated slowly, suggesting that it had other post-translational modifications. We also observed an increase in total AKT upon differentiation. There was also a decrease in mTOR and a number of its key interacting proteins upon differentiation. RAPTOR and RICTOR, components of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively, showed modestly decreased protein levels (∼40%) with differentiation. PRAS40, an mTOR-interacting protein that negatively regulates mTOR activity, and TSC2, an upstream inhibitor of mTOR signaling, also decreased with differentiation to a similar extent, suggestive of a tight control in mTOR signaling. However, none of these regulators of mTOR decreased to the same degree as DEPTOR during differentiation. Although we observed a decrease in mTOR levels, the fraction of mTOR phosphorylated at both Ser-2448 and Ser-2481 showed a modest increase with differentiation (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448 and Ser-2481 has been shown to correlate with mTOR activation (20.Rosner M. Siegel N. Valli A. Fuchs C. Hengstschläger M. mTOR phosphorylated at S2448 binds to raptor and rictor.Amino Acids. 2010; 38: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21.Soliman G.A. Acosta-Jaquez H.A. Dunlop E.A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 7866-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fig. 3D shows quantification of these observations from multiple experimental replicates (n = 3 in each case). Our data indicate that during differentiation of mESCs toward neuronal fate, there is a modest decrease in levels of mTOR signaling components associated with an increase in mTORC1 activity. However, DEPTOR uniquely is turned off completely, indicating its critical requirement in pluripotent stem cells. To determine whether DEPTOR has a conserved role in human ESCs, we analyzed DEPTOR levels in undifferentiated or 2-week differentiated H1 hESCs. Cells were differentiated toward a neuronal lineage using DKK, IGF1, and Noggin (15.Lamba D.A. Gust J. Reh T.A. Transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived photoreceptors restores some visual function in Crx-deficient mice.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 73-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 16.Lamba D.A. Karl M.O. Ware C.B. Reh T.A. Efficient generation of retinal progenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12769-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). After 2 weeks of differentiation, cells were analyzed for OCT4, PAX6, and DEPTOR expression using qPCR. As seen in Fig. 4, differentiation of H1 hESCs was accompanied by down-regulation of DEPTOR expression. This was associated with loss of OCT4 expression and a gain of PAX6 expression indicative of neural lineage. Reduction in DEPTOR levels with hESC differentiation, in a manner similar to that observed in mESCs, indicates that this mechanism for regulating mTOR signaling during stem cells differentiation is conserved between mice and humans. To test if DEPTOR played a role in the maintenance of mESC pluripotency, we reduced DEPTOR levels in the cells using shRNA. R1 mESCs were infected with lentivirus expressing either control shRNA constructs or shRNA targeting DEPTOR (FIGURE 5., FIGURE 6.). Following infection, drug selection was used to enrich for cells expressing shRNA. Knockdown of DEPTOR (shRNA2) was verified by qPCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, A and B). DEPTOR knockdown cells displayed differentiation phenotypes in culture conditions (+LIF +2i) used to maintain pluripotent mESCs within 3–5 days of drug selection. This included a loss in the tightly packed refractile colony morphology of mESC colonies (Figs. 5C and 6B) (22.Davey R.E. Zandstra P.W.

Ng D.Y. Jayakumaran G. Wood G.A. Koide H.

These results suggest that DEPTOR is a key regulator of differentiation in mESCs. Interestingly, we observed that the differentiation phenotype was sensitive to the degree of DEPTOR knockdown. When a different shRNA sequence targeting DEPTOR (shRNA4) giving less than 80% knockdown was used, differentiation of mESCs was observed only in media lacking LIF but still containing two inhibitors involved in maintaining ESC fate (Fig. 6) (24.Nichols J. Silva J. Roode M. Smith A. Suppression of Erk signalling promotes ground state pluripotency in the mouse embryo.Development. 2009; 136: 3215-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This suggests that mESCs are extremely sensitive to DEPTOR levels, and even small amounts of DEPTOR can promote the pluripotent phenotype. Fig. 6 also shows the effects of DEPTOR shRNA4 on expression of pluripotent markers (A), colony morphology (B), and induction of expression of the endodermal and ectodermal differentiation markers Hnf4A and Pax6, respectively (C).FIGURE 6.Validation of DEPTOR knockdown-mediated mESC differentiation. A, R1 mESCs were infected with control or DEPTOR shRNA4, and cells were selected using puromycin. Cells were then grown in the absence of LIF, mRNA was extracted, and qPCR was performed for Deptor, Oct4, Nanog, and Zfp42 as in Fig. 1. Actin was used as an internal control. B, morphological change of R1 mESCs upon DEPTOR knockdown in A was analyzed under phase contrast, and representative images are shown.

Error bars, S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whereas differentiation or knockdown of the transcription factor OCT4 resulted in reduced expression of DEPTOR and other pluripotent markers to similar degrees (Fig. 1, B and E), knockdown of DEPTOR had more modest effects on expression of OCT4 (Fig. 5A). This suggested that DEPTOR expression might be regulated by OCT4 directly. We searched for potential OCT4 binding sites in the promoter region of DEPTOR as well as in genes encoding other mTOR pathway regulators, TSC2 and PRAS40 (AKT1S1), using LASAGNA-Search (25.Lee C. Huang C.H. LASAGNA-Search: an integrated web tool for transcription factor binding site search and visualization.BioTechniques. 2013; 54: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Upstream promoter regions of these genes were compared with the JASPAR (human) and TRANSFAC (mouse) public databases for predicted OCT4 binding motifs. Both human and the mouse DEPTOR promoters contain highly significant predicted OCT4 binding sites (human DEPTOR promoter, p value = 0.000575; mouse DEPTOR promoter, p value = 0.00035). The human promoter also has a predicted binding site for SOX2 (a pluripotency transcription factor) immediately adjacent to the OCT4 binding site. The same analysis of the PRAS40 and TSC2 promoters predicted no OCT4 binding sites. This result is consistent with our observation of changes in PRAS40 and TSC2 levels during differentiation of mESCs (Fig. 3B). Our studies establish a novel role for DEPTOR as a stemness factor that promotes pluripotency of stem cells. DEPTOR is the only endogenous negative regulator of mTOR known to inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities (10.Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. DEPTOR is an mTOR inhibitor frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and required for their survival.Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). DEPTOR acts as a tumor suppressor, and DEPTOR knockdown results in increased mTORC1/2 signaling. At high levels, DEPTOR facilitates increased mTORC2 activity by inhibiting negative feedback and promotes cell survival (10.Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. DEPTOR is an mTOR inhibitor frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and required for their survival.Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Given its central role in coupling growth factor and nutrient signaling with metabolism and growth, the mTOR pathway has emerged as a critical regulator of stem cell maintenance. Activation of mTOR signaling through deletion of negative regulators, TSC1 and PTEN, or gain of function of mTOR activators, RHEB2 and AKT, in mouse hematopoietic stem cell populations results in hyperproliferation and decreased SC pools (3.Chen C.

Conversely, modest reduction in mTOR activity with rapamycin results in enhanced self-renewal of SC populations by preventing uncontrolled cell growth and exhaustion (2.Castilho R.M. Squarize C.H.

Gutkind J.S. mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Studies in Drosophila germ line and intestinal SCs have also demonstrated a role for TSC1/2 in mTOR regulation of SC maintenance (28.Kapuria S. Karpac J. Biteau B. Hwangbo D. Jasper H. Notch-mediated suppression of TSC2 expression regulates cell differentiation in the Drosophila intestinal stem cell lineage.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1003045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29.Sun P. Quan Z. Zhang B. Wu T. Xi R. TSC1/2 tumour suppressor complex maintains Drosophila germline stem cells by preventing differentiation.Development. 2010; 137: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the stemness factor USP9X is a negative regulator of mTOR and muscle stem cell differentiation (6.Agrawal P. Chen Y.T. Schilling B. Gibson B.W. Hughes R.E. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X) modulates activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21164-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of inhibiting mTOR signaling to maintain the regenerative capacity of stem cells. Here we describe a novel and specific role for DEPTOR in this process. Differentiation of mESCs toward a neuronal fate was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in DEPTOR (Fig. 1). No DEPTOR was observed in differentiated cells, as measured by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1D). Moreover, knockdown of OCT4 drastically reduced Deptor to levels comparable with those of the pluripotency markers Nanog and Zfp42 (Fig. 1E), indicating that it might have a critical role in SC maintenance. To investigate this, we knocked down DEPTOR levels in mESCs using shRNA. This was sufficient to cause these cells to differentiate (FIGURE 5., FIGURE 6.). DEPTOR knockdown with shRNA also caused reduction in pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog, and Zfp42. Based on the knockdown data and bioinformatics analysis, Deptor plays a role downstream of OCT4. Recent work has shown that SOX2-induced suppression of mTOR is necessary for induced pluripotent stem cell generation (8.Wang S. Xia P. Ye B. Huang G. Liu J. Fan Z. Transient activation of autophagy via Sox2-mediated suppression of mTOR is an important early step in reprogramming to pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and although they did not look at DEPTOR, it is plausible that DEPTOR is the intermediate in the process based on our data. Overall, the Deptor-mTOR pathway very likely modulates pluripotency by regulating protein synthesis and autophagy by post-transcriptionally balancing the pluripotency network and repressing the differentiation network (9.Zhou J. Su P. Wang L. Chen J. Zimmermann M. Genbacev O. Afonja O. Horne M.C. Tanaka T. Duan E. Fisher S.J. Liao J. Chen J. Wang F. mTOR supports long-term self-renewal and suppresses mesoderm and endoderm activities of human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Autophagy regulates homeostasis of pluripotency-associated proteins in hESCs.Stem Cells. 2014; 32: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to mESCs, DEPTOR levels were dramatically decreased upon differentiation of human ESCs (Fig. 4). This suggests that the function of DEPTOR in stem cell maintenance is conserved. Given the decrease in DEPTOR levels with differentiation, it is not surprising that DEPTOR is absent in most adult tissues and in primary cell lines that have committed to a defined cell fate. These results indicate that DEPTOR is a novel stemness factor that predominantly functions in stem cells as an on/off switch to regulate mTOR signaling. To further characterize the modulation of mTOR signaling during differentiation, we analyzed the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. S6 phosphorylation increased 2–3-fold with differentiation in mESC, indicating a strong increase in mTORC1 activity (Fig. 3). This is consistent with what is seen during hESC differentiation (32.Easley 4th, C.A. Ben-Yehudah A. Redinger C.J. Oliver S.L. Varum S.T. Eisinger V.M. Carlisle D.L. Donovan P.J. Schatten G.P. mTOR-mediated activation of p70 S6K induces differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells.Cell. Reprogram. 2010; 12: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We did not observe any significant change in mTORC2 activity during differentiation (Fig. 3). Several groups have reported that constitutive activation of mTORC1 substrate S6K1 can reduce mTORC2 activity (33.Corradetti M.N. Guan K.L.

Balancing Akt with S6K: implications for both metabolic diseases and tumorigenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that we did not observe changes in mTORC2 activity in differentiated cells due to hyperactivation of mTORC1. However, we did observe that AKT levels increased upon differentiation and that a majority of AKT migrated slowly in SDS-PAGE, suggestive of posttranslational modification. AKT activity is known to be regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and sumoylation (38.Fan C.D. Lum M.A. Xu C. Black J.D. Wang X. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of phospho-AKT dynamics by the ubiquitin E3 ligase, NEDD4-1, in the insulin-like growth factor-1 response.J. Biol.

AKT/PKB signaling: navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4692) Google Scholar). We also observed small but significant decreases in the levels of mTOR itself and several canonical mTOR-interacting proteins upon differentiation (Fig. 3). Decreased RICTOR and TSC2 levels with differentiation are consistent with a previous report that analyzed mTOR signaling during differentiation of hESCs (32.Easley 4th, C.A. Ben-Yehudah A. Redinger C.J. Oliver S.L. Varum S.T. Eisinger V.M. Carlisle D.L. Donovan P.J. Schatten G.P. mTOR-mediated activation of p70 S6K induces differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells.Cell. Reprogram. 2010; 12: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Reduction of TSC2 levels that we observed with differentiation of mESCs is consistent with the work done in Drosophila intestinal SCs, where knockdown of TSC2 caused an increased mTOR activity and loss of SC pools due to enhanced differentiation (28.Kapuria S. Karpac J. Biteau B. Hwangbo D. Jasper H. Notch-mediated suppression of TSC2 expression regulates cell differentiation in the Drosophila intestinal stem cell lineage.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1003045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

Med. 2010; 16: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that PRAS40 levels decreased with differentiation of mESCs (Fig. 3). USP9X is a stemness gene that promotes self-renewal of neural progenitors (42.Jolly L.A. Taylor V. Wood S.A. USP9X enhances the polarity and self-renewal of embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2015-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The decrease that we observed in USP9X levels upon differentiation of mESCs is in agreement with the inhibitory effect of USP9X on differentiation (Fig. 3). We note that the magnitudes of decrease in mTOR levels and in the levels of its interactors were similar (∼40% in all cases), suggesting that the stoichiometries of these components in mTOR complexes were not altered during differentiation. This is in contrast to the significant decrease in DEPTOR levels relative to other mTORC components. The decrease in DEPTOR levels was comparable with that of pluripotency markers in the differentiated mESCs. This was also accompanied by increased mTORC1 activity. This indicates that DEPTOR-mediated regulation of mTOR signaling is critical to the maintenance of pluripotent stem cell populations, and disruption of this results in differentiation of stem cells. Recently, it was shown that inhibition of mTOR activity by resveratrol increased the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming to form induced pluripotent stem cells (43.Chen T. Shen L. Yu J. Wan H. Guo A. Chen J. Long Y. Zhao J. Pei G. Rapamycin and other longevity-promoting compounds enhance the generation of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells.Aging Cell. 2011; 10: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Resveratrol is known to cause inhibition of mTOR activity by promoting the association of DEPTOR with mTOR (44.Liu M. Wilk S.A. Wang A. Zhou L. Wang R.H. Ogawa W. Deng C. Dong L.Q. Liu F. Resveratrol inhibits mTOR signaling by promoting the interaction between mTOR and DEPTOR.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36387-36394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a model where increased DEPTOR inhibition of mTOR facilitates the transition from non-stem cell to pluripotent states. Complete mTOR inhibition in hESCs promotes increased differentiation toward mesodermal and endodermal lineages (9.Zhou J. Su P. Wang L. Chen J. Zimmermann M. Genbacev O. Afonja O. Horne M.C. Tanaka T. Duan E. Fisher S.J. Liao J. Chen J. Wang F. mTOR supports long-term self-renewal and suppresses mesoderm and endoderm activities of human embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rapamycin promotes the osteoblastic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells by blocking the mTOR pathway and stimulating the BMP/Smad pathway.Stem Cells Dev. 2010; 19: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This is not surprising, given that loss of mTOR signaling in mESCs results in a loss of ESC viability (7.Murakami M. Ichisaka T. Maeda M. Oshiro N. Hara K. Edenhofer F. Kiyama H. Yonezawa K. Yamanaka S. mTOR is essential for growth and proliferation in early mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6710-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). As discussed above, hyperactivation of mTOR can lead to proliferation and depletion of the stem cell pool. Based on these studies, it appears that a fine balance of mTOR activity is required in ESCs and that complete inhibition and/or overactivation of mTOR functions can cause reduced pluripotency in ESCs. Our data indicate that DEPTOR is a stemness factor that helps to maintain this balance of mTOR signaling in ESCs. High levels of DEPTOR in ESCs modulate mTOR activity to facilitate self-renewal. When conditions are favorable for differentiation, mTOR activity increases, accompanied by a reduction in DEPTOR levels. Because mTOR can promote down-regulation of DEPTOR, this results in a positive feedback loop that ensures continued mTOR signaling and thereby efficient differentiation of cells. Our study provides a novel connection between DEPTOR and mTOR regulation in stem cells that can be modulated to favor either increased regeneration through enhanced DEPTOR activity or differentiation through DEPTOR inhibition. Regulation of stem cell pluripotency is critical for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis in the adult. The mTOR pathway, a central modulator of cell growth and proliferation in response to growth factor and nutrient signaling, is known to have a role in stem cell differentiation. We show that DEPTOR, an inhibitor of TORC1 activity, is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells and is significantly down-regulated as they differentiate. The expression pattern of DEPTOR during ESC differentiation is similar to that of the other known stemness genes Oct4, Nanog, and Zfp24. We demonstrate that DEPTOR knockdown is sufficient to promote differentiation of ESCs and that DEPTOR is a critical stemness factor regulating the role of mTOR in maintaining stem cell pluripotency.

We aimed at elucidating the apoptotic mechanisms involved in immunotoxicity of ATR and their attenuation by Melatonin (MEL). Young Swiss mice were divided into control, ATR and MEL+ATR groups based on daily (x14) intraperitoneal administration of the vehicle (normal saline), ATR (100 mg/kg body weight) and MEL (20 mg/kg body weight) with ATR. Isolated splenocytes were processed for detection of apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC and TUNEL assays, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by immunostaining. Key proteins involved in apoptosis, ER stress and autophagy were quantified by immunoblotting. ATR treatment resulted in Fas-mediated activation of caspases 8 and 3 and inactivation of PARP1 which were inhibited significantly by co-treatment with MEL. MEL also attenuated the ATR-induced, p53 independent mitochondrial apoptosis through upregulation of E2F-1 and PUMA and suppression of their downstream target Bax. An excessive ER stress triggered by ATR through overexpression of ATF-6α, spliced XBP-1, CREB-2 and GADD153 signals was reversed by MEL. MEL also reversed the ATR-induced impairment of autophagy which was indicated by a decline in BECN-1, along with significant enhancement in LC3B-II and p62 expressions. Induction of mitochondrial apoptosis, ER stress and autophagy dysregulation provide a new insight into the mechanism of ATR immunotoxicity. The cytoprotective role of MEL, on the other hand, was defined by attenuation of ER stress, Fas-mediated and p53 independent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis as well as autophagy signals."
https://openalex.org/W2075909441,"V-ATPase (V(o)V1) converts the chemical free energy of ATP into an ion-motive force across the cell membrane via mechanical rotation. This energy conversion requires proper interactions between the rotor and stator in V(o)V1 for tight coupling among chemical reaction, torque generation, and ion transport. We developed an Escherichia coli expression system for Enterococcus hirae V(o)V1 (EhV(o)V1) and established a single-molecule rotation assay to measure the torque generated. Recombinant and native EhV(o)V1 exhibited almost identical dependence of ATP hydrolysis activity on sodium ion and ATP concentrations, indicating their functional equivalence. In a single-molecule rotation assay with a low load probe at high ATP concentration, EhV(o)V1 only showed the ""clear"" state without apparent backward steps, whereas EhV1 showed two states, ""clear"" and ""unclear."" Furthermore, EhV(o)V1 showed slower rotation than EhV1 without the three distinct pauses separated by 120° that were observed in EhV1. When using a large probe, EhV(o)V1 showed faster rotation than EhV1, and the torque of EhV(o)V1 estimated from the continuous rotation was nearly double that of EhV1. On the other hand, stepping torque of EhV1 in the clear state was comparable with that of EhV(o)V1. These results indicate that rotor-stator interactions of the V(o) moiety and/or sodium ion transport limit the rotation driven by the V1 moiety, and the rotor-stator interactions in EhV(o)V1 are stabilized by two peripheral stalks to generate a larger torque than that of isolated EhV1. However, the torque value was substantially lower than that of other rotary ATPases, implying the low energy conversion efficiency of EhV(o)V1."
https://openalex.org/W2146835807,"Background Many commentators on “direct-to-consumer” genetic risk information have raised concerns that giving results to individuals with insufficient knowledge and training in genomics may harm consumers, the health care system, and society. In response, several commercial laboratories offering genomic risk profiling have shifted to more traditional “direct-to-provider” (DTP) marketing strategies, repositioning clinicians as the intended recipients of advertising of laboratory services and as gatekeepers to personal genomic information. Increasing popularity of next generation sequencing puts a premium on ensuring that those who are charged with interpreting, translating, communicating and managing commercial genomic risk information are appropriately equipped for the job. To shed light on their gatekeeping role, we conducted a study to assess how and why early clinical users of genomic risk assessment incorporate these tools in their clinical practices and how they interpret genomic information for their patients. Methods and Findings We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 18 clinicians providing genomic risk assessment services to their patients in partnership with DNA Direct and Navigenics. Our findings suggest that clinicians learned most of what they knew about genomics directly from the commercial laboratories. Clinicians rely on the expertise of the commercial laboratories without the ability to critically evaluate the knowledge or assess risks. Conclusions DTP service delivery model cannot guarantee that providers will have adequate expertise or sound clinical judgment. Even if clinicians want greater genomic knowledge, the current market structure is unlikely to build the independent substantive expertise of clinicians, but rather promote its continued outsourcing. Because commercial laboratories have the most “skin in the game” financially, genetics professionals and policymakers should scrutinize the scientific validity and clinical soundness of the process by which these laboratories interpret their findings to assess whether self-interested commercial sources are the most appropriate entities for gate-keeping genomic interpretation."

Establishing a complete reconstitution system for eukaryotic translation has lagged behind prokaryote translation reconstitution partly because the initiation phase for eukaryotic translation is far more complicated than that of prokaryotes. In 1996, Pestova et al. (7.Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Shatsky I.N. Canonical eukaryotic initiation factors determine initiation of translation by internal ribosomal entry.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) successfully reconstituted eukaryotic translation initiation. That system depended on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a cardiovirus of the picornavirus family, and it included purified eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (7.Pestova T.V.

Initiation factor-independent translation mediated by the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site.RNA. 2006; 12: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reconstituted HCV IRES-dependent translation with translation elongation factors, aminoacyl-tRNAs, and ribosomal subunits (40 and 60 S) in the presence of a relatively high concentration of magnesium to synthesize radiolabeled peptides (3–7 kDa). In that system, translation proceeded without eIFs because the 80 S ribosome could initiate translation by directly binding to the HCV IRES under the conditions used (13.Lancaster A.M. Jan E. Sarnow P. Initiation factor-independent translation mediated by the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site.RNA. 2006; 12: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The genome of EMCV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of 7.9 kb. Upon infection, the EMCV RNA is translated into a single polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into structural (capsid) and nonstructural proteins mostly through the actions of the virally encoded protease 3C (14.Palmenberg A.C. Proteolytic processing of picornaviral polyprotein.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The primary event in processing the EMCV polyprotein is the cleavage that occurs between nonstructural proteins 2A (144 amino acids) and 2B (148 amino acids) independently of the 3C protease (15.Hahn H. Palmenberg A.C. Mutational analysis of the encephalomyocarditis virus primary cleavage.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6870-6875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), an aphthovirus of the picornavirus family, demonstrated that the C-terminal 18 amino acids of 2A plus the first amino acid (proline) of 2B are responsible for this processing event (16.Ryan M.D. Drew J.

Site-directed mutagenesis of these 19 amino acids in EMCV and FMDV revealed that the amino acid sequence, NPGP, is critically important for this processing event; NPG are the C-terminal three amino acids of 2A, and the last P represents the first amino acid of 2B (15.Hahn H.

Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) proposed a model in which the C-terminal 18-amino acid sequence of 2A modulates the activity of the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) of the ribosome. Thus, the peptidyl (2A)-tRNAGly ester linkage is hydrolyzed before it forms a peptide bond with the prolyl-tRNA in the A site (18.Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D.

Experiments in a yeast system substantiated that hypothesis and suggested that eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1 and eRF3) played a key role in the reaction (19.Doronina V.A.

To construct plasmids for expression of C-terminally HA-tagged proteins, the coding regions of Rluc, β-actin, PABP, and β-gal with the HA tag at the C terminus were inserted into the plasmid pUC-T7-HCV-MCS-ter (20.Mikami S.

Overlap PCR was used to change each amino acid of the C-terminal 18 amino acids of 2A and the N-terminal four amino acids of 2B into alanine in the plasmid pUC-T7-HCV 2A (18 aa)-2B-FLAG. The wild type nucleotide sequence (aat cca ggg ccc for NPGP) was mutated by overlap PCR into silent-1 (aac ccc gga cca) and silent-2 (aac cct ggt cct) sequences in the plasmid pUC-T7-HCV HA-2A-2B-HA to generate pUC-T7-HCV HA-2A(silent-1)2B-HA and pUC-T7-HCV HA-2A(silent-2)2B-HA, respectively. Neither mutation alters the amino acid sequence. To construct the plasmid pUC-T7-HCV HA-2A-HA-2B (22 aa), the following mutations were introduced in pUC-T7-HCV HA-2A-2B by PCR with appropriate primers. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of 2B was changed from PFMFRPRKQVFQTQGAA to PFEYDYDVPDYAGQGAA where the HA sequence is underlined, and the C-terminal 22 amino acids of 2B were replaced with amino acids AHYAGYFADLLIHDIETNPGPF without a stop codon. To construct the plasmid pUC-T7-HCV HA-2A(uORF2) for producing a tRNA-conjugated peptide, the C-terminal 22 amino acids of 2A were replaced with amino acids MQPLVLSAKKLSSLLTCKYIPP with a termination codon (TAA). Three eEF1 DNA sequences (eEF1A, eEF1Bγ, and eEF1Bα) carried in expression vectors pUC-T7-EMCV-His-eEF1A, pUC-T7-EMCV-His-eEF1Bγ, and pUC-T7-EMCV-eEF1Bα were co-transfected into BHK-21 cells that were infected with a vaccinia virus (LO-T7-1), which conferred expression of T7 RNA polymerase, as described previously (24.Machida K.

Two days later, cells were harvested and frozen at −85 °C. The frozen cells (∼2 g) were suspended in 30 ml of buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, one tablet of a mixture of protease inhibitors; Nacalai). The cells were lysed by vortexing and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (bed volume, 0.4 ml; Qiagen), and unbound proteins were removed by washing with 4 ml of buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole). Then the resin was washed with 4 ml of the same buffer but with the KCl concentration reduced to 100 mm. The eEF1 complex, which consisted of His-eEF1A, His-eEF1Bγ, and eEF1Bα, was eluted in a stepwise manner with increasing concentrations of imidazole (50, 100, 250, and 1000 mm) in 1.2 ml of buffer (0.1 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol). The eluates with 50, 100, and 250 mm imidazole were combined and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration column (120 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). Elution was carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1.5-ml fractions were collected with the ÄKTAprime plus system (GE Healthcare). The fractions that contained the eEF1 complex were combined and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (molecular weight cutoff, 30,000; Millipore) to ∼0.1 ml. The final protein concentration of the sample was 15–30 mg/ml. HeLa S3 cells (3–4 × 109) were suspended in buffer (10 ml; 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and disrupted by nitrogen pressure (1 megapascal for 30 min) in a Mini-Bomb cell disruption chamber (Kontes) on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was again centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 16 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for tRNA purification (see “Purification of tRNAs”). The pellet (crude ribosomal pellet) was suspended in buffer (8 ml; 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.25 m sucrose) by mixing with a magnetic stirrer for 4 h on ice. After addition of 3 m KCl (1.6 ml), stirring was further continued for 2 h, and the sample was then centrifuged at 25,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor for 16 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation and centrifuged. The supernatant was brought to 70% saturation in ammonium sulfate, and precipitates were collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in buffer (2.5 ml; 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and passed through a PD-10 column equilibrated with the same buffer. The eluate (3.5 ml) was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose resin (0.3 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer. After being washed with the same buffer (3 ml), proteins were eluted out in a stepwise manner that increased the concentration of KCl from 100 to 1000 mm in buffer (0.9 ml each; 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Eluates with 100 and 200 mm KCl were combined and passed through a PD-10 column equilibrated with the same buffer containing 50 mm KCl. The eluate was then applied to a phosphocellulose column (P11; 0.2 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer containing 50 mm KCl. After washing with the same buffer (2 ml), proteins were eluted out with buffer (0.6 ml; 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) with an increasing concentration of KCl (100, 200, 300, 500, and 1000 mm). Eluates with 100 and 200 mm KCl were combined and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (molecular weight cutoff, 50,000) to ∼0.05–0.1 ml. The final concentration of the sample was 2.0–3.5 mg/ml. The presence of eEF2 in each fraction was monitored by Western blotting with anti-eEF2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). GST-eRF1 and GST-eRF3 were expressed in bacterial strain BL-21(DE3) transformed with pGEX6P-eRF1 and pGEX6P-eRF3, respectively, and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) as described (26.Mikami S.

Purif. 2006; 46 (b): 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Non-tagged eRF1 and eRF3 proteins were cleaved from the GST tag with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) as described (26.Mikami S. Masutani M. Sonenberg N. Yokoyama S. Imataka H.

Chromatography with SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was used to complete purification of eRF3. The final concentration of each sample was 0.8–1.0 mg/ml. Because eight ARSs (Glu-ProRS, IleRS, LeuRS, MetRS, GlnRS, LysRS, ArgRS, and AspRS) exist as a multiprotein complex (27.Kaminska M. Havrylenko S. Decottignies P. Gillet S. Le Maréchal P.

Ten of the remaining ARSs were individually expressed in the LO-T7–1-infected BHK-21 cells by transfection with pUC-T7-EMCV-GST-AlaRS, -CysRS, -GlyRS, -HisRS, -AsnRS, -SerRS, -ThrRS, -ValRS, -TrpRS, or -TyrRS. The GST tags were removed from these ARSs individually as described above. PheRSα and PheRSβ were expressed with His tags in the vectors pUC-T7-EMCV-His-PheRSα and pUC-T7-EMCV-His-PheRSβ. These constructs were co-transfected into LO-T7–1-infected BHK-21 cells, and a mixture of His-PheRSα and His-PheRSβ was purified as described for eEF1.

https://openalex.org/W2091768537,"In this work we investigate the role of CHIP in a new CHIP-mutation related ataxia and the therapeutic potential of trehalose. The patient's fibroblasts with a new form of hereditary ataxia, related to STUB1 gene (CHIP) mutations, and three age and sex-matched controls were treated with epoxomicin and trehalose. The effects on cell death, protein misfolding and proteostasis were evaluated. Recent studies have revealed that mutations in STUB-1 gene lead to a growing list of molecular defects as deregulation of protein quality, inhibition of proteasome, cell death, decreased autophagy and alteration in CHIP and HSP70 levels. In this CHIP-mutant patient fibroblasts the inhibition of proteasome with epoxomicin induced severe pathophysiological age-associated changes, cell death and protein ubiquitination. Additionally, treatment with epoxomicin produced a dose-dependent increase in the number of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells. However, co-treatment with trehalose, a disaccharide of glucose present in a wide variety of organisms and known as a autophagy enhancer, reduced these pathological events. Trehalose application also increased CHIP and HSP70 expression and GSH free radical levels. Furthermore, trehalose augmented macro and chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA), rising the levels of LC3, LAMP2, CD63 and increasing the expression of Beclin-1 and Atg5-Atg12. Trehalose treatment in addition increased the percentage of immunoreactive cells to HSC70 and LAMP2 and reduced the autophagic substrate, p62. Although this is an individual case based on only one patient and the statistical comparisons are not valid between controls and patient, the low variability among controls and the obvious differences with this patient allow us to conclude that trehalose, through its autophagy activation capacity, anti-aggregation properties, anti-oxidative effects and lack of toxicity, could be very promising for the treatment of CHIP-mutation related ataxia, and possibly a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders related to protein disconformation."
https://openalex.org/W1999139260,"Background The concept of disability is now understood as a result of the interaction between the individual, features related to impairment, and the physical and social environment. It is important to understand these environmental influences and how they affect social participation. The purpose of this study is to describe the social participation of young adults with Down syndrome and examine its relationship with the physical and social environment. Methods Families ascertained from the Down syndrome ‘Needs Opinion Wishes’ database completed questionnaires during 2011. The questionnaires contained two parts, young person characteristics and family characteristics. Young adults’ social participation was measured using the Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H) and the influences of environmental factors were measured by the Measure of the Quality of the Environment (MQE). The analysis involved descriptive statistics and linear and logistic regression. Results Overall, participation in daily activities was higher (mean 6.45) than in social roles (mean 5.17) (range 0 to 9). When the physical and/or social environment was reported as a facilitator, compared to being no influence or a barrier, participation in social roles was greater (coef 0.89, 95%CI 0.28, 1.52, coef 0.83, 95%CI 0.17, 1.49, respectively). The relationships between participation and both the physical (coef 0.60, 95% CI −0.40, 1.24) and social (coef 0.20, 95%CI −0.47, 0.87) environments were reduced when age, gender, behavior and functioning in ADL were taken into account. Conclusion We found that young adults’ participation in social roles was influenced more by the physical environment than by the social environment, providing a potentially modifiable avenue for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2047193384,"Aim Diabetes is a growing burden especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Inadequate access to diabetes care is of particular concern and selection of appropriate diabetes medicines on national essential medicines lists (NEMLs) is a first step in achieving adequate access. This selection was studied among LMICs and influences of various factors associated with selection decisions were assessed. Methods Countries were studied if they employed NEMLs for reimbursement or procurement purposes. Presence and number of essential diabetes medicines from different classes, both insulins and oral blood glucose lowering medicines, were surveyed and calculated. Data were also analyzed by country income level, geographic region, year of last update of the NEML and purpose of NEML employment. The effect of prevalence and burden of disease on the number of essential diabetes medicines was also studied. Non parametric tests and univariate linear regression analysis were used. Results Nearly all countries (n = 32) had chosen fast (97%) and intermediate acting insulin (93%), glibenclamide and metformin (100% both) as essential medicines. The median number of essential diabetes medicines was 6, equally divided between insulins and oral medicines. 20% of the countries had selected insulin analogues as essential medicines. Among all the studied factors, an increase in burden of diabetes and wealth of countries were associated with selection of higher numbers of essential diabetes medicines (p = 0.02 in both cases). Conclusions Nearly all the studied LMICs had included the minimum required medicines for diabetes management in their NEMLs. Selection can still be improved (e.g. exclusion of insulin analogues and replacement of glibenclamide by gliclazide). Nevertheless, the known suboptimal and inconsistent availability of essential diabetes medicines in LMICs cannot be explained by inadequate selection of essential medicines. Countries should therefore be encouraged to give precedence to implementation of NEMLs to make essential diabetes medicines more accessible."
https://openalex.org/W2069147998,"Somitogenesis in vertebrates is a complex and dynamic process involving many sequences of events generated from the segmentation clock. Previous studies with mouse embryos revealed that the presumptive somite boundary is periodically created at the anterior border of the expression domain of Tbx6 protein. Ripply1 and Ripply2 are required for the determination of the Tbx6 protein border, but the mechanism by which this Tbx6 domain is regulated remains unclear. Furthermore, since zebrafish and frog Ripplys are known to be able to suppress Tbx6 function at the transcription level, it is also unclear whether Ripply-mediated mechanism of Tbx6 regulation is conserved among different species. Here, we tested the generality of Tbx6 protein-mediated process in somite segmentation by using zebrafish and further examined the mechanism of regulation of Tbx6 protein. By utilizing an antibody against zebrafish Tbx6/Fss, previously referred to as Tbx24, we found that the anterior border of Tbx6 domain coincided with the presumptive intersomitic boundary even in the zebrafish and it shifted dynamically during 1 cycle of segmentation. Consistent with the findings in mice, the tbx6 mRNA domain was located far anterior to its protein domain, indicating the possibility of posttranscriptional regulation. When both ripply1/2 were knockdown, the Tbx6 domain was anteriorly expanded. We further directly demonstrated that Ripply could reduce the expression level of Tbx6 protein depending on physical interaction between Ripply and Tbx6. Moreover, the onset of ripply1 and ripply2 expression occurred after reduction of FGF signaling at the anterior PSM, but this expression initiated much earlier on treatment with SU5402, a chemical inhibitor of FGF signaling. These results strongly suggest that Ripply is a direct regulator of the Tbx6 protein level for the establishment of intersomitic boundaries and mediates a reduction in FGF signaling for the positioning of the presumptive intersomitic boundary in the PSM."
https://openalex.org/W2063646264,"The immune defence of an organism is evolving continuously, causing counteradaptations in interacting species, which in turn affect other ecological and evolutionary processes. Until recently comparative studies of species interactions and immunity, combining information from both ecological and immunological fields, have been rare. The cellular immune defense in insects, mainly mediated by circulating hemocytes, has been studied primarily in Lepidoptera and Diptera, whereas corresponding information about coleopteran species is still scarce. In the study presented here, we used two closely related chrysomelids, Galerucella pusilla and G. calmariensis (Coleoptera), both attacked by the same parasitoid, Asecodes parviclava (Hymenoptera). In order to investigate the structure of the immune system in Galerucella and to detect possible differences between the two species, we combined ecological studies with controlled parasitism experiments, followed by an investigation of the cell composition in the larval hemolymph. We found a striking difference in parasitism rate between the species, as well as in the level of successful immune response (i.e. encapsulation and melanisation of parasitoid eggs), with G. pusilla showing a much more potent immune defense than G. calmariensis. These differences were linked to differences in the larval cell composition, where hemocyte subsets in both naïve and parasitised individuals differed significantly between the species. In particular, the hemocytes shown to be active in the encapsulation process; phagocytes, lamellocytes and granulocytes, differ between the species, indicating that the cell composition reflects the ability to defend against the parasitoid."
https://openalex.org/W2002475466,"Ruminant livestock turn forages and poor-quality feeds into human edible products, but enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants are a significant contributor to greenhouse gases (GHGs) and hence to climate change. Despite the predominance of pasture-based beef production systems in many parts of Europe there are little data available regarding enteric CH4 emissions from free-ranging grazing cattle. It is possible that differences in physiology or behaviour could influence comparative emissions intensities for traditional and modern breed types depending on the nutritional characteristics of the herbage grazed. This study investigated the role of breed type in influencing CH4 emissions from growing beef steers managed on contrasting grasslands typical of intensive (lowland) and extensive (upland) production systems. Using the SF6 dilution technique CH4 emissions were estimated for a modern, fast-growing crossbred (Limousin cross) and a smaller and hardier native breed (Welsh Black) when grazing lowland perennial ryegrass (high nutritional density, low sward heterogeneity) and semi-improved upland pasture (low/medium nutritional density, high sward heterogeneity). Live-weight gain was substantially lower for steers on the upland system compared to the lowland system (0.31 vs. 1.04 kg d-1; s.e.d. = 0.085 kg d-1; P<0.001), leading to significant differences in estimated dry matter intakes (8.0 vs. 11.1 kg DM d-1 for upland and lowland respectively; s.e.d. = 0.68 kg DM d-1; P<0.001). While emissions per unit feed intake were similar for the lowland and upland systems, CH4 emissions per unit of live-weight gain (LWG) were substantially higher when the steers grazed the poorer quality hill pasture (760 vs 214 g kg-1 LWG; s.e.d. = 133.5 g kg-1 LWG; P<0.001). Overall any effects of breed type were relatively small relative to the combined influence of pasture type and location."
https://openalex.org/W1997542040,"The elusive but ubiquitous multifactor interactions represent a stumbling block that urgently needs to be removed in searching for determinants involved in human complex diseases. The dimensionality reduction approaches are a promising tool for this task. Many complex diseases exhibit composite syndromes required to be measured in a cluster of clinical traits with varying correlations and/or are inherently longitudinal in nature (changing over time and measured dynamically at multiple time points). A multivariate approach for detecting interactions is thus greatly needed on the purposes of handling a multifaceted phenotype and longitudinal data, as well as improving statistical power for multiple significance testing via a two-stage testing procedure that involves a multivariate analysis for grouped phenotypes followed by univariate analysis for the phenotypes in the significant group(s). In this article, we propose a multivariate extension of generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) based on multivariate generalized linear, multivariate quasi-likelihood and generalized estimating equations models. Simulations and real data analysis for the cohort from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment are performed to investigate the properties and performance of the proposed method, as compared with the univariate method. The results suggest that the proposed multivariate GMDR substantially boosts statistical power."

The biosynthetic gene cluster for reveromycin A (RM-A), which is a promising lead compound with anti-osteoclastic activity, also includes a P450 gene, revI. To understand the roles of P450revI, we comprehensively characterized the enzyme by genetic, kinetic, and structural studies. The revI gene disruptants (ΔrevI) resulted in accumulation of reveromycin T (RM-T), and revI gene complementation restored RM-A production, indicating that the physiological substrate of P450revI is RM-T. Indeed, the purified P450revI catalyzed the C18-hydroxylation of RM-T more efficiently than the other RM derivatives tested. Moreover, the 1.4 Å resolution co-crystal structure of P450revI with RM-T revealed that the substrate binds the enzyme with a folded compact conformation for C18-hydroxylation. To address the structure-enzyme activity relationship, site-directed mutagenesis was performed in P450revI. R190A and R81A mutations, which abolished salt bridge formation with C1 and C24 carboxyl groups of RM-T, respectively, resulted in significant loss of enzyme activity. The interaction between Arg190 and the C1 carboxyl group of RM-T elucidated why P450revI was unable to catalyze both RM-T 1-methyl ester and RM-T 1-ethyl ester. Moreover, the accumulation of RM-T in ΔrevI mutants enabled us to characterize its biological activity. Our results show that RM-T had stronger anticancer activity and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase inhibition than RM-A. However, RM-T showed much less anti-osteoclastic activity than RM-A, indicating that hemisuccinate moiety is important for the activity.

https://openalex.org/W2090107658,"Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a common post-stroke problem. PEM can independently induce a systemic acute-phase response, and pre-existing malnutrition can exacerbate neuroinflammation induced by brain ischemia. In contrast, the effects of PEM developing in the post-ischemic period have not been studied. Since excessive inflammation can impede brain remodeling, we investigated the effects of post-ischemic malnutrition on neuroinflammation, the acute-phase reaction, and neuroplasticity-related proteins. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to global forebrain ischemia using the 2-vessel occlusion model or sham surgery. The sham rats were assigned to control diet (18% protein) on day 3 after surgery, whereas the rats exposed to global ischemia were assigned to either control diet or a low protein (PEM, 2% protein) diet. Post-ischemic PEM decreased growth associated protein-43, synaptophysin and synaptosomal-associated protein-25 immunofluorescence within the hippocampal CA3 mossy fiber terminals on day 21, whereas the glial response in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subregions was unaltered by PEM. No systemic acute-phase reaction attributable to global ischemia was detected in control diet-fed rats, as reflected by serum concentrations of alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, and albumin. Acute exposure to the PEM regimen after global brain ischemia caused an atypical acute-phase response. PEM decreased the serum concentrations of albumin and haptoglobin on day 5, with the decreases sustained to day 21. Serum alpha-2-macroglobulin concentrations were significantly higher in malnourished rats on day 21. This provides the first direct evidence that PEM developing after brain ischemia exerts wide-ranging effects on mechanisms important to stroke recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2029351609,"After demonstrating, with karyotyping, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization, the retention of certain human chromosomes and genes following the spontaneous fusion of human tumor and hamster cells in-vivo, it was postulated that cell fusion causes the horizontal transmission of malignancy and donor genes. Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles of 3 different hybrid tumors first generated in the hamster cheek pouch after human tumor grafting, and then propagated in hamsters and in cell cultures for years: two Hodgkin lymphomas (GW-532, GW-584) and a glioblastoma multiforme (GB-749). Based on the criteria of MAS 5.0 detection P-values ≤0.065 and at least a 2-fold greater signal expression value than a hamster melanoma control, we identified 3,759 probe sets (ranging from 1,040 to 1,303 in each transplant) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of the 3 hybrid tumors, which unambiguously mapped to 3,107 unique Entrez Gene IDs, representative of all human chromosomes; however, by karyology, one of the hybrid tumors (GB-749) had a total of 15 human chromosomes in its cells. Among the genes mapped, 39 probe sets, representing 33 unique Entrez Gene IDs, complied with the detection criteria in all hybrid tumor samples. Five of these 33 genes encode transcription factors that are known to regulate cell growth and differentiation; five encode cell adhesion- and transmigration-associated proteins that participate in oncogenesis and/or metastasis and invasion; and additional genes encode proteins involved in signaling pathways, regulation of apoptosis, DNA repair, and multidrug resistance. These findings were corroborated by PCR and reverse transcription PCR, showing the presence of human alphoid (α)-satellite DNA and the F11R transcripts in additional tumor transplant generations. We posit that in-vivo fusion discloses genes implicated in tumor progression, and gene families coding for the organoid phenotype. Thus, cancer cells can transduce adjacent stromal cells, with the resulting progeny having permanently transcribed genes with malignant and other gene functions of the donor DNA. Using heterospecific in-vivo cell fusion, genes encoding oncogenic and organogenic traits may be identified."

Mutations in SRY cause 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis with female somatic phenotype (Swyer syndrome) and confer a high risk of malignancy (gonadoblastoma). Such mutations cluster in the SRY high mobility group (HMG) box, a conserved motif of specific DNA binding and bending. To explore structure-function relationships, we constructed all possible substitutions at a site of clinical mutation (W70L). Our studies thus focused on a core aromatic residue (position 15 of the consensus HMG box) that is invariant among SRY-related HMG box transcription factors (the SOX family) and conserved as aromatic (Phe or Tyr) among other sequence-specific boxes. In a yeast one-hybrid system sensitive to specific SRY-DNA binding, the variant domains exhibited reduced (Phe and Tyr) or absent activity (the remaining 17 substitutions). Representative nonpolar variants with partial or absent activity (Tyr, Phe, Leu, and Ala in order of decreasing side-chain volume) were chosen for study in vitro and in mammalian cell culture. The clinical mutation (Leu) was found to markedly impair multiple biochemical and cellular activities as respectively probed through the following: (i) in vitro assays of specific DNA binding and protein stability, and (ii) cell culture-based assays of proteosomal degradation, nuclear import, enhancer DNA occupancy, and SRY-dependent transcriptional activation. Surprisingly, however, DNA bending is robust to this or the related Ala substitution that profoundly impairs box stability.

Sex determination involves synergistic action of SRY and SF1 on a specific Sox9 enhancer.Nature. 2008; 453: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar).

HMGs everywhere.Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 208-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In human SRY, the box is flanked by N- and C-terminal segments lacking conserved or recognizable structural motifs (Fig. 1B) (11Whitfield L.S. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N.

The HMG box itself contains an N-terminal β-strand, three helices (α1, α2, and α3), and a C-terminal basic tail (Fig. 1C). Its L-shaped structure is conserved within a eukaryotic superfamily of architectural TFs (13Weir H.M. Kraulis P.J. Hill C.S. Raine A.R. Laue E.D. Thomas J.O.

Zhurkin V.B. Louis J.M. Cornilescu G. Clore G.M. Structural basis for SRY-dependent 46-X,Y sex reversal: modulation of DNA bending by a naturally occuring point mutation.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Additional determinants of DNA bending are provided by the minor wing and its basic C-terminal tail (34Phillips N.B.

Sinclair A.H. Mutations in SRY and SOX9: testis-determining genes.Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Corresponding mutations in other SOX factors cause diverse developmental abnormalities reflecting their individual biological roles (16Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H.

The sox family of transcription factors: versatile regulators of stem and progenitor cell fate.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 15-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This study has focused on an invariant position of the SRY HMG box that underlies the hydrophobic wedge. Trp-70 (box position 15) is a site of a clinical mutation (Leu) that arose de novo in paternal spermatogenesis (9Hersmus R. de Leeuw B.H. Stoop H. Bernard P. van Doorn H.C. Brüggenwirth H.T.

Genet. 2009; 17: 1642-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This residue is of structural interest in relation to the core of the major wing (Fig. 2, A–C). Contained within helix α1, the side chain of Trp-70 abuts two other aromatic side chains, Trp-98 in α2 and Phe-109 in α3 (respective box positions 43 and 54; Fig. 2D). This aromatic cluster is invariant among mammalian Sry sequences (Fig. 1D) and broadly conserved among metazoan Sox sequences (36Laudet V. Stehelin D. Clevers H.

Because of such conservation and its DSD-associated mutation, we sought to investigate the contribution of Trp-70 to the structure and function of SRY.

In our hands, the intact human SRY readily aggregates in vitro leading to progressive loss of specific DNA binding activity (40Li B. Phillips N.B. Jancso-Radek A. Ittah V. Singh R. Jones D.N. Haas E.

Such loss may underlie the higher sequence- or structure-specific DNA-binding affinities observed by Lippard and co-workers (39Trimmer E.E. Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Essigmann J.M. Human testis-determining factor SRY binds to the major DNA adduct of cisplatin and a putative target sequence with comparable affinities.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in studies of the SRY HMG box relative to the intact protein. Such focus on isolated DNA-binding domains is broadly representative of an extensive literature concerning modular TFs containing conserved motifs (93Weirauch M. Hughes T.R. Hughes T.R. A Handbook of Transcription Factors. Springer, Netherlands2011: 25-73Google Scholar). Our experimental design thus employed systematic mutagenesis in a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) system (41Phillips N.B.

Chem. 2011; 286: 36787-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), followed by complementary investigation of representative variants in vitro and in mammalian cell culture. Because box position 15 is part of its hydrophobic core, priority was given to nonpolar and aromatic substitutions with particular attention to DSD-associated mutation W70L. These studies culminated in analysis of transcriptional regulatory activities in an embryonic rat pre-Sertoli cell line (42Haqq C.M. Donahoe P.K. Regulation of sexual dimorphism in mammals.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), previously characterized as a model of the bipotential gonadal ridge at a stage of development just prior to its morphological differentiation (38Chen Y.S.

https://openalex.org/W2075341520,"ASH2L is a component of MLL complexes that confer H3K4 trimethylation. The ASH2L gene is located at 8q11-12, which is often amplified in breast cancers. We found that increased ASH2L expression, which can result from gene amplification, is often correlated with increased ERα expression in both breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancers. Forced expression of ASH2L induced ERα expression in mammary epithelial cells, whereas depletion of ASH2L suppressed ERα expression in breast cancer cells. To understand the mechanism by which ASH2L regulates ERα expression, we identified GATA3 as the binding protein of ASH2L. ASH2L was shown to potentiate the transcriptional activity of GATA3. ASH2L was recruited to the enhancer of the ERα gene through GATA3 to promote ERα transcription. This study established that ASH2L enhances ERα expression as a coactivator of GATA3 in breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2155405458,"Nelson and Narens have proposed a metacognition model that dissociates the objective processing of information (object-level) and the subjective evaluation of the performance (i.e., the metalevel). Neurophysiological evidence also indicates that the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are the brain areas which perform the metalevel function [1]–[3]. A corresponding neural mechanism of Nelson and Narens’s model, called dynamic filtering theory [4], [5], indicates that object-level processing is distributed in the posterior cortices and regulated by the prefrontal cortices with a filtering or gating mechanism to select appropriate signals and suppress inappropriate signals and noise. Based on this model, a hypothesis can be developed that, in the case of uncertainty or overloading of object-level processing, the prefrontal cortices will become more active in order to modulate signals and noise. This hypothesis is supported by a recent fMRI study [6] showing that the PFC (Brodmann area 9, BA9) was activated when subjects were overloaded in a bimodal attentional task, compared to a unimodal task. Here, we report a study showing that applying repetitive transmagnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the BA9 in order to interfere with its functional activity resulted in significant increas in guessed responses, compared to three other control conditions (i.e., no-TMS, sham TMS on BA9, and rTMS on Cz). The results are compatible with the dynamic filtering theory and suggest that a malfunction of the PFC would weaken the quality of meta-cognitive percepts and increase the number of guessed responses."

In addition, safety was further evaluated in human ectocervical explants. The gels did not induce mucosal toxicity. A single ex vivo exposure to diluted MZC (1∶30, 1∶100) and MC (1∶30, the only dilution tested), but not to ZC gel, up to 4 days prior to viral challenge, significantly inhibited SHIV-RT infection in macaque vaginal mucosa. MZC's activity was not affected by seminal plasma. The antiviral activity of unformulated MIV-150 was not enhanced in the presence of ZA, suggesting that the antiviral activity of MZC was mediated predominantly by MIV-150. In vivo administration of MZC and CG significantly inhibited ex vivo SHIV-RT infection (51–62% inhibition relative to baselines) of vaginal (but not cervical) mucosa collected 24 h post last gel exposure, indicating barrier effect of CG. Although the inhibitory effect of MZC (65–74%) did not significantly differ from CG (32–45%), it was within the range of protection (∼75%) against vaginal SHIV-RT challenge 24 h after gel dosing. Overall, the data suggest that evaluation of candidate microbicides in macaque explants can inform macaque efficacy and clinical studies design. The data support advancing MZC gel for clinical evaluation."

Extending the study of the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to an admixed population such as Puerto Rico has the potential to shed light on IBD genes identified in studies of European populations, find new genes contributing to IBD susceptibility, and provide basic information on IBD for the care of US patients of Puerto Rican and Latino descent. In order to study the association between immune-related genes and Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in Puerto Rico, we genotyped 1159 Puerto Rican cases, controls, and family members with the ImmunoChip. We also genotyped 832 subjects from the Human Genome Diversity Panel to provide data for estimation of global and local continental ancestry. Association of SNPs was tested by logistic regression corrected for global continental descent and family structure. We observed the association between Crohn’s disease and NOD2 (rs17313265, 0.28 in CD, 0.19 in controls, OR 1.5, p = 9×10−6) and IL23R (rs11209026, 0.026 in CD, 0.0.071 in controls, OR 0.4, p = 3.8×10−4). The haplotype structure of both regions resembled that reported for European populations and “local” continental ancestry of the IL23R gene was almost entirely of European descent. We also observed suggestive evidence for the association of the BAZ1A promoter SNP with CD (rs1200332, 0.45 in CD, 0.35 in controls, OR 1.5, p = 2×10−6). Our estimate of continental ancestry surrounding this SNP suggested an origin in Ancient America for this putative susceptibility region. Our observations underscored the great difference between global continental ancestry and local continental ancestry at the level of the individual gene, particularly for immune-related loci."
https://openalex.org/W2170722394,"Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) can simultaneously monitor the spatiotemporal electrical dynamics of thousands of neurons and is often used to identify functional differences in models of neurological disease. While the chief advantage of VSDI is the ability to record spatiotemporal activity, there are no tools available to visualize and statistically compare activity across the full spatiotemporal range of the VSDI dataset. Investigators commonly analyze only a subset of the data, and a majority of the dataset is routinely excluded from analysis. We have developed a software toolbox that simplifies visual inspection of VSDI data, and permits unaided statistical comparison across spatial and temporal dimensions. First, the three-dimensional VSDI dataset (x,y,time) is geometrically transformed into a two-dimensional spatiotemporal map of activity. Second, statistical comparison between groups is performed using a non-parametric permutation test. The result is a 2D map of all significant differences in both space and time. Here, we used the toolbox to identify functional differences in activity in VSDI data from acute hippocampal slices obtained from epileptic Arx conditional knock-out and control mice. Maps of spatiotemporal activity were produced and analyzed to identify differences in the activity evoked by stimulation of each of two axonal inputs to the hippocampus: the perforant pathway and the temporoammonic pathway. In mutant hippocampal slices, the toolbox identified a widespread decrease in spatiotemporal activity evoked by the temporoammonic pathway. No significant differences were observed in the activity evoked by the perforant pathway. The VSDI toolbox permitted us to visualize and statistically compare activity across the spatiotemporal scope of the VSDI dataset. Sampling error was minimized because the representation of the data is standardized by the toolbox. Statistical comparisons were conducted quickly, across the spatiotemporal scope of the data, without a priori knowledge of the character of the responses or the likely differences between them."

All genomic integrants showed enhanced citric and gluconic acid secretion on Tris-Cl rock phosphate (TRP) buffered medium, which was sufficient to release 200-1000 µM Pi in TRP medium.

Human DUE-B also retains the aminoacyl-tRNA proofreading function of its shorter orthologs in lower organisms. Here we report that phosphorylation of the DUE-B unstructured C-terminal domain unique to higher organisms regulates DUE-B intermolecular binding. Gel filtration analyses show that unphosphorylated DUE-B forms multiple high molecular weight (HMW) complexes. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and Mcm2-7 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry of the HMW complexes. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase binding is RNase A sensitive, whereas interaction with Mcm2-7 is nuclease resistant. Unphosphorylated DUE-B HMW complex formation is decreased by PP2A inhibition or direct DUE-B phosphorylation, and increased by inhibition of Cdc7. These results indicate that the state of DUE-B phosphorylation is maintained by the equilibrium between Cdc7-dependent phosphorylation and PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation, each previously shown to regulate replication initiation. Alanine mutation of the DUE-B C-terminal phosphorylation target sites increases MCM binding but blocks Cdc45 loading in vivo and inhibits cell division. In egg extracts alanine mutation of the DUE-B C-terminal phosphorylation sites blocks Cdc45 loading and inhibits DNA replication. The effects of DUE-B C-terminal phosphorylation reveal a novel S phase kinase regulatory mechanism for Cdc45 loading and MCM helicase activation."

The inactive (T) and active (R) state structures of TcLDH were determined at 1.8 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. The structures indicated that two mobile regions, MR1 (positions 172-185) and MR2 (positions 211-221), form a compact core for allosteric motion, and His(179) of MR1 forms constitutive hydrogen bonds with MR2. The Q4(R) mutation, which comprises the L67E, H68D, E178K, and A235R replacements, increased V(max) 4-fold but reduced pyruvate S(0.5) only 5-fold in the reaction without FBP. In contrast, the P2 mutation, comprising the R173Q and R216L replacements, did not markedly increase V(max), but 10(2)-reduced pyruvate S(0.5), and additively increased the FBP-independent activity of the Q4(R) enzyme. The two types of mutation consistently increased the thermal stability of the enzyme. The MR1-MR2 area is a positively charged cluster, and its center approaches another positively charged cluster (N domain cluster) across the Q-axis subunit interface by 5 Å, when the enzyme undergoes the T to R transition. Structural and kinetic analyses thus revealed the simple and unique allosteric machinery of TcLDH, where the MR1-MR2 area pivotally moves during the allosteric motion and mediates the allosteric equilibrium through electrostatic repulsion within the protein molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1964019045,"Auditory selective attention plays an essential role for identifying sounds of interest in a scene, but the neural underpinnings are still incompletely understood. Recent findings demonstrate that neural activity that is time-locked to a particular amplitude-modulation (AM) is enhanced in the auditory cortex when the modulated stream of sounds is selectively attended to under sensory competition with other streams. However, the target sounds used in the previous studies differed not only in their AM, but also in other sound features, such as carrier frequency or location. Thus, it remains uncertain whether the observed enhancements reflect AM-selective attention. The present study aims at dissociating the effect of AM frequency on response enhancement in auditory cortex by using an ongoing auditory stimulus that contains two competing targets differing exclusively in their AM frequency. Electroencephalography results showed a sustained response enhancement for auditory attention compared to visual attention, but not for AM-selective attention (attended AM frequency vs. ignored AM frequency). In contrast, the response to the ignored AM frequency was enhanced, although a brief trend toward response enhancement occurred during the initial 15 s. Together with the previous findings, these observations indicate that selective enhancement of attended AMs in auditory cortex is adaptive under sustained AM-selective attention. This finding has implications for our understanding of cortical mechanisms for feature-based attentional gain control."

https://openalex.org/W1981287382,"While sensory processes are tuned to particular features, such as an object's specific location, color or orientation, visual working memory (vWM) is assumed to store information using representations, which generalize over a feature dimension. Additionally, current vWM models presume that different features or objects are stored independently. On the other hand, configurational effects, when observed, are supposed to mainly reflect encoding strategies. We show that the location of the target, relative to the display center and boundaries, and overall memory load influenced recall precision, indicating that, like sensory processes, capacity limited vWM resources are spatially tuned. When recalling one of three memory items the target distance from the display center was overestimated, similar to the error when only one item was memorized, but its distance from the memory items' average position was underestimated, showing that not only individual memory items' position, but also the global configuration of the memory array may be stored. Finally, presenting the non-target items at recall, consequently providing landmarks and configurational information, improved precision and accuracy of target recall. Similarly, when the non-target items were translated at recall, relative to their position in the initial display, a parallel displacement of the recalled target was observed. These findings suggest that fine-grained spatial information in vWM is represented in local maps whose resolution varies with distance from landmarks, such as the display center, while coarse representations are used to store the memory array configuration. Both these representations are updated at the time of recall."
https://openalex.org/W2056550792,"Recent advances in big data and analytics research have provided a wealth of large data sets that are too big to be analyzed in their entirety, due to restrictions on computer memory or storage size. New Bayesian methods have been developed for large data sets that are only large due to large sample sizes; these methods partition big data sets into subsets, and perform independent Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses on the subsets. The methods then combine the independent subset posterior samples to estimate a posterior density given the full data set. These approaches were shown to be effective for Bayesian models including logistic regression models, Gaussian mixture models and hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R package parallelMCMCcombine which carries out four of these techniques for combining independent subset posterior samples. We illustrate each of the methods using a Bayesian logistic regression model for simulation data and a Bayesian Gamma model for real data; we also demonstrate features and capabilities of the R package. The package assumes the user has carried out the Bayesian analysis and has produced the independent subposterior samples outside of the package. The methods are primarily suited to models with unknown parameters of fixed dimension that exist in continuous parameter spaces. We envision this tool will allow researchers to explore the various methods for their specific applications, and will assist future progress in this rapidly developing field."

In contrast, mitochondria in adult mammalian skeletal muscle fibres show little motility over several hours. Here, we use a novel three channelled microflow device, the multifunctional pipette, to test whether mitochondria in mouse skeletal muscle connect to each other. The central channel in the pipette delivers compounds to a restricted region of the sarcolemma, typically 30 µm in diameter. Two channels on either side of the central channel use suction to create a hydrodynamically confined flow zone and remove compounds completely from the bulk solution to internal waste compartments. Compounds were delivered locally to the end or side of single adult mouse skeletal muscle fibres to test whether changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were transmitted to more distant located mitochondria. Mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). Cytosolic free [Ca2+] was monitored with fluo-3. A pulse of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 100 µM) applied to a small area of the muscle fibre (30 µm in diameter) produced a rapid decrease in the mitochondrial TMRE signal (indicative of depolarization) to 38% of its initial value. After washout of FCCP, the TMRE signal partially recovered. At distances greater than 50 µm away from the site of FCCP application, the mitochondrial TMRE signal was unchanged. Similar results were observed when two sites along the fibre were pulsed sequentially with FCCP. After a pulse of FCCP, cytosolic [Ca2+] was unchanged and fibres contracted in response to electrical stimulation. In conclusion, our results indicate that extensive networks of interconnected mitochondria do not exist in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the limited and reversible effects of targeted FCCP application with the multifunctional pipette highlight its advantages over bulk application of compounds to isolated cells."

Brn4-deficient mice have a low endocochlear potential (EP), hearing loss, and ultrastructural alterations in spiral ligament fibrocytes, however the molecular pathology through which Brn4 deficiency causes low EP is still unclear. Mutations in the Gjb2 and Gjb6 genes encoding the gap junction proteins connexin26 (Cx26) and connexin30 (Cx30) genes, respectively, which encode gap junction proteins and are expressed in cochlear fibrocytes and non-sensory epithelial cells (i.e., cochlear supporting cells) to maintain the proper EP, are responsible for hereditary sensorineural deafness. It has been hypothesized that the gap junction in the cochlea provides an intercellular passage by which K+ is transported to maintain the EP at the high level necessary for sensory hair cell excitation. Here we analyzed the formation of gap junction plaques in cochlear supporting cells of Brn4-deficient mice at different stages by confocal microscopy and three-dimensional graphic reconstructions. Gap junctions from control mice, which are composed mainly of Cx26 and Cx30, formed linear plaques along the cell-cell junction sites with adjacent cells. These plaques formed pentagonal or hexagonal outlines of the normal inner sulcus cells and border cells. Gap junction plaques in Brn4-deficient mice did not, however, show the normal linear structure but instead formed small spots around the cell-cell junction sites. Gap junction lengths were significantly shorter, and the level of Cx26 and Cx30 was significantly reduced in Brn4-deficient mice compared with littermate controls. Thus the Brn4 mutation affected the assembly and localization of gap junction proteins at the cell borders of cochlear supporting cells, suggesting that Brn4 substantially contributes to cochlear gap junction properties to maintain the proper EP in cochleae, similar to connexin-related deafness."
https://openalex.org/W2017051653,"Although breast cancer typically develops in women over the age of 40, it remains unclear when breast cancer initiating events occur or whether the mammary gland is particularly susceptible to oncogenic transformation at a particular developmental stage. Using MTB-IGFIR transgenic mice that overexpress type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in a doxycycline-inducible manner, mammary tumorigenesis was initiated at different developmental stages. Tumor multiplicity was significantly increased while tumor latency was significantly decreased when the IGF-IR transgene was expressed during pubertal development compared to post-pubertal transgene expression. Moreover, metastatic spread of mammary tumors to the lungs was approximately twice as likely when IGF-IR was overexpressed in pubertal mice compared to post-pubertal mice. In addition, engraftment of pubertal MTB-IGFIR mammary tissue into cleared mammary fat pads of pubertal hosts produced tumors more frequently and faster than engraftment into adult hosts. These experiments show that the mammary microenvironment created during puberty renders mammary epithelial cells particularly susceptible to transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2080247288,"Purpose To investigate the feasibility of an intravascular imaging antenna to image abdominal aorta atherosclerotic plaque in swine using 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Atherosclerotic model was established in 6 swine. After 8 months, swine underwent an MR examination, which was performed using an intravascular imaging guide-wire, and images of the common iliac artery and the abdominal aorta were acquired. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed in the right femoral artery; images at the same position as for the MR examination were obtained. The luminal border and external elastic membrane of the targeted arteries were individually drawn in the MR and IVUS images. After co-registering these images, the vessel, lumen, and vessel wall areas and the plaque burden in the same lesions imaged using different modalities were calculated and compared. The diagnostic accuracy of intravascular MR examination in delineating the vessel wall and detecting plaques were analyzed and compared using IVUS. Results Compared with IVUS, good agreement was found between MRI and IVUS for delineating vessel, lumen, and vessel wall areas and plaque burden (r value: 0.98, 0.95, 0.96 and 0.91, respectively; P<0.001). Conclusion Compared with IVUS, using an intravascular imaging guide-wire to image deep seated arteries allowed determination of the vessel, lumen and vessel wall areas and plaque size and burden. This may provide an alternative method for detecting atherosclerotic plaques in the future."
