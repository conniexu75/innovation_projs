https://openalex.org/W2031493923,"Hydra, first described by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in a letter to the Royal Society in 1702, has been studied by biologists for centuries and now is an important model for work on axial patterning, stem cell biology and regeneration. Its genome, over half of which is made up of mobile elements, has now been sequenced, as has the genome of a Curvibacter sp. bacterium stably associated with Hydra magnipapillata. Comparisons of the Hydra genome with those of other animals provide insights into the evolution of epithelia, contractile tissues, developmentally regulated transcription factors, pluripotency genes and the neuromuscular junction, as well as the Spemann–Mangold organizer, the region in the early embryo that establishes the embryo's axis. The freshwater cnidarian Hydra is a significant model for studies of axial patterning, stem cell biology and regeneration. Its (A+T)-rich genome has now been sequenced. Comparison of this genome with those of other animals provides insights into the evolution of epithelia, contractile tissues, developmentally regulated transcription factors, pluripotency genes and more. The freshwater cnidarian Hydra was first described in 17021 and has been the object of study for 300 years. Experimental studies of Hydra between 1736 and 1744 culminated in the discovery of asexual reproduction of an animal by budding, the first description of regeneration in an animal, and successful transplantation of tissue between animals2. Today, Hydra is an important model for studies of axial patterning3, stem cell biology4 and regeneration5. Here we report the genome of Hydra magnipapillata and compare it to the genomes of the anthozoan Nematostella vectensis6 and other animals. The Hydra genome has been shaped by bursts of transposable element expansion, horizontal gene transfer, trans-splicing, and simplification of gene structure and gene content that parallel simplification of the Hydra life cycle. We also report the sequence of the genome of a novel bacterium stably associated with H. magnipapillata. Comparisons of the Hydra genome to the genomes of other animals shed light on the evolution of epithelia, contractile tissues, developmentally regulated transcription factors, the Spemann–Mangold organizer, pluripotency genes and the neuromuscular junction."
https://openalex.org/W2109899118,"Mark Seielstad and colleagues report results of a large genome-wide association and replication study of ulcerative colitis. The work identifies several new risk loci for this disease and provides further insight into the shared pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with a complex genetic and environmental etiology. In an effort to identify genetic variation underlying ulcerative colitis risk, we present two distinct genome-wide association studies of ulcerative colitis and their joint analysis with a previously published scan1, comprising, in aggregate, 2,693 individuals with ulcerative colitis and 6,791 control subjects. Fifty-nine SNPs from 14 independent loci attained an association significance of P < 10−5. Seven of these loci exceeded genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8). After testing an independent cohort of 2,009 cases of ulcerative colitis and 1,580 controls, we identified 13 loci that were significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (P < 5 × 10−8), including the immunoglobulin receptor gene FCGR2A, 5p15, 2p16 and ORMDL3 (orosomucoid1-like 3). We confirmed association with 14 previously identified ulcerative colitis susceptibility loci, and an analysis of acknowledged Crohn's disease loci showed that roughly half of the known Crohn's disease associations are shared with ulcerative colitis. These data implicate approximately 30 loci in ulcerative colitis, thereby providing insight into disease pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2031848382,"Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation, enabling them to generate a 'thermal image' of predators or prey. Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2118516269,"With the rise in prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, honey is increasingly valued for its antibacterial activity. To characterize all bactericidal factors in a medical-grade honey, we used a novel approach of successive neutralization of individual honey bactericidal factors. All bacteria tested, including Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, were killed by 10-20% (v/v) honey, whereas > or = 40% (v/v) of a honey-equivalent sugar solution was required for similar activity. Honey accumulated up to 5.62 +/- 0.54 mM H(2)O(2) and contained 0.25 +/- 0.01 mM methylglyoxal (MGO). After enzymatic neutralization of these two compounds, honey retained substantial activity. Using B. subtilis for activity-guided isolation of the additional antimicrobial factors, we discovered bee defensin-1 in honey. After combined neutralization of H(2)O(2), MGO, and bee defensin-1, 20% honey had only minimal activity left, and subsequent adjustment of the pH of this honey from 3.3 to 7.0 reduced the activity to that of sugar alone. Activity against all other bacteria tested depended on sugar, H(2)O(2), MGO, and bee defensin-1. Thus, we fully characterized the antibacterial activity of medical-grade honey."
https://openalex.org/W2049150145,"McMillin et al. describe a drug screening platform that takes into account the tumor microenvironment, in particular tumor-stromal interactions, enabling the screening of the antitumor activity of candidate anticancer agents in the context of such interactions. The in vitro tumor cell–specific bioluminescence imaging assay is both high throughput and scalable. Conventional anticancer drug screening is typically performed in the absence of accessory cells of the tumor microenvironment, which can profoundly alter antitumor drug activity. To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell–specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging (CS-BLI) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. CS-BLI is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, NF-κB, HIF-1α, myc, hTERT and IRF4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, CS-BLI can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of CS-BLI, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1997565067,"Tumor suppressor genes on the X chromosome may skew the gender distribution of specific types of cancer. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with an increased incidence in males. In this study, we report the identification of inactivating mutations and deletions in the X-linked plant homeodomain finger 6 (PHF6) gene in 16% of pediatric and 38% of adult primary T-ALL samples. Notably, PHF6 mutations are almost exclusively found in T-ALL samples from male subjects. Mutational loss of PHF6 is importantly associated with leukemias driven by aberrant expression of the homeobox transcription factor oncogenes TLX1 and TLX3. Overall, these results identify PHF6 as a new X-linked tumor suppressor in T-ALL and point to a strong genetic interaction between PHF6 loss and aberrant expression of TLX transcription factors in the pathogenesis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1997960416,"Invasion of host cells by apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, is a multistep process. Central to invasion is the formation of a tight junction, an aperture in the host cell through which the parasite pulls itself before settling into a newly formed parasitophorous vacuole. Two protein groups, derived from different secretory organelles, the micronemal protein AMA1 and the rhoptry proteins RON2, RON4, and RON5, have been shown to form part of this structure, with antibodies targeting P. falciparum AMA1 known to inhibit invasion, probably via disruption of its association with the PfRON proteins. Inhibitory AMA1-binding peptides have also been described that block P. falciparum merozoite invasion of the erythrocyte. One of these, R1, blocks invasion some time after initial attachment to the erythrocyte and reorientation of the merozoite to its apical pole. Here we show that the R1 peptide binds the PfAMA1 hydrophobic trough and demonstrate that binding to this region prevents its interaction with the PfRON complex. We show that this defined association between PfAMA1 and the PfRON complex occurs after reorientation and engagement of the actomyosin motor and argue that it precedes rhoptry release. We propose that the formation of the AMA1-RON complex is essential for secretion of the rhoptry contents, which then allows the establishment of parasite infection within the parasitophorous vacuole.

IntroductionApicomplexan parasites are an ancient phylum of protozoan parasites, several members of which are important pathogens of humans, including Toxoplasma gondii and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. All Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites that invade a host cell at some point in their lifecycle to complete development. Indeed, the defining feature of this phylum is the presence, in the motile parasite form, of an apical complex composed of secretory organelles termed micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. The process of host cell invasion involves a series of tightly regulated steps. After initial contact of the parasite with a target cell, reorientation occurs, resulting in direct juxtaposition of its apical end with the host cell membrane, leading to the formation of a tight junction. This is an irreversible zone of contact where the host and parasite plasma membranes are brought together through interaction of parasite ligands with specific host cell receptors. As invasion proceeds, the junction moves along the parasite to the posterior, powered by an internal actomyosin motor, eventually leading to a fusion of the erythrocyte membrane with release of the parasite into a parasitophorous vacuole surrounded by the parasitophorous vacuole membrane inside the host cell (1Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 755-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar).The invasive blood stage form of P. falciparum, the merozoite, enters the host red cell in less than 30 s (2Gilson P.R.

Science. 1975; 187: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies of this event have provided a morphologically detailed description of tight junction formation (4Aikawa M. Bull. World Health Organ. 1977; 55: 139-156PubMed Google Scholar, 5Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Johnson J. Rabbege J. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), hinting at both the ultrastructure of the junction and the shedding of merozoite surface proteins (6Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Rabbege J.R. Epstein N. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified likely proteases responsible for this process of shedding and also provided a potential mechanism for disengagement of adhesin-receptor complexes at the junction, an event required for entry of the parasite into the host cell (7Harris P.K. Yeoh S. Dluzewski A.R. O'Donnell R.A. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Blackman M.J. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Initial contact of the merozoite with the erythrocyte is a low affinity interaction, most likely involving glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins located on the parasite surface (8Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D. Cohen S. Cell Tissue Res. 1986; 245: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Langreth S.G. Jensen J.B. Reese R.T. Trager W. J. Protozool. 1978; 25: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Other proteins, such as the micronemal protein apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA1), 4The abbreviations used are: PfAMA1P. falciparum apical membrane antigen-1TgAMA1T. gondii AMA1HSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlation. are released onto the surface at or just before merozoite egress and play an essential role in invasion (10Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), possibly mediating merozoite reorientation following attachment (11Mitchell G.H. Thomas A.W. Margos G. Dluzewski A.R. Bannister L.H. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Tight junction formation is thought to occur after reorientation, but little is known about the mechanism that underlies its formation or its molecular architecture.Recently, a rhoptry neck protein called TgRON4 was shown to localize to the tight junction during invasion of T. gondii tachyzoites into mammalian host cells (12Lebrun M. Michelin A. El Hajj H. Poncet J. Bradley P.J. Vial H. Dubremetz J.F. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Alexander D.L. Mital J. Ward G.E. Bradley P. Boothroyd J.C. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The T. gondii orthologue of PfAMA1 (TgAMA1), a micronemal protein, interacts with TgRON4 and two other rhoptry neck proteins, TgRON2 and TgRON5, at the tight junction of tachyzoites during invasion (13Alexander D.L. Mital J. Ward G.E. Bradley P. Boothroyd J.C. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum homologues of these proteins have been identified and associate in schizont stage protein extracts, although the apparent composition of the complex has varied between studies (14Alexander D.L. Arastu-Kapur S. Dubremetz J.F. Boothroyd J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Cao J. Kaneko O. Thongkukiatkul A. Tachibana M. Otsuki H. Gao Q.

Parasitol. 2009; 122: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although antibodies to PfAMA1 have long been known to inhibit merozoite invasion, the mechanism of inhibition has remained elusive (18Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that an invasion inhibitory monoclonal antibody that binds an epitope adjacent to the conserved PfAMA1 hydrophobic pocket prevented its association with the RON complex, suggesting a critical role for this interaction in the invasion process (16Collins C.R. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Blackman M.J. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000273Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the role of PfAMA1 has come from studies using a binding peptide, R1, which has been shown to inhibit invasion (19Harris K.S. Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Masciantonio R. Sabo J.K. Keizer D.W. Lee E.F. McMahon A. Norton R.S. Anders R.F. Foley M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6981-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Harris K.S. Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Karas J.A. Sabo J.K.

Live videomicroscopy of merozoites in the presence of R1 peptide showed that they undergo successful reorientation and attachment to the erythrocyte surface, including forceful pulling, but fail to proceed to invasion (21Treeck M. Zacherl S. Herrmann S. Cabrera A. Kono M. Struck N.S. Engelberg K. Haase S. Frischknecht F. Miura K. Spielmann T. Gilberger T.W. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This suggests that PfAMA1 plays a key role in the transition between attachment and activation of the invasion event, perhaps concurrent with tight junction formation.To better understand the mechanisms underlying erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite P. falciparum, we undertook an investigation of how R1 inhibits invasion. Here we demonstrate that R1 binds the PfAMA1 hydrophobic trough and that this prevents the interaction of PfAMA1 with the PfRON complex. Combined with videomicroscopy of R1-inhibited merozoites attempting invasion of erythrocytes, our data provide direct mechanistic insight into this crucial step in the establishment of blood stage infection.DISCUSSIONInvasion of erythrocytes by the malaria parasite P. falciparum is an obligatory step during blood stage infection, involving a cascade of molecular events between the parasite and host erythrocyte. We have shown that two distinct peptides that inhibit this process, R1 and F1, both act by blocking the interaction between PfAMA1 and the RON complex, as does the inhibitory antibody 4G2 (30Collins C.R. Withers-Martinez C. Bentley G.A. Batchelor A.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7431-7441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is therefore an important and apparently general mechanism of action of inhibitory agents that target AMA1 and represents a viable strategy for new therapeutic agents. A detailed structural understanding of these interactions is therefore of the utmost importance. Although it had been inferred previously that these inhibitory interactions may be localized at the conserved hydrophobic trough of AMA1 (7Harris P.K. Yeoh S. Dluzewski A.R. O'Donnell R.A. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Blackman M.J. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we now present direct evidence confirming this localization. Moreover, the NMR probes utilized here should be valuable in further studies of agents targeting this AMA1-RON interaction. A potential drawback of these inhibitory peptides as models for the development of antimalarial drugs is their strain specificity, but we have shown recently that relatively simple modifications of R1 can enhance its affinity for AMA1 from the strains HB3 and W2mef (20Harris K.S. Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Karas J.A. Sabo J.K. Tan Y.Y. Dolezal O. Norton R.S. Hughes A.B. Scanlon D. Foley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9361-9371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This, together with the apparently conserved nature of the AMA1 hydrophobic trough and the AMA1-RON interaction, strongly suggests that strain-independent inhibition should be achievable by this mechanism. Videomicroscopy of merozoites invading erythrocytes has provided an overall view of the process that can now be used as a framework to dissect the mechanisms involved at each step (2Gilson P.R. Crabb B.S. Int. J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Treeck M. Zacherl S. Herrmann S. Cabrera A. Kono M. Struck N.S. Engelberg K. Haase S. Frischknecht F. Miura K. Spielmann T. Gilberger T.W. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2A). The results presented here are a first step in this direction.P. falciparum merozoites incubated in the presence of R1 proceed from initial contact with the erythrocyte through to the reorientation and formation of the tight junction between the apical tip of the parasite and the red blood cell membrane (21Treeck M. Zacherl S. Herrmann S. Cabrera A. Kono M. Struck N.S. Engelberg K. Haase S. Frischknecht F. Miura K. Spielmann T. Gilberger T.W. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2B, red arrows). The merozoite can then be seen to pull on the red blood cell, causing it to wrap around the apical tip, but invasion fails to proceed (supplemental Fig. 2B, yellow arrows, 24.1 s). This suggests that the machinery required by the parasite to propel itself, that is, adhesin binding and actomyosin motor engagement, is established and functional, with its action pushing the merozoite against the erythrocyte membrane. This, combined with our data demonstrating that R1 blocks PfAMA1 function by preventing its association with the PfRON complex, allows us to precisely define the step at which this interaction takes place during the invasion process, i.e. after reorientation and establishment of the initial tight junction and motor engagement (Fig. 6). We thus hypothesize that the interaction of PfAMA1 with the PfRONs results in the secretion of the rhoptries, whose contents likely form the nascent parasitophorous vacuole membrane, and that R1 inhibits invasion by preventing the steps that initiate secretion of the rhoptry bulb contents. Recent work in T. gondii has shown that the TgRON complex was translocated into the host cell cytosol, with TgRON2 spanning the host plasma membrane and acting as a receptor for TgAMA1 (37Straub K.W. Cheng S.J. Sohn C.S. Bradley P.J. Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 590-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Besteiro S. Michelin A. Poncet J. Dubremetz J.F. Lebrun M. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000309Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Whether this is also true for Plasmodium is not known at the moment but, if this is the case, we believe that R1 inhibition would occur subsequently to this translocation and therefore that secretion of the rhoptry neck requires different signals than the ones involved in rhoptry bulb secretion. Earlier studies have shown that rhoptries contain high amounts of lamellar deposits, most likely made up of lipids (39Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D. Parasitology. 1986; 92: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 40Stewart M.J. Schulman S. Vanderberg J.P. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1986; 35: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which are predicted to be released at the point of contact between the invading merozoite and the red blood cell (41Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In untreated parasites, following the formation of the junction aperture, release of the rhoptry contents allows for the generation of the nascent parasitophorous vacuole, which then most likely provides necessary space for the merozoite to push through as the actomyosin motor propels it forward (39Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Butcher G.A. Dennis E.D. Parasitology. 1986; 92: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Electron micrograph images of invading Plasmodium knowlesi merozoites, treated with cytochalasin B (which blocks actin filament polymerization but not tight junction formation), reveal the presence of vesicles in the red blood cell cytoplasm at the point of contact between the apical tip of the parasite and the erythrocyte membrane, suggesting that blocking motor function, although arresting invasion, does not prevent rhoptry secretion (42Miller L.H. Aikawa M. Johnson J.G. Shiroishi T. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 172-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We predict that R1-treated P. falciparum parasites would not show these vesicles, as precursors to full rhoptry release. Unfortunately, capturing P. falciparum merozoites mid-invasion is a very rare event because of the fragile nature of merozoites from this species and has not as yet been documented by electron microscopy.The fact that the AMA1-RON complex interaction has been observed in other Plasmodium species (43Narum D.L. Nguyen V. Zhang Y. Glen J. Shimp R.L. Lambert L. Ling I.T. Reiter K. Ogun S.A. Long C. Holder A.A. Herrera R. Infect.

Immun. 2006; 74: 5529-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and T. gondii (13Alexander D.L. Mital J. Ward G.E. Bradley P. Boothroyd J.C. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) suggests a conserved mechanism of rhoptry release across apicomplexan parasites. Indeed, a T. gondii strain with a conditional knock-out of TgAMA1 fails to invade and was shown to be defective in rhoptry secretion (45Mital J. Meissner M. Soldati D. Ward G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4341-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A role for AMA1 in rhoptry secretion is further supported by its absence in the ookinete stage, which does not have rhoptries (46Lal K. Prieto J.H. Bromley E. Sanderson S.J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Wastling J.M. Tomley F.M. Sinden R.E. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This highlights the signals that link binding of AMA1 to the RONs, and subsequent rhoptry secretion, as key areas of future study. A recent report demonstrating the importance of phosphorylated residues in the PfAMA1 cytoplasmic tail to invasion provides a tantalizing possibility for the mechanism behind this signaling event (21Treeck M. Zacherl S. Herrmann S. Cabrera A. Kono M. Struck N.S. Engelberg K. Haase S. Frischknecht F. Miura K. Spielmann T. Gilberger T.W.

Rabbege J.R. Epstein N. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified likely proteases responsible for this process of shedding and also provided a potential mechanism for disengagement of adhesin-receptor complexes at the junction, an event required for entry of the parasite into the host cell (7Harris P.K.

Initial contact of the merozoite with the erythrocyte is a low affinity interaction, most likely involving glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins located on the parasite surface (8Bannister L.H.

Bannister L.H. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Tight junction formation is thought to occur after reorientation, but little is known about the mechanism that underlies its formation or its molecular architecture.Recently, a rhoptry neck protein called TgRON4 was shown to localize to the tight junction during invasion of T. gondii tachyzoites into mammalian host cells (12Lebrun M.

Boothroyd J.C. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The T. gondii orthologue of PfAMA1 (TgAMA1), a micronemal protein, interacts with TgRON4 and two other rhoptry neck proteins, TgRON2 and TgRON5, at the tight junction of tachyzoites during invasion (13Alexander D.L. Mital J. Ward G.E. Bradley P. Boothroyd J.C. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum homologues of these proteins have been identified and associate in schizont stage protein extracts, although the apparent composition of the complex has varied between studies (14Alexander D.L.

Parasitol. 2009; 122: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although antibodies to PfAMA1 have long been known to inhibit merozoite invasion, the mechanism of inhibition has remained elusive (18Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that an invasion inhibitory monoclonal antibody that binds an epitope adjacent to the conserved PfAMA1 hydrophobic pocket prevented its association with the RON complex, suggesting a critical role for this interaction in the invasion process (16Collins C.R. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Blackman M.J. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000273Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the role of PfAMA1 has come from studies using a binding peptide, R1, which has been shown to inhibit invasion (19Harris K.S. Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Masciantonio R. Sabo J.K.

Live videomicroscopy of merozoites in the presence of R1 peptide showed that they undergo successful reorientation and attachment to the erythrocyte surface, including forceful pulling, but fail to proceed to invasion (21Treeck M. Zacherl S. Herrmann S. Cabrera A. Kono M. Struck N.S. Engelberg K. Haase S. Frischknecht F. Miura K. Spielmann T. Gilberger T.W. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This suggests that PfAMA1 plays a key role in the transition between attachment and activation of the invasion event, perhaps concurrent with tight junction formation.To better understand the mechanisms underlying erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite P. falciparum, we undertook an investigation of how R1 inhibits invasion. Here we demonstrate that R1 binds the PfAMA1 hydrophobic trough and that this prevents the interaction of PfAMA1 with the PfRON complex. Combined with videomicroscopy of R1-inhibited merozoites attempting invasion of erythrocytes, our data provide direct mechanistic insight into this crucial step in the establishment of blood stage infection."
https://openalex.org/W2053318380,"Oxidative stress induced by inhibition of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis with D,L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) causes human microglia, human astrocytes, THP-1 cells, and U373 cells to secrete materials toxic to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and stimulates them to release TNF-α, IL-6, and nitrite ions. The effect is correlated with activation of the inflammatory pathways P38 MAP- kinase, Jun-N-terminal kinase, and NF-KB. The effect is reduced by adding to the medium GSH or clotrimazole (CTM), an inhibitor of Ca2+-influx through TRPM2 channels. It is also produced by inhibiting TRPM2 protein expression in microglia and astrocytes through introduction of its small inhibitory RNA (siRNA). TRPM2 mRNA is expressed by glial cells but not by SH-SY5Y cells. BSO in the culture medium causes an almost 3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i in microglia and astrocytes over a 24-h period, which is reduced to half by the addition of CTM. The data strongly suggest that inhibiting intracellular GSH synthesis induces a neuroinflammatory response in human microglia and astrocytes, which is linked to Ca2+ influx through TRPM2 channels. It represents a new model for inducing neuroinflammation and suggests that increasing GSH levels in glial cells may confer neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, which have a prominent neuroinflammatory component.—Lee, M., Cho, T., Jantaratnotai, N., Wang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2067382049,"As chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progresses from the chronic phase to blast crisis, the levels of BCR-ABL increase. In addition, blast-transformed leukemic cells display enhanced resistance to imatinib in the absence of BCR-ABL-resistance mutations. In this study, we show that when BCR-ABL-transformed cell lines were selected for imatinib resistance in vitro, the cells that grew out displayed a higher BCR-ABL expression comparable to the increase seen in accelerated forms of the disease. This enhanced expression of BCR-ABL was associated with an increased rate of glycolysis but with a decreased rate of proliferation. The higher level of BCR-ABL expression in the selected cells correlated with a nonhypoxic induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) that was required for cells to tolerate enhanced BCR-ABL signaling. HIF-1α induction resulted in an enhanced rate of glycolysis but with reduced glucose flux through both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The reduction in oxidative PPP-mediated ribose synthesis was compensated by the HIF-1α-dependent activation of the nonoxidative PPP enzyme, transketolase, in imatinib-resistant CML cells. In both primary cultures of cells from patients exhibiting blast transformation and in vivo xenograft tumors, use of oxythiamine, which can inhibit both the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and transketolase, resulted in enhanced imatinib sensitivity of tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that oxythiamine can enhance imatinib efficacy in patients who present an accelerated form of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1971588558,"Ubiquitin is one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes and plays major biological roles as a post-translational protein modifier. Ubiquitin is also a natural constituent of plasma, and several lines of evidence suggest that extracellular ubiquitin is an immune modulator with anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, ubiquitin treatment has been shown to limit inflammation and reduce organ injury in various disease models and species in vivo. However, its mechanism of action is unknown. Here we show that extracellular ubiquitin is a natural CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4 and CD184) agonist. Extracellular ubiquitin promotes intracellular Ca(2+) flux and reduces cAMP levels through a G protein-coupled receptor that signals via a Galpha(i/o) protein in THP1 cells. Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation reduces ubiquitin-binding sites, which enabled identification of four Galpha(i/o) PCRs as ubiquitin receptor candidates. Overexpression of candidate genes in HEK293 cells, gene silencing in THP1 cells, competition binding, and signaling studies with the CXCR4 agonist stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 12) and inhibitor AMD3100 identify CXCR4 as a functional ubiquitin receptor. Our finding uncovers a fundamentally new aspect of the role of ubiquitin in biology, has implications for the understanding of CXCR4-mediated events, and is expected to facilitate development of new therapeutic avenues for a variety of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2028004137,"Iron is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in numerous cellular processes, yet little is known about the impact of iron deficiency on cellular metabolism or iron proteins. Previous studies have focused on changes in transcript and proteins levels in iron-deficient cells, yet these changes may not reflect changes in transport activity or flux through a metabolic pathway. We analyzed the metabolomes and transcriptomes of yeast grown in iron-rich and iron-poor media to determine which biosynthetic processes are altered when iron availability falls. Iron deficiency led to changes in glucose metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and lipid biosynthesis that were due to deficiencies in specific iron-dependent enzymes. Iron-sulfur proteins exhibited loss of iron cofactors, yet amino acid synthesis was maintained. Ergosterol and sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways had blocks at points where heme and diiron enzymes function, whereas Ole1, the essential fatty acid desaturase, was resistant to iron depletion. Iron-deficient cells exhibited depletion of most iron enzyme activities, but loss of activity during iron deficiency did not consistently disrupt metabolism. Amino acid homeostasis was robust, but iron deficiency impaired lipid synthesis, altering the properties and functions of cellular membranes.

Iron-deficient cells exhibited depletion of most iron enzyme activities, but loss of activity during iron deficiency did not consistently disrupt metabolism. Amino acid homeostasis was robust, but iron deficiency impaired lipid synthesis, altering the properties and functions of cellular membranes. With a few notable exceptions, iron is an essential nutrient for virtually every organism. Every cell in the human body has a requirement for iron, yet iron can be toxic when present in excess. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder in the world (1Zimmermann M.B. Hurrell R.F. Lancet. 2007; 370: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are especially prevalent among children and women of childbearing age, where they are associated with perinatal mortality. Iron deficiency also impairs neurological development and cognitive function in children, and some of these defects appear to be irreversible (2Beard J.L. J. Nutr. 2008; 138: 2534-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although the pathogenesis of anemia in iron deficiency is well understood, other manifestations of iron deficiency are not understood at the cellular or metabolic level, and it is unlikely that all of the clinical manifestations of iron deficiency can be attributed to a reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Iron overload is also a common disorder and is associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, iron loading anemias, and chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver (3Alla V. Bonkovsky H.L. Semin. Liver Dis. 2005; 25: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Iron overload is typically manifest as an accumulation of iron in organs, especially the liver, heart, and pancreas, leading to organ dysfunction and failure. The mechanisms by which excess iron causes organ failure are unknown. Iron is an essential nutrient, because iron cofactors activate enzymes involved in most of the major metabolic processes in the cell. This metal is used in the synthesis of organic and inorganic cofactors, such as heme and iron-sulfur clusters, as well as in the metallation of mononuclear and diiron enzymes (5Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 669-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 6Ozer A. Bruick R.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7Paoli M. Marles-Wright J. Smith A. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Iron proteins are required for oxygen delivery, for the oxidation of acetyl CoA via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and for the generation of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Iron cofactors are required for the biosynthesis of amino acids, proteins, sterols, and fatty acids. They are required for the synthesis and repair of DNA and for the metabolism of xenobiotics. Very little is known about the activity of these enzymes under conditions of iron deficiency. For examples, it is not known whether cells can tolerate large reductions in the activity of any of these enzymes, it is not known whether any particular class of iron enzyme is susceptible to iron deficiency, and it is not known whether individual iron-dependent pathways are disproportionally affected by iron deficiency. Studies of metal metabolism in budding yeast have yielded important insights into iron metabolism in both humans and pathogenic microorganisms. In determining the cellular response to iron deficiency and iron overload in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we and others have focused on changes in the levels of mRNA transcripts and proteins involved in iron homeostasis (8Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 9Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that S. cerevisiae responds to iron deficiency by (i) activating systems of iron uptake, (ii) mobilizing intracellular stores of iron, and (iii) adjusting metabolism to optimize the use of iron (10Philpott C.C. Protchenko O. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). One metabolic adjustment indicated by the changes in mRNA transcript levels is the redistribution of iron away from some non-essential biosynthetic pathways toward other, essential iron-requiring pathways. Under conditions of iron deficiency, S. cerevisiae relies on two transcription factors, Aft1 and Aft2, to activate the transcription of genes involved in the primary response to iron deficiency (11Waldron K.J. Rutherford J.C. Ford D. Robinson N.J. Nature. 2009; 460: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Some of this redistribution of iron is apparent in the genes directly activated by Aft1 and -2, and some is suggested by other transcripts that are down-regulated under iron deficiency (12Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Many transcripts encoding components of the respiratory cytochromes, which contain several heme cofactors, and some heme biosynthetic genes are down-regulated in iron deficiency (8Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), while the heme-degrading enzyme encoded by HMX1 (an Aft1 target) is up-regulated (13Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This down-regulation of heme synthesis and the respiratory machinery is consistent with the observation that iron-deficient cells cannot grow on non-fermentable carbon sources and thus cannot rely exclusively on respiration for energy production during iron deficiency. Several transcripts encoding Fe-S cluster proteins involved in glutamate, leucine, and lipoic acid biosynthesis are down-regulated during iron deficiency (8Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 9Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Multiple transcripts coding for proteins involved in biotin biosynthesis, including the iron-sulfur cluster protein Bio2, are down-regulated in iron deficiency, whereas transporters facilitating the uptake of biotin and biotin precursors are up-regulated by Aft1. Some of this down-regulation of mRNAs occurs at the transcriptional level while some is controlled post-transcriptionally. CTH1 and CTH2 encode two proteins that are expressed in response to iron deficiency and are under the control of Aft1 and -2 (8Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Puig S. Vergara S.V. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These proteins of the tristetraprolin family of RNA-binding proteins specifically recognize AU-rich sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of many transcripts coding for proteins that contain iron cofactors, such as succinate dehydrogenase, and aconitase. Cth1 and -2 bind to these mRNAs and promote their degradation. Thus, under conditions of iron deficiency, yeast activate the expression of proteins that lead to the degradation of mRNAs encoding proteins that function in iron-dependent pathways, thereby reducing the amount of iron allocated to these pathways. Cth1 and Cth2 also appear to be indirectly involved in the up-regulation of several transcripts that may contribute to an alteration in glucose metabolism and carbohydrate storage that occurs in iron deficiency. Although these studies have produced some insights into the metabolic response to iron deficiency, they have a major limitation. That is, alterations in protein levels do not always correlate with the flux of metabolites through a pathway, because the flux through a pathway is largely determined by enzyme kinetics and substrate concentrations. Changes in the level of an iron-binding enzyme may alter the amount of iron dedicated to that pathway without producing a significant change in the flux through the pathway. Here we analyzed the metabolomes of yeast grown in iron-rich and iron-poor media to determine the extent to which flux through metabolic pathways is maintained or altered in the face of falling iron availability. We find that in yeast, amino acid homeostatic mechanisms are robust, but that carbon source utilization and lipid biosynthesis are affected by iron deficiency. We found specific alterations in the flux through the ergosterol and sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways at points where heme and diiron enzymes function. We specifically examined the metallation of iron-dependent enzymes and found that, although some enzymes are resistant to iron deficiency, others exhibit loss of their iron cofactors during periods of iron deficiency.

For short term growth, cells grown in optimal iron were transferred to low iron or high iron medium for an additional 4 h. All cells were grown at 30 °C with shaking, and six independent cultures were prepared for each growth condition. Metabolomics analysis was carried out in collaboration with Metabolon, Inc. Cells were subjected to glass bead lysis, and metabolites were extracted and analyzed as described (16Lawton K.A. Berger A. Mitchell M. Milgram K.E. Evans A.M. Guo L. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C.

The samples were extracted using a series of four solvent extraction steps: 400 μl of tridecanoic acid (2.5 mg/ml) in ethyl acetate:ethyl alcohol (1:1), 200 μl of methanol, 200 μl of methanol:H2O (3:1), and 200 μl of dichloromethane:methanol (1:1). Each solvent-extraction step was performed by shaking for 2 min in the presence of glass beads using a Geno/Grinder 2000 (Glen Mills, Inc., Clifton, NJ). After each extraction the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed using the MicroLab STAR® robotics system, followed by re-extraction of the pellet. The multiple extract supernatants were pooled and then split into two equal aliquots, one for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and one for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Aliquots were placed on a TurboVap® (Zymark) to remove the solvent, frozen, and dried under vacuum overnight. Samples were maintained at 4 °C throughout the extraction process. For LC/MS analysis extract aliquots were reconstituted in 10% methanol and 0.1% formic acid. For GC/MS analysis, aliquots were derivatized using equal parts bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide and solvent mixture acetonitrile:dichloromethane:cyclohexane (5:4:1) with 5% triethylamine at 60 °C for 1 h. LC/MS was carried out using a Surveyor HPLC (ThermoElectron Corp., San Jose, CA) with an electrospray ionization (18Katajamaa M. Oresic M. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 179Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) source coupled to an LTQ mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corp.). The derivatized samples for GC/MS were analyzed on a ThermoFinnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer operated at unit mass resolving power. Compounds were identified by automated comparison to Metabolon's reference library entries. Data normalization and statistical analysis were performed as described previously (16Lawton K.A. Berger A.

Data were normalized to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Raw area counts for a compound were divided by the median value, setting the medians equal for each day's run. Missing values were assumed to result from areas being below the limits of detection. Missing values for a given compound were imputed with half the observed minimum after the normalization step. Quantitative values were derived from integrated raw detector counts of the mass spectrometers. Importantly, while peak area comparisons between samples represent relative amounts of each ion detected, different compounds and ions have different ionization potentials. To preserve all of the variation, yet allow compounds of widely different raw peak areas to be compared directly on a similar graphical scale, a simple arithmetic transformation was performed in which each data point was divided by the mean of the entire set for that compound. Statistical analysis was performed on log transformed values with Welch's two-sample t test. Microarray analysis was performed in quadruplicate (15Protchenko O. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Keane P. Storey J.

For amino acid analysis, cells were subjected to glass bead lysis in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the clarified supernatant was subjected to analysis using an Hitachi Amino Acid Analyzer Model L-8800. Raw data were recorded using EZ Chrom Elite software, and cell extracts were normalized by absorbance at 260 nm. For sterol analysis, the non-saponifiable sterol fraction was extracted and analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph (GC) as previously described (20Kennedy M.A. Bard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sterol intermediates were identified based on retention times and analyses of sterols that accumulate in wild-type and various ergosterol mutant strains. Peaks were identified by comparison to known standards. Neutral lipids were extracted and measured as described (21Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol (22Bertello L.E. Gonçalvez M.F. Colli W. de Lederkremer R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Hung C.Y. Ko Y.G. Thompson Jr., G.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) then analyzed quantitatively by HPLC. A 3 A600 cell pellet was dried and subjected to acid methanolysis by boiling in 1 n HCl in methanol for 30 min. After cooling, 1 volume of 0.9% NaCl was added, the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted twice with hexane:diethyl ether (1:1), and the extracts were pooled and dried under N2 gas. The pH of the remaining aqueous phase was adjusted with 0.125 volume of 10 n NaOH. The long-chain bases were analyzed as described with the following modifications (24Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Long-chain bases were extracted twice with 2 ml of hexane, and the extracts were pooled and dried. The long-chain base extract was redissolved in 80 μl of methanol:190 mm triethylamine (20:3) and 20 μl of AccQ-Fluor Reagent (Waters). Samples were incubated at 23 °C for 60 min, and 60 μl of the sample was injected onto a Genesis C18 4 mm HPLC column (Jones Chromatography) and resolved on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC equipped with a fluorescence detector. The long-chain bases were resolved using an isocratic mobile phase of acetonitrile:methanol:H2O:acetic acid:triethylamine (48:32:16.5:3.0:0.7) at 1.5 ml/min and detected by the AccQ fluorescence (Ex: 244 nm/Em: 398 nm). Phytosphingosine (PHS) concentrations were determined by adding the PHS peak with that of the 1,4-anhydro-PHS peak, which elutes slightly after dihydrosphingosine (DHS). Fatty acid methyl ester extracts were resuspended in 50 μl of hexane, and 1 μl was autoinjected onto a GC/MS (HP 6890/5973) equipped with a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm HP INNOWax column. The fatty acid methyl esters were resolved at 0.5 ml/min constant flow using a temperature gradient as follows: initial oven at 50°, 40°/min to 90° and hold for 2 min, 20°/min to 250°, and hold for 90 min. Fatty acid methyl ester identification was determined by using an MS fragmentation pattern. Heme was extracted from 55Fe-labeled cells as described (25Stehling O. Smith P.M. Biederbick A. Balk J. Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Leister D. Herrmann J.M. Mitochondria: Practical Protocols. Springer, New York2007: 325-342Google Scholar) and measured by scintillation counting. Ferric reductase assays were performed as described (26Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). TAP-tagged strains were lysed as described (15Protchenko O. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Keane P. Storey J. Androphy R. Philpott C.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected using peroxidase anti-peroxidase-soluble complex (Sigma) at 1:1000. For subcellular fractionations, cells were lysed as described (15Protchenko O. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Keane P. Storey J. Androphy R. Philpott C.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and lysates were separated on 20–60% continuous sucrose gradients. Fractions were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using peroxidase anti-peroxidase, anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science) at 1:1000, and anti-Dpm1 (Molecular Probes) at 1:1000. Immunoprecipitations from 55Fe-labeled cells were performed as described (27Deng Y. Guo Y. Watson H. Au W.C. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Basrai M.A. Bonifacino J.S. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using IgG-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Immune complexes were washed, and 10% of the total washed beads were used for Western blotting, whereas the remainder was subjected to scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using peroxidase anti-peroxidase complex and Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit at 1:1000. Quantitative fluorescence intensity was determined using a Typhoon imager with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). As a negative control, protein G-Sepharose was substituted for IgG-Sepharose in the immunoprecipitations of 55Fe-labeled lysates. Previous studies on iron deficiency in yeast have utilized common laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae that exhibit multiple amino acid auxotrophies. These auxotrophies are rescued with amino acid supplementation of the medium, which typically results in alterations in the expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes. Because the synthesis of amino acids is a major function of intermediary metabolism and because several enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis are iron-containing proteins, we used a strain that did not exhibit any amino acid auxotrophies and grew the strain in medium without amino acid supplementation. We performed metabolite analyses on yeast grown for 18 h (7 to 8 generations) or for short duration (4 h) in low iron and high iron media and compared these metabolite levels to those of yeast grown with optimal iron concentrations (supplemental Table S1). Cells grown in low iron medium exhibited slower growth, with a 20% increase in doubling time compared with optimal-iron medium at the end of the culture period, confirming that iron was limiting for growth in this medium. Cells grown in high iron medium also exhibited slower growth, with a 40% increase in doubling time, confirming that high iron cells were exposed to iron toxicity. Using both LC/MS and GC/MS, 129 metabolites were detected and identified in the yeast samples, and most of these exhibited some change in either high iron or low iron medium (Fig. 1A). Of the growth conditions tested, the greatest number of metabolite level changes and the highest magnitude changes occurred in the yeast grown for 18 h in low iron medium, with 70 metabolites exhibiting significant changes (Fig. 1B). Yeast grown for 18 h in high iron medium exhibited the smallest changes to the metabolome, and specifically did not show evidence of oxidative stress. For example, levels of oxidized and reduced glutathione did not change. Comparison of the low iron, 18-h yeast to the high iron, 18-h yeast mirrored the changes seen in the comparison of low with optimal iron, but with greater magnitude changes (Fig. 1C), and this comparison is shown in the figures below. Virtually every category of metabolites was affected by iron availability. To correlate changes in metabolite levels with changes in gene transcript levels, we performed microarray analyses on cells grown in low iron and high iron conditions identical to those used for the metabolite analyses. The results of these microarray analyses were very similar those previously published, in that the Aft1 target genes were highly up-regulated in the low iron condition, confirming that our growth conditions produced iron deficiency (data not shown). They differed from previous microarrays in the regulation of genes involved in the uptake and synthesis of amino acids and in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Yeast consume the majority of cellular glucose in the process of energy production. Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate via glycolysis, then pyruvate is either converted to ethanol and CO2 via fermentation, or fully oxidized to CO2 and H2O via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiration (Fig. 2A). Even in the presence of oxygen, yeast typically ferment nearly all of the available glucose, with only 3% being metabolized via respiration (28Lagunas R. Yeast. 1986; 2: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although respiration yields far more energy than fermentation, it also requires large quantities of iron, as respiratory complexes II–IV contain numerous heme and Fe-S centers, and two tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, contain Fe-S clusters. Although yeast can grow on carbon sources that can only be metabolized through respiration, they cannot do so under conditions of iron deficiency. Previous studies using microarrays found that iron-deficient yeast down-regulate transcripts involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiration (8Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 9Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D.

Genet. 2003; 12: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and we found evidence of similar transcript changes in these studies (supplemental Table S2). Metabolite analysis indicated that levels of intracellular glucose, glycolytic intermediates, and byproducts of glycolysis were significantly depleted in iron-deficient cells while the product of glycolysis, pyruvate, was elevated (Fig. 2B). In contrast, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates succinate, fumarate, and malate were significantly elevated (Fig. 2C). Citrate levels rose in cells grown in both low iron medium (2.8-fold) and high iron medium (2.2-fold) when compared with optimal iron cells. Only 2-oxoglutarate levels fell in low iron cells, which may have occurred as large amounts of this intermediate are drawn out of the tricarboxylic acid cycle for the synthesis of amino acids and purines. Intracellular glucose depletion was not associated with depletion of glucose in the growth medium (supplemental Fig. S2A). Intermediates"
https://openalex.org/W2067875248,"The core kinetochore protein CENP-H is shown to be required for the organization of the metaphase plate. CENP-H regulates microtubule plus-end dynamics, and chromosome oscillations, which are shown to be essential for chromosome congression. Chromosome segregation in metazoans requires the alignment of sister kinetochores on the metaphase plate. During chromosome alignment, bioriented kinetochores move chromosomes by regulating the plus-end dynamics of the attached microtubules. The bundles of kinetochore-bound microtubules alternate between growth and shrinkage, leading to regular oscillations along the spindle axis. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate microtubule plus-end dynamics remain unknown. Here we show that centromere protein (CENP)-H, a subunit of the CENP-A nucleosome-associated and CENP-A distal complexes (CENP-A NAC/CAD), is essential for this coordination, because kinetochores lacking CENP-H establish bioriented attachments but fail to generate regular oscillations, as a result of an uncontrolled rate of microtubule plus-end turnover. These alterations lead to rapid erratic movements that disrupt metaphase plate organization. We also show that the abundance of the CENP-A NAC/CAD subunits CENP-H and CENP-I dynamically change on individual sister kinetochores in vivo, because they preferentially bind the sister kinetochore attached to growing microtubules, and that one other subunit, CENP-Q, binds microtubules in vitro. We therefore propose that CENP-A NAC/CAD is a direct regulator of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics, which physically links centromeric DNA to microtubule plus ends."

https://openalex.org/W2087156154,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in various cell types, which mediates many of the effects of TGF-β. The molecular mechanisms whereby TGF-β increases ROS production and ROS modulate the signaling processes of TGF-β, however, remain poorly defined. In this study, we show that TGF-β1 stimulates NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression and ROS generation in the nucleus of murine embryo fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells). This is associated with an increase in protein thiol modification and inactivation of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), a nuclear phosphatase. Furthermore, knockdown of MKP-1 using small interfering RNA enhances TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38 as well as the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a TGF-β-responsive gene involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Knockdown of Nox4 with Nox4 small interfering RNA, on the other hand, reduces TGF-β1-stimulated ROS production, p38 phosphorylation, and PAI-1 expression. TGF-β also increased the nuclear level of Nox4 protein as well as PAI-1 expression in human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210 cells), suggesting that TGF-β may induce PAI-1 expression by a similar mechanism in human lung fibroblasts. In summary, in this study we have identified nuclear MAPK phosphatase MKP-1 as a novel molecular target of ROS in TGF-β signaling pathways. Our data suggest that increased generation of ROS by Nox4 mediates TGF-β1-induced PAI-1 gene expression at least in part through oxidative modification and inhibition of MKP-1 leading to a sustained activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs.

https://openalex.org/W1983374699,"C53/LZAP (also named as Cdk5rap3) is a putative tumor suppressor that plays important roles in multiple cell signaling pathways, including DNA damage response and NF-κB signaling. Yet how its function is regulated remains largely unclear. Here we report the isolation and characterization of two novel C53/LZAP-interacting proteins, RCAD (Regulator of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1) and DDRGK1 (DDRGK domain-containing protein 1). Our co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed their interactions, while gel filtration assay indicated that C53/LZAP and RCAD may form a large protein complex. Intriguingly, we found that RCAD knockdown led to dramatic reduction of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 proteins. We also found that C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 became more susceptible to the proteasome-mediated degradation in RCAD knockdown cells, whereas their ubiquitination was significantly attenuated by RCAD overexpression. In addition, we found that RCAD, like C53/LZAP, also plays an important role in regulation of NF-κB signaling and cell invasion. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that RCAD is a novel regulator of C53/LZAP tumor suppressor and NF-κB signaling.

C53/LZAP is a highly conserved protein that has been shown to be involved in multiple cell signaling pathways. We originally found that C53/LZAP overexpression potentiated DNA damage-induced cell death by modulating the G2/M checkpoint (1Jiang H. Luo S. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20651-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that by antagonizing checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), C53/LZAP modulated the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), thereby influencing the DNA damage response and mitotic entry during the cell cycle progression (2Jiang H. Wu J. He C. Yang W. Li H. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, Wang et al. (3Wang J. An H. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Yarbrough W.G. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) elegantly demonstrated that C53/LZAP functions as a novel tumor suppressor in primary head and neck cancers by specifically inhibiting NF-κB signaling. They found that decreased C53/LZAP expression promoted cellular transformation, xenograft tumor growth, and xenograft tumor vascularity. Loss of C53/LZAP increased cellular invasion, and NF-κB transcriptional activity. At the molecular level, C53/LZAP directly bound to RelA, impaired serine 536 phosphorylation of RelA and increased HDAC association with RelA, thereby inhibiting basal and stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity. Interestingly, they found that C53/LZAP protein level was markedly decreased in one third of primary human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) and decreased C53/LZAP level in primary HNSCC correlated with increased expression of the NF-κB-regulated genes IL-8 and IκBα. C53/LZAP appears to play important roles in cell signaling pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis, yet the mechanism to regulate its activity remains completely unknown. To further elucidate its biological functions and the molecular mechanism that regulates its activity, we attempted to identify and characterize its interacting partners. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel C53/LZAP-interacting protein that regulates its protein stability.

The following antibodies at indicated dilutions were used for immunoblotting: GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:10,000), anti-Flag M2 (Sigma, 1:2,000), Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:3,000), HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma, 1:2,000), C53 rat polyclonal and monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution), RCAD rat polyclonal antibody (affinity purified, 1:500), DDRGK1 rat polyclonal antibody (affinity purified, 1:500). Species-specific horseradish peroxidase- and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Subcellular fractionation was performed according to the protocol of differential sucrose gradient isolation of ER and mitochondria (17Bozidis P. Williamson C.D. Colberg-Poley A.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2007Google Scholar). HeLa or HepG2 cells (from three 75-cm flasks) that had reached 90% confluency were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed mechanically with sonication in MTE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 270 mm d-mannitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors. The following procedures were performed at 4 °C. A low-speed centrifugation (700 × g) was used to remove large cellular debris. The supernatant from this step was collected as a total lysed protein fraction, and further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min to separate mitochondria from ER and other light membrane fractions. The supernatant from 15,000 × g centrifugation (containing crude ER) was loaded onto a three-layered discontinuous sucrose gradient (1.3, 1.5, and 2 m sucrose from the top to the bottom in MTE buffer) and centrifuged at 152,000 × g for 70 min. The top layer was collected as the fraction of cytosol, while the banded fraction at the interface of the 1.3 m sucrose layer was collected as the ER fraction. The subcellular fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and followed by immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies. We used calnexin as the ER marker, and α-tubulin as the cytosol marker. Cells (1 × 106) were collected and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. mRNA was purified by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by Superscript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), and used as the template for real-time PCR. QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) was used for RT-PCR assays that were run on ABI 7500 RT-PCR system and analyzed by the relevant software. The primers were used for RT-PCR: human GAPDH: 5′-AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAA-3′ (forward); 5′-CCATGTAGTTGAGGTCAATGAAGG-3′ (reverse); human C53/LZAP: 5′-ATTTTTGGCCGATACTCTTCACA-3′ (forward); 5′-TCATAGTTGACATTCCGAACCAG-3′ (reverse); human RCAD: 5′-AGCAAACAGGCCTCAACTGT-3′ (forward); 5′-TTTCTGGTGCATCAGCTCAC-3′ (reverse); human DDRGK1: 5′-TGCTGGCTGAGGGGACTATAA-3′ (forward); 5′-CCGCTGTCGGATGAAGTTG-3′ (reverse). The NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (a gift from Dr. Junying Yuan) was transfected into HeLa or U2OS cells along with pRL-TK (Promega). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 8 h. Cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. 4 at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then scraped from the tissue culture dish and harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was further fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h, and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h at 4 °C. The cell pellet was dehydrated in an ethanol gradient (50–100% for 10 min each) and embedded in Epon 812 at 60 °C for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and pictures were taken by a Zeiss 900 electron microscope. HeLa S100 extract was prepared as described by Dignam et al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). 0.5 ml of S100 extract was loaded on Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) that was precalibrated with gel filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare). The chromatography was performed using AKTApurifier (GE Healthcare) in the buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors (0.3 ml/min flow rate). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots of the fraction were subject to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Cell invasion assays were performed in an invasion chamber, a 24-well tissue culture plate with 12 cell culture inserts. The inserts contain an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Transwell Permeable Support, Corning Inc), coated with 60 μl of 1 mg/ml Matrigel (BD Sciences). U2OS cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight, trypsinized, and washed three times in DMEM containing 1% FBS. 2 × 104 cells in 1% FBS-DMEM were seeded into the upper chamber, and 600 μl of DMEM containing 10% or 1% FBS was placed in the lower chamber. After a 16-h incubation, matrigel and cells remaining in the chamber were removed using cotton swabs. Invasive cells which cling to the bottom of the membrane were stained with 0.5 μm Calcein AM (Sigma-Aldrich). Pictures of the stained cells were taken under a fluorescent microscope with×1 magnification. Cells were then counted using the Openlab software. All experiments were run in duplicate and were repeated three times. Zymography of MMP9 was performed using 10% SDS-PAGE with 0.1% gelatin. U2OS cells were starved in serum-free MaCoy's 5A medium overnight. An aliquot (10 μl) of conditional medium was mixed with 10 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, incubated at 50 °C for 5 min, and then subject to SDS-PAGE. The gel was washed twice for 15 min in 100 ml of Triton X-100 (2.5% in H2O) at room temperature, followed by incubation in 100 ml of development buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2). After agitation for 15 min at room temperature, the gel was transferred to a 37 °C incubator with slow agitation (50 rpm) overnight. After development, the gel was incubated in fixing/destaining solution (45% methanol and 10% acetic acid) for 15 min at room temperature, and then stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (0.1% in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid) for 2–3 h at room temperature, and destained in destaining solution for at least 2 h at room temperature. In an attempt to isolate C53/LZAP-interacting proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using C-terminally Flag-tagged C53/LZAP as the bait, and identified potential interactors with mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1A, there were at least three non-C53/LZAP proteins that were specifically immunoprecipitated with Flag-C53 protein, including heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and two uncharacterized proteins. A polypeptide with molecular mass of 40 kilodalton (kDa) was identified as DDRGK domain-containing protein 1 (DDRGK1, also named as C20orf116, CT116, and Dashurin) (4Tatsumi K. Sou Y.S. Tada N.

Interestingly, our finding was in accordance with the data generated from a large-scale screening of protein-protein interactions (6Ewing R.M. Chu P. Elisma F. Li H. Taylor P. Climie S.

Biol. 2007; 3: 89Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) (also see the search result from the IntAct database using Cdk5rap3 as the keyword). The human RCAD gene is located at chromosome 6q16.1. Similar to C53/LZAP, the human RCAD protein has 794 amino acid residues with no recognizable protein domains or motifs. Its orthologs can be found in the genomes of invertebrate, vertebrate, and plants, but not of yeast. Multiple sequence alignment indicates that its N-terminal portion is highly conserved (supplemental Fig. S1). RCAD is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues and cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1B, there are two major murine RCAD mRNA species with sizes of 2.8 and 4.2 kilobase (kb) in multiple mouse tissues. According to the EST data base, both mRNAs may give rise to the same protein with 793 amino acid residues. However, there are several human EST sequences with alternatively spliced exons that may encode RCAD isoforms with truncations. We generated an RCAD antibody that recognized an endogenous 90-kDa protein, while the antibody specificity was further confirmed by siRNA-mediated knockdown assay (Fig. 1C). Using this antibody, we examined RCAD expression in tissues and human cell lines. As illustrated in Fig. 1, D and E, RCAD was ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues and cell lines. Interestingly, RCAD expression was remarkably lower in invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1E). Human DDRGK1 protein has 314 amino acid residues with predicted molecular mass 35.6 kDa. Sequence analysis suggests that the first 1–28 residues are highly hydrophobic and may serve as a signal peptide. However, we could not detect any secretion of either endogenous or overexpressed DDRGK1 in tissue culture medium (data not shown). Furthermore, it contains a partial PCI (residues 229–273) domain that is frequently found in the subunits of the proteasome, COP-9 complex and translation initiation factors. DDRGK1 is a highly conserved protein, and its orthologs can be found in the genomes of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Multisequence alignment suggests that its C-terminal portion contains several stretches of highly conserved sequences including the one with DDRGK pentapeptide (supplemental Fig. S2). Northern blot analysis showed that murine DDRGK1 cDNA was about 1.3 kb, which is consistent with the size of both human and murine cDNA found in the full-length cDNA database (Fig. 1B). It was ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues and organs, with relatively high-level expression in the liver, kidney, and testes. Our DDRGK1 antibody recognized a 42-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE, which is slightly larger than the predicted size (Fig. 1C). Similar to C53/LZAP and RCAD, DDRGK1 was expressed in multiple cancer cell lines with a relatively low expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. To further confirm our initial observation of the interactions among C53/LZAP, RCAD, and DDRGK1, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays using overexpressed proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, both Myc-tagged RCAD and DDRGK1 were present in the Flag-tagged C53 immunoprecipitate. Endogenous RCAD and DDRGK1 were also co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous C53/LZAP in various cancer cells (Fig. 2B). Using co-IP assays, we briefly mapped the domains of both proteins for their interaction. It appeared that the N-terminal portion of RCAD (residues 1–400) was important for RCAD-C53 interaction, while the C (residues 269–506) terminal portion of C53/LZAP had a higher affinity to RCAD (Fig. 2, C and D). Additionally, we further mapped the interacting domains for the interaction between C53/LZAP and DDRGK1. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, the N-terminal portion of DDRGK1 (1–114) was capable of binding to C53/LZAP, while both N- and C-fragments of C53/LZAP bound DDRGK1. It is not clear whether the C53-DDRGK1 interaction is direct or is mediated by RCAD. To investigate the interaction of endogenous proteins, we performed a size exclusion assay to examine if they exist in a large protein complex. HeLa cell S100 fraction was subject to gel filtration chromatography, and the collected fractions were immunoblotted with specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2G, RCAD protein was exclusively present in a large complex that peaked around 550 kDa. Intriguingly, a small fraction of C53/LZAP was also present in a complex with similar size, while the remaining C53/LZAP appeared in the fractions ranging between 60 and 200 kDa. The co-peaking of endogenous RCAD and C53/LZAP in the same fractions of gel filtration strongly suggests that they may be the components of a large protein complex. In contrast to RCAD and C53/LZAP, DDRGK1 was absent in the S100 fraction but present in the membrane fraction (see below). Unlike RCAD and C53/LZAP, DDRGK1 has a putative N-terminal signal peptide, indicating that it may be an ER or secreted protein. Our efforts failed to detect any secreted DDRGK1 in culture medium. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence staining with our DDRGK1 antibody showed that DDRGK1 co-localized with the ER marker PDI (Protein Disulfide Isomerase), and the specificity of our DDRGK1 antibody was confirmed in DDRGK1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, overexpressed Myc-tagged DDRGK1 co-localized with another ER marker YFP-ER (Fig. 3B), and it appeared to be on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, DDRGK1 overexpression caused abnormal ER aggregation around the nucleus (Fig. 3B). Low-magnification electron micrographs showed that electron-dense “clouds” surrounded the nuclei of the cells transfected with DDRGK1, whereas such “clouds” were absent in the control cells. By examining the EM pictures, we found that 75% of DDRGK1-overexpressing cells contained abnormal ER aggregation, whereas none of the control cells displayed any abnormality (Fig. 3C). Examination at a high magnification revealed that the electron-dense structures corresponded to massive proliferation and aggregation of the ER network in DDRGK1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3C). We also performed subcellular fractionation to biochemically confirm its ER localization. As shown in Fig. 3D, DDRGK1 was exclusively present in the enriched ER fraction, while C53/LZAP and RCAD were present in both cytosolic and ER fractions. Of note, RCAD appeared to be cleaved in the cytosolic fraction, and the possible cause remains unclear. Except for its N-terminal putative signal peptide, DDRGK1 does not have any other recognizable transmembrane domains. We therefore speculated that this putative signal peptide may be responsible for its ER anchorage. As shown in Fig. 3E, deletion of the N-terminal 28 residues resulted in nuclear localization of AcGFP-DDRGK1 fusion protein, suggesting that the N-terminal signal peptide of DDRGK1 is indeed responsible for its ER localization. To elucidate the biological function of RCAD, we examined the effect of RCAD depletion. As shown in Fig. 4A, two siRNAs effectively knocked down endogenous RCAD (more than 90%) in both HeLa and U2OS cells, and they did not significantly affect cell morphology and proliferation. However, RCAD knockdown in HeLa cells caused remarkable reduction of C53/LZAP (94% for RCAD siRNA-1 and 90% for RCAD siRNA-2, respectively) and DDRGK1 (94% for RCAD siRNA-1 and 2) (Fig. 4, A, left panel, and B). The similar phenotype was also observed in U2OS cells (Fig. 4A, right panel). More importantly, the reduction of protein levels was not caused by the change of mRNA levels (Fig. 4C). In comparison to the mock, transfection of either negative control or RCAD siRNAs modestly altered the mRNA levels of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1, and the alterations may be due to the nonspecific effect of siRNA transfection. Yet the variations on mRNA levels appeared random and were limited within the range of 2-fold change (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the dramatic drop of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 protein levels in RCAD knockdown cells was unlikely to be caused by transcriptional change. Additionally, we examined if C53/LZAP can affect RCAD and DDRGK1 levels. In HeLa cells, C53/LZAP knockdown exerted a modest effect on the level of DDRGK1 (80% reduction of DDRGK1 in C53/LZAP knockdown cells) and minimal effect on RCAD (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, C53/LZAP knockdown in U2OS cells appeared to have more significant effect on both RCAD and DDRGK1, leading to reduction of both proteins. This result indicates that unlike RCAD, the effect of C53/LZAP appears to be cell type-specific. To understand how RCAD influences the protein levels of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1, we first examined the kinetics of protein degradation. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment of control HeLa cells with cycloheximide, a commonly used protein translation inhibitor, did not cause much degradation of either C53/LZAP or DDRGK1 during the time course of treatment. In contrast, cycloheximide treatment on RCAD knockdown cells led to more rapid degradation of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 (Fig. 5A). Although we could not exclude the possibility that RCAD may affect microRNA-mediated pathways, our result provided indirect evidence that RCAD may influence protein stability of C53/LZAP and DDGRK1. The ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is the major cellular pathway for protein degradation. To further understand the molecular mechanism underlying RCAD function, we attempted to examine whether the UPS is involved in degradation of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1. HeLa cells were transfected with either control or RCAD siRNAs, and RCAD knockdown were confirmed by immunoblotting at 60 h post-transfection (Fig. 5B). The cells were then treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 for various periods of time. As shown in Fig. 5B, in the cells transfected with negative control siRNA, MG132 treatment did not significantly affect the levels of three proteins. This result indicates that in the control cells, all three proteins are fairly stable, and the proteasome-mediated degradation of these proteins is not very robust. In contrast, protein levels of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 were significantly elevated by MG132 treatment in RCAD knockdown cells, and the increase became obvious even at 2 h after treatment (Fig. 5B). This result strongly suggests that RCAD knockdown renders both C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 more susceptible to the UPS-mediated protein degradation. We further tested whether RCAD can affect ubiquitination of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1. As shown in Fig. 5C, both C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 can be ubiquitinated by HA-Ubiquitin, but the modification was dramatically inhibited by RCAD overexpression. This result strongly suggests that RCAD regulates degradation of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 by affecting their ubiquitination. Wang et al. (3Wang J. An H. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Yarbrough W.G. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that C53/LZAP acts as a suppressor of NF-κB signaling. Loss of C53/LZAP leads to the increase of NF-κB transcriptional activity and expression of its downstream targets such as MMP9. As shown above, RCAD knockdown resulted in a dramatic reduction of C53/LZAP level. Therefore, we speculated that RCAD may also influence the NF-κB activity. To test this hypothesis, we first used a luciferase reporter assay to measure the NF-κB activity in RCAD knockdown cells. In HeLa cells, knockdown of either RCAD or C53/LZAP led to elevation of both basal and TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activity (Fig. 6A). A similar result was obtained in U2OS cells (Fig. 6B). We consistently observed about a 2-fold increase of basal NF-κB activity (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, like C53/LZAP, RCAD knockdown promoted cell invasion of U2OS cells (Fig. 6C), possibly due to the increased expression of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) (Fig. 6D). Taken together, our results suggest that RCAD plays an important role in NF-κB signaling. C53/LZAP is a putative tumor suppressor that has been implicated in multiple cell signaling pathways, including DNA damage response and NF-κB signaling (1Jiang H. Luo S. Li H. J. Biol.

Here we report the isolation and characterization of two novel C53/LZAP-interacting proteins, RCAD and DDRGK1. In this study, we confirmed the interactions among these three proteins (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The result of size exclusion chromatography further indicated that RCAD and C53/LZAP may form a protein complex larger than 440 kDa (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, we found that RCAD knockdown led to remarkable reduction of C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 proteins (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we found that C53/LZAP and DDRGK1 were more susceptible to the proteasome-mediated degradation in RCAD knockdown cells, while their ubiquitination was significantly attenuated by RCAD overexpression (Fig. 5). In addition, we found that like C53/LZAP, RCAD also plays an important role in regulation of NF-κB signaling (Fig. 6). Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that RCAD is a novel regulator of C53/LZAP tumor suppressor and NF-κB signaling pathway. By searching public databases and our own observations, we"

We found that signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), which is constitutively activated in a wide variety of human cancers, is a protein partner of PKCɛ. Stat3 has two conserved amino-acid (Tyr705 and Ser727) residues, which are phosphorylated during Stat3 activation. PKCɛ interacts with Stat3α isoform, which has Ser727, and not with Stat3β isoform, which lacks Ser727. PKCɛ–Stat3 interaction and Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation was initially observed during induction of squamous cell carcinomas and in prostate cancer. Now we present that (1) PKCɛ physically interacts with Stat3α isoform in various human cancer cells: skin melanomas (MeWo and WM266-4), gliomas (T98G and MO59K), bladder (RT-4 and UM-UC-3), colon (Caco-2), lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA:MB-231); (2) inhibition of PKCɛ expression using specific siRNA inhibits Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation, Stat3-DNA binding, Stat3-regulated gene expression as well as cell invasion; and (3) PKCɛ mediates Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation through integration with the MAPK cascade (RAF-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2).

https://openalex.org/W2132552599,"Actin dynamics is a tightly regulated process involved in various cellular events including biogenesis of clathrin-coated, AP-1 (adaptor protein 1)-coated transport carriers connecting the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the endocytic pathway. However, the mechanisms coordinating coat assembly, membrane and actin remodelling during post-TGN transport remain poorly understood. Here we show that the Arf1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1) GTPase synchronizes the TGN association of clathrin-AP-1 coats and protein complexes comprising CYFIP (cytoplasmic fragile-X mental retardation interacting protein; Sra, PIR121), a clathrin heavy chain binding protein associated with mental retardation. The Rac1 GTPase and its exchange factor beta-PIX (PAK-interacting exchange factor) activate these complexes, allowing N-WASP-dependent and Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization towards membranes, thus promoting tubule formation. These phenomena can be recapitulated with synthetic membranes. This protein-network-based mechanism facilitates the sequential coordination of Arf1-dependent membrane priming, through the recruitment of coats and CYFIP-containing complexes, and of Rac1-dependent actin polymerization, and provides complementary but independent levels of regulation during early stages of clathrin-AP1-coated carrier biogenesis."

The newly available data on human copy-number variation (CNV) allow an analysis of the most recent and ongoing evolution.

In this study, we make use of several sources of population genetic data to identify selection on structural variations of dosage sensitive genes. We show that CNVs can directly affect expression levels of contained genes. We find that genes encoding members of protein complexes exhibit limited expression variation and overlap significantly with a manually derived set of dosage sensitive genes. We show that complexes and other dosage sensitive genes are underrepresented in CNV regions, with a particular bias against frequent variations and duplications. These results suggest that dosage sensitivity is a significant force of negative selection on regions of copy-number variation."
https://openalex.org/W1972026290,"The cytoskeletal organization of detached and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is currently not well defined and may provide potential targets for new therapies to limit metastatic tumor spread. In vivo, CTCs reattach in distant tissues by a mechanism that is tubulin-dependent and suppressed by polymerized actin. The cytoskeletal mechanisms that promote reattachment of CTCs match exactly with the mechanisms supporting tubulin microtentacles (McTN), which we have recently identified in detached breast tumor cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate how McTN formation is affected by the microtubule-associated protein, tau, which is expressed in a subset of chemotherapy-resistant breast cancers. We demonstrate that endogenous tau protein localizes to McTNs and is both necessary and sufficient to promote McTN extension in detached breast tumor cells. Tau-induced McTNs increase reattachment of suspended cells and retention of CTCs in lung capillaries. Analysis of patient-matched primary and metastatic tumors reveals that 52% possess tau expression in metastases and 26% display significantly increased tau expression over disease progression. Tau enrichment in metastatic tumors and the ability of tau to promote tumor cell reattachment through McTN formation support a model in which tau-induced microtubule stabilization provides a selective advantage during tumor metastasis."

Bidirectional interactions between osteoblasts and prostate cancer cells are critical in the progression of prostate cancer in bone, but the effect of dasatinib on osteoblasts is unknown. We found that dasatinib inhibited proliferation of primary mouse osteoblasts isolated from mouse calvaria and the immortalized MC3T3-E1 cell line. In calvarial osteoblasts from Col-luc transgenic mice carrying osteoblast-specific Col1alpha1 promoter reporter, luciferase activity was inhibited. Dasatinib also inhibited fibroblast growth factor-2-induced osteoblast proliferation, but strongly promoted osteoblast differentiation, as reflected by stimulation of alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin secretion and osteoblast mineralization. To determine how dasatinib blocks proliferative signaling in osteoblasts, we analyzed the expression of a panel of tyrosine kinases, including Src, Lyn, Fyn, Yes and Abl, in osteoblasts. In the Src family kinases, only Src was activated at a high level. Abl was expressed at a low level in osteoblasts. Phosphorylation of Src-Y419 or Abl-Y245 was inhibited by dasatinib treatment. Knockdown of either Src or Abl by lenti-shRNA in osteoblasts enhances osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that dasatinib enhances osteoblast differentiation through inhibition of both Src and Abl."
https://openalex.org/W1989078517,"Human lung adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent form of lung cancer, is characterized by many molecular abnormalities. K-ras mutations are associated with the initiation of lung adenocarcinomas, but K-ras-independent mechanisms may also initiate lung tumors. Here, we find that the runt-related transcription factor Runx3 is essential for normal murine lung development and is a tumor suppressor that prevents lung adenocarcinoma. Runx3−/− mice, which die soon after birth, exhibit alveolar hyperplasia. Importantly, Runx3−/− bronchioli exhibit impaired differentiation, as evidenced by the accumulation of epithelial cells containing specific markers for both alveolar (that is SP-B) and bronchiolar (that is CC10) lineages. Runx3−/− epithelial cells also express Bmi1, which supports self-renewal of stem cells. Lung adenomas spontaneously develop in aging Runx3+/− mice (∼18 months after birth) and invariably exhibit reduced levels of Runx3. As K-ras mutations are very rare in these adenomas, Runx3+/− mice provide an animal model for lung tumorigenesis that recapitulates the preneoplastic stage of human lung adenocarcinoma development, which is independent of K-Ras mutation. We conclude that Runx3 is essential for lung epithelial cell differentiation, and that downregulation of Runx3 is causally linked to the preneoplastic stage of lung adenocarcinoma."

MDA-9/syntenin affects cancer cell motility and invasion through distinct biochemical and signaling pathways, including focal adhesion kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), resulting in activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway. MDA-9/syntenin also promotes melanoma metastasis by activating c-Src, but how c-Src regulates NF-kappaB activation is unclear. Using a human melanoma model, we document that MDA-9/syntenin-c-Src interactions are positive regulators of NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of c-Src by PP2 treatment, by blocking c-Src or mda-9/syntenin expression with small interfering RNA, or in c-Src (-/-) knockout cell lines, reduces NF-kappaB activation following overexpression of mda-9/syntenin or c-Src. Deletion or point mutations of the PDZ binding motif preventing MDA-9/syntenin association with c-Src reveals that both PDZ domains, with PDZ2 being the dominant module, are required for activating downstream signaling pathways, including p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. We also document that MDA-9/syntenin-c-Src complexes functionally cooperate with NF-kappaB to promote anchorage-independent growth, motility and invasion of melanoma cells. These findings underscore PDZ domains of MDA-9/syntenin as promising potential therapeutic targets for intervening in a decisive component of cancer progression, namely, metastatic tumor spread."
https://openalex.org/W2142251961,"Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) is a functionally important metabolite required to support numerous cellular processes. However, despite the identification of numerous NADPH-producing enzymes, the mechanisms underlying how the organellar pools of NADPH are maintained remain elusive. Here, we have identified glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) as an important source of NADPH in mitochondria. Activity analysis, submitochondrial fractionation, fluorescence microscopy, and protease sensitivity assays revealed that G6PDH is localized to the mitochondrial matrix. 6-ANAM, a specific G6PDH inhibitor, depleted mitochondrial NADPH pools and increased oxidative stress revealing the importance of G6PDH in NADPH maintenance. We also show that glucose availability and differences in metabolic state modulate the enzymatic sources of NADPH in mitochondria. Indeed, cells cultured in high glucose (HG) not only adopted a glycolytic phenotype but also relied heavily on matrix-associated G6PDH as a source of NADPH. In contrast, cells exposed to low-glucose (LG) concentrations, which displayed increased oxygen consumption, mitochondrial metabolic efficiency, and decreased glycolysis, relied predominantly on isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) as the principal NADPH-producing enzyme in the mitochondria. Culturing glycolytic cells in LG for 48 h decreased G6PDH and increased ICDH protein levels in the mitochondria, further pointing to the regulatory role of glucose. 2-Deoxyglucose treatment also prevented the increase of mitochondrial G6PDH in response to HG. The role of glucose in regulating enzymatic sources of mitochondrial NADPH pool maintenance was confirmed using human myotubes from obese adults with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (post-T2DM). Myotubes from post-T2DM participants failed to increase mitochondrial G6PDH in response to HG in contrast to mitochondria in myotubes from control participants (non-T2DM). Hence, we not only identified a matrix-associated G6PDH but also provide evidence that metabolic state/glucose availability modulate enzymatic sources of NADPH.—Mailloux, R J., Harper, M.-E.

Here, we found substantial inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and cell migration in each of four NSCLC lines stably transfected with E-cadherin. The inhibitory effects were independent of the EGFR and β-catenin/Wnt-signaling pathways. However, E-cadherin expression was associated with an adhesion-dependent reduction in the activity of Rho family proteins, RhoA in two lines and Cdc42 in the other two. The reduction of RhoA activity was dependent on DLC-1 Rho-GAP and p190 Rho-GAP and associated with an increase in a membrane-associated p190 Rho-GAP/p120 Ras-GAP complex. In parental cells with high levels of RhoA-GTP, siRNA-mediated knock-down of RhoA reduced cell migration and agar growth in a manner analogous to E-cadherin. In parental cells with high levels of Cdc42-GTP, transfection of a Cdc42 dominant-negative mutant reduced cell growth and migration similarly to cells expressing E-cadherin. Thus, E-cadherin can negatively regulate cell proliferation and migration in NSCLC by reducing the level of the predominant active form of Rho family protein, RhoA or Cdc42.

HOPX-β expression was silenced in all gastric cancer cell lines tested; its expression could be restored by treatment with demethylating agent. On Q-MSP, HOPX-β hypermethylation (cut-off value of 3.55) was found in 84% (67 out of 80) of primary tumor tissues and 10% (8 out of 80) of the corresponding normal tissues and could discriminate normal from tumor tissues (P<0.0001). The prognosis of the advanced cases with HOPX-β hypermethylation was as poor as those with stage IV disease when cut-off value was set at 11.28. This finding was validated in an independent cohort of 90 advanced gastric cancers. The HOPX-β hypermethylation was also an independent prognostic factor (P=0.029) on multivariate analysis. Exogenous HOPX expression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and invasion as well as enhanced apoptosis. Taken together, HOPX-β promoter methylation is a frequent and cancer-specific event in gastric cancer. Quantitative assessment of HOPX-β methylation has great clinical potential as a marker of tumor aggressiveness."

We have isolated a novel SUMO-2/3-modified mitotic chromosomal protein and identified it as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). PARP1 was robustly conjugated to SUMO-2/3 on mitotic chromosomes but not on interphase chromatin. PIASy promotes SUMOylation of PARP1 both in egg extracts and in vitro reconstituted SUMOylation assays. Through tandem mass spectrometry analysis of mitotically SUMOylated PARP1, we identified a residue within the BRCA1 C-terminal domain of PARP1 (lysine 482) as its primary SUMOylation site. Mutation of this residue significantly reduced PARP1 SUMOylation in egg extracts and enhanced the accumulation of species derived from modification of secondary lysine residues in assays using purified components. SUMOylation of PARP1 did not alter in vitro PARP1 enzyme activity, poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation), nor did inhibition of SUMOylation of PARP1 alter the accumulation of PARP1 on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that SUMOylation regulates neither the intrinsic activity of PARP1 nor its localization.

Consistent with the important and broad roles of the SUMOylation pathway, hundreds of SUMOylation targets have been identified in proteomic screens (6Denison C. Rudner A.D. Gerber S.A.

SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are closely related in their primary sequence (95% identical), whereas SUMO-1 is around 45% identical to either of the other two paralogues. In contexts where SUMO-2 cannot be functionally distinguished from SUMO-3, we will refer to these paralogues collectively as SUMO-2/3. All vertebrate paralogues are around 50% identical to the single SUMO protein found in budding yeast, Smt3p (2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). SUMO conjugation to cellular substrates is carried out in a manner similar to ubiquitin. The conjugation process requires three sequential enzymes: an activating (E1) enzyme, a conjugating (E2) enzyme, and usually a SUMO ligase (E3 enzyme). All SUMOylation utilizes the same E1 and E2 enzymes, which are called Uba2/Aos1 and Ubc9, respectively. However, there are a number of different E3 enzymes that show a high degree of specificity for particular conjugation targets (1Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). small ubiquitin-related modifiers Xenopus egg extract poly(ADP-ribose) poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase poly-ADP-ribosylation cytostatic factor wild type topoisomerase IIα. All eukaryotes possess E3 enzymes with variant RING-finger like domains (SP-RINGs) (1Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). These proteins are called Siz (SAP and miz-finger domain) proteins in yeast and PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) proteins in vertebrates. The five vertebrate PIAS proteins (PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy) are involved in a wide variety of processes, including signal transduction, gene expression, and genome maintenance (10Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PIASy-mediated conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to mitotic chromosomal proteins is essential for proper chromosomal segregation at anaphase in Xenopus egg extract (XEE) cell free assays (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One of the major targets for PIASy-directed SUMOylation is DNA topoisomerase IIα (TopoIIα) (12Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PIASy-deficient mice are viable (13Wong K.A. Kim R. Christofk H. Gao J. Lawson G. Wu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5577-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting PIASy-catalyzed SUMOylation is not essential during anaphase in mice. However, siRNA-mediated PIASy knockdown causes mitotic arrest with aberrant chromosome cohesion in HeLa cells (14Díaz-Martínez L.A. Giménez-Abián J.F. Azuma Y. Guacci V. Giménez-Martín G. Lanier L.M. Clarke D.J. PLoS One. 2006; 1: e53Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, the yeast Siz1p and Siz2p proteins are essential for accurate segregation of chromosomes in yeast (15Takahashi Y. Yong-Gonzalez V. Kikuchi Y. Strunnikov A. Genetics. 2006; 172: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It, thus, appears that PIASy-mediated SUMOylation plays an essential role in regulating mitotic chromosomal structure and progression of mitosis in many cellular contexts. Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of proteins is another major post-translational modification of many nuclear proteins, catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) (16Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar, 17D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem.

All PARPs share a conserved catalytic domain that interacts with NAD+, which is the donor molecule of poly(ADP-ribose) (19Amé J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The importance of PARylation during mitosis has been demonstrated; inhibition of PARylation compromises spindle formation in XEEs (20Chang P. Jacobson M.K. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 2004; 432: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PARylation mediated by the enzyme Tankyrase-1 has been particularly implicated the correct assembly of spindle poles (21Chang P. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Another PARylation enzyme, PARP1, has been shown to interact with centromeres and could mediate PARylation of centromeric proteins (22Saxena A. Wong L.H. Kalitsis P. Earle E. Shaffer L.G. Choo K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2319-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Saxena A. Saffery R. Wong L.H. Kalitsis P. Choo K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26921-26926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PARP1 interacts with the mitotic chromosomal protein kinase, Aurora B, and could mediate PARylation of Aurora B to regulate its activity (24Monaco L. Kolthur-Seetharam U. Loury R. Murcia J.M. de Murcia G. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14244-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the mitotic function of PARP1 has not been clearly demonstrated, the increasing evidence that PARP1 plays a role in chromatin structure suggests the potential relevance of PARP1 activity to chromosomal structure and function in mitosis (18Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 25Caiafa P. Guastafierro T. Zampieri M. Faseb J. 2009; 23: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We identified PARP1 as a SUMO-2/3-modified substrate associated with mitotic chromosomes. PARP1 was robustly conjugated to SUMO-2/3 on mitotic chromatin but not on interphase chromatin. PIASy promoted PARP1 SUMOylation both in XEEs and in vitro SUMOylation assays using purified, recombinant proteins. Through tandem mass spectrometry analysis of mitotically SUMOylated PARP1, we identified a residue within the BRCA1 C-terminal domain of PARP1 (lysine 482) as its primary SUMOylation site. Mutation of this residue significantly reduced PARP1 SUMOylation in XEEs and enhanced the accumulation of species derived from modification of secondary lysine residues in assays using purified components. SUMOylation of PARP1 did not alter PARP1 auto-PARylation activity in vitro, nor did inhibition of SUMOylation of PARP1 alter the accumulation of PARP1 on mitotic chromosomes in XEEs, suggesting that SUMOylation regulates neither the intrinsic activity of PARP1 nor its localization. However, loss of SUMOylation increased PARP1-dependent PARylation on isolated chromosomes, indicating that SUMOylation controls the capacity of PARP1 to modify other chromatin-associated proteins. cDNAs of Xenopus PARP1 were cloned from Xenopus tadpole cDNA (kindly provided by T. Amano and Y. B. Shi, NICHD, National Institutes of Health) using PCR amplification with the addition of the BglII recognition sequence at the 5′ end and SalI recognition sequence at the 3′ end. Amplified cDNA was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 plasmids using BglII and SalI sites and was verified by DNA sequencing. The full-length cDNAs were subcloned into pET28 using BamH1 and XhoI restriction sites. cDNA fragments encoding Xenopus PAPR1 (amino acids 1–150 (PARP1xl-N) and 500–650 (PARP1xl-M)) were amplified from a pEGFP-PARP1construct and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare) and pET28a (Novagen) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The recombinant proteins encoded by these cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by tag-based purification according to the manufacture's protocol followed by conventional ion-exchange chromatography. The lysine to arginine substitution of PARP1 was produced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyclonal antibodies against PARP1 and TopoIIα were generated in rabbits by injection with recombinant fragments of His6-T7-PAPR1xl-N, His6-T7-PAPR1xl-M, and His6-T7-TopoIIαxl C terminus (amino acids 1359–1579). The rabbit antisera were subjected to affinity purification on NHS-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) columns with their covalently bound antigens. The anti-SUMO-2/3 polyclonal guinea pig antibody was raised and purified similar to previous polyclonal rabbit antibody (12Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The anti-PAR monoclonal antibody and anti-T7 tag antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Trevigen and EMD Bioscience, respectively. Unless otherwise specified, other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The recombinant E1 complex (Aos1/Uba2 heterodimer) was purified by co-expression His6-Aos1 and Uba2 (kindly provided by Dr. F. Melchior) in E. coli as described previously (26Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The bacterially expressed E1 complex was purified with Talon affinity resin (Clontech) purification followed by SUMO affinity and conventional chromatography as previously described (27Azuma Y. Tan S.H. Cavenagh M.M. Ainsztein A.M. Saitoh H. Dasso M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1825-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant SUMO-2, wild type Ubc9, dnUbc9, and PIASy were as previously described (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recombinant PARP1-wt and PARP1K482R proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) at 15 °C in the presence of 5% glycerol, 2.5% ethanol, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. The expressed proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate using Talon affinity resin (Clontech) followed by Sephacyryl-300 gel filtration and SP-Sepharose column chromatography (GE Healthcare). Purified PARP1 proteins were concentrated up to 2∼3 mg/ml by centrifugal concentrator (Amicon Ultra-4, 30 kDa, Millipore) then snap-frozen by liquid N2 in small aliquots. In vitro SUMOylation assay was performed with 15 nm E1, 5 μm SUMO-2, 2.5 mm ATP, and 500 nm PARP1 in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) together with the indicated Ubc9 (E2) and PIASy (E3) concentrations. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for the indicated periods. Sperm chromatin and low speed extracts of Xenopus eggs arrested in metaphase by cytostatic factor (CSF) were prepared as described (28Kornbluth S. Yang J. Powers M. M. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 11.11.11-11.11.13Google Scholar). Where required, CSF extracts were driven into interphase by the addition of 0.6 mm CaCl2. For mitotic chromosome assembly or interphase nuclear assembly, demembranated sperm chromatin were added to CSF or interphase extracts and incubated for 40∼60 min at room temperature. Chromatin isolation was performed as previously described (12Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, all reactions contained 5000 sperm nuclei per μl. The immunodepletion experiment with XEE was performed as previously described (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with an affinity-purified anti-PARP1 antibody. For add-back experiments, recombinant PARP1 proteins were added at an endogenous concentration of 4 μg/ml. The immunofluorescence analysis in Fig. 5C was demonstrated as previously described (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μl of CSF extracts were released into interphase by a 0.6 mm CaCl2 addition. 200 sperm/μl were added 5 min after the CaCl2, and the extracts were incubated at 23 °C for 55 min to complete DNA replication. Reentry into mitosis was induced by the addition of 50 μl of fresh CSF extract. In the case of inhibition of mitotic SUMOylation, dnUbc9 (150 ng/μl final concentration) was also added at this point. The reactions were incubated for 40 min after the addition of fresh CSF extract to reach metaphase. Then 50 μl were removed from each reaction, diluted with 200 μl of buffer A (0.8× CSF-XB buffer containing 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate and 250 mm sucrose), and incubated for 0.5 min at 23 °C. 300 μl of buffer A containing 4% paraformaldehyde was added to this sample and incubated for an additional 10 min. Samples were spun onto coverslips through a 35% glycerol cushion. Chromosomal samples on coverslips were post-fixed by 1.6% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunostaining with anti-PARP1 (rabbit polyclonal), anti-SUMO-2/3 (guinea pig polyclonal), and anti-CENP-A (chicken polyclonal). Anti-rabbit Alexa 568, anti-guinea pig Alexa 684, and anti-chicken Alexa 488 were used as secondary antibodies respectively. Specimens were observed by Nikon TE2000-U microscope with Plan Apo 100×/1.40 objective. Images were taken with Retiga SRV CCD camera (QImaging) operated by Volocity software (Improvision). To measure PARylation activity of in vitro SUMOylated PARP1, reactions of in vitro SUMOylation were incubated for 60 min, and then the reactions were diluted twice with the reaction buffer (same as in vitro SUMOylation reaction buffer) containing 2 mm NAD+. The reactions were incubated further at 25 °C for indicated periods. Termination of reaction was done by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the reaction mixture. For analysis of PARylation of chromosomal proteins, the mitotic chromosomes, assembled in an XEE reaction, were suspended into 30 μl of the reaction buffer containing 1 mm NAD+ and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reactions were centrifuged, and chromosomal pellets were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. PARylation of proteins in SDS-PAGE samples were determined by immunoblotting with anti-PAR monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (Trevigen). PIASy-mediated SUMO-2/3 modification of chromosomal proteins is essential for faithful anaphase chromosome segregation in the XEE in vitro system (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There are a number of readily detectable SUMOylated proteins on mitotic chromosomes in XEEs whose modification requires PIASy, including TopoIIα (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To identify the full spectrum of mitotic SUMOylation substrates for PIASy in XEEs, we added hexahistidine (His6)-tagged SUMO-2 protein to XEEs arrested in meiotic M phase through the action of cytostatic factor (CSF XEEs) in the presence of demembranated sperm chromatin. We purified a chromosomal fraction from these reactions and isolated the SUMOylated proteins by Co2+ affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions (supplemental Fig. 1) in a manner analogous to earlier studies (12Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We observed a prominent SUMOylated species with a molecular mass around 140 kDa and subjected it to LC (liquid chromatography)-tandem mass spectometry analysis for protein identification at the Harvard Microchemistry and Proteomics Facility (Cambridge, MA). The results indicated that this species was SUMO-2-conjugated PARP1. To confirm this identification, we cloned Xenopus laevis PARP1 and prepared antibodies against fragments of the PARP1 protein (Fig. 1D). Immunoblotting analysis of mitotic chromosomes prepared from CSF XEEs clearly showed more slowly migrating forms of PARP1 protein, which were abolished when a dominant negative form of Ubc9 (dnUbc9 (11Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)) was added to the reactions or increased in abundance upon the addition of exogenous PIASy (Fig. 1A). To test directly whether the SUMOylation of PARP1 requires PIASy, we depleted PIASy from CSF XEEs (Fig. 1B); PIASy depletion eliminated the slowly migrating SUMOylated forms of PARP1. These forms of PARP1 were restored upon the addition of a recombinant PIASy to the depleted CSF XEEs, confirming that they arise in a PIASy-dependent manner. To test whether SUMOylation of PARP1 was sensitive to the cell cycle status of the XEE, we compared chromatin fractions isolated from CSF XEEs to chromatin fractions from interphase XEEs (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting analysis with anti-PARP1 and anti-SUMO-2/3 antibodies showed robust SUMOylation in the CSF XEEs (indicated with arrows) as expected, but no SUMOylated PARP1 could be detected in the interphase chromatin fractions. Together, these results show that PARP1 is a target of mitotic, PIASy-mediated SUMO-2/3 conjugation that is associated with mitotic chromosomes in XEEs. Notably, this pattern was closely similar to the SUMOylation of TopoIIα, an established PIASy substrate in this system (12Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To examine PARP1 SUMOylation by PIASy further, we reconstituted this modification in an in vitro system using entirely purified components that were expressed in bacteria and prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that PARP1 could be modified by SUMO-2/3 in the absence of PIASy in reactions containing a very high concentration of Ubc9 (600 nm) (Fig. 2A indicated with brackets). These concentrations significantly exceeded the physiological concentration of Ubc9 in XEEs, which was determined to be around 30 nm through quantitative immunoblotting of XEE in comparison to purified recombinant Ubc9 (data not shown). In reactions containing 30 nm Ubc9, SUMOylated PARP1 was hardly detected (Fig. 2B), even with prolonged incubation. Notably, strong SUMOylation of PARP1 was observed when PIASy was added to reactions containing near-physiological concentrations of Ubc9 (Fig. 2C). Modified forms of PARP1 were evident in reactions containing 10 nm Ubc9 and 15 nm PIASy. Such SUMOylation was enhanced in reactions containing 30 nm PIASy. Increasing the concentration of Ubc9 to 30 nm provided a robust boost in PARP1 SUMOylation at both concentrations of PIASy. Our results collectively showed that PIASy stimulates SUMOylation of PARP1 at physiological concentrations of Ubc9. A subtler but equally important finding from these in vitro reactions was that the pattern of SUMOylated PARP1 bands differed between the reactions with and without PIASy. Without PIASy, we observed a SUMOylated form of PARP1 with an aberrant migration on SDS-PAGE that did not correspond to the bands observed in CSF XEEs (indicated with the asterisk in Fig. 2, A and B). This form was dramatically decreased in PIASy-dependent reactions (compare Fig. 2, B and C). In other words, the pattern of SUMOylated PARP1 species found in the PIASy-dependent in vitro reactions (Fig. 2C) was much closer to the pattern observed within the chromatin fractions of complete CSF XEEs. To determine the function of PARP1 SUMOylation, we mapped its SUMOylation site(s). We isolated SUMOylated PARP1 by immunoprecipitation with anti-PARP1 antibodies under denaturing conditions from a mitotic chromatin fraction made from CSF XEEs (supplemental Fig. 2A) (29Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.C. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22115-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Both SUMOylated and non-SUMOylated PARP1 were subjected to tandem mass spectometry analysis for mapping of SUMOylation site(s). The SUMOylation site was identified by mass spectrometry after a double digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin generated a signature QQQTGG tag on the modified lysine of PARP1. With >70% sequence coverage of PARP1, this analysis indicated that lysine 482 was a candidate SUMOylation site on PARP1. Moreover, alignment of X. laevis PARP1 primary sequence to Homo sapiens PARP1 (supplemental Fig. 2B) indicated that lysine 482 is conserved to a recently reported SUMOylation site of human PARP1, which was found by mutational analysis (30Messner S. Schuermann D. Altmeyer M. Kassner I. Schmidt D. Schär P. Müller S. Hottiger M.O. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3978-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To confirm this mapping result, we introduced a mutation at lysine 482 to encode an arginine at this position (PARP1-K482R). We compared the SUMOylation patterns of wild type PARP1 (PARP1-wt) and PARP1-K482R within SUMOylation assays using recombinant proteins. In the absence of PIASy, PARP1-wt and PARP1-K482R became SUMO-2/3 conjugated to similar extents and showed similar dependence upon the concentration of Ubc9 (Fig. 3A). However, PARP1-K482R showed a much greater accumulation of the aberrant SUMOylation product that was preferentially observed in PIASy-independent reactions (Fig. 3A, indicated with an arrow; compare with Fig. 2). In reactions containing PIASy, there were two important differences between PARP1-K482R and PARP1-wt (Fig. 3B). First, PARP1-K482R showed a significantly lower efficiency of SUMOylation than PARP1-wt. For instance, more than 50% of PARP1-wt became SUMOylated within 60 min at the lowest Ubc9 and PIASy concentrations (10 and 15 nm, respectively), whereas the extent of PARP1-K482R SUMOylation was much less under the same conditions. In the presence of 30 nm Ubc9 and 30 nm PIASy, the decreased efficiency of PARP1-K482R SUMOylation was even more obvious; PARP1-wt was almost 100% SUMOylated within 30 min, whereas PARP1-K482R was only about 50% SUMOylated in the same interval. Second, aberrantly migrating SUMOylated species were more abundant in reactions containing PARP1-K482R (Fig. 3B, indicated by an arrow). As before, these forms were largely suppressed by the presence of PIASy in reactions containing PARP1-wt (Figs. 2C and 3B). Collectively, these results indicate that lysine 482 is a primary SUMOylation site of PARP1 for PIASy-mediated SUMO-2/3 modification in vitro. Mutation of this residue is accompanied by the enhanced modification of other lysines within PARP1, leading to the formation of species with electrophoretic motilities that differ from the primary SUMOylation products observed in intact CSF XEEs. We wished to compare the SUMOylation of PARP1-K482R to PARP1-wt under more physiological conditions in XEE CSF extracts. We added recombinant, T7-tagged PARP1-K482R and PARP1-wt to chromatin-containing CSF XEEs that had been immunodepleted of endogenous PARP1 using anti-PARP1 antibodies (−PARP1) (Fig. 4). The efficiency of depletion was measured by immunoblotting the extracts with an anti-PARP1 antibody (left panel, indicated as Extracts). More than 99% of PARP1 was eliminated from CSF XEEs without detectable changes in the concentration of another PIASy substrate, TopoIIα. After a 60-min incubation, mitotic chromosomes were prepared from these reactions, and the chromosomal proteins were isolated (Fig. 4, right panels). As expected, chromosomes prepared from the PARP1-depleted extract did not contain detectable levels of PARP1 (Fig. 4, −PARP1 lane on the right panels). Reactions reconstituted through the addition of recombinant PARP1-wt to depleted CSF XEEs showed levels of SUMOylation similar to endogenous PARP1 modification in non-depleted CSF XEEs (right panels, arrowheads), and this modification was similarly sensitive to dnUbc9. On the other hand, PARP1-K482R was SUMOylated to a lesser extent, and the resultant species showed greater electrophoretic mobility than the SUMOylated forms of the endogenous protein (Fig. 4, indicated with asterisks), as we had previously observed the assays with fully purified components (compare FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Notably, the formation of these species remained sensitive to dnUbc9. Our findings would be consistent with the utilization of an alternative or secondary SUMOylation site(s) in PARP1 that lacks lysine 482. Lysine 482 is located within the BRCA1 C-terminal domain of PARP1. This domain is predicted to bind to other proteins as well as to mediate auto-PARylation. Therefore, we hypothesized that SUMOylation of Lys-482 may either affect auto-PARylation activity by modulating the conformation of the catalytic domain or affect the PARylation of other substrates by modulating PARP1 protein-protein interactions (18Kim M.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2098554891,"In preadipocytes, retinoic acid (RA) regulates gene expression by activating the nuclear RA receptor (RAR) and its cognate intracellular lipid-binding protein CRABP-II. It was previously reported that RA inhibits adipocyte differentiation but only when administered early during the differentiation program. The data presented here indicate that the diminished ability of RA to activate RAR following induction of differentiation stems from down-regulation of CRABP-II. The observations show that expression of CRABP-II in preadipocytes is repressed by all three components of the classical hormonal mixture that induces adipocyte differentiation, i.e. isobutylmethylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone. Isobutylmethylxanthine-dependent activation of protein kinase A triggered the phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein, which induced the expression of the cAMP-response element-binding protein family repressor cAMP-response element modulator. In turn, cAMP-response element modulator was found to associate with a cognate response element in the CRABP-II promoter and to repress CRABP-II expression. The data further show that CRABP-II is a direct target gene for the glucocorticoid receptor and that it is subjected to dexamethasone-induced glucocorticoid receptor-mediated repression during adipogenesis. Finally, the observations demonstrate that permanent repression of CRABP-II in mature adipocytes is exerted by the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and is directly mediated through CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α-response elements in the CRABP-II promoter. Taken together, the observations emphasize the important role of CRABP-II in regulating the transcriptional activity of RA through RAR, and they demonstrate that repression of this gene is critical for allowing adipogenesis to proceed.

Adipogenesis entails a timed progression of tightly controlled changes in gene expression, culminating in terminal differentiation. Studies using cultured preadipocytes demonstrated that adipocyte differentiation, which begins with cell-cell contact inhibition, can be induced by a hormonal mixture containing insulin, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), 3The abbreviations used are: IBMXisobutylmethylxanthineC/EBPαCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein αRAretinoic acidRARretinoic acid receptorCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCREMcAMP-response element modulatorGRglucocorticoid receptorPKAprotein kinase APPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationQ-PCRquantitative real time PCRiLBPintracellular lipid-binding proteinshRNAsmall hairpin RNACREcAMP-response element. and a glucocorticoid such as dexamethasone (1Green H.

This differentiation mixture triggers an initial growth arrest followed by one or two cell divisions known as clonal expansion. Cells then exit the cell cycle and proceed to terminal differentiation driven by the “master regulators” of adipocyte differentiation, the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). Mature adipocytes are characterized by their ability to accumulate lipids and by the appearance of adipocyte markers such as the fatty acid-binding protein FABP4 and the lipid transporter CD36 (3Rosen E.D.

The individual components of the mixture that trigger differentiation facilitate different aspects of adipogenesis. IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, elevates cellular cAMP levels leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA). One of the PKA substrates in adipocyte is the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Activated CREB positively regulates the expression of multiple genes, including the transcription factor C/EBPβ, which promotes cell cycle arrest and clonal expansion (3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M.

CREB also induces the expression of another CREB family member, the cAMP-response element modulator gene (CREM). In contrast with CREB, CREM lacks the ability to recruit coactivators, and it functions as a cAMP-responsive negative regulator of gene expression (8Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P.

Glucocorticoids are involved in adipocyte differentiation by activating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) whose targets include C/EBPδ, a transcription factor that induces the expression of PPARγ (11Shi X.M.

The downstream effectors that mediate the involvement of insulin in adipocyte differentiation are poorly understood, and the effects may stem from cross-activation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Studies using the well established adipogenesis model NIH3T3-L1 cells revealed that the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) effectively inhibits adipocyte differentiation (14Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological activities of RA are mediated by two nuclear receptors, RAR (15Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar) and PPARβ/δ (17Shaw N. Elholm M.

It has been demonstrated in regard to this that RA is delivered to RAR by the iLBP cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABP-II) and that it is transported to PPARβ/δ by the iLBP termed fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) (18Schug T.T.

Hence, the partitioning of RA between its two receptors and the biological activities of the hormone are determined by the relative expression levels of these iLBPs. RA signals through RAR in cells that highly express CRABP-II, and it activates PPARβ/δ in cells that display a high level of FABP5 (18Schug T.T. Berry D.C. Shaw N.S. Travis S.N. Noy N.

It was previously reported in preadipocytes that CRABP-II is highly expressed and consequently that RA functions through RAR in these cells. Interestingly, it was shown that adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by down-regulation of CRABP-II and RAR and up-regulation of FABP5, resulting in a marked shift of RA signaling toward the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway (14Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Berry D.C. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Available information thus indicates that the ability of RA to inhibit adipogenesis is exerted by activities of the hormone that are mediated by CRABP-II and its cognate receptor RAR in preadipocytes and thus suggests that down-regulation of CRABP-II is a critical component of the differentiation process. The observations reported here support this notion, and they delineate the pathways by which the expression of CRABP-II is repressed during adipogenesis and is maintained at a low level in mature adipocytes. Antibodies against CREM, phospho-CREB, and GR were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. C/EBPα and CREB antibodies were from Cell Signaling and Millipore, respectively. Antibodies against CRABP-II were generously provided by Cecile Rochette-Egly (Institut Génétique Biologie Moléculaire Cellulaire). Adenovirus expressing CRABP-II was generated at the Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa. Wortmannin and RA were purchased from Calbiochem. Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, forskolin, IBMX, insulin, dexamethasone, RU486, H89, and antibodies against β-tubulin were from Sigma. Lentiviruses harboring shRNAs were purchased from Open Biosystems. The triglyceride assay kit was obtained from Zen-Bio. 3T3-L1s were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cells were grown 2 days postconfluence and then induced to differentiate with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm IBMX, and 0.25 mm dexamethasone. Adipocyte differentiation was confirmed by Oil Red O staining and by immunostaining for the presence of FABP4. Preadipocytes were treated with IBMX (0.5 mm, 4 h) or dexamethasone (250 nm, 2 h) prior to cross-linking with formaldehyde. 1.5 m glycine was added, and lysates were sonicated. Appropriate antibodies were added, and proteins were immunoprecipitated (12 h) and attached to protein A/G beads (2 h). Cross-link was reversed and protein degraded using protease K. DNA was precipitated using ethanol. PCR was performed using the following primer sets: CRE response element, sense 5′-CGTTGTGCCTACCTA-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGAGCGATTTTAGGGCTTG-3′; GR half-site response element, sense 5′-AGCTGTCCAGAGCACCAAAT-3′ and antisense 5′-GAGAAGCGTCAGAAGGCAAG-3′; C/EBPα-response element, sense 5′-GAGCATCAGGCTCCTGTTTT-3′ and antisense 5′-CTCCGAGGCTGATTTTTACG-3′. RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Molecular Research Center). cDNA was generated using GeneAmp RNA PCR (Applied Biosystems). Q-PCR was carried out using TaqMan chemistry and Assays-on-Demand probes (Applied Biosystems) for CRABP-II Mm00801691_m1, CREM Mm00516346_m1, and CREB Mm00501607_m1. Adipose tissue was collected from patients undergoing abdominoplasty, and primary preadipocytes were isolated as described previously (26Bakker A.H. Van Dielen F.M. Greve J.W. Adam J.A. Buurman W.A. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 g of tissue was cut into fine pieces, placed in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing collagenase (10 mg) and 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Material was centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The pellet was suspended in erythrocyte buffer (1.54 mm NH4Cl, 5.2 mm K2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA) and placed on ice for 10 min. Cells were centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media containing 10% calf serum, and cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cells were recultured three times prior to experimentation. It has been reported that RA inhibits the differentiation of NIH3T3-L1 cells, a well established cultured cell model of adipogenesis (14Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, preadipose cells are grown 2 days post-confluence and induced to differentiate using a hormone mixture containing insulin (10 μg/ml), IBMX (0.5 mm), and dexamethasone (0.25 mm). Following 3 days of treatment, media were replaced, and cells were grown for 4 days to obtain mature adipocytes. To examine the involvement of CRABP-II in RA-induced inhibition of adipogenesis, NIH3T3-L1 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence and then infected with an adenovirus harboring cDNA for CRABP-II (Ad-II, Fig. 1a). Cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of varying concentrations of RA, and adipogenesis was examined by monitoring lipid accumulation and by examining the expression of the early and late adipocyte markers C/EBPβ and FABP4, respectively. RA had little effect at low concentrations. However, treatment with 1 μm of the hormone markedly inhibited adipogenesis as reflected by decreased lipid accumulation (Fig. 1, b and c) and lower expression of the adipocyte markers C/EBPβ (Fig. 1d) and FABP4 (Fig. 1e). Strikingly, in cells that ectopically overexpressed CRABP-II, RA inhibited differentiation at concentrations as low as 10 nm (Fig. 1, b–e), demonstrating that the protein markedly enhances the ability of RA to inhibit adipogenesis. Examination of the expression of CRABP-II in NIH3T3-L1 cells showed that both CRABP-II mRNA (Fig. 2a) and protein (Fig. 2b) are rapidly down-regulated following induction of differentiation by the standard differentiation mixture consisting of insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX. The rate of decrease of CRABP-II mRNA levels following treatment with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig. 2c) was similar to that observed upon treatment with the differentiation mixture (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the expression of the gene during adipogenesis may be regulated at the level of transcription. To examine which of the individual components of the differentiation mixture controls CRABP-II expression, cells were treated separately with insulin, dexamethasone, or IBMX, and the expression of CRABP-II mRNA (Fig. 2d) and protein (Fig. 2e) was measured. The data show that all three components down-regulated CRABP-II expression. Treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, abolished the ability of insulin to repress CRABP-II (Fig. 3a), and treatment with RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, inhibited down-regulation of CRABP-II by dexamethasone (Fig. 3b). CRABP-II expression was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner following a 4-h treatment of IBMX (Fig. 3c). The rate of decrease in CRABP-II mRNA following IBMX treatment was similar to that observed upon treatment with actinomycin D (Fig. 3d), suggesting that IBMX regulates the expression of CRABP-II by inhibiting its transcription. The pathways by which IBMX down-regulates CRABP-II were then investigated. Cells were treated with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, a treatment which, like IBMX, increases intracellular cAMP levels. Similarly to IBMX, forskolin decreased the levels of CRABP-II (Fig. 4, a and b). The PKA inhibitor H89 alleviated the repression induced by either IBMX or forskolin (Fig. 4, a and b). Hence, activation of PKA by cAMP is closely involved in regulating CRABP-II expression. The effect of PKA activation on CRABP-II expression was also examined using primary preadipocytes isolated from human adipose tissue. Tissue was dissociated in phosphate-buffered saline containing collagenase (1 mg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (1%). Cells were collected, resuspended in a buffer containing 1.54 mm NH4Cl, 5.2 mm K2HPO4, and 0.1 mm EDTA, centrifuged, suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media containing 10% calf serum, and plated. Cells were recultured three times prior to experimentation. Similarly to the response observed in NIH3T3-L1 cells, treatment of primary human preadipocytes with IBMX decreased the level of expression of CRABP-II (Fig. 4c). To determine whether PKA-mediated down-regulation of CRABP-II expression is direct or whether it reflects secondary responses to PKA activation, NIH3T3-L1 preadipocytes were pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, 15 min) prior to treatment with IBMX. Cycloheximide treatment abolished the ability of IBMX to decrease CRABP-II expression levels (Fig. 4d), demonstrating that the effect required de novo protein synthesis. A well established downstream effector of PKA is the transcription factor CREB. Activation of CREB by PKA-mediated phosphorylation allows this factor to bind to cAMP-response elements (CRE) in promoter regions of target genes and to positively regulate gene expression (3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 4Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 8Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of NIH3T3-L1 cells with IBMX enhanced the phosphorylation level of CREB (Fig. 5a). To examine a possible involvement of CREB in regulating CRABP-II expression, the expression of this factor in NIH3T3-L1 preadipocytes was decreased using lentiviruses harboring CREB shRNA (Fig. 5b). Cells were then treated with IBMX, and CRABP-II expression was measured. Decreased expression of CREB abrogated the ability of IBMX to down-regulate CRABP-II mRNA (Fig. 5c) and protein (Fig. 5d). In adipocytes, activated CREB is known to induce early responsive genes, such as CREM (27Tenbrock K. Juang Y.T. Leukert N. Roth J. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6159-6164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unlike CREB, which induces gene expression, CREM does not associate with coactivators. Instead, this factor recruits transcriptional corepressors, and upon binding to CRE, it represses the expression of its target genes (3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 4Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the observations that CREB negatively regulates CRABP-II expression (Fig. 5, c and d) and that the effect is indirect (Fig. 4d), possible involvement of CREM was examined. Induction of adipocyte differentiation was accompanied by a transient up-regulation of CREM (Fig. 5e), and interestingly, the maximal level of CREM expression at 4 h post-induction coincided with 50% reduction in CRABP-II mRNA (Fig. 5e). Decreasing the expression level of CREM using a lentivirus harboring CREM shRNA (Fig. 5g) hampered the ability of IBMX to suppress CRABP-II attesting to the involvement of the factor in mediating the repression of CRABP-II (Fig. 5h). The Alibaba 2 program of the Transfac site was used to identify response elements that may mediate CREM-dependent repression of CRABP-II. Two putative CREs were found, a site at 649 bp upstream from the gene start site, and an additional element located in the first intron of CRABP-II (Fig. 5i). ChiP assays were carried out to examine whether either CREB or CREM is associated with these elements in NIH3T3-L1 cells. Neither factor associated with the upstream element either (data not shown). In contrast, IBMX treatment efficiently induced recruitment of CREM (but not CREB) to the CRE located in the first intron of CRABP-II (Fig. 5j). IBMX treatment also recruited the transcriptional corepressor HDAC1 to this element. (Fig. 5j). The data thus indicate that CREM and its associated corepressors directly repress CRABP-II expression. In addition to the repression of CRABP-II by cAMP signaling, the expression of this gene in preadipocytes was also found to be down-regulated upon treatment with the GR agonist dexamethasone (Fig. 2, d and e). To examine whether CRABP-II is a direct target gene for GR, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide prior to treatment with dexamethasone. The observations that the ligand decreased CRABP-II expression in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. 6a) suggest that CRABP-II is a direct target for GR-mediated repression. In accordance, down-regulation of GR expression using a lentivirus harboring GR shRNA (Fig. 6b) inhibited dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of CRABP-II (Fig. 6, c and d). Examination of the CRABP-II promoter revealed the presence of a putative GR-response element at 247 bp upstream from the gene start site (Fig. 6e). ChiP assays demonstrated that GR is recruited to this element following treatment with dexamethasone (Fig. 6f). The observations thus establish that GR directly suppresses CRABP-II during adipocyte differentiation. Following its down-regulation during adipogenesis, CRABP-II expression remains low in mature adipocytes (25Berry D.C. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These observations raise the question of the mechanisms that sustain CRABP-II repression following differentiation. The question is especially pertinent considering that although the major CRABP-II repressor CREM is induced upon triggering differentiation, the effect is transient, and CREM expression returns to a basal level as early as 8 h following induction (Fig. 5e). In accordance with these observations, ChIP assays indicated that although CREM was associated with CRE of the CRABP-II gene 4 h following IBMX treatment (Fig. 5j), the factor was not bound to the element in mature adipocytes (Fig. 7b). One possibility is that sustained repression of CRABP-II in mature adipocytes is exerted by C/EBPα, a master regulator of adipogenesis that is highly expressed in mature adipocytes and can function either as an activator or as a repressor of gene expression (3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 4Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M.

Biol. 2009; 29: 4714-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Inspection of the CRABP-II promoter revealed that a region, located at about 1,000 bp upstream from the gene start site, contains five putative C/EBPα-response elements (Fig. 7a). ChiP assays indicated that C/EBPα is indeed associated with this region in mature adipocytes (Fig. 7b). The involvement of C/EBPα in regulating CRABP-II expression was further examined by down-regulating C/EBPα expression in mature adipocytes (Fig. 7d). Decreasing the expression level of C/EBPα resulted in marked up-regulation of CRABP-II mRNA (Fig. 7c) and protein (Fig. 7d). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the low level of expression of CRABP-II in mature adipocytes is maintained by C/EBPα. RA regulates gene transcription by activating the nuclear receptor RAR and its cognate iLBP CRABP-II and by an alternative pathway mediated by PPARβ/δ and FABP5 (15Chambon P.

PPAR Res. 2007; 2007: 73256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We previously reported that although RA predominantly signals through CRABP-II/RAR in preadipocytes, adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by a shift in the balance between the two pathways. This shift is accomplished by down-regulation of CRABP-II, RARα, and RARγ and by up-regulation of FABP5 during adipogenesis, enabling activation of the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway in the mature adipocyte (25Berry D.C. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Consequently, in mature adipocytes, RA regulates lipid homeostasis and insulin responses by controlling the expression of target genes for both RAR and PPARβ/δ (25Berry D.C. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that CRABP-II markedly sensitizes preadipocytes to RA-induced inhibition of differentiation (Fig. 1). The observations thus reveal that down-regulation of CRABP-II, which sets the stage for proper RA signaling in mature adipocytes, is also critical for bypassing RA-induced, RAR-mediated inhibition of differentiation and allowing adipogenesis to proceed. Interestingly, it was reported that RA inhibits adipocyte differentiation if administered within a short time frame following its induction but that it fails to do so when administered late in the program even in cells that ectopically overexpress RARs (32Xue J.C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observations that suppression of CRABP-II is an early adipogenic event (Fig. 2a) emphasize the importance of CRABP-II in activation of RAR and provide a rationale for understanding the failure of RA to inhibit adipogenesis late in the program. Expression of CRABP-II was found to be repressed by all three components of the classical adipocyte differentiation mixture (Fig. 8). Although the pathway(s) that mediate the effect of insulin remain to be explored, the observations delineate the mechanisms by which dexamethasone and IBMX control CRABP-II expression. The data demonstrate that treatment of preadipocytes with dexamethasone results in recruitment of GR to a GR element located 247 bp upstream from the CRABP-II gene start site (Fig. 6e) and that repression of CRABP-II by dexamethasone is a GR-mediated response that does not require de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 6, a–d). Hence, CRABP-II is a direct target gene for dexamethasone-induced, GR-mediated repression. Treatment with IBMX or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin decreased the expression of CRABP-II in NIH3T3-L1 cells as well as in primary human preadipocytes, and inhibition of PKA activity abolished the effect (Fig. 4, a–c). The data thus establish that cAMP and PKA signaling down-regulates the expression of CRABP-II. Suppression of CRABP-II by IBMX was indeed found to be mediated by the transcription factor CREB, a PKA substrate in preadipocytes (Fig. 5, b and c). However, the observations that down-regulation of CRABP-II by IBMX required de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 4d) and the known activity of CREB as a positive regulator of transcription (3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) suggested that repression of CRABP-II by CREB is a secondary response. The data indicate that CRABP-II expression is controlled by CREB indirectly through induction of the direct CREB target gene, the transcriptional repressor CREM (Fig. 8). In support of this conclusion, IBMX-induced repression of CRABP-II was found to require the expression of CREM (Fig. 5h), and treatment with IBMX resulted in recruitment of CREM to a cognate CRE in the first intron of CRABP-II (Fig. 5, i and j). Association of CREM with this CRE was accompanied by recruitment of HDAC1 (Fig. 5j), revealing that CREM functions as a direct repressor of CRABP-II. CREM is up-regulated upon induction of adipocyte differentiation, but its expression is transient and returns to basal level 8 h later (Fig. 5e). Accordingly, CREM was found to be associated with the CRE of the CRABP-II gene in early stages of adipogenesis (Fig. 5j) but not in mature adipocytes (Fig. 7b). These observations indicate that another mechanism must be in place to maintain the low level of CRABP-II expression observed in mature adipocytes (25Berry D.C. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The data show that, in mature adipocytes, CRABP-II expression is suppressed by C/EBPα, a critical regulator of adipogenesis whose expression is induced late during differentiation and remains high in mature adipose cells (4Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the CRABP-II promoter revealed the presence of five consensus C/EBPα-response elements, and ChiP assays indicated that C/EBPα is associated with this region in mature adipocytes (Fig. 7, a and b). The observations that C/EBPα effectively down-regulates the expression of CRABP-II (Fig. 7, c and d) are in agreement with the reports that this transcription factor can recruit transcriptional repressors and function as a negative regulator of gene expression (28Vernochet C. Peres S.B. Davis K.E. McDonald M.E. Qiang L. Wang H. Scherer P.E. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4714-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Soliera A.R. Lidonnici M.R.

The data thus demonstrate that down-regulation of CRABP-II is critical for allowing adipocyte differentiation, and they elucidate the mechanisms by which the expression of this protein is suppressed during adipogenesis and remains low in mature adipocytes. The mechanisms through which RA, functioning by activating RAR and CRABP-II, inhibits adipogenesis remain to be clarified. It has been reported that CRABP-II inhibits the growth of cultured mammary carcinoma cells (29Donato L.J. Noy N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8193-8199Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Donato L.J. Suh J.H. Noy N.

It was further shown that, in the murine mammary tumor virus-neu mouse model of breast cancer, tumorigenesis is accompanied by down-regulation of CRABP-II expression (19Schug T.T. Berry D.C.

However, the molecular events that underlie the loss of this protein during tumor initiation and progression are unknown. The observations that the expression of CRABP-II is suppressed by cAMP signaling may provide insight into such mechanisms. It is interesting to note in regard to this that cAMP activities have been shown to promote carcinoma cell growth (35de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2122970940,"GRASP proteins share an N-terminal GRASP domain and mediate homotypic tethering of Golgi cisternae to form extended Golgi ribbons. The golgin GM130 is thought to bind the C-terminal side of the GRASP domain to recruit GRASP65 onto the Golgi whereas stable membrane association appears to also depend on anchoring of the N terminus by myristoylation. Here, we examine the nature of the GM130/GRASP65 interaction and test whether the dual membrane contacts of the GRASP domain have a role in tethering beyond membrane recruitment. GM130 was found to contain a C-terminal PDZ ligand that binds the putative groove of the second PDZ-like domain in GRASP65. To test tethering activity independent of targeting, we took advantage of a tethering assay carried out on the mitochondrial membrane in which the GRASP membrane attachment points were individually or simultaneously substituted with mitochondrially targeted transmembrane sequences. N-terminally anchored constructs tethered only if the C terminus was also anchored; and likewise, C-terminally anchored constructs tethered only if the N terminus was anchored. One explanation for the role of this dual anchoring is that it orients the GRASP domain to prevent cis interactions within the same membrane thereby favoring trans interactions between adjacent membranes. Indeed, singly anchored GRASP constructs, although nonfunctional in tethering, interacted with one another and also bound and inhibited dually anchored constructs. This work thus elucidates the GM130/GRASP65 interaction and supports a novel orientation-based model of membrane tether regulation in which dual membrane contact orients the tethering interaction interface to favor trans over cis interactions.

IntroductionThe tethering of membranes prior to SNARE 2The abbreviations used are: SNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptorGFPgreen fluorescent protein. -mediated fusion is accomplished by factors present in each membrane that interact to form a bridge thereby increasing the fidelity and efficiency of membrane fusion (1Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The interaction can be heterotypic, such as vesicle fusion with a target organelle, or homotypic, as is the case when identical membranes fuse. In heterotypic tethering, each membrane contributes a distinct partner to form a heteromeric-tethering complex. After fusion, the complex is presumably disassembled, and one partner, if still membrane-associated, is sorted from the other in the plane of the membrane and packaged into vesicles for recycling. Disassembly and sorting are needed because interactions in cis between the tether partners would prevent further rounds of tethering just as cis SNARE interactions block membrane fusion (2Whiteheart S.W. Schraw T. Matveeva E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In homotypic tethering, each membrane may contribute distinct partners that bind to one another or identical partners that self-associate but because the membranes are identical each has a full complement of the tethering components, and this state is also maintained after fusion. Thus, for homotypic tethering, mechanisms other than sorting and recycling are needed to prevent cis complex formation.In higher eukaryotes, the juxtanuclear Golgi membrane network, or Golgi ribbon, is a product of homotypic fusion between analogous cisternae in adjacent mini stacks. This fusion is mediated, in part, by the tethering action of the GRASP family of proteins beginning with GRASP65 on the cis face of the Golgi (3Puthenveedu M.A. Bachert C. Puri S. Lanni F. Linstedt A.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 4Feinstein T.N. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2696-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The GRASP65 interaction is homotypic (5Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4921-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and is presumed to involve an internal PDZ ligand within a GRASP65 partner on one membrane binding to the first of two PDZ binding pockets in a GRASP65 partner on the opposing membrane (6Sengupta D. Truschel S. Bachert C. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Currently, however, it is unknown how GRASP65 interactions in cis are prevented.Our work has shown that the N-terminal myristoylation site of GRASP65 is required for it to tether membranes (6Sengupta D. Truschel S. Bachert C. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As a transmembrane domain substitutes for this function, it suggests that the purpose of myristoylation is to anchor the first PDZ domain, PDZ1, promoting interactions in trans. Interestingly, the C-terminal side of PDZ1 is also anchored. Next to PDZ1 is PDZ2, which appears to mediate GRASP65 interactions with its Golgi-localized receptor GM130 (6Sengupta D. Truschel S. Bachert C. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PDZ ligands are typically a short peptide stretch at the C terminus and use the terminal carboxylic moiety to interact with a conserved GLGF motif in the PDZ binding pocket (8Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The GM130 C terminus may bind the PDZ2 pocket for dual anchoring of PDZ1, but significant questions remain. Even though the GM130 C terminus was shown to function as a PDZ ligand (10Murwantoko Yano M. Ueta Y. Murasaki A. Kanda H. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Runyon S.T. Zhang Y. Appleton B.A. Sazinsky S.L. Wu P. Pan B. Wiesmann C. Skelton N.J. Sidhu S.S. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2454-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), this is of uncertain physiological relevance as it involved binding to a mitochondrial, rather than Golgi, protein. Further, GM130 binding to GRASP65 was shown to depend on a GLGF-like motif in the second PDZ domain of GRASP65 (7Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), but there are three GLGF-like motifs in this domain, and it is unclear which of these, if any, is actually part of a PDZ binding groove. Typically, the GLGF motif is present near the N terminus of PDZ domains just prior to the second β-strand, which forms one side of the binding pocket (8Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the GLGF motif of GRASP65 mutated in previous work is near the C terminus just after the predicted sixth β-strand. Finally, it is not known whether anchoring the C-terminal side of PDZ1, i.e. establishing a dually anchored PDZ1 domain, plays a functional role in tethering beyond targeting the complex to the membrane.We thus set out to test whether membrane recruitment of GRASP65 by GM130 involves a bone fide PDZ ligand interaction that dually anchors the tether to promote trans interactions. Our results indicate that GM130 does, indeed, bind to the second PDZ domain of GRASP65 via a traditional PDZ/C-terminal ligand interaction. We further show that this interaction is sufficient to recruit GRASP65 to membranes and regulates its ability to tether membranes in trans by anchoring both ends of the molecule possibly geometrically restricting it to prevent cis interactions.DISCUSSIONThese studies support a model (Fig. 9) in which GRASP65 is recruited onto the Golgi by GM130 whereupon GRASP65 membrane attachment is stabilized by insertion of its N-terminal myristic acid. These two contact points, membrane binding by the myristic acid and GM130 binding, orient the GRASP65 homotypic binding interface in such a way that it can interact in trans but not in cis. GRASP65 self-association in trans is then followed by fusion, presumably mediated by a SNARE complex involving syntaxin-5, which interacts with GM130 (18Diao A. Frost L. Morohashi Y. Lowe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6957-6967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The resulting membrane rearrangement might then cause GRASP65 disassembly because it would impart a torque on the complex due to the orientation conferred by the dual anchors; that is, membrane rearrangement would force an unfavorable cis configuration leading to partner dissociation. The relatively weak PDZ interaction (19Nourry C. Grant S.G. Borg J.P. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE7Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) lends itself to this novel type of regulation in which protein/protein interaction would be regulated by membrane dynamics. Another noteworthy feature of this model is that localization of the tether and tether activity are linked because both stable localization and activity require dual anchoring. This elegantly ensures that all GRASP65 molecules on the Golgi are dually anchored so that cis interactions do not interfere with trans pairing and membrane tethering.Orientation may be a key regulator of many tethering reactions. In the case of tethering of endosome membranes by EEA1, Rab5 and phosphatidylinositol binding to the EEA1 C terminus anchors it to the membrane orienting its coiled-coil domain to project outwards, perpendicular to the membrane (20Dumas J.J. Merithew E. Sudharshan E. Rajamani D. Hayes S. Lawe D. Corvera S. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 947-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This positions an array of binding sites away from interactions that might occur in cis thereby promoting association with other endosomal membranes. In an analogous fashion, coiled-coil tethers containing the GRIP domain are likely oriented perpendicular to the membrane by the GRIP interaction with the Arl1 GTPases that mediate their membrane association on the trans Golgi network (21Panic B. Perisic O. Veprintsev D.B. Williams R.L. Munro S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Whether these orientation features are required and whether membrane rearrangement upon fusion plays a role in complex disruption remain to be investigated. In these examples, membrane association is regulated by GTPases and is highly dynamic. In the case of GRASP65 tethering, however, it does not appear to be regulated by cycles of membrane recruitment and detachment, so aspects of its disassembly in cis may be unique.The GRASP65 paralog, GRASP55, is thought to act in a fashion similar to GRASP65 in tethering membranes of the medial and trans Golgi (4Feinstein T.N. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2696-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Their GRASP domains share many similarities at the sequence level, with 69% identity and 78% of the changes being of a conservative nature. Similar to GRASP65, the N terminus of GRASP55 is myristoylated (22Kuo A. Zhong C. Lane W.S. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6427-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this modification is required for its tethering activity. 3C. Bachert and A. D. Linstedt, unpublished results. Further, paralleling GRASP65 binding to GM130, GRASP55 binds the C terminus of golgin-45 (23Short B. Preisinger C. Körner R. Kopajtich R. Byron O. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which has a conserved PDZ ligand motif. Interestingly, GRASP55 appears to be in two separate complexes within the cell, only one of which contains golgin-45 (16Barr F.A. Preisinger C. Kopajtich R. Körner R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The other contains transiting molecules including secretory cargo with C-terminal PDZ ligand motifs, and at least some of these bind GRASP65 as well (16Barr F.A. Preisinger C. Kopajtich R. Körner R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17D'Angelo G. Prencipe L. Iodice L. Beznoussenko G. Savarese M. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Martire G. De Matteis M.A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34849-34860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Kuo A. Zhong C. Lane W.S. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6427-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of the ligand motifs to those of GM130 and golgin-45 suggests that they bind the GRASP PDZ2 domain leaving PDZ1 available for tethering. This raises the interesting possibility that cargo functions interchangeably with golgins in anchoring GRASP proteins. GRASP55 is also palmitoylated (22Kuo A. Zhong C. Lane W.S. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6427-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so, unlike GRASP65, it may be able to remain active during transient absence of either golgin or cargo binding due to the dual myristic and palmitic acid contacts.A final consideration is whether dual anchoring of the GRASP domain is critical for GRASP-mediated cisternal stacking (24Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25Shorter J. Watson R. Giannakou M.E. Clarke M. Warren G. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 26Xiang Y. Wang Y. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or nonconventional secretion (27Kinseth M.A. Anjard C. Fuller D. Guizzunti G. Loomis W.F. Malhotra V. Cell. 2007; 130: 524-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28Schotman H. Karhinen L. Rabouille C. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the case of stacking, this seems likely because the current model invokes homotypic interactions in trans even though the linkage is formed between distinct Golgi subcompartments. Thus, cis interactions need to be prevented, and an orientation of the homotypic binding interface that is dependent on dual anchoring provides a simple solution. One possibility that warrants further investigation is whether GRASP·golgin complexes mediate ribbon formation whereas GRASP·cargo complexes contribute to cisternal stacking due perhaps to localization of the former complexes to Golgi rims and the latter to compact zones. In the case of the participation of the GRASP homologs in Dictyostelium and Drosophila in nonconventional secretion it remains unclear whether the relevant activity depends on PDZ interactions or membrane cross-bridging. Nevertheless, from an evolutionary perspective, the GRASP family of proteins may have developed first as cargo transport factors, then as participants in stacking, and finally, with the emergence of a second GRASP protein, as mediators of ribbon formation. In any case, our study further elucidates the basis of the GM130/GRASP65 interaction and shows its importance, along with myristoylation, in the favoring of trans interactions, which in conjunction with pericentrosomal positioning, allow for the formation of a single copy Golgi organelle with an extended ribbon structure. IntroductionThe tethering of membranes prior to SNARE 2The abbreviations used are: SNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptorGFPgreen fluorescent protein. -mediated fusion is accomplished by factors present in each membrane that interact to form a bridge thereby increasing the fidelity and efficiency of membrane fusion (1Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The interaction can be heterotypic, such as vesicle fusion with a target organelle, or homotypic, as is the case when identical membranes fuse. In heterotypic tethering, each membrane contributes a distinct partner to form a heteromeric-tethering complex. After fusion, the complex is presumably disassembled, and one partner, if still membrane-associated, is sorted from the other in the plane of the membrane and packaged into vesicles for recycling. Disassembly and sorting are needed because interactions in cis between the tether partners would prevent further rounds of tethering just as cis SNARE interactions block membrane fusion (2Whiteheart S.W. Schraw T. Matveeva E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In homotypic tethering, each membrane may contribute distinct partners that bind to one another or identical partners that self-associate but because the membranes are identical each has a full complement of the tethering components, and this state is also maintained after fusion. Thus, for homotypic tethering, mechanisms other than sorting and recycling are needed to prevent cis complex formation.In higher eukaryotes, the juxtanuclear Golgi membrane network, or Golgi ribbon, is a product of homotypic fusion between analogous cisternae in adjacent mini stacks. This fusion is mediated, in part, by the tethering action of the GRASP family of proteins beginning with GRASP65 on the cis face of the Golgi (3Puthenveedu M.A. Bachert C. Puri S. Lanni F. Linstedt A.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 4Feinstein T.N. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2696-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The GRASP65 interaction is homotypic (5Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4921-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and is presumed to involve an internal PDZ ligand within a GRASP65 partner on one membrane binding to the first of two PDZ binding pockets in a GRASP65 partner on the opposing membrane (6Sengupta D. Truschel S. Bachert C. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Currently, however, it is unknown how GRASP65 interactions in cis are prevented.Our work has shown that the N-terminal myristoylation site of GRASP65 is required for it to tether membranes (6Sengupta D. Truschel S. Bachert C. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As a transmembrane domain substitutes for this function, it suggests that the purpose of myristoylation is to anchor the first PDZ domain, PDZ1, promoting interactions in trans. Interestingly, the C-terminal side of PDZ1 is also anchored. Next to PDZ1 is PDZ2, which appears to mediate GRASP65 interactions with its Golgi-localized receptor GM130 (6Sengupta D. Truschel S. Bachert C. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PDZ ligands are typically a short peptide stretch at the C terminus and use the terminal carboxylic moiety to interact with a conserved GLGF motif in the PDZ binding pocket (8Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The GM130 C terminus may bind the PDZ2 pocket for dual anchoring of PDZ1, but significant questions remain. Even though the GM130 C terminus was shown to function as a PDZ ligand (10Murwantoko Yano M. Ueta Y. Murasaki A. Kanda H. Oka C. Kawaichi M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Runyon S.T. Zhang Y. Appleton B.A. Sazinsky S.L. Wu P. Pan B. Wiesmann C. Skelton N.J. Sidhu S.S. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2454-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), this is of uncertain physiological relevance as it involved binding to a mitochondrial, rather than Golgi, protein. Further, GM130 binding to GRASP65 was shown to depend on a GLGF-like motif in the second PDZ domain of GRASP65 (7Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), but there are three GLGF-like motifs in this domain, and it is unclear which of these, if any, is actually part of a PDZ binding groove. Typically, the GLGF motif is present near the N terminus of PDZ domains just prior to the second β-strand, which forms one side of the binding pocket (8Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the GLGF motif of GRASP65 mutated in previous work is near the C terminus just after the predicted sixth β-strand. Finally, it is not known whether anchoring the C-terminal side of PDZ1, i.e. establishing a dually anchored PDZ1 domain, plays a functional role in tethering beyond targeting the complex to the membrane.We thus set out to test whether membrane recruitment of GRASP65 by GM130 involves a bone fide PDZ ligand interaction that dually anchors the tether to promote trans interactions. Our results indicate that GM130 does, indeed, bind to the second PDZ domain of GRASP65 via a traditional PDZ/C-terminal ligand interaction. We further show that this interaction is sufficient to recruit GRASP65 to membranes and regulates its ability to tether membranes in trans by anchoring both ends of the molecule possibly geometrically restricting it to prevent cis interactions.

Our results indicate that GM130 does, indeed, bind to the second PDZ domain of GRASP65 via a traditional PDZ/C-terminal ligand interaction. We further show that this interaction is sufficient to recruit GRASP65 to membranes and regulates its ability to tether membranes in trans by anchoring both ends of the molecule possibly geometrically restricting it to prevent cis interactions. DISCUSSIONThese studies support a model (Fig. 9) in which GRASP65 is recruited onto the Golgi by GM130 whereupon GRASP65 membrane attachment is stabilized by insertion of its N-terminal myristic acid. These two contact points, membrane binding by the myristic acid and GM130 binding, orient the GRASP65 homotypic binding interface in such a way that it can interact in trans but not in cis. GRASP65 self-association in trans is then followed by fusion, presumably mediated by a SNARE complex involving syntaxin-5, which interacts with GM130 (18Diao A. Frost L. Morohashi Y. Lowe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6957-6967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The resulting membrane rearrangement might then cause GRASP65 disassembly because it would impart a torque on the complex due to the orientation conferred by the dual anchors; that is, membrane rearrangement would force an unfavorable cis configuration leading to partner dissociation. The relatively weak PDZ interaction (19Nourry C. Grant S.G. Borg J.P. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE7Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) lends itself to this novel type of regulation in which protein/protein interaction would be regulated by membrane dynamics. Another noteworthy feature of this model is that localization of the tether and tether activity are linked because both stable localization and activity require dual anchoring. This elegantly ensures that all GRASP65 molecules on the Golgi are dually anchored so that cis interactions do not interfere with trans pairing and membrane tethering.Orientation may be a key regulator of many tethering reactions. In the case of tethering of endosome membranes by EEA1, Rab5 and phosphatidylinositol binding to the EEA1 C terminus anchors it to the membrane orienting its coiled-coil domain to project outwards, perpendicular to the membrane (20Dumas J.J. Merithew E. Sudharshan E. Rajamani D. Hayes S. Lawe D. Corvera S. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 947-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This positions an array of binding sites away from interactions that might occur in cis thereby promoting association with other endosomal membranes. In an analogous fashion, coiled-coil tethers containing the GRIP domain are likely oriented perpendicular to the membrane by the GRIP interaction with the Arl1 GTPases that mediate their membrane association on the trans Golgi network (21Panic B. Perisic O. Veprintsev D.B. Williams R.L. Munro S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Whether these orientation features are required and whether membrane rearrangement upon fusion plays a role in complex disruption remain to be investigated. In these examples, membrane association is regulated by GTPases and is highly dynamic. In the case of GRASP65 tethering, however, it does not appear to be regulated by cycles of membrane recruitment and detachment, so aspects of its disassembly in cis may be unique.The GRASP65 paralog, GRASP55, is thought to act in a fashion similar to GRASP65 in tethering membranes of the medial and trans Golgi (4Feinstein T.N. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2696-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Their GRASP domains share many similarities at the sequence level, with 69% identity and 78% of the changes being of a conservative nature. Similar to GRASP65, the N terminus of GRASP55 is myristoylated (22Kuo A. Zhong C. Lane W.S. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6427-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this modification is required for its tethering activity. 3C. Bachert and A. D. Linstedt, unpublished results. Further, paralleling GRASP65 binding to GM130, GRASP55 binds the C terminus of golgin-45 (23Short B. Preisinger C. Körner R. Kopajtich R. Byron O. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which has a conserved PDZ ligand motif. Interestingly, GRASP55 appears to be in two separate complexes within the cell, only one of which contains golgin-45 (16Barr F.A. Preisinger C. Kopajtich R. Körner R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The other contains transiting molecules including secretory cargo with C-terminal PDZ ligand motifs, and at least some of these bind GRASP65 as well (16Barr F.A. Preisinger C. Kopajtich R. Körner R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17D'Angelo G. Prencipe L. Iodice L. Beznoussenko G. Savarese M. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Martire G. De Matteis M.A. Bonatti S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6427-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of the ligand motifs to those of GM130 and golgin-45 suggests that they bind the GRASP PDZ2 domain leaving PDZ1 available for tethering. This raises the interesting possibility that cargo functions interchangeably with golgins in anchoring GRASP proteins. GRASP55 is also palmitoylated (22Kuo A. Zhong C. Lane W.S. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6427-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so, unlike GRASP65, it may be able to remain active during transient absence of either golgin or cargo binding due to the dual myristic and palmitic acid contacts.A final consideration is whether dual anchoring of the GRASP domain is critical for GRASP-mediated cisternal stacking (24Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25Shorter J. Watson R. Giannakou M.E. Clarke M. Warren G. Barr F.A.

Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or nonconventional secretion (27Kinseth M.A. Anjard C. Fuller D. Guizzunti G. Loomis W.F. Malhotra V. Cell. 2007; 130: 524-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28Schotman H. Karhinen L. Rabouille C. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the case of stacking, this seems likely because the current model invokes homotypic interactions in trans even though the linkage is formed between distinct Golgi subcompartments. Thus, cis interactions need to be prevented, and an orientation of the homotypic binding interface that is dependent on dual anchoring provides a simple solution. One possibility that warrants further investigation is whether GRASP·golgin complexes mediate ribbon formation whereas GRASP·cargo complexes contribute to cisternal stacking due perhaps to localization of the former complexes to Golgi rims and the latter to compact zones. In the case of the participation of the GRASP homologs in Dictyostelium and Drosophila in nonconventional secretion it remains unclear whether the relevant activity depends on PDZ interactions or membrane cross-bridging.

Some endocytic pathways may be co-regulated such that disruption of one pathway leads to the up-regulation of another; however, the underlying mechanisms for this are unclear. Cav1 has been reported to function as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), which inhibits Cdc42 activation. We tested the hypothesis that Cav1 can regulate Cdc42-dependent, fluid phase endocytosis. We demonstrate that Cav1 overexpression decreases fluid phase endocytosis, whereas silencing of Cav1 enhances this pathway. Enhancement of Cav1 phosphorylation using a phosphatase inhibitor reduces Cdc42-regulated pinocytosis while stimulating caveolar endocytosis. Fluid phase endocytosis was inhibited by expression of a putative phosphomimetic mutant, Cav1-Y14E, but not by the phospho-deficient mutant, Cav1-Y14F. Overexpression of Cav2, or a Cav1 mutant in which the GDI region was altered to the corresponding sequence in Cav2, did not suppress fluid phase endocytosis. These results suggest that the Cav1 expression level and phosphorylation state regulates fluid phase endocytosis via the interaction between the Cav1 GDI region and Cdc42.

The hypoxia-responsive transcription factor HIF-1α dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), which is also an important binding partner for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR is an important mediator in the metabolic activation and detoxification of carcinogens, such as the environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). We hypothesized that HIF-1α activation attenuates BaP-induced AhR-mediated gene expression, which may lead to increased genetic instability and malignant progression. Human lung carcinoma cells (A549) were simultaneously stimulated with CoCl2, which leads to HIF-1α stabilization and varying concentrations of BaP. Both quantitative PCR and immunoblot analysis indicated that induction of the hypoxia response pathway significantly reduced the levels of AhR downstream targets CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 and AhR protein binding to ARNT. We further demonstrate that the BaP-induced hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mutation frequency and γ-H2AX foci were markedly amplified when the HIF-1 pathway was induced. BaP-DNA adducts were only marginally increased, and transient strand breaks were diminished by HIF-1 induction, indicating changes in DNA repair.

https://openalex.org/W2172027642,"Yeast filamentous growth is a stress response to conditions of nitrogen deprivation, wherein yeast colonies form pseudohyphal filaments of elongated and connected cells. As proteins mediating adhesion and transport are required for this growth transition, we expect that the protein complement at the yeast cell periphery plays a critical and tightly regulated role in pseudohyphal filamentation. To identify proteins differentially abundant at the yeast cell periphery during pseudohyphal growth, we generated quantitative proteomic profiles of plasma membrane protein preparations under conditions of vegetative growth and filamentation. By isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification chemistry and two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we profiled 2463 peptides and 356 proteins, identifying 11 differentially abundant proteins that localize to the yeast cell periphery. This protein set includes Ylr414cp, herein renamed Pun1p, a previously uncharacterized protein localized to the plasma membrane compartment of Can1. Pun1p abundance is doubled under conditions of nitrogen stress, and deletion of PUN1 abolishes filamentous growth in haploids and diploids; pun1Δ mutants are noninvasive, lack surface-spread filamentation, grow slowly, and exhibit impaired cell adhesion. Conversely, overexpression of PUN1 results in exaggerated cell elongation under conditions of nitrogen stress. PUN1 contributes to yeast nitrogen signaling, as pun1Δ mutants misregulate amino acid biosynthetic genes during nitrogen stress. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-PCR, we find that the filamentous growth factor Mss11p directly binds the PUN1 promoter and regulates its transcription.

In S. cerevisiae, at least three signaling pathways regulate the initiation and maintenance of pseudohyphal growth as follows: 1) the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (PKA) 2The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseMCCmembrane compartment of Can1iTRAQisobaric tags for relative and absolute quantificationSCXstrong cation exchangeRTreverse transcriptionMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseHAhemagglutininGOGene OntologySLADsynthetic low ammonium dextrose medium. pathway; 2) the Kss1p mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade; and 3) a pathway involving the 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase Snf1p. During filamentous growth, nitrogen stress results in activation of the GTP-binding protein Ras2p, which acts upstream of both the PKA and MAPK signaling modules (13Mösch H.U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R.

In particular, proteins at the plasma membrane and cell wall contribute to the pseudohyphal growth response by mediating cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, nutrient transport, and receptor-linked signaling events (1Gimeno C.J.

MUC1 expression is subject to extensive regulatory control; the PKA, Kss1p MAPK, and Snf1p pathways described above all regulate MUC1 transcription, and epigenetic silencing through the histone deacetylase Hda1p further controls MUC1 expression (34Rupp S.

Muc1p contributes to cell-substrate adhesion in vivo, exhibits homotypic adhesion in vitro, and is the only flocculin family member expressed in filamentous strains of S. cerevisiae (37Guo B.

In addition, membrane transporters such as Mep2p and the amino acid transporter homolog Ssy1p regulate filamentous growth (33Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 46Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, proteins at the yeast cell periphery play critical roles in pseudohyphal growth, but the extent to which protein composition at the plasma membrane and cell wall is differentially regulated during filamentation is largely unknown. In particular, it is not known if the protein profile at the yeast cell periphery is significantly altered during filamentous growth or if the differentially abundant proteins contribute to the filamentous growth phenotype. Here, we employ quantitative proteomics to profile changes in protein abundance at the yeast cell periphery during pseudohyphal growth. For this study, we generated plasma membrane protein preparations from yeast colonies under vegetative and filamentous growth conditions and analyzed these samples by mass spectrometry using iTRAQ reagents. The plasma membrane was chosen as the focus of this study for the following three reasons: 1) plasma membrane proteins are known to be important for pseudohyphal growth; 2) plasma membrane protein preparation will also carry along some cell wall proteins; and 3) a significant complement of plasma membrane proteins should be amenable to extraction through a single biochemical protocol, whereas multiple protocols would be needed to isolate a similarly large complement of cell wall proteins. Our analysis identified a set of proteins differentially abundant during pseudohyphal growth, revealing, in particular, an integral component of the plasma membrane compartment of Can1 (MCC), Ylr414cp, that we find to be essential for the pseudohyphal growth response. Ylr414cp, herein renamed Pun1p, exhibits increased abundance under conditions of nitrogen stress and is required for wild-type filamentous growth and cell adhesion. PUN1 is subject to transcriptional regulation by the filamentous growth factors Mss11p and Flo8p; Mss11p directly regulates PUN1 expression under conditions of nitrogen stress, whereas Flo8p acts indirectly. In total, this work presents an informative data set of proteins that change abundance during pseudohyphal growth, while also identifying an essential, but previously unstudied, role for PUN1 in the molecular events enabling the yeast filamentous growth transition. All yeast strains were generated in the Σ1278b background. The genotype of the haploid Y825 strain is MATa ura3-52 leu2Δ0; the genotype of the diploid Y825/6 strain is ura3-52/ura3–52 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 (30Bharucha N. Ma J. Dobry C.J. Lawson S.K. Yang Z. Kumar A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2708-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jin R. Dobry C.J. McCown P.J. Kumar A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Haploid deletion mutants were constructed in strain Y825 by homologous recombination using the PCR-based strategy of Baudin et al. (47Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Haploid mutants were independently constructed and mated to generate homozygous diploids. YLR414C was chromosomally tagged with the Venus variant of yellow fluorescent protein in Y825/6 (48Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). Integrated alleles were generated by standard protocols using the vYFP-KanMX6 cassette from pBS7 (Yeast Resource Center, University of Washington). For co-localization analysis, MCC component genes were amplified by PCR; each open reading frame (without stop codon) was amplified along with 1 kb of upstream genomic DNA for introduction into pDEST-mCherry (49Ma J. Bharucha N. Dobry C.J. Frisch R.L. Lawson S. Kumar A. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Upon cloning, the PCR product creates a translational fusion between the 3′-end of the gene and mCherry. YLR414C was also chromosomally tagged with three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope in Y825/6 for protein quantification by Western blotting. The HA tag was integrated at the 3′-end of YLR414C using the KanMX6 selection cassette from plasmid pFA6a-3HAKanMX6 (50Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4130) Google Scholar). For chromatin immunoprecipitation, MSS11 and FLO8 were chromosomally tagged with protein A in Y825. Yeast strains were propagated on rich YPD medium or synthetic medium as described (51Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 12-17Google Scholar). Haploid filamentous growth was induced in standard medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base (YNB) without amino acids and ammonia, 2% glucose, and 5 mm ammonium sulfate) supplemented with 1% (v/v) butanol or on SLAD plates (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, 50 μm ammonium sulfate, with essential amino acids) plus 1% (v/v) butanol (52Lorenz M.C. Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Diploid filamentous growth was induced in liquid low nitrogen medium (0.17% YNB without amino acids and ammonia, 2% glucose and 50 μm ammonium sulfate) or on SLAD plates. Invasive growth was assayed on YPD medium. Plasma membrane proteins preparations were generated by cell fractionation on Renografin density gradients according to the protocol described in Chang (53Chang A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For these preparations, ∼17 A600 units of yeast cells were harvested from plates (SLAD and standard medium) for each density gradient. Cells were subsequently washed in Tris/EDTA buffer and treated with a mixture of protease inhibitors immediately prior to cell lysis by vortexing with glass beads. After vortexing, the supernatant was reserved, and any remaining unbroken cells were removed by brief centrifugation at 500 × g. The lysate was mixed with an equal volume of Renografin-76, Renocal-76, or Renografin-60 (Bracco Diagnostics, Inc., Princeton, NJ) and placed at the bottom of an SW 50.1 centrifuge tube. The lysate/Renografin mixture was overlaid with 2 volumes each of 34, 30, 26, and 22% Renografin prior to overnight centrifugation at 40,000 rpm. Following centrifugation, fractions from the top of the gradient were collected; the fractions were diluted with Tris/EDTA buffer, and Renografin was removed from these samples by centrifugation in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Subsequently, the distribution of the plasma membrane marker Pma1p in the fractions was analyzed by Western blotting with antibody directed against Pma1p. Protein extracts from selected fractions containing high levels of Pma1p were labeled with iTRAQ reagents (Applied Biosystems) essentially as described in Keshamouni et al. (54Keshamouni V.G.

Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Protein samples (∼50–100 μg) were reduced with 2.5 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at 60 °C for 1 h, and cysteine residues were blocked with 10 mm methyl methane thiosulfate at room temperature for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated with acetone overnight at −20 °C, and pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed in cold 90% acetone, and air-dried. Proteins were digested with trypsin overnight at 40 °C. Tris was removed from the tryptic digests prior to isobaric labeling with iTRAQ reagents; subsequently, iTRAQ reagent was added directly to the protein digest, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The vegetative growth samples (nitrogen sufficiency) were labeled in duplicate using mass 114 and 115 isobaric iTRAQ tags; tryptic peptide pools from the filamentous growth samples (low nitrogen medium) were labeled in duplicate using mass 116 and 117 isobaric iTRAQ tags. After quenching, the labeled peptide pools were mixed 1:1:1:1 for subsequent strong cation exchange (SCX) fractionation and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC). For SCX separation, the combined samples were fractionated on two SCX spin columns run in parallel. Peptides were eluted using 50-μl volumes of KCl in a stepwise gradient from 25 to 350 mm. Seven salt fractions were used, and paired eluates were combined and taken to dryness. Peptides in SCX fractions were subsequently separated by C18 nano-LC using an 1100 Series nano high pressure liquid chromatography equipped with μWPS autosampler, 2/10 microvalve, MWD UV detector (214 nm), and Micro-FC fraction collector/spotter (Agilent). Each SCX salt fraction was reconstituted in 43 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and 40 μl was subsequently injected onto a C18 cartridge (Zorbax300SB, 3.5 μm, 150 × 0.1 mm; Agilent) and desalted with solvent C (CH3CN:H2O:trifluoroacetic acid, 5:95:0.1). The enrichment column was placed ahead of a C18 column (Zorbax300SB, 3.5 μm, Agilent) equilibrated with solvent A (CH3CN:H2O:trifluoroacetic acid, 6.5:93.5:0.1), and peptides were eluted with a gradient of solvent B (CH3CN:H2O:trifluoroacetic acid, 90:10:0.1) from 6.5 to 50% solvent B over 90 min at a flow rate of 0.4 μl/min. Column effluent was mixed with matrix delivered with a PHD200 infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus). Fractions were spotted at 30-s intervals onto a stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization target plate (192 wells/plate, Applied Biosystems). Mass spectra were acquired on an Applied Biosystems model 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (TOF/TOF) using 4000 Series Explorer software. Peptides were identified using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science) run using GPS Explorer. Each mass spectrometry spectrum was searched against a protein sequence data base (NCBI nonredundant data base), resulting in a set of tryptic peptide matches with confidence values. MASCOT searches were run allowing for one missed cleavage, precursor error tolerance of 0.7 Da, and mass spectrometry fragment tolerance of 0.3 Da. Signature ion peak areas at 114.1, 115.1, 116.1, and 117.1 m/z were extracted from the 4700 raw data using the ABI 4700 software. To quantify differences between the vegetative growth and filamentous growth samples, raw peak heights were normalized by matching the quantiles of the distributions of the 115, 116, and 117 measurements to the quantiles of the 114 measurements using a monotone piece-wise linear function (55Li J.Y. Lescure P.A. Misek D.E. Lai Y.M. Chai B.X. Kuick R. Thompson R.C. Demo R.M. Kurnit D.M. Michailidis G. Hanash S.M. Gantz I. J. Biol.

After normalization, the four peak area measurements exhibited similar statistics in mean, variance, and quartiles. Invasive growth of haploid deletion mutants was determined by the standard plate-washing assay (1Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar); mid-log phase cultures were spotted onto YPD plates and incubated for 5 days at 30 °C, and surface cells were subsequently washed off the plate under a gentle stream of water. Colony morphology of deletion mutants was observed by streaking mid-log cultures grown in YPD onto SLAD plates (diploid strains) or SLAD supplemented with 1% (v/v) butanol (haploid strains) and incubating at 30 °C for 10 days. For fluorescence microscopy, overnight cultures were diluted to an absorbance (A600) of 0.1 in synthetic medium lacking leucine. Yeast cells grown to an A600 of 0.6 were used for co-localization analysis. For assays of filamentous growth, cells were grown overnight, diluted to an A600 of 0.1, and grown in standard medium or inducing conditions as required (30Bharucha N. Ma J. Dobry C.J. Lawson S.K. Yang Z. Kumar A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2708-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filamentous growth in haploid strains was induced by inoculating diluted cultures into standard growth medium supplemented with 1% butanol for 4 h at 30 °C. Diploid filamentous strains were induced as follows: overnight cultures were centrifuged, washed, and inoculated at an A600 of 0.1 in low nitrogen medium at 30 °C for 4 h before observation. All microscopy was performed on an upright Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with a CoolSNAP ES2 CCD (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ); images were acquired using the MetaMorph software package (Molecular Devices). RNA isolation, target preparation, hybridization, and data analysis were performed as described previously (29Ma J. Jin R. Jia X. Dobry C.J. Wang L. Reggiori F. Zhu J. Kumar A. Genetics. 2007; 177: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GeneChip Yeast Genome S98 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used in all experiments. All microarray experiments were performed in triplicate with independent biological replicates. Gene annotations were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (SGD). Gene Ontology (GO) Term Finder and GO Slim Mapper tools in SGD were used to assign the genes in GO-based categories, and over-represented GO terms were identified in each data set. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Gene Cluster 3.0, and the data were visualized with Java Tree View, essentially as described in Juan and Huang (56Juan H.F. Huang H.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 382: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The transcriptional profiling data described here are accessible through accession number GSE20351 at NCBI, Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA using the Superscript II kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time PCR was performed in triplicate using the SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to an internal control, and the ΔΔCT method was used to obtain relative expression levels for each gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described previously (28Borneman A.R. Leigh-Bell J.A. Yu H. Bertone P. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, the overnight culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of YPD medium to an A600 of 0.2. The cultures were allowed to recover from stationary phase until an A600 of 0.4 was reached. One percent (v/v) of butanol was then added to induce filamentous growth. Cells were cross-linked by formaldehyde treatment and lysed using lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein A-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). DNA fragments from the immunoprecipitated samples were amplified using the primers indicated in supplemental Table S1.

In contrast, wild-type (WT) cochlin may form only dimers transiently. Interestingly, the presence of mutant cochlin can stabilize WT cochlin in dimer conformation, providing a possible mechanism for the dominant nature of DFNA9 mutations.

Our study suggests a possible molecular mechanism underlying DFNA9 hearing loss and provides an in vitro model that may be used to explore protein-misfolding diseases in general. Protein misfolding is a fundamental mechanism underlying multiple chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and prion disease, which have been called collectively the conformational diseases to emphasize the role of aberrant protein conformations in the clinical manifestation of the diseases (1Bossy-Wetzel E. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S2-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Mutations of different genes involved in these diseases have been shown to lead to oligomerization and aggregation of corresponding proteins to form amyloid. The conformational transition that leads to the formation of amyloid requires misfolding of native protein structure and intermolecular bonding. However, we still understand very little about the conformational transition processes from the misfolded state to the aggregated state, as this transition for most conformational disease-associated mutant proteins explored so far is both rapid and heterogeneous. Point mutations in the COCH (coagulation factor C homology) gene are responsible for an autosomal-dominant non-syndromic hearing disorder termed DFNA9 (deafness, autosomal-dominant 9) (2Robertson N.G. Lu L. Heller S. Merchant S.N. Eavey R.D. McKenna M. Nadol Jr., J.B. Miyamoto R.T. Linthicum Jr., F.H. Lubianca Neto J.F. Hudspeth A.J. Seidman C.E. Morton C.C. Seidman J.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). DFNA9 is characterized by adult-onset, progressive neurosensory hearing loss with vestibular dysfunction. Pathological studies of the temporal bones from affected individuals have shown remarkable degeneration of neuroepithelial cells, including both fibrocytes and neurosensory cells, and the accumulation of abundant acellular eosinophilic deposits throughout the auditory and vestibular systems (3Merchant S.N. Linthicum F.H. Nadol Jr., J.B. Adv. Otorhinolaryngol. 2000; 56: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Khetarpal U. Schuknecht H.F. Gacek R.R. Holmes L.B. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1991; 117: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for the degeneration and hearing loss in DFNA9 syndrome remains unknown. The amino acid sequence of cochlin, the protein product of the gene COCH, is highly conserved in mammals (5Robertson N.G. Skvorak A.B. Yin Y. Weremowicz S. Johnson K.R. Kovatch K.A. Battey J.F. Bieber F.R. Morton C.C. Genomics. 1997; 46: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of cochlin contains a signal peptide in its N terminus, followed by a region homologous to a domain in the FCL domain (factor C of Limulus; also named the LCCL domain for Limulus factor C/Coch-5b2/Lgl1), a short intervening domain, and two von Willebrand factor A-like domains separated by a second short intervening domain. The von Willebrand factor A-like domain is known to function by interacting with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen (6Nagy I. Trexler M. Patthy L. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The LCCL domain is a novel fold consisting of a central α-helix wrapped on two sides by irregular secondary structures that include eight short β-strands stabilized by two pairs of disulfide bonds (7Liepinsh E. Trexler M. Kaikkonen A. Weigelt J. Bányai L. Patthy L. Otting G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5347-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because most of the disease-associated point mutations in COCH are localized in the LCCL domain of cochlin (8Robertson N.G. Jones S.M. Sivakumaran T.A. Giersch A.B. Jurado S.A. Call L.M. Miller C.E. Maison S.F. Liberman M.C. Morton C.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the function of the LCCL domain is predicted to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of DFNA9. Coch−/− mice do not develop the degeneration and hearing loss as observed in DFNA9 patients, suggesting that DFNA9-associated COCH mutations may be gain of function in nature (9Makishima T. Rodriguez C.I. Robertson N.G. Morton C.C. Stewart C.L. Griffith A.J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 118: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, how disease-associated mutations in COCH convey a toxic gain of function. The normal function of cochlin is also unknown. The expression of COCH is highly enriched in the inner ear but can also be detected in other organs (2Robertson N.G. Lu L. Heller S. Merchant S.N. Eavey R.D. McKenna M. Nadol Jr., J.B. Miyamoto R.T. Linthicum Jr., F.H. Lubianca Neto J.F. Hudspeth A.J. Seidman C.E. Morton C.C. Seidman J.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 10Rodriguez C.I. Cheng J.G. Liu L. Stewart C.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1410-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Five isoforms (p63, p44, p40, p18, and p16) of cochlin were found in adult bovine cochlea (11Ikezono T. Omori A. Ichinose S. Pawankar R. Watanabe A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1535: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Ikezono T. Shindo S. Li L. Omori A. Ichinose S. Watanabe A. Kobayashi T. Pawankar R. Yagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and two isoforms were found in fetal human inner ear (p60 and p50) (13Robertson N.G. Resendes B.L. Lin J.S. Lee C. Aster J.C. Adams J.C. Morton C.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cochlin comprises the major non-collagen component of the extracellular matrix predominantly present in the spiral ligament and spiral limbus regions in fetal and adult mouse and human inner ears, corresponding to the regions of abnormalities in DFNA9 (13Robertson N.G. Resendes B.L. Lin J.S. Lee C. Aster J.C. Adams J.C. Morton C.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The abundant acellular eosinophilic deposits throughout the cochlear and vestibular systems of DFNA9 patients (3Merchant S.N. Linthicum F.H. Nadol Jr., J.B. Adv. Otorhinolaryngol. 2000; 56: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the tendency of the recombinant mutant LCCL domains to misfold in vitro (7Liepinsh E. Trexler M. Kaikkonen A. Weigelt J. Bányai L. Patthy L. Otting G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5347-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have led to the proposal for a potential involvement of protein misfolding in DFNA9. However, no direct evidence for misfolding of mutant cochlins has been demonstrated. In cultured cells, wild-type (WT) 2The abbreviations used are: WTwild-typeCMconditioned mediumHAhemagglutininABRauditory brainstem responseCTFC-terminal fragmentNTFN-terminal fragment. and mutant cochlins are synthesized, modified, and secreted in similar amounts (14Grabski R. Szul T. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Mayne R. Hicks B. Sztul E. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Robertson N.G. Hamaker S.A. Patriub V. Aster J.C. Morton C.C. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, mutant cochlins are able to be glycosylated and secreted adequately by cells through the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway. The cellular behavior of mutant cochlins is different from that of other known intracellular and extracellular misfolded mutant proteins such as mutant Htt (16Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M.

Commun. 1984; 122: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), which readily form high order oligomers upon expression. These results have led to the suggestion that DFNA9 mutations may manifest deleterious effects beyond the point of secretion in the extracellular matrix of the inner ear by disrupting cochlin function or interfering with protein-protein interactions involving the LCCL domain. However, although WT cochlin accumulates in extracellular deposits that closely parallel the matrix component fibronectin, no consistent deposition of mutant cochlin was found (14Grabski R. Szul T.

Genet. 2003; 113: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). wild-type conditioned medium hemagglutinin auditory brainstem response C-terminal fragment N-terminal fragment. In this study, we show that although mutations in the COCH gene do not consistently affect the secretion of cochlin, they lead to dimerization and oligomerization of intracellular and secreted cochlins. Interestingly, the presence of mutant cochlin is able to induce WT cochlin to form reducing agent-sensitive dimers and eventually reducing agent-insensitive oligomers. We further reveal that the coexpression of mutant and WT cochlins is cytotoxic for cells of inner ear origin in vitro and in vivo. Our study demonstrates the interaction of WT and mutant proteins, the role of WT protein in protein-misfolding diseases, and a potential molecular mechanism for co-dominance of WT and mutant proteins in mediating selective degeneration in age-delayed chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Full-length mouse Coch cDNA was amplified by PCR from a mouse spleen library (18Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) and the pFLAG-CMV5 (Sigma) and pMH (Roche Applied Science) vectors, respectively. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-active caspase-3 antibody was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). UB/UE-1 cells, kindly provided by Dr. Mathew Holley (19Lawlor P. Marcotti W. Rivolta M.N. Kros C.J. Holley M.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9445-9458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained at 33 °C in complete medium plus 50 units/ml recombinant murine interferon-γ (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). UB/UE-1 cells were induced to differentiate by culturing at 39 °C in complete medium without recombinant murine interferon-γ. Primary fibrocytes were isolated from mouse cochlea following a previously described protocol (20Suko T. Ichimiya I. Yoshida K. Suzuki M. Mogi G. Hear. Res. 2000; 140: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 293T cells were allowed to grow to 70∼80% confluence and transfected with constructs with TransIT polyamine transfection reagents (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI). UB/UE-1 cells were transfected with the Amaxa Nucleofector and Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R, Program T-27 (Amaxa Inc.). The conditioned medium (CM) of 293T cells collected for intracochlear injection did not contain 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, or phenol red. CM was concentrated ∼8-fold by centrifugal filter units with microporous membrane. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with TransIT reagent. Forty-eight hours after transfection, 293T cell culture supernatant was collected. Cells were then washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 30 min, and culture supernatants were collected. The samples were mixed at a 1:1 ratio either with nonreducing loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.5% bromphenol blue) and not heated for nonreducing SDS-PAGE or with reducing loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min for reducing SDS-PAGE. Cell lysates were separated either by nonreducing SDS-PAGE in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol or by reducing SDS-PAGE in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitation was accomplished using agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) or with anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation from supernatants or cell lysates collected from 5 × 106 293T cells expressing vector only or cochlins. After the beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, FLAG-tagged cochlins were eluted in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 250 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C or by heating (for HA). UB/UE-1 cells were transfected by the Nucleofector system. The cells were maintained either at 33 °C (undifferentiated) or at 39 °C (differentiated). Seventy-two hours after transfection, dead and living cells containing green fluorescent protein were counted visually. C57BL/6 mice (4∼6 weeks old) were chosen as the recipients. The surgical procedure was performed, and 10 μl of CM containing either WT or mutant cochlin was injected from the lateral semicircular canal using the procedure described previously (21Nakagawa T.

The hearing threshold for each animal was measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing 1 and 4 weeks after the protein injection as described (23Shen H. Zhang B. Shin J.H. Lei D. Du Y. Gao X. Wang Q. Ohlemiller K.K. Piccirillo J. Bao J. Hear. Res. 2007; 226: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally, and mouse cochleae were processed as described (24Ohlemiller K.K. McFadden S.L. Ding D.L. Lear P.M. Ho Y.S. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2000; 1: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and stained with Mayer's hematoxylin solution. HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1 m glycine, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 + 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then subsequently stained with anti-FLAG antibody M2, Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes), mouse serum (1:100), and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were imaged on a Nikon TE2000E inverted fluorescence microscope as Z-series (0.25 μm) using a 60× objective lens. Z-stacks were deconvolved using AutoQuant X2 software (AutoQuant Imaging, Inc.), followed by three-dimensional reconstruction using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Because degenerative hearing loss is a hallmark of DFNA9, we hypothesized that mutant cochlin may function as a proteotoxic species that leads to cell death. To test this hypothesis, we utilized UB/UE-1 cells, a cell line derived from progenitor cells of the mouse inner ear. Cochlin is expressed abundantly in the inner ear and has been reported to represent as much as 70% of the extractable proteins in the bovine inner ear (11Ikezono T. Omori A. Ichinose S. Pawankar R. Watanabe A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1535: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of cochlin in UB/UE-1 cells is much lower than that in vivo (data not shown). To create a condition comparable with the expression of cochlin in vivo, we transfected the expression vectors of murine WT and mutant G90E cochlins, corresponding to the DFNA9-associated G88E mutation in humans, into UB/UE-1 cells. Interestingly, expression of mutant cochlin or WT and mutant cochlins together but not WT cochlin alone in differentiated UB/UE-1 cells induced cell death associated with activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 1, A–D). In contrast, expression of WT and/or mutant cochlin in 293T or HeLa cells was not cytotoxic (data not shown). Thus, expression of mutant cochlin leads to cytotoxicity in cells derived from the inner ear. Cochlin was predicted to be a secreted protein based on its N-terminal signal peptide and von Willebrand factor A-like domains, which are usually found in proteins associated with the extracellular matrix (25Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We developed two specific anti-cochlin antibodies, an anti-LCCL monoclonal antibody and an anti-C-terminal fragment (CTF) polyclonal antibody. The anti-LCCL antibody recognizes the LCCL domain, whereas the anti-CTF antibody recognizes the N-terminal part of the C-terminal domain (CTF) of cochlin as well as the LCCL domain (supplemental Fig. 1). Because the cochlin isoforms expressed from the expression vector of full-length COCH cDNA, including full-length cochlin, CTF, N-terminal fragment (NTF) A, and NTF-B, migrated similarly on SDS-polyacrylamide gel as the endogenous cochlin isoforms in the inner ear cell lysate (supplemental Fig. 1), we conclude that our culture model recapitulates key behaviors of endogenous cochlin in processing and secretion. Using this system, we explored the processing of WT and mutant cochlins in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with expression vectors of WT and mutant cochlins. We followed the maturation of WT cochlin by Western blotting using anti-LCCL and anti-CTF antibodies. On Western blots, anti-CTF antibody recognized secreted WT cochlin predominantly as the CTF (44 kDa) as well as a small amount of full-length cochlin (Fig. 2A). At later time points, two additional cochlin species, NTF-A (18 kDa) and later NTF-B (16 kDa), both derived from the LCCL domain, were detected in the culture supernatant. On Western blots of the supernatant using anti-LCCL antibody, which recognizes the LCCL domain only, we first detected full-length cochlin, followed by NTF-A and then NTF-B (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the amount of secreted full-length cochlin (63 kDa) in the culture supernatant remained constant over 24 h, whereas the amount of the smaller fragments of other cochlin species (CTF, NTF-A, and NTF-B) increased over time. Importantly, the processing of WT cochlin as detected by both antibodies is entirely consistent. The kinetic difference in the detection of full-length versus mature cochlin isoforms in the culture supernatant suggests that the smaller isoforms, especially NTF-A and NTF-B, are produced by the cleavage of full-length cochlin at the cell surface. We also analyzed the secretion of cochlin mutants associated with DFNA9 syndrome. Because the amino acid sequences of murine and human cochlins are 94% identical, we introduced four point mutations, P53S, V68G, G90E, and W119R, into murine WT cochlin, corresponding to the human DFNA9 mutations of P51S, V66G, G88E, and W117R, respectively. The expression vectors of WT and mutant cochlins were transfected into 293T cells, and the culture supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CTF (Fig. 2C) and anti-LCCL (Fig. 2D) antibodies. Compared with WT cochlin, all mutants analyzed showed a varying degree of increases in the levels of full-length cochlin and decreases in the levels of processed forms (CTF, NTF-A, and NTF-B). In the culture supernatant of 293T cells expressing P53S and W119R, there was a slight increase in the full-length cochlin/CTF ratio compared with WT cochlin (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, the increase in the full-length cochlin/CTF ratio was much more dramatic in the culture supernatant expressing V68G and G90E, which showed very little detectable CTF (Fig. 2, C and D). This conclusion is also supported by a time course study of mutants P53S and G90E (Fig. 2, E and F). Although the production of CTF and NTF-A for P53S cochlin is largely normal, the processing of G90E cochlin is highly defective. In addition, these mutations also affected the processing of the N-terminal LCCL domain isoforms, namely NTF-A and NTF-B. On Western blots probed with anti-CTF antibody, there was a severe reduction of both NTF-A and NTF-B in the supernatant expressing all the point mutants. On the other hand, because the anti-LCCL antibody is much more sensitive in detecting the LCCL domain compared with the anti-CTF antibody (supplemental Fig. 1), the anti-LCCL antibody detected variable amounts of NTF-A and NTF-B on the same Western blot of the culture supernatant expressing different mutants, with the exception of W119R, which expressed approximately the same amount of NTF-A and NTF-B as WT cochlin (Fig. 2D). The variable effects of different mutations on the processing of secreted mutant cochlins were further confirmed by a time course study of the P53S and G90E mutants (Fig. 2, E and F). Because the V68G mutation almost completely abolished the production of CTF, NTF-A, and NTF-B, whereas the W119R mutation appeared to have a minimal effect, we conclude that DFNA9-associated COCH mutations have variable effects on the processing and/or secretion of cochlin and that at least some of the mutants are processed and secreted normally similar to WT cochlin. Consistent with this proposal, we found that the subcellular distributions of WT and mutant cochlins are very similar (supplemental Fig. 2), which is consistent with what was reported by Robertson et al. (15Robertson N.G. Hamaker S.A. Patriub V. Aster J.C. Morton C.C. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To understand how mutant cochlin causes cytotoxicity, we investigated the effects of the mutations on protein folding. We developed an assay using nonreducing SDS-PAGE in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol in conjunction with Western blotting. The WT and mutant cochlin expression constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells individually, and the culture supernatant and cell lysate were collected under nonreducing conditions for Western blotting using anti-CTF polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3, A and E) and anti-LCCL monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3, B and F) after SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agent. The full-length WT and CTF cochlins in the culture supernatant and cell lysates, which ran as 63- and 44-kDa bands upon reducing SDS-PAGE, respectively (Fig. 2C), migrated also as 63- and 44-kDa bands upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, A and E). Thus, the migratory behavior of WT cochlin is similar under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Interestingly, in all samples of the culture supernatant and cell lysates collected from the cells expressing cochlin mutants, an additional 120-kDa band recognized by both anti-CTF and anti-LCCL antibodies on Western blots was observed (Fig. 3, A, B, E, and F, arrowheads). The migratory behavior of full-length cochlin upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE suggests that the 120-kDa band constitutes a dimer of cochlin. This result suggests that all DFNA9-associated cochlin mutants misfold and form dimers, although the efficiency of dimerization may be different: P53S and G90E cochlins appear to form dimers much more readily compared with V68G and W119R cochlins. The migratory behavior of misfolded cochlin mutants is similar, as they all migrated as a 120-kDa band in the presence of SDS without reducing agent. To further characterize this 120-kDa band, we treated the culture supernatant and cell lysates collected from cells expressing WT and mutant cochlins with the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed the results by reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3 (C, D, G, and H), the addition of β-mercaptoethanol completely eliminated the presence of this 120-kDa band in the culture supernatant and cell lysates from cells expressing the mutant cochlin. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the mutant-specific 120-kDa band detected by both anti-CTF and anti-LCCL antibody is highly sensitive to reducing conditions. Considering that β-mercaptoethanol reduces disulfide bonds in proteins, this result suggests that the mutations in cochlin may result in the formation of abnormal disulfide bonds. On the other hand, because a significant amount of misfolded mutant cochlin is detected in the culture supernatant and cell lysates, it appears that protein misfolding per se is not sufficient to result in their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or selective degradation through ER-associated protein degradation (26Rose J.K. Doms R.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the cellular events that lead to cochlin misfolding and dimerization, we constructed HA- and FLAG-tagged WT, P53S, and G90E cochlin expression vectors and transiently transfected them pairwise into HEK293T cells. In culture supernatant from cells expressing WT cochlin, anti-HA Western blotting detected predominantly CTF (44 kDa) (Fig. 4A, upper panel), consistent with the efficient processing of WT cochlin after its secretion. Immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody from cells expressing two expression vectors of FLAG-tagged WT cochlins pulled down a significant amount of HA-tagged CTF as well as a small amount of full-length cochlin (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Although the dimers were disrupted by the presence of reducing agent, the interaction of secreted full-length and CTF cochlins could still be detected (Fig. 4B, lower panel), including WT cochlin. Thus, cochlin may normally dimerize, and the dimerization of mutant cochlin may be further stabilized by disulfide bonds. In the supernatant of cell cultures expressing mutant cochlin alone or WT and mutant cochlins together, different amount of the dimer (120 kDa), full-length cochlin, and CTF could be detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Anti-FLAG antibody from the supernatant of cells expressing both FLAG- and HA-tagged mutant cochlins could immunoprecipitate HA-tagged mutant cochlin (Fig. 4B, upper panel), confirming that the 120-kDa species is indeed a dimer. Interestingly, WT cochlin, which could not be detected as a 120-kDa dimer in the supernatant after nonreducing SDS-PAGE when expressed alone, was found to interact with mutant cochlin as part of a 120-kDa dimer when coexpressed with mutant cochlin (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Thus, the interaction between WT and mutant cochlins leads to the formation of misfolded dimers that persist after secretion, similar to that with mutant cochlin alone, suggesting that WT cochlin can be recruited to and form stable dimers with mutant cochlin. We next investigated whether the dimers could be detected intracellularly. The interaction of intracellular WT and mutant cochlins was also detected using immunoprecipitation in cells expressing two differentially tagged cochlin-expressing vectors (Fig. 4, C and D). Interacting mutant and WT cochlins were found to be present as 120-kDa dimers as well as in higher molecular mass oligomers after nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, when WT cochlin was expressed alone, a small amount of WT cochlin was also present as a 120-kDa dimer in cell lysates, suggesting that WT cochlin might form disulfide bond-stabilized dimers intracellularly in a transient manner, with reduced affinity and/or with reduced rate of dimer formation, whereas interacting mutant and WT cochlins persist in dimer conformation even after secretion. In the supernatant and lysates collected from cells expressing WT and mutant cochlins for 48 h and analyzed under reducing conditions, all dimers and oligomers were efficiently disrupted (Fig. 4, A–D, lower panels), suggesting that misfolded cochlin is initially sensitive to reducing conditions. Interestingly, in lysates collected from cells expressing WT or mutant cochlin for 72 h, a higher molecular mass complex o"

PA-MSHA was administered to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231HM and MDA-MB-468 in vitro and to mice bearing tumor xenografts. The mannose cocultured test was used to detect the effect of mannose on PA-MSHA-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and EGFR pathway signaling. We found that cells stimulated with PA-MSHA exhibited a downregulation of EGFR signaling. The addition of mannose partially inhibited the PA-MSHA-stimulated cell anti-proliferative effect, cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, activation of apoptosis-associated caspases, and even downregulation of the EGFR signaling pathway. In vivo, PA-MSHA treatment significantly suppressed mammary tumorigenesis in xenografts in mice and decreased lung metastasis in MDA-MB-231HM cell-transplanted mice. Tumor sample analyses confirmed inhibition of the EGFR pathway in the PA-MSHA-treated mice. In conclusion, this study showed that the involvement of the mannose-mediated EGFR pathway has a critical function in the preclinical rationale for the development of PA-MSHA for the treatment of human breast cancer. It also suggests the potentially beneficial use of PA-MSHA in adjuvant therapy for breast tumors with EGFR overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2043391367,"A large body of evidence supports the hypothesis that proteasomal degradation of the growth suppressor p27Kip1 (p27) facilitates mammalian cell cycle progression. However, very few studies have addressed the possibility of proteasome-independent mechanisms of p27 proteolysis. Here we provide evidence for a novel pathway of p27 degradation via the lysosome that is mediated by its interaction with the endosomal protein sorting nexin 6 (SNX6), a member of the sorting nexin family of vesicular trafficking regulators. p27 and SNX6 interact in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells, partially colocalize in endosomes, and are present in purified endosomal fractions. Gain-and loss-of-function studies revealed that SNX6 induces endosomal accumulation of p27. Moreover, p27 is detected in lysosomes and inhibition of lysosome-dependent proteolysis impairs serum-mediated down-regulation of p27 in a SNX6-dependent manner. To validate the localization of p27 in these organelles, we analyzed several cell lines using two different anti-p27 antibodies, several organelle-specific markers [e.g., early endosome antigen 1, lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP) 1, LAMP2, and LysoTracker], and overexpression of fluorescent p27 and SNX6. Remarkably, silencing of SNX6 attenuates p27 down-regulation in the G1 phase of the mitotic cell cycle and delays cell cycle progression. We therefore conclude that, in addition to the proteasome-dependent pathway, SNX6-mediated endolysosomal degradation of p27 also contributes to cell cycle progression in mammalian cells.—Fuster, J.

https://openalex.org/W2170193215,"A major source of “high-output” NO in inflammation is inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS is primarily transcriptionally regulated and is thought to function as an uncontrolled generator of high NO. We found that iNOS in cytokine-stimulated human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) is highly regulated post-translationally via activation of the B1 kinin G protein-coupled receptor (B1R). We report here that B1R-mediated iNOS activation was significantly inhibited by knockdown of ß-arrestin 2 with siRNA in cytokine-treated HLMVECs or HEK293 cells transfected with iNOS and B1R In contrast, ß-arrestin 1 siRNA had no effect. The prolonged phase of B1R-dependent ERK activation was also inhibited by ß-arrestin 2 knockdown. Furthermore, robust ERK activation by the epidermal growth factor receptor (a ß-arrestin 2 independent pathway) had no effect on iNOS-derived NO production. ß-arrestin 2 and iNOS coimmunoprecipitated, and there was significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer between CFP-iNOS and ß-arrestin 2-YFP (but not ß-arrestin 1-YFP) that increased 3-fold after B1R stimulation. These data show that ß-arrestin 2 mediates B1R-dependent high-output NO by scaffolding iNOS and ERK to allow post-translational activation of iNOS. This could play a critical role in mediating endothelial function in inflammation.—Kuhr, F.

Although the function of cytosolic Hsp90 is dependent on a battery of cochaperone proteins regulating both its ATPase activity and its interaction with client proteins, little is known about the real Hsp90 molecular mechanism. Besides its highly flexible dimeric state, Hsp90 is able to self-oligomerize in the presence of divalent cations or under heat shock. In addition to dimers, oligomers exhibit a chaperone activity. In this work, we focused on Mg2+-induced oligomers that we named Type I, Type II, and Type III in increasing molecular mass order.

Combining analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering, and high mass matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, we determined biochemical and biophysical characteristics of each Hsp90 oligomer. We demonstrate that Type I oligomer is a tetramer, and Type II is an hexamer, whereas Type III is a dodecamer. These even-numbered structures demonstrate that the building brick for oligomerization is the dimer up to the Type II, whereas Type III probably results from the association of two Type II.

In contrast to most of the chaperone protein families, Hsp90 is not involved in de novo folding but operates at later stages of the folding process, assisting the maturation and activation of numerous client proteins, including steroid receptors and cell cycle kinases (3Aherne W.

In the cell, Hsp90 amounts to 1–2% of the total proteins under nonstress conditions depending on the organism and cell type (2–25 mg/ml). Hsp90 is overexpressed under stress conditions such as heat or hypoxia (8Lai B.T. Chin N.W. Stanek A.E. Keh W. Lanks K.W. Mol. Cell.

At the structural level, Hsp90 is composed of three distinct domains: the N-terminal domain contains the common binding site for ATP and geldanamycin; the middle domain is implicated in ATP γ-phosphate binding/hydrolysis and client proteins binding (14Meyer P.

Kimura Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The domains are linked via large hinge loop regions conferring both an important intrinsic flexibility and an interdomain communication within the Hsp90 dimer (17Phillips J.J. Yao Z.P. Zhang W.

Furthermore, it is clear that Hsp90 flexibility is crucial for the course of its chaperoning cycle, because ATP binding seems to drive large conformational changes (18Cunningham C.N. Krukenberg K.A.

Besides the influence of nucleotide and/or ligand binding on its structure, the Hsp90 dimer also undergoes some large conformational changes under heat shock or in the presence of divalent cations, leading to oligomerization. Hsp90 oligomerization is a highly ordered process, and heat-induced oligomers are sensitive to modulators such as ATP and geldanamycin, suggesting a real function in the chaperoning cycle (23Garnier C.

Hsp90 oligomers have also been observed under nonheated conditions, suggesting a basal oligomer level in the cell under physiological conditions (25Nemoto T. Sato N. Biochem.

We previously demonstrated that oligomers are formed in the presence of divalent cations that induce an increase of the compactness of the Hsp90 dimer, leading to its self-association (27Garnier C. Barbier P. Devred F. Rivas G. Peyrot V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11770-11778Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A recent small angle x-ray scattering study has highlighted the presence of tetramers for HtpG and eukaryote homologues, amounting to 10–20% of the quaternary structures present in solution. The V-shaped dimer would be more prone than the flying seagull to form an apo tetramer (28Krukenberg K.A. Böttcher U.M. Southworth D.R. Agard D.A. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 1815-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the Hsp90 structural modifications, with respect to the flexibility of the dimer as well as the oligomerization process, enables Hsp90 to adapt to its broad spectrum of client proteins (25Nemoto T. Sato N. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Concerning their functional aspects, oligomers were able to maintain dihydrofolate reductase in a folding-competent state and to prevent firefly luciferase thermal denaturation (29Yonehara M.

A comparative study of oligomerization of Hsp90 homologues showed that oligomerization is a prerequisite for chaperoning under stress conditions and that HtpG, Hsp90, and Grp94 oligomers were able to prevent glutathione S-transferase precipitation only in the oligomeric state (26Nemoto T.K. Ono T. Tanaka K. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 663-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that Hsp90 heat-induced oligomerization would be accompanied by an auto-chaperone process (30Thorne M.E. McQuade K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 oligomers play a chaperone function, a clear understanding of the role of oligomerization in the chaperoning cycle of the Hsp90 machinery is crucial. Furthermore, some discrepancies remain concerning the degrees of oligomerization. Little is known regarding the biochemical and biophysical properties of Hsp90 oligomers, and even less is known about their structures. This work focuses on magnesium-induced Hsp90 oligomers. The optimization of experimental conditions reveals several oligomer types that we have termed Type I, Type II, and Type III in increasing order of molecular mass. Once the oligomers were stabilized, the prerequisite of this work was to obtain pure samples of each species in suitable quantity for their biochemical and biophysical characterization. For this purpose, we have designed and optimized several protocols based on their molecular mass difference; we used both electroelution from native-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. For the first time, we were able to purify distinct Hsp90 oligomeric species. We have elucidated the self-association stoichiometries of Hsp90 magnesium-induced oligomers by combining complementary techniques such as analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS), and high mass MALDI-TOF MS. We demonstrate that this self-assembly process involves the dimer as the basic unit up to the Type II oligomer, whereas Type III results from the association of two Type II oligomers. An understanding of the magnesium-induced oligomerization process allows us to explain the temperature-dependent oligomerization and reinforces the hypothesis that oligomers are involved in auto-chaperone activity. We initiated the first structural study by electron tomography on negatively stained specimens, and the reconstruction of the structure obtained for the Type II displays a typical shape reminiscent of a “cozy nest.” Hsp90 was purified from pig brains according to the method of Yonezawa et al. (31Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. Koyasu S. Matsuzaki F. Iida K. Yahara I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) modified by Garnier et al. (23Garnier C. Protasevich I.

Peyrot V. Briand C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by measuring UV absorption with a molar absorption coefficient (280 nm) of 124,000/M·cm in 10 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.5, considering that Hsp90 is a dimer. The absorption was corrected for light scattering using Beckman DU640B spectrophotometer software. Hsp90 (54 μm) in 10 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.5, was supplemented with 8 mm MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Chemical cross-linking was performed using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 2.3 mm for 30 min at 25 °C, and the Hsp90 concentration was 46 μm. The reaction was stopped by adding Tris quenching buffer (750 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). A 20-fold excess of amine containing buffer is enough to quench the reaction. The prepared sample was supplemented with ⅓ Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 2%, glycerol 30% and applied (10 × 30 μl) on a 6% native-polyacrylamide gel. Migration was performed in Tris-glycine buffer for 2.5 h at 20 mA/gel (33Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Bands corresponding to each oligomer type were cut and placed in micro baskets adaptable to YM50 Centricon (Millipore). Centricons were adapted to an electroelutor system (Bio-Rad). Extensively degassed Tris-glycine buffer was used for migration (4 h at 2.5 mA/Centricon). Centricons were then centrifuged 2,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C. The resulting concentrate was ultracentrifuged 100,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C on a Beckman TL100. Aliquots of supernatant (50 μl) were used for electron microscopy studies. A 500-μl cross-linked and quenched sample (final concentration, 29 μm) was loaded on a Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography column, 1 cm × 210 cm (90/60/30/30 cm Tricorn columns in series, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mm MES-NaOH, 8 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, with chromatography conditions controlled by an HPLC pump system (625 LC System, Waters). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature, the eluate was monitored at 280 nm (2996 photodiode Array detector, Waters), and fractions of 500 μl were collected between 130 and 180 min of elution time. Fractions corresponding to each oligomer type were selected and stored at −80 °C. Corresponding fractions from identical runs were pooled, concentrated on an Amicon Ultra YM30 (Millipore), and stored at −80 °C. The columns were standardized with a calibration kit of proteins with known molecular masses and Stokes radii (GE Healthcare) (34Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 35le Maire M. Rivas E. Møller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), using thyroglobulin (Mr = 669 kDa, Rs = 85 Å), ferritin (Mr = 440 kDa, Rs = 61 Å), and catalase (Mr = 232 kDa, Rs = 52.2 Å). Blue dextran 2000 (GE Healthcare) was used to determine the column exclusion volume. The samples were supplemented with Laemmli buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and loaded onto polyacrylamide 3–8% gradient gel. Migration was performed in SDS-Tris-glycine buffer at 100 V. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Molecular mass markers were from the high molecular weight-SDS marker kit (GE Healthcare). The samples were supplemented with buffer containing Coomassie Blue G-250 in 30% glycerol and loaded onto 6/8% double layer polyacrylamide gels. Migrations were performed in Tris-glycine buffer over 2.5 or 3 h at 20 mA/gel. The gels were stained using EZ-Blue (Sigma-Aldrich). Molecular mass markers were purchased from GE Healthcare. Hsp90 oligomers samples were prepared as described above. Concentrated SEC-HPLC fractions 128–133, 134–139, and 145–150, corresponding to Type III, Type II, and Type I oligomers, respectively, were analyzed by sedimentation velocity. Protein concentrations ranged between 0.03 and 0.19 mg/ml for Type III oligomer, 0.22 and 0.32 mg/ml for Type II oligomer, and 0.29 and 0.46 mg/ml for Type I oligomer. Before all of the experiments, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (5 min) to remove potential aggregates formed during freezing (Air-Fuge ultracentrifuge; Beckman). The experiments were carried out at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima-XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using 12-mm Epon double sector centerpieces in an AN55Ti rotor. The scans were acquired in continuous mode at wavelengths selected for appropriate signals in the range of 0.1 to 1 absorption, i.e. 230 nm/20,000 rpm for Type III oligomer, 240 nm/20,000 rpm for Type II oligomer, and 280 nm/30,000 rpm for Type I oligomer. Hsp90 extinction coefficients were calculated for all of the wavelengths tested: 0.7337, 0.9538, and 4.8727 liter/g·cm at 280, 240, and 230 nm, respectively. Apparent sedimentation coefficients were determined using SEDFIT (37Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and were corrected to standard conditions using SEDNTERP (38Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Computer-aided Interpretation of Analytical Sedimentation Data for Proteins in Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Sciences. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). Examining the sedimentation coefficient distributions curves generated in SEDFIT for Type I and Type II oligomers, the purest fractions (i.e. thinnest peaks) were chosen to determine the sedimentation coefficient at standard conditions and infinite dilution. Then fractions 138–139 (STII) and 147–148 (STI) were diluted in 10 mm MES-NaOH, 8 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, to obtain final concentrations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 mg/ml for Type I oligomer and 0.11, 0.16, and 0.22 mg/ml for Type II oligomer and run at 25,000 rpm at 20 °C. The scans were acquired in continuous mode at 230 nm. The experiments were performed at 4 °C with the same analytical ultracentrifuge. The measurements were done at three successive speeds (3400, 4100, and 6000 rpm) by taking scans at the appropriate wavelengths (230 and 280 nm), when sedimentation equilibrium was reached. High sedimentation (40,000 rpm) was conducted afterward for base-line correction. At 4 °C, the values of partial specific volume of Hsp90, solvent density, and viscosity, calculated with SEDNTERP, were 0.7273 ml/g, 1.00673 g/ml, and 0.01567 poise, respectively. The average molecular speed masses were determined by fitting a sedimentation equilibrium model for a single solute to individual data sets with EQASSOC programs supplied by Beckman (39Minton A.P. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhävser, Boston, MA1994Google Scholar). Data analysis was also performed by global analysis of several data sets obtained at different loading concentrations and speeds using the Sedphat program (40Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). MALLS experiments were carried out using an HPLC system (Waters) combined with a DAWN EOS System (Wyatt Technology Corp) at room temperature. Elution was monitored at 280 nm by the photodiode array detector 2996 (Waters) and a refractive index detector (2414, Waters). STI, STII, and STIII samples were injected on a double size exclusion chromatography apparatus composed of two Tricorn columns (GE Healthcare): a 1 cm × 60 cm Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) coupled to a 1 cm × 16 cm Sepharose 6B (Sigma Aldrich). Elution was performed with 10 mm MES-NaOH, 8 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The data were collected and processed with Astra 4.90.08 software using the Debye fit method with a dn/dc set to 0.19 ml/g, typical of nonglycosylated proteins. STI (1.21 mg/ml), STII (0.85 mg/ml), and Type III SEC-HPLC individually eluted fractions 129 (0.665 mg/ml), 130 (1.16 mg/ml), and 131 (2.42 mg/ml) were diluted in K200 cross-linking buffer (CovalX) from ½ to 164 in a 10 μl of final volume. For control experiments, 1 μl of each mixture was mixed with 1 μl of a sinapinic acid matrix (10 mg/ml) in acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v), trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%. After mixing, 1 μl of each sample was spotted on the MALDI plate (SCOUT 384; AnchorChip). The analysis was repeated in triplicate. After crystallization at room temperature, the plate was introduced in the MALDI mass spectrometer. The remaining 9 μl of the sample were submitted to cross-linking using a CovalX K200 MALDI MS analysis kit (CovalX AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Each sample was mixed with 1 μl of K200 stabilizer reagent (2 mg/ml) and incubated at room temperature. After 1, 3, or 6 h of incubation time, the samples were prepared for MALDI analysis as for control experiments. The samples were analyzed by high mass MALDI-TOF immediately after crystallization. The analysis was performed using the standard nitrogen laser and focusing on different mass ranges from 0 to 1200 kDa. High mass MALDI mass spectra were obtained using a 4800 MALDI-TOF TOF instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a HM2 high mass retrofit system (CovalX AG, Zürich, Switzerland). The instrument was operated in linear and positive mode by applying an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The HM2 system was operated in the high mass mode with acceleration voltage set to 20 kV and gain voltage set to between 2.85 and 3.25 kV. The instrument was calibrated using clusters of insulin, bovine serum albumin, and IgG. For each sample, three spots were analyzed (200 laser shots/spot). The presented spectra correspond to the average of 200 laser shots. The MS data were analyzed using Complex Tracker analysis software. Electroeluted sample of Type II (∼ 0.1 mg/ml) oligomer was applied for 30 s to collodion/carbon-coated copper grids previously glow-discharged, rinsed with water or 0.05% glutaraldehyde, and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Tilt series were acquired on a Tecnai G2 Sphera electron microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) operating at 200 kV. Digital images were automatically recorded on a CCD camera (charge-coupled device camera; Megascan) at ×25,000 nominal magnification (pixel size, 0.46 nm) over a tilt range of −60 to +60 with 1° increments. The images were aligned, and tomograms were calculated by the ART reconstruction algorithm (41Herman G.T. Lent A. Rowland S.W. J. Theor. Biol. 1973; 42: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) using the plug-in TomoJ (42Messaoudii C. Boudier T. Sanchez Sorzano C.O. Marco S.

Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). The three-dimensional volumes were imported into the three-dimensional visualization software AMIRA (Mercury Computer Systems, Mérignac, France). As we previously demonstrated, Hsp90 dimer undergoes a Mg2+-dependent oligomerization process involving the C-terminal domain. Indeed, magnesium (i) induces a conformational change within the Hsp90 dimer, making it more compact and (ii) leads to the oligomerization process (27Garnier C. Barbier P. Devred F. Rivas G. Peyrot V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11770-11778Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hsp90 chaperone protein also self-oligomerizes under stress temperature (23Garnier C. Protasevich I. Gilli R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4133-4139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To compare these oligomerization processes, we performed parallel studies with native and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Native-PAGE analysis of Hsp90 preincubated in the presence of magnesium showed a major band for the dimer and very low intensity bands corresponding to oligomers (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Although magnesium induced an oligomerization process, these quaternary structures must be stabilized before native-PAGE. For this purpose we used EDC, a zero length cross-linker. When Hsp90 was cross-linked in the presence of magnesium, native-PAGE revealed a low intensity band for the Hsp90 dimer and at least three or more additional bands of higher molecular masses corresponding to magnesium-induced oligomers (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Heat-induced oligomers do not require cross-linking; we observed more heat shock-induced oligomeric species in this sample than magnesium-induced ones (Fig. 1A, lane 3). In fact, some bands were identical to the magnesium-induced oligomers, whereas other bands were of intermediate mass. The relative migrations of the dimer band (lanes 2 and 3) were slightly different from lane 1. For the Hsp90 sample heated for 30 s in the presence of magnesium, we observed a fast oligomerization process, with protein bands that remained at the top of the resolving gel. Increasing the incubation time did not reveal any protein bands on the native-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). As we previously reported, magnesium and temperature had a synergic effect on the Hsp90 oligomerization process (23Garnier C. Protasevich I. Gilli R. Tsvetkov P. Lobachov V. Peyrot V. Briand C. Makarov A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of Hsp90 showed only monomers (Fig. 1B, lane 1). When Hsp90 was cross-linked in the presence of magnesium, several bands were visualized, with two bands corresponding to the Hsp90 monomer and dimer, and three additional diffuse bands having higher molecular masses (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The presence of monomeric species under denaturing conditions indicated an incomplete cross-linking reaction; however, the reaction is sufficient to stabilize magnesium-induced oligomers under native conditions (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The SDS-PAGE analysis of the heated samples (with or without magnesium) showed only monomer species (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5). PAGE analyses clearly demonstrated that (i) cross-linking is necessary to stabilize Mg2+-induced oligomers and (ii) temperature induces"

The irregular nature of this capsid shell precludes direct atomic resolution structural analysis. CA hexamers and pentamers are the fundamental building blocks of the capsid, however the pentameric state, in particular, remains poorly characterized. We have developed an efficient in vitro protocol for studying the assembly of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) CA that involves mild acidification and produces structures modeling the authentic viral capsid. These structures include regular spherical particles with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry, built from CA pentamers alone. These particles were subject to cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image processing, and a pseudo-atomic model of the icosahedron was created by docking atomic structures of the constituent CA domains into the cryo-EM-derived three-dimensional density map. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of CA forms pentameric turrets, which decorate the surface of the icosahedron, while the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CA is positioned underneath, linking the pentamers. Biophysical analysis of the icosahedral particle preparation reveals that CA monomers and icosahedra are the only detectable species and that these exist in reversible equilibrium at pH 5. These same acidic conditions are known to promote formation of a RSV CA CTD dimer, present within the icosahedral particle, which facilitates capsid assembly.

CA reorganizes to form the external shell of the viral core, inside which the genomic RNA and the replicative enzymes of the virus are packaged. During the early stages of viral infection, the core is delivered into the cytoplasm of the host cell where uncoating of the core and reverse transcription take place (3Nisole S. Saïb A.

Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Kelly B.N. Hua Y. Whitby F.G. Stout C.D. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Yeager M. Cell. 2009; 137: 1282-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Given that the capsid cannot be closed with hexamers alone, it has been conjectured that capsid pentamers must exist to enable closure of the shell (24Li S. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. Finch J.T. Nature. 2000; 407: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 34Heymann J.B. Butan C. Winkler D.C. Craven R.C. Steven A.C. Comput. Math. Methods Med. 2008; 9: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Very recently, this notion received direct experimental support, through a cryo-EM study that visualized RSV CA pentamers within icosahedral assemblies, as well as the interactions between CA pentamers and hexamers (19Cardone G. Purdy J.G. Cheng N. Craven R.C. Steven A.C. Nature. 2009; 457: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Pentameric and hexameric CA rings are constructed through slight variation of essentially similar interfaces. Diversity in the positioning of the pentameric rings within the capsid, and in the intrinsic curvature of the hexagonally packed capsid surface, is now hypothesized to give rise to the observed differences in core morphology between the retroviral genera (19Cardone G. Purdy J.G. Cheng N. Craven R.C. Steven A.C. Nature. 2009; 457: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Pornillos O. Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Kelly B.N. Hua Y. Whitby F.G. Stout C.D.

Less is known about the intermolecular forces which help form and stabilize the capsid, and the pathways through which the capsid assembles. HIV-1 CA exists in a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium at neutral pH, with dimerization occurring via the CTD. In the presence of salt or crowding agent it can be induced to further assemble in vitro into tubular and conical structures, which resemble the viral core (20del Alamo M. Rivas G. Mateu M.G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14271-14281Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Ehrlich L.S. Agresta B.E. Carter C.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4874-4883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lanman J. Sexton J.

Nature. 2000; 407: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). RSV CA, in contrast, remains monomeric at neutral pH. It can however be induced to assemble in vitro either by mild acidification (18Bailey G.D. Hyun J.K. Mitra A.K. Kingston R.L. Structure. 2009; 17: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Kingston R.L. Fitzon-Ostendorp T. Eisenmesser E.Z. Schatz G.W. Vogt V.M. Post C.B. Rossmann M.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 617-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), or by the addition of anions such as phosphate (25Purdy J.G. Flanagan J.M. Ropson I.J. Craven R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 438-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Purdy J.G. Flanagan J.M. Ropson I.J. Rennoll-Bankert K.E. Craven R.C. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the case of mild acidification, the assembly products are a mixture of planar sheets composed purely of CA hexamers; “T = 1” icosahedra composed purely of CA pentamers; and Core-Like Particles (CLPs), which are inferred to contain both hexamers and pentamers (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The promotion of capsid assembly by acidification is understood in structural terms. Protonation of an aspartic acid residue within the CTD facilitates dimerization of CA (18Bailey G.D. Hyun J.K. Mitra A.K. Kingston R.L. Structure. 2009; 17: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which in turn drives higher-order capsid assembly (Fig. 1). Addition of sodium phosphate to RSV CA at neutral pH results in the formation of similar assembly products although the underlying mechanism is not completely defined. However, both proton-driven and phosphate-driven assembly of RSV CA seem to involve a nucleation step (18Bailey G.D. Hyun J.K. Mitra A.K. Kingston R.L. Structure. 2009; 17: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Purdy J.G. Flanagan J.M. Ropson I.J. Craven R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 438-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This also appears to be the case for in vitro assembly of HIV-1 CA (35Barklis E. Alfadhli A. McQuaw C. Yalamuri S. Still A. Barklis R.L. Kukull B. López C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 376-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The T = 1 icosahedron generated by mild acidification, and composed purely of RSV CA pentamers, is the subject of this study. We report a moderate resolution three-dimensional reconstruction, derived from cryo-EM images of such icosahedral particles. By docking known atomic structures of the NTD and CTD into the density map, a pseudo-atomic model of the icosahedron is constructed. Comparison with a model previously generated for the phosphate-assembled T = 1 icosahedral particles, shows that regardless of the conditions used to initiate assembly, there is a common structural outcome. Our structural model is consistent with the finding that proton-driven dimerization of the CTD facilitates capsid assembly. Biophysical characterization of the icosahedral particle preparation shows that assembly proceeds to completion once initiated, as only monomer and icosahedral can be detected in solution. These species exist in reversible equilibrium at pH 5. Additional experiments highlight the general importance of nucleation in initiating RSV capsid assembly in vitro. Full-length RSV CA (Prague C strain, GenbankTM Accession Number V01197) was produced by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as previously described (18Bailey G.D. Hyun J.K. Mitra A.K. Kingston R.L. Structure. 2009; 17: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Following purification the protein was dialyzed into a standard storage buffer (10 mm MOPS/KOH (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm sodium azide, 0.25 mm TCEP-HCl) and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated using UV absorption measurements at 280 nm (36Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar). In vitro assembly of RSV CA was initiated by transferring the protein into a high-salt, mildly acidic buffer. Sitting drop vapor diffusion, dialysis, and jump dilution were used for CA assembly. Among these methods, jump-dilution was used exclusively for the production of icosahedra, as this method was most efficient and reproducible. Typically, the assembly buffer (0.2 m citric acid/KOH (pH 4.9), 1.4 m NaCl) was added to an equal volume of CA solution (400–600 μm in standard storage buffer), followed by 2–3 h incubation at 18 °C (a 1:1 mixture of storage and assembly buffer has a pH of 5.0). Icosahedral particles could be efficiently separated from sheets and CLPs using differential centrifugation. Spinning the assembled material at 25,000 × g (15 min, 18 °C) in a benchtop centrifuge pelleted the larger assembly products. The supernatant, which we term the icosahedral particle preparation, was used for cryo-EM or biophysical analysis. For the CA nucleation experiment, the icosahedral particle preparation (in a 1:1 mixture of assembly and storage buffer) was first dialyzed into the storage buffer, and then mixed with unassembled CA, also in storage buffer. 2 μl of the icosahedral particle preparation (total [CA] = 34 μm) was mixed with 18 μl of the unassembled monomer (total [CA] = 547 μm). Control experiments were performed by using pure storage buffer in place of the icosahedral particle preparation. Following mixing, the solutions were incubated at 18 °C for 48 h before examination using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For routine TEM analysis, 5 μl of sample was applied onto a 300 mesh EM-grid covered with plastic-supported carbon film that was rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge in air and then negatively stained using 1.5% uranyl acetate. For cryo-EM of the T = 1 icosahedra, 5 μl of the icosahedral particle preparation was applied to a holey EM grid (Quantifoil R2/2) that had been rendered hydrophilic by glow discharging in the presence of n-amylamine. Vitrified specimens were prepared by using Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 4 °C and 90–100% relative humidity. Focal pairs with defocus values of ∼3.0 μm and 0.8 μm were imaged under minimal electron dose using a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope equipped with a Lab6 gun and operated at 120 kV. The images were recorded on SO-163 (Kodak) films at a nominal magnification of 42,000, and developed in D19 (Kodak) diluted 1:1 with deionized water for 10 min. Electron micrographs displaying minimal drift and astigmatism were digitized using Nikon LS-9000 film scanner at a step size 10.5 μm, which corresponded to 2.5 Å on the specimen. Unless otherwise specified, image processing was carried out using the Bsoft package (37Heymann J.B. J. Struct Biol. 2001; 133: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 38Heymann J.B. Belnap D.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Images of icosahedral particles were manually selected from high-defocused micrographs in Bshow, and then the location of the corresponding particles in the close-to-focus images were searched and extracted using Bmgalign and Bpick, respectively. The Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) was estimated for individual micrographs using Bshow, and then the particle images were phase-flipped using Bctf. Origin and orientation of particles in the low-defocused images were iteratively searched and the three-dimensional reconstruction was generated using PFT2 and EM3DR2 (39Baker T.S. Cheng R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 40Crowther R.A. Amos L.A. Finch J.T. De Rosier D.J. Klug A.

The resolution of the three-dimensional map was estimated using the 0.5 Fourier shell coefficient cutoff criterion (42Van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 95-100Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Atomic structures of the NTD (PDB ID code: 1EM9) and the low pH CTD dimer (PDB ID code: 3G21) from RSV CA were manually docked into the density ascribed to a CA monomer in the three-dimensional reconstruction using UCSF Chimera (43Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27343) Google Scholar). Initially, the NTD structure was placed into one of the five density volumes that protrude around the local 5-fold axis and then the CTD dimer was docked into the density linking neighboring pentameric rings at the local 2-fold axis. The docking was refined using Sculptor (44Wriggers W. Milligan R.A. McCammon J.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and the symmetrized, complete pseudo-atomic model for the icosahedron was generated using UROX (45Navaza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Alvarez-Rúa C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cross-correlation between the cryo-EM density map and the fitted x-ray structures were calculated in Sculptor. The image reconstruction and pseudo-atomic model have been deposited in the EM Data Bank (entry code: EMD-1710). Small zone size exclusion chromatography was performed using an Äkta purifier (GE Healthcare). Icosahedral particle preparations (500 μl; total [CA] 47 μm) were injected onto a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 1:1 mixture of assembly buffer and storage buffer. The column was calibrated using protein standards (Sigma) in 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. Injections of tobacco Mosaic virus and l-tyrosine were used to estimate the void volume (V0) and included volume (Vi) of the column. All chromatography runs were carried out at 5.5 °C, with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Elution of proteins was monitored by following UV absorbance at 280 nm. Distribution coefficients (σ) for all proteins were calculated from elution volumes (Ve) as σ = (Ve − V0)/Vi (46Ackers G.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 343-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The Hydrodynamic radii of the protein standards were calculated from the published translational diffusion coefficients using the Stokes-Einstein relationship (supplemental Table S1) and a linear calibration plot was constructed (cube root of the distribution coefficient versus hydrodynamic radius) (47Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 48Winzor D.J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2003; 56: 15-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This plot was used to estimate the sizes of the species present in the icosahedral particle preparation. All dynamic light scattering measurements were made at a wavelength of 831.1 nm using a Dynapro Titan (Wyatt Technology). Before data collection, solutions were filtered (0.2 μm) and spun at high speed (25,000 × g) in a bench top centrifuge to remove dust and other particulate matter. Intensity Autocorrelation Functions (ACFs) were measured for both unassembled CA (in storage buffer) and icosahedral particle preparations (in a 1:1 mixture of storage buffer and assembly buffer). ACFs were also recorded for the buffer solutions alone, to detect any correlated light scattering by the buffer components. All samples were maintained at 18 °C during the data collection. For unassembled CA, measurements were made using protein solutions of varying concentration (40–670 μm). The normalized ACFs, G(τ), were fitted using Equation 1 appropriate for scattering of non-interacting protein molecules of fixed size (49Finsy R. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 1994; 52: 79-143Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 50Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Benedek G.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 299: 153-174PubMed Google Scholar),G(τ)=1+A2exp(−2q2Dτ)(Eq. 1) using non-linear least squares methods. This yielded estimates for the translational diffusion coefficient (D). Here τ is the decay time, A is a constant dependent on the experimental conditions, and q = (4πn)/λ)sin(θ/2) is the length of the scattering vector, which is a function of the solvent refractive index n, the wavelength of the incident light λ, and the scattering angle θ. At each protein concentration, several hundred ACFs were accumulated and analyzed. Linear extrapolation of the mean, apparent D to infinite protein dilution (51Xu R. Particle Characterization: Light Scattering Methods. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000Google Scholar) was then used to estimate the true translational diffusion coefficient (D0) of unassembled CA. The hydrodynamic radius (RH) of unassembled CA was then calculated from D0 using the Stokes-Einstein relationship. For the icosahedral particle preparations, measurements were made on solutions with a total [CA] = 47 μm. Normalized ACFs were fitted with a generalization of Equation 2, appropriate when there are several non-interacting species of fixed size present in solution (49Finsy R. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 1994; 52: 79-143Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 50Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Benedek G.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 299: 153-174PubMed Google Scholar).G(τ)=1+(∑i=1i=mAiexp(−q2Diτ))(Eq. 2) Associated with each scattering species i, are two model parameters Ai and Di. To account for weak correlated light scattering from the buffer, a 3 species model was fitted (2 CA species plus buffer), fixing the diffusion coefficient (D) for the buffer contribution, and allowing only the corresponding amplitude (A) to vary. It is the very disparate sizes of the scattering species, which enable straightforward application of Equation 2. The appropriate value for the buffer diffusion coefficient was determined from measurements made on the buffer alone. Several thousand individual ACFs were analyzed to derive the mean reported model parameters. This analysis ignores any chemical exchange between the scattering species (i.e. monomer and icosahedra), and also assumes that the species diffuse independently (i.e. that their diffusion is uncoupled, and all cross-diffusion coefficients are negligible (see Annunziata et al. (52Annunziata O. Buzatu D. Albright J.G. Langmuir. 2005; 21: 12085-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for discussion). Quantitative interpretation of the DLS data required that the refractive index, kinematic viscosity, and density of all buffers be determined at 18 °C (supplemental Table S2). Buffer refractive index at 831.1 nm was measured using a critical angle digital refractometer (Schmidt and Haensch DSR-λ). Kinematic viscosity was measured using a Cannon-Ubbelohde viscometer (Cannon Instrument Corporation). Buffer density was measured using a Gay-Lussac specific gravity bottle (Wilmad-Labglass) and a standard mass balance (Sartorius CPA225D), making the required corrections for air buoyancy (53Battino R. Williamson A.G. J. Chem. Ed. 1984; 61: 51-52Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The expected hydrodynamic radius of monomeric CA was calculated based on the atomic model using the precise boundary element method of Aragon and Hahn (54Aragon S. Hahn D.K. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1591-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as implemented in t"

Although hyperoxic and hypoxic stresses have been well characterized, little is known about cellular functions in the oxygen levels commonly found in vivo. Here, we show that p53-dependent apoptosis in response to different DNA-damaging agents was reduced when normal and cancer cells were cultured at physiological oxygen tensions instead of the usual atmospheric levels. Different from what has been described in hypoxia, this was neither determined by decreases in p53 induction or its transactivation activity, nor by differences in the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species. At these physiological oxygen levels, we found a constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK in all the models studied. Inhibition of this signaling pathway reversed the protective effect in some but not all cell lines. We conclude that a stress-independent constitutive activation of prosurvival pathways, including but probably not limited to MAPK, can protect cells in physiological oxygen tensions against genotoxic stress. Our results underscore the need of considering the impact of oxygen levels present in the tissue microenvironment when studying cell sensitivity to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Our results underscore the need of considering the impact of oxygen levels present in the tissue microenvironment when studying cell sensitivity to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Changes in oxygen levels are known to affect the life span of cultured cells. Oxygen tensions above atmospheric levels (20–21% O2, ∼160 mm Hg) can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis (1Bhandari V. Choo-Wing R. Lee C.G. Zhu Z. Nedrelow J.H. Chupp G.L. Zhang X.

Saretzki G. Döcke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). On the other hand, severe reductions in oxygen availability (hypoxia) also have cytotoxic effects (3Chandel N.S. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Schumacker P.T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3840-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although oxygenated arterial blood contains 10–12% O2 (4Steurer J. Hoffmann U. Dür P. Russi E. Vetter W. Respiration. 1997; 64: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), healthy tissues normally have a lower partial pressure of oxygen (3–6% O2, ∼20–40 mm Hg), with no apparent toxicity for cells (5Hall E.J. Giaccia A.J. Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2005: 89Google Scholar). Interestingly, mouse fibroblasts cultured at these physiological oxygen tensions proliferate better than cells at atmospheric conditions because of a reduction in oxidative stress and DNA damage (6Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Human diploid fibroblasts also show longer replicative life spans at oxygen concentrations that mimic those normally found in vivo (7Saito H. Hammond A.T. Moses R.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All of this suggests that low oxygen levels are beneficial for cells as long as they remain above the threshold of severe hypoxia and highlights the importance of studying cells in environments that are similar to those found in live tissues in the absence of stress or disease. In that regard, the responses to DNA damage at physiological oxygen levels have been insufficiently characterized. The importance of oxygen availability in these processes is underscored by the fact that in hypoxic stress, tumor suppressor p53 is up-regulated (3Chandel N.S. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B.

Also, hypoxic cells are known to be more resistant to damage because of a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) 6The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesERK1/2extracellular signal-regulated kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterPIpropidium iodideDCFdichlorofluorescin diacetatefpgformamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylaseGygray. generation (13Cuisnier O.

IMR90 expressing a dominant negative p53 (IMR90 DNp53) were obtained using a R248W mutant of p53 subcloned with BamHI/AscI into a pBABE vector, as described (15Mahale A.M. Khan Z.A. Igarashi M. Nanjangud G.J. Qiao R.F. Yao S. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, amphotropic virus stocks were generated by transient cotransfection of 293T cells with 5 μg of the retroviral construct and 5 μg of pCL ampho packaging plasmid. Culture fluids were collected and filtered 48 h later, and stocks with titers of >105 selectable marker units were used for infections of IMR90 fibroblasts. Doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich) and/or U0126 (Promega) were added to the medium and were not removed until analysis was performed or when medium was changed, as specified in the text. For UV treatments, medium was removed, and cells were kept under a UV lamp for a total of 50 mJ/cm2. Incubations at 5% O2 were performed in a Sanyo MCO-5 M cell incubator. Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was achieved by transfecting On-Target plus SMARTpool small interfering RNA MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 (Thermo Scientific). Small interfering RNA against luciferase was used as control. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection, following the manufacturer's protocols. Fluorescent-stained cells were transferred to polystyrene tubes with cell strainer caps (Falcon) and subjected to FACS (BD Biosciences FACSCalibur or FACSCanto II) using Cell Quest 3.2 or FACSDiva 6.0 software (BD Biosciences) for acquisition and analysis. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI), using the CycleTEST Plus DNA reagent kit (BD Biosciences), following instructions provided by manufacturer. Other cells were stained with the annexin V-Fluos staining kit (Roche Applied Science) following instructions provided by manufacturer. Cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml of dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF) (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and collected in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline followed by FACS analysis. Values of mean fluorescence intensity were reported. Cells were stained with an OxyDNA assay kit (Calbiochem) following the manufacturer's instructions to detect the presence of 8-oxoguanine in DNA. Alternatively, relative levels of oxidative purine base damage were monitored using the human formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (fpg) comet assay as described previously (16Duarte T.L. Cooke M.S. Jones G.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After lysis, the slides were washed once with distilled water and immersed in three changes of enzyme digestion buffer (40 mm HEPES, 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 8.0)), for 5 min each time, at room temperature. Fpg (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the gel (50 μl/gel) at 1/500 or 1/1000 dilutions; gels were covered with a coverslip and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 30 min. The coverslips were removed, and the slides were placed in a horizontal electrophoresis tank. DNA damage was expressed as the percentage of DNA in the comet tails. The vector for lentiviral transcriptional enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter has been described previously (17Akiri G. Cherian M.M. Vijayakumar S. Liu G. Bafico A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, three copies of p53-responsive element of mouse MDM2 gene were synthesized and ligated into a modified lentiviral vector using MluI and NheI. The sequence of p53-responsive element used is 5′-GGTCAAGTTGGGACACGTCC-3′. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 30 mm Na4P2O7, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate disodium salt hydrate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were then determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of total cell protein/sample was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protean nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell). An ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. p53 was detected with the 1801 antibody, p21 with the Ab-1 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research), MAPK and Thr202/Tyr204-phosphorylated MAPK were measured with polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling). Levels of β-actin (measured with clone AC-15 monoclonal antibody from Sigma) were used as loading controls. To study cellular responses to genotoxic stress in physiological oxygen conditions, we exposed wild type p53-containing HCT116 colon cancer cells to doxorubicin, UV or ionizing radiation, and immediately incubated them at 20% or 5% O2. 5% O2 was selected for being an oxygen tension commonly found in vivo that does not induce a hypoxic stress response (5Hall E.J. Giaccia A.J. Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2005: 89Google Scholar). Indeed, untreated cells did not show any significant change in cell cycle profile or survival after 48 h at 5% O2 (Fig. 1A), indicating that this oxygen concentration did not impair basic cell physiology. Of note, we found significantly more dead cells in response to all damaging agents in cultures at 20% than in those at 5% O2 (Fig. 1A). This effect was reproducible with lower concentrations of doxorubicin (supplemental Fig. 1A). We further investigated this result using an annexin V/PI staining, which is specific for detecting apoptosis (18Aubry J.P. Blaecke A. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Jeannin P. Herbault N. Caron G. Moine V. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cytometry. 1999; 37: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, there was a higher percentage of annexin-positive cells at 20% O2 after exposure to UV radiation, indicating that the cell death observed was due to apoptosis and confirming that it was much lower at physiological oxygen tensions. Similar results were obtained after treatment with different doxorubicin concentrations (supplemental Fig. 1B). We observed that this antiapoptotic effect was not dependent on preincubation of cells at 5% O2 because a similar protection could be observed regardless of the amount of time that cells were equilibrated before treatment (supplemental Fig. 1, A and C). Next, we extended our findings using other human cell lines. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2A, the reduction in cell death was also observed in IMR90 diploid fibroblasts, U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and MCF7 breast cancer cells, indicating that this phenomenon is likely common in both normal and cancer cells. Of note, all of these cells expressed wild type p53. Cells lacking a functional p53 were more resistant to DNA damage than their isogenic counterparts, as expected (supplemental Fig. 3). When death was eventually induced, no differences could be observed at 5% O2, suggesting that p53-independent mechanisms of cell death were not affected by changes in oxygen levels. Finally, we found that cells exposed to doxorubicin were able to form more colonies at 5% O2 than 20% O2 (Fig. 1, C and D), confirming the prosurvival effect of the lower oxygen tension. Of note, colonies at 5% O2 were bigger in average, suggesting a growth advantage consistent with previous reports (6Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 7Saito H. Hammond A.T. Moses R.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that physiological oxygen environments have a protective effect against p53-mediated apoptosis in response to damage compared with atmospheric oxygen levels and that this occurs both in normal and cancer cells. It has been reported that hypoxia can interfere with p53 transactivation properties (19Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P. Hoffman W. Murphy M. Derr J. Taya Y. Lowe S.W. Kastan M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We reasoned that physiological oxygen tensions could have a similar effect, which could explain the decrease in apoptosis. However, we found that levels of induced p53 were not affected by oxygen tensions in HCT116 or the wild type p53 colon cancer RKO cell line (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, expression of different p53 target genes did not vary either (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that p53 activity was not affected. This was further confirmed using a fluorescent reporter with a p53-responsive element, which showed comparable activation after damage at 20 and 5% O2 (Fig. 2C). Similar results were observed in normal fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. 4). We concluded that variations in the induction or the activity of p53 after DNA damage were not responsible for the reduction in apoptosis observed at 5% O2, which further stresses the differences between physiologically low oxygen tensions and hypoxia. UV, ionizing radiation, and doxorubicin induce ROS, which greatly contribute to their toxic effects (20Latonen L. Laiho M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 71-89PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kurz E.U.

UV-treated fibroblasts show reduced levels of oxidation and apoptosis when cultured at 5% O2 (14Matsuda N. Horikawa M. Wang L.H. Yoshida M. Okaichi K. Okumura Y. Watanabe M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and squamous cell carcinomas have lower intracellular ROS levels in response to radiation (13Cuisnier O. Serduc R. Lavieille J.P. Longuet M. Reyt E. Riva C. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1033-1041PubMed Google Scholar). Also, murine fibroblasts maintained at 3% O2 have fewer oxidative lesions in their DNA than cells cultured at 20% (6Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). All of this suggests that the protection against apoptosis we observed could be dependent on a diminished induction of ROS after damage. To test this possibility, we stained HCT116 cells with DCF, a marker of accumulation of cellular oxidants (24Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). There were no statistically significant differences in ROS levels after ionizing radiation between cells at 20 and 5% O2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Basal ROS were also comparable (Fig. 3A). To confirm these results further, we used a fluorescent probe that binds to 8-oxoguanine in the DNA, a specific marker of oxidative DNA damage and thus an indirect measure of intracellular ROS accumulation. As shown in Fig. 3C, there were no significant differences in cells cultured at 20% or 5% O2, either before or after treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Finally, a fpg comet assay, which measures both strand breaks and oxidatively damaged purine base lesions in the DNA, also showed no differences before or after exposure to doxorubicin (Fig. 3D). These results together prove that physiological oxygen environments do not reduce basal or damage-induced intracellular ROS levels in HCT116 under the conditions explored and rule out a mechanism of cellular protection in these cells based on hampering ROS increases and the ensuing DNA damage that they cause. p53-dependent apoptosis is ameliorated by prosurviving signals such as MAPK (25Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which can be induced in low oxygen conditions (26Minet E. Arnould T. Michel G. Roland I. Mottet D. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We reasoned that activation of the MAPK pathway could be contributing to a reduction in cell death responses at 5% O2. We explored this hypothesis by measuring phosphorylation of MAPK (ERK1/2) in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Consistent with previous reports (14Matsuda N. Horikawa M. Wang L.H. Yoshida M. Okaichi K. Okumura Y. Watanabe M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), MAPK phosphorylation increased due to DNA damage (Fig. 4A). However, we could also observe an increase in MAPK phosphorylation in the absence of any stress in both normal and cancer cells cultured at 5% O2 (Fig. 4A; see also supplemental Fig. 5D). The levels of activated MAPK after treatment were also proportionally higher in 5% than in 20% O2. These data show a constitutive activation of MAPK in cells cultured at physiological oxygen tensions and suggest that this prosurvival pathway could interfere with the induction of apoptosis. To test this possibility, we blocked MAPK activation in HCT116 with the specific chemical inhibitor U0126 (27Duncia J.V. Santella III, J.B. Higley C.A. Pitts W.J. Wityak J. Frietze W.E. Rankin F.W. Sun J.H. Earl R.A. Tabaka A.C. Teleha C.A. Blom K.F. Favata M.F. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Horiuchi K. Copeland R.A. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. Magolda R.L. Trainor G.L. Wexler R.R. Hobbs F.W. Olson R.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2839-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We found that this abrogated the protective effects of 5% O2 after treatment with doxorubicin (Fig. 4B). As reported previously (25Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), MAPK inhibition also increased p53-induced apoptosis in cells cultured at atmospheric oxygen tensions. Of note, although MAPK phosphorylation was completely blocked, expression of p53 and p21 was not affected (Fig. 4, C and D). Because U0126 could, in principle, induce nonspecific inhibitions of other kinase pathways, we also suppressed MAPK phosphorylation using small interfering RNA against the upstream kinase, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK). This similarly reversed the antiapoptotic effect of 5% O2 in HCT116 (supplemental Fig. 5, A and B). However, repression of MAPK phosphorylation was not sufficient to restore cell death in U2OS cells cultured at 5% O2 (supplemental Fig. 5, C and D). Of note, chemical inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation in these cells was not as complete as that observed in HCT116. These results together show that the resistance to DNA damage in HCT116 when cultured at physiological oxygen tensions depends on MAPK activation. This is likely to be determined by cell context because other cell lines did not respond similarly. Finally, to assess the importance of MAPK in the increased cell growth observed at 5% O2 (6Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 7Saito H. Hammond A.T. Moses R.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1, C and D) we performed a colony formation assay in the presence of the MAPK inhibitor. As shown in supplemental Fig. 6, the increase in colony size observed at 5% O2 was suppressed in the absence of MAPK activity. Of note, the inhibitor equally diminished the number of colonies that could be formed at 20 and 5% O2. These results indicate that the growth advantage of cells cultured at physiologic oxygen tensions in HCT116 is also dependent on MAPK signaling. Human tissues are normally exposed to a range of low oxygen concentrations (5Hall E.J. Giaccia A.J. Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2005: 89Google Scholar, 28Hammond E.M. Denko N.C. Dorie M.J. Abraham R.T. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1834-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), most of them insufficient to elicit a cytotoxic stress. These conditions are often overlooked because cell culture studies are generally performed at atmospheric oxygen tensions. Thus, although hypoxic stress has been thoroughly studied, little is known about cell physiology in the most common in vivo oxygen tensions. We analyzed the influence of oxygen in the response of normal and cancer cells to different DNA-damaging agents. Our results underscore the impact that normal microenvironmental oxygen levels have on cellular functions and stress the importance of taking them into account when studying genotoxic stresses. We compared the toxic effects of a chemotherapeutic compound and radiation on cells cultured at atmospheric (20%) and physiological (5%) oxygen tensions. We uncovered substantially different responses. Normal and cancer cells were more resistant to p53-induced apoptosis when cultured at physiological oxygen tensions, and this was independent of changes in protein levels or transcriptional activity of p53. Our data are consistent with previous reports showing that 5% O2 can delay DNA fragmentation in calcium-mediated apoptosis (29Stefanelli C. Stanic I. Bonavita F. Muscari C. Pignatti C. Rossoni C. Caldarera C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is, however, the opposite of what has been described in hypoxia, in which p53 expression is induced while simultaneously its transactivation functions are suppressed (11Achison M. Hupp T.R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3431-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Hammond E.M. Giaccia A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Importantly, these results show that a reduction of oxygen up to 5% does not trigger the stress pathways activated in hypoxia in the models tested, inducing a previously uncharacterized prosurvival response instead. It has been proposed that cells at physiological oxygen tensions have a lower level of oxidative damage after exposure to toxic agents (6Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 13Cuisnier O. Serduc R. Lavieille J.P. Longuet M. Reyt E. Riva C. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1033-1041PubMed Google Scholar, 14Matsuda N. Horikawa M. Wang L.H. Yoshida M. Okaichi K. Okumura Y. Watanabe M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, we did not observe any change in basal or induced intracellular ROS levels or the subsequent oxidative damage to DNA in the models studied. Our data are consistent with the fact that very drastic reductions in oxygen availability (<0.22%) are required to interfere biochemically with the generation of oxygen radicals in response to damaging agents such as ionizing radiation (5Hall E.J. Giaccia A.J. Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2005: 89Google Scholar). This suggests that although microenviromental oxygen reductions may hinder ROS generation in some tissues, they do not play a role in others. Our results indicate that these tissues are nevertheless protected from genotoxic stress. The reasons for this protection still need to be fully elucidated. We observed that culturing cells at 5% O2 induced ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation in normal and cancer cells, even in the absence of any damage. The prosurvival and antiapoptotic effects of MAPK are well known. For instance, we have shown that p53 itself can activate MAPK and that this compensates the induction of apoptosis (25Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation suppressed the prosurvival effects of 5% O2 in HCT116, confirming that the MAPK pathway participates in blocking apoptosis in these cells. This effect was not observed in other cell lines tested. This could be in part explained by the difficulty of inhibiting MAPK phosphorylation in some cells. However, it is likely that cell-specific factors determine the involvement of the 5% O2-dependent MAPK activation in protecting against apoptosis. For instance, HCT116 has a ras mutation in codon 13 (30Schroy III, P.C. Brown-Shimer S. Kim K. Johnson K.A. Murnane M.J. Yang S. O'Brien M.J. Carney W.P. Kupchik H.Z. Cancer. 1995; 76: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that could determine their dependence on MAPK signaling. Other prosurvivals factors that may be constitutively activated at physiological oxygen tensions need to be investigated to understand what factors may contribute to the effect in other cell lines. Moreover, the mechanisms by which physiological oxygen tensions trigger MAPK signaling and maybe other prosurvival pathways are not yet clear. Hypoxia results in MAPK activation in certain models (31Jeong H.J. Kim J.B. Hong S.H. An N.H. Kim M.S. Park B.R. Park R.K. Kim H.M. J.

Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that in some tissues MAPK could be closely involved in prosurvival signaling when oxygen is reduced. This opens new avenues of research that fall beyond the scope of this study and will be explored in the future. 5% is a concentration of oxygen frequently found in vivo (12Hammond E.M. Giaccia A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34Chow D.C. Wenning L.A. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Biophys.

In other studies it has been considered to induce a hypoxic stress (13Cuisnier O. Serduc R. Lavieille J.P. Longuet M. Reyt E. Riva C. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1033-1041PubMed Google Scholar, 14Matsuda N. Horikawa M. Wang L.H. Yoshida M. Okaichi K. Okumura Y. Watanabe M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We showed that it is insufficiently low to induce damage in the models we tested. Moreover, it increased cell survival and growth. It is possible that these oxygen conditions, although not toxic, may be slightly below the metabolic needs, prompting the constitutive induction of prosurvival mechanisms that would help the cells adapt to the environment. Thus, cells in physiologically low oxygen tensions would have a survival advantage when exposed to damage compared with those in environments richer in oxygen. On the other hand, they could also be more sensitive to transformation because tumor suppressor mechanisms are not as efficient at removing damaged cells. The present study provides novel insights on how cells from different tissues react to chemicals and radiation and what defines their specific sensitivity to toxic agents. Our data are especially relevant in colon cancers with Ras activation, such as those represented by HCT116. This could be important to explain the increased resistance of some cells to certain drugs or their susceptibility to oncogenic processes, thus opening the possibility of designing improved therapies to cancer and other diseases.

As a key factor in melanosomal biogenesis, understanding intracellular trafficking and processing of Pmel17 is of central importance to comprehend how these organelles are formed, how they mature, and how they function in the cell. Using a series of deletion and missense mutants of Pmel17, we are able to show that the integrity of the junction between the N-terminal region and the polycystic kidney disease-like domain is highly crucial for endoplasmic reticulum export, subcellular targeting, and fibril formation by Pmel17 and thus for establishing functional melanosomes.

Through maturation of its oligosaccharides, P1 is converted into the larger (120 kDa) P2 form that enters the trans-Golgi network and from there migrates (directly or via the plasma membrane) to stage I melanosomes (7Raposo G. Marks M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These are a specialized set of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) destined to later develop into the mature pigment-storing organelles (8Raposo G. Marks M.S. Traffic. 2002; 3: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therein Pmel17 is transferred to intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) via budding into the interior of the MVB (9Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3451-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), a step thought to be essential for subsequent cleavage of P2 into an N-terminal 90-kDa Mα fragment and a C-terminal membrane-standing 28-kDa Mβ fragment (10Theos A.C.

This cleavage, carried out by a yet unidentified furin-like proprotein convertase (pPC) is essential for fibril formation (11Berson J.F. Theos A.C. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. J.

A subsequent membrane-proximal cleavage of Mβ by a metalloprotease of the a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family eventually releases the lumenal Mα fragment from the ILV surface (12Kummer M.P.

The organization of domains within Pmel17 has recently been described, and the first steps have been undertaken to investigate their function in the molecule. In particular, all three large domains within Mα (namely the N-terminal region (NTR, ∼aa 22–210), the polycystic kidney disease-like domain (PKD, ∼aa 211–293), and the repeat domain (RPT, ∼aa 314–424) (see Fig. 1A)) are essential for fibril formation (10Theos A.C.

Pmel17 lacking either of these domains fails to accumulate in LAMP1/LAMP2-containing organelles when transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells but rather localizes to early endosomes (10Theos A.C.

Interestingly, although targeting of Pmel17 to MVBs is normal, its delivery from the limiting membrane to ILVs appears to be impaired when either the NTR or the PKD domain is missing (10Theos A.C.

This may underlie the observed subcellular sorting defect of the respective mutants. To allow a more detailed mapping of the sorting requirements, we constructed a series of deletion and missense mutants of Pmel17 where either the whole NTR or only a small region at the NTR-PKD domain boundary is affected. These were stably expressed in the Pmel17-negative melanoma cell line LG2-MEL-220 (Mel220) (15Vigneron N. Ooms A. Morel S. Ma W. Degiovanni G. Van den Eynde B.J. Tissue Antigens. 2005; 65: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier reports (10Theos A.C. Truschel S.T. Tenza D. Hurbain I. Harper D.C. Berson J.F. Thomas P.C.

Interestingly, a mutant with a smaller deletion (Δ190–208) completely fails to get released from the ER and a very similar, albeit slightly milder defect is also observed with three Pmel17 missense mutants, all affected in the same region close to the NTR-PKD domain boundary. The subset of these mutants with the slightly milder phenotype can eventually leave the ER, albeit at an extremely slow rate and only to a very low extent. Interestingly, these mutants nevertheless largely accumulate in LAMP1-positive compartments over time and they do so to levels comparable with wild-type Pmel17 (wt-Pmel17). We use these mutants to demonstrate that an intact NTR-PKD domain boundary is also necessary beyond efficient ER release for proper subcellular targeting and fibril formation. Hence, this region within Pmel17 is crucial for the function of the polypeptide and thus for melanosome biogenesis. LG2-MEL-220 (Mel220), a human Pmel17-deficient melanoma cell line (15Vigneron N.

We consider HMB50 and NKI-beteb to be conformation-specific antibodies, because they only work in applications where folded protein is to be detected (immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and immunoprecipitation), whereas denatured protein in a Western blot format is not recognized (21Yasumoto K.

Moreover, thermal denaturation completely abrogates reactivity of Pmel17 with either of these antibodies (data not shown).

All pBMN vectors containing mutant or wild-type Pmel17 were sequenced from both directions before retroviral transduction into Mel220 cells (24Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Mel220 transfectants expressing wild-type or mutant Pmel17 were selected in medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks, and expression of Pmel17 was assessed by Western blot. Levels of expression of wt-Pmel17 in Mel220 transfectants were compared with endogenous Pmel17 expression in a derivative of the melanoma cell line buf1280 (25Seliger B. Ritz U. Abele R. Bock M. Tampé R. Sutter G. Drexler I. Huber C. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8647-8650PubMed Google Scholar) and found to be ∼2-fold higher (supplemental Fig. S1). Mel220 transfectants were seeded overnight on glass coverslips. The next day, cells were washed with PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBS+/+) and fixed with 2% formaldehyde (15 min at room temperature). After quenching with PBS+/+/10 mm glycine followed by a wash with PBS+/+/0.5% bovine serum albumin, cells were permeabilized for 1h in staining buffer (PBS+/+/0.5% bovine serum albumin/0.5% saponin). Staining was performed in a humidity chamber for 1 h with the indicated primary antibodies at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer or 1:50 for 148.3, 1:100 for HMB50, and 1:35 for Clyde. After three washes with staining buffer, Alexa647- and Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were applied at a 1:100 dilution in the same buffer, before cells were washed again three times, mounted in ProLong Gold reagent (Invitrogen), and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using a TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). For quantification of differences in the subcellular distribution patterns of LAMP1- and Pmel17 we first rotated the respective immunofluorescence pictures in a way that the nucleus of the shown cell points to one side (right or left), whereas the bulk of perinuclear LAMP1-fluorescence points to the other side as schematically depicted in supplemental Fig. S3A. We then determined the vertically averaged pixel intensity for every position along the x axis using the Plot Profile function of the image processing software ImageJ 1.41o (National Institutes of Health) and exported the respective histogram data to Microsoft Excel 2004 (Microsoft). There, the histograms for LAMP1 and Pmel17 staining were independently normalized to fit a range from 0 (lowest observed fluorescence intensity) to 100 (highest observed fluorescence intensity) before they were subtracted from each other in every position along the x axis. The absolute values of the respective differences were added and finally divided by the total number of pixels along the x axis. We named the resulting value “average difference” between the LAMP1 and Pmel17 distributions. Flow cytometry using surface or intracellularly labeled cells was performed as described previously (26Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5104-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Leonhardt R.M. Lee S.J. Kavathas P.B. Cresswell P.

All data were acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo 6.4.7 software (Tree Star). For conventional Epon embedding of cell samples, Mel220 transfectants were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (NaCaCo buffer), for 30 min at room temperature followed by another 30 min in the same fixative solution at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were rinsed with NaCaCo buffer and further processed as described (28Carrithers M.D. Chatterjee G. Carrithers L.M. Offoha R. Iheagwara U. Rahner C. Graham M. Waxman S.G. J. Biol.

For cryo-immunoelectron microscopy, samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by another 15 min in the same fixative solution at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were rinsed with PBS and further processed as described (28Carrithers M.D. Chatterjee G. Carrithers L.M. Offoha R. Iheagwara U. Rahner C. Graham M. Waxman S.G. J. Biol.

For immunolabeling cells were stained with Pmel17-specific antibody HMB50 at 1:25 followed by gold-anti-mouse conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For embedding of cell samples in LR-gold resin (London Resin Gold), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde/2% sucrose in 0.1 m HEPES buffer for 30 min at room temperature followed by another 90 min in the same fixative solution, but lacking glutaraldehyde at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were rinsed with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl/100 mm glycine/3% sucrose for 15 min to quench free aldehydes, scraped in 1% gelatin, and transferred to 5% agar. Once set, samples were placed in 0.5% tannic acid in 0.1 m HEPES for 30 min, rinsed twice in Tris/50 mm maleate/3% sucrose (sucrose-maleate buffer), and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in sucrose-maleate buffer. Samples were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (50% to 95%) at −20 °C and embedded in LR-gold resin (EMS) at −20 °C. For immunolabeling, cells were stained with Pmel17-specific antibody HMB50 at 1:10 followed by gold-anti-mouse conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Samples were viewed using an FEI Tencai Biotwin transmission electron microscope at 80 Kv. Images were taken using Morada CCD and iTEM (Olympus) software. Mel220 cells expressing wild-type Pmel17 or construct Δ190–208 were treated overnight with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) or were left untreated, before mRNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the First Strand Synthesis kit (Stratagene) in combination with Oligo(dT) primers. XBP-1 was amplified using primer pair 5′-CCTTGTAGTTGAGAACCAGG-3′/5′-GGGGCTTGGTATATATGTGG-3′ (29Zheng Y. Gao B. Ye L. Kong L. Jing W. Yang X. Wu Z. Ye L. J. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 529-536PubMed Google Scholar) in a standard Taq-driven PCR (annealing temperature, 50 °C/40 cycles), and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was assessed by monitoring the presence of the spliced, PstI-resistant form (indicating UPR induction) versus the unspliced, PstI-sensitive form (indicating absence of UPR induction) of XBP-1. Radiolabeling was performed as described (26Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5104-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 107 starved Mel220 cells expressing Pmel17 derivatives were pulse-labeled at 37 °C with [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 0.5 mCi/ml in 1.5 ml for 30 min and subsequently chased in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium/10% fetal calf serum containing an excess of cold l-methionine/l-cysteine (both at 0.45 mg/ml) for up to 4 h. Following this, cells were harvested and frozen at −80 °C until the next day. For immunoprecipitation antibody HMB50 was first covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose and stored at 4 °C (26Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5104-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were thawed, lysed in 2% Triton X-100 (containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) at 107 cells/ml, and precleared using protein A-Sepharose beads. Subsequently, the supernatant was applied to the HMB50-coupled beads, and immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (26Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5104-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After separation of immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE, gels were dried, exposed to PhosphorImager screens, and analyzed with ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting was carried out as described (26Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5104-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We used the prestained marker mix Seablue Plus 2 (Invitrogen) for estimation of protein molecular weights in gels. Because this prestained marker mix displayed an inaccurate running behavior in the big gel system employed (PROTEAN II xi cell with 20 cm long gels, Bio-Rad), we recalibrated the bands using proteins of known molecular mass as standards (TPP2, 135 kDa; Grp94, 94 kDa; TAP1, 70 kDa; calreticulin, 57 kDa; and HLA-A2, 42 kDa). The recalibrated marker bands are shown in the figures. Both the NTR and the PKD domain of Pmel17 have been implicated in subcellular targeting of the polypeptide to ILVs in stage I melanosomes (10Theos A.C. Truschel S.T. Tenza D. Hurbain I. Harper D.C.

However, which of the one or more subregions within the ∼270-aa stretch encompassing the two domains mediates this effect is unknown. Yet, because this sorting defect has so far only been described in transient overexpression systems employing the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa, we first decided to examine whether it would also be observed in melanoma cells. These cells may provide a more native environment (e.g. with regard to repertoires of ER chaperones or pPCs present), in which Pmel17 is normally expressed and functional. To this end, we constructed a Pmel17 deletion mutant lacking the NTR (Δ28–208) (Fig. 1A) (hereinafter ΔNTR) and stably expressed it in the Pmel17-deficient melanoma cell line LG2-MEL-220 (Mel220) (15Vigneron N. Ooms A. Morel S. Ma W. Degiovanni G. Van den Eynde B.J. Tissue Antigens. 2005; 65: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression was confirmed by Western blot using antibody Pep13h (Fig. 1B, left panel), which recognizes newly synthesized Pmel17, but not mature fibrils (19Harper D.C. Theos A.C. Herman K.E. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2307-2322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Raposo G. Tenza D. Murphy D.M. Berson J.F. Marks M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). ΔNTR appeared to undergo pPC-mediated cleavage as judged by the detection of Mβ (Fig. 1B, left panel) and Mα (Fig. 1B, right panel) fragments, but did not give rise to the set of fibrillogenic fragments reactive with antibody HMB45 (Fig. 1B, right panel), suggesting that it represents a loss-of-function mutant. Levels of Mβ and Mα were lower at steady state when compared with wt-Pmel17, indicating either reduced rate of cleavage or enhanced degradation of the ΔNTR-derived cleavage products. To distinguish between these two possibilities we performed a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 1C). If anything, conversion of P2 into Mα and Mβ occurred with more rapid kinetics for ΔNTR than for wt-Pmel17 as shown by both faster decay of P2 and earlier appearance of its cleavage products (Fig. 1C, see bottom panels for quantification). This suggests that the NTR may have a possible function in protecting Pmel17 from premature cleavage early during secretion. However, although generated earlier, both Mα and Mβ also disappeared faster than their counterparts in wt-Pmel17-expressing cells, thus providing an explanation for the lower steady-state levels of these fragments in ΔNTR-transfected Mel220 cells. These results are consistent with an earlier report showing that the NTR is not required for pPC-mediated cleavage of Pmel17 (13Hoashi T. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Rouzaud F. Kikuchi K. Tamaki K.

Myosin V is a smart 'walker' that is able to swiftly adjust to variable 'road conditions' to continue its processive movement across dense cellular environments. Coordination between the two heads via intramolecular load modulates biochemical kinetics and ensures highly efficient unidirectional motion. However, little is known about how load-induced regulation of the processive stepping occurs in vivo, where myosin V experiences significant off-axis loads applied in various directions. To reveal how myosin V remains processive in cells, we measured the effect of the off-axis loads, applied to individual actomyosin V bonds in a range of angles, on the coordination between the two heads and myosin V processive stepping. We found that myosin V remains highly processive under diagonal loads owing to asymmetrical ADP affinities and that the native 6IQ lever optimizes the subunit coordination, which indicates that myosin V is designed to be an intracellular transporter."

These methodologies, although powerful, are inherently limited because they provide a collective observation of both DNA strands. Therefore, in this work we utilized a molecular beacon strategy to selectively monitor the behavior of a single hairpin in the presence of the complementary sequence. This strand-specific strategy has allowed us to identify molecular recognition events that are important in the conversion from individual hairpins to the CAG/CTG duplex. Extensive research on the secondary structure of RNA has shown that complementary nucleic acid hairpins can convert to duplex via the formation of kissing hairpins and/or a cruciform intermediate (20Chang K.Y.

In a kissing complex, the two hairpins interact via the loop regions; in a cruciform, the interaction is via the terminal region of the stem. Given the precedent for these molecular recognition events in RNA hairpin to duplex conversion, we examined their potential role in TNR DNA hairpin to duplex conversion. To accomplish this, we designed a series of TNR hairpins that are modified in either the loop or stem region. Using our molecular beacon strategy, along with other chemical, biochemical, and biophysical methods, we have found that both kissing hairpins and cruciform intermediates provide viable pathways for the hairpin to duplex conversion. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry (29Beaucage S.L. Caruther M.H. Curr. Protoc. Nucleic Acid Chem. 2000; : 3.3.1-3.3.20Crossref Google Scholar). All phosphoramidites, including the 5′-fluorescein phosphoramidite (6-(3′,6′-dipivaloylfluoresceinyl-6-carboxamido)-hexyl-1-O-(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite), and the 3′-dabcyl CPG supports (1-dimethoxytrityloxy-3-[O-(N-4′-carboxy-4-(dimethylamino)-azobenzene)-3-aminopropyl)]-propyl-2-O-succinoyl-alkylamino-controlled pore glass) were purchased from Glen Research. The (CAG)10 sequence containing the pendant 5′-fluorescein and 3′-dabcyl groups was purified using a Dynamax Microsorb C18 reverse phase HPLC column (10 × 250 mm). The mobile phases were 30 mm ammonium acetate and acetonitrile with a gradient of 5–25% acetonitrile over 25 min (3.5 ml/min). Product identity was confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. 1). During the synthesis of all other oligonucleotides (i.e. those lacking the pendant fluorophore and quencher), the 5′-dimethoxytrityl group was retained to aid in purification. The crude products were purified using a Dynamax Microsorb C18 reverse phase HPLC column (10 × 250 mm). The mobile phases were 30 mm ammonium acetate and acetonitrile with a gradient of 5–25% acetonitrile over 25 min (3.5 ml/min). The 5′-dimethoxytrityl group was removed by incubation in 80% glacial acetic acid for 12 min followed by ethanol precipitation. A second HPLC purification was performed using the same column and mobile phases as above with a gradient of 0–15% acetonitrile over 35 min (3.5 ml/min). Quantification of oligonucleotides was performed at 90 °C using the ϵ260 values estimated for single-stranded DNA (30Warshaw M.M. Tinoco Jr., I. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 20: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and a Beckman Coulter DU800 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier thermoelectric device. Fluorescence profiles were obtained using an MX4000 real time PCR instrument (Stratagene). Hairpins (3 μm) were obtained by incubating each oligonucleotide at 90 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature in a buffer of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Each hairpin was chilled on ice for ∼30 min prior to mixing with another hairpin. Two hairpins were then combined to yield a 25-μl sample containing 1.5 μm of each hairpin in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The temperature cycle was as follows: 10 °C for 10 min, 10–90 °C at 1 °C/min, 90 °C for 5 min, and 90 to 10 °C at 1 °C/min. The excitation wavelength was 492 nm, and fluorescence was monitored at 520 nm. Melting temperatures (Tm) were obtained by taking the maximum in the first derivative of the fluorescence profile. The sequence of the noncomplementary control oligonucleotide is 5′-TGTGATAGCACTGATATATACCTTAGACCCATGA-3′. Melting temperatures for each oligonucleotide were obtained with a Beckman Coulter DU800 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier thermoelectric device. Samples contained varying concentrations of an oligonucleotide in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Prior to optical analysis, the samples were incubated at 90 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The samples were then heated from 25 to 90 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min while monitoring absorbance at 260 nm; for the reverse experiment, the samples were cooled from 90 to 25 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. Melting temperatures were obtained by taking the maximum in the first derivative of the absorbance profile generated while heating from 25 to 90 °C. For the hairpin to duplex conversion experiments, each hairpin was first formed by incubating the appropriate oligonucleotide (3 μm) at 90 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature in a buffer of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Prior to mixing, each hairpin was incubated at 10 °C. The hairpins were combined to yield a 325-μl sample containing 1.5 μm of each hairpin in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The temperature cycle was as follows: 10–90 °C at 1 °C/min followed by the reverse experiment of 90 to 10 °C at 1 °C/min. Absorbance was monitored at 260 nm. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hairpins were obtained by incubating each oligonucleotide at 90 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature in a buffer of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Samples for chemical probe experiments contained a single hairpin (5 μm) and 13.3–267 μm DEPC in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Following incubation with DEPC, samples were dried under vacuum, treated with 10% piperidine (v/v) at 90 °C for 30 min, and again dried under vacuum. Samples were resuspended in denaturing loading buffer (80% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed through an 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Products were visualized using phosphorimagery. The (CAG)10 sequence was 5′-32P-end-labeled. Individual hairpins were obtained by incubation of the appropriate oligonucleotide at 90 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Experiments were performed under pseudo first-order conditions using 0.25 μm (CAG)10 and 2.5 μm of the complementary hairpin in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Prior to mixing, each hairpin was incubated at 37 °C for ∼30 min; the hairpins were then combined and incubated at 37 °C. The longest time point was mixed first, and subsequent samples were timed and loaded onto the same gel with a 15-min delay between the loading of each sample. This procedure was followed for the determination of all rate constants with the exception of an experiment performed at 4 °C, in which there was no delay between the loading of each sample and an experiment performed in the presence of 80 mm NaCl, which had a 10-min delay between the loading of each sample. Samples were electrophoresed through a 12% native polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 25–50 V for 7–8 h at 4 °C. Products were visualized using phosphorimagery. The amount of duplex product was quantified and plotted as a function of time. The data were fitted in Origin to a monoexponential curve using the following equation: D = H0 (1 − e−k′t), where D is percentage of duplex at time t (in seconds), H0 is percentage of hairpin at t = 0, which was set to 100% during data fitting (31Vo M.N. Barany G. Rouzina I. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 244-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and k′ is the observed rate constant. The reported second-order rate constant was obtained by dividing k′ by the concentration of the sequence that is in excess (2.5 μm). For the (CAG)10 and (CTG)10 hairpin to duplex conversion experiments, a significant amount of duplex product appeared at t = 0; therefore, in this case, as described previously, we included a dead time parameter to account for this time lapse (32Ramalanjaona N. de Rocquigny H. Millet A. Ficheux D. Darlix J.L. Mély Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1041-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The dead time was 19 s on average. To probe the behavior of the (CAG)10 hairpin in the presence of the complementary sequence, we utilized a molecular beacon strategy. Our molecular beacon consists of a (CAG)10 sequence with a fluorophore (fluorescein) and quencher (dabcyl) covalently attached at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively (Fig. 1A). By design, when the molecular beacon is in the hairpin conformation, the fluorophore and quencher are in close proximity; this results in fluorescence quenching (Fig. 1B). In contrast, when the molecular beacon is present in an unfolded conformation or is base-paired to the complementary sequence to form a double-stranded duplex, the fluorophore and quencher are spatially separated, and fluorescence will be observed (Fig. 1C). We first obtained the fluorescence profile of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL molecular beacon by monitoring fluorescence intensity at 520 nm as a function of temperature (Fig. 2). At temperatures below 40 °C, only low levels of fluorescence were observed. However, as the temperature was increased above 40 °C, there was an increase in fluorescence intensity, which plateaus at 60 °C, and remains constant at higher temperatures. The temperature at the mid-point of this transition, 49.0 ± 1.0 °C, corresponds to the Tm of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin. These fluorescence data indicate that, consistent with our design strategy, the molecular beacon adopts a hairpin conformation. At temperatures above the Tm of the hairpin, however, the hairpin melted, and the molecular beacon was present in an unfolded conformation. To determine the contribution of the pendant fluorophore and quencher to thermal stability of the molecular beacon hairpin, a (CAG)10 sequence lacking these pendant moieties was also prepared. The thermal stability of this hairpin was obtained using optical melting analysis; a Tm of 53.5 ± 0.1 °C was observed (supplemental Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the Tm does not vary over a 5-fold range in concentration. This concentration-independent behavior is consistent with an intramolecular fold (33Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), as opposed to a multistranded conformation. When analyzed by optical melting, the FL-(CAG)10-DCL molecular beacon displays a Tm of 53.4 ± 0.1 °C (supplemental Fig. 2B). Based on the similar Tm obtained by optical melting for (CAG)10 and FL-(CAG)10-DCL, we concluded that the pendant fluorophore and quencher do not significantly modulate the thermal stability of the molecular beacon hairpin. Although these fluorescence and optically based methods have allowed us to confirm that the (CAG)10 sequence does, in fact, adopt a hairpin conformation, they do not provide a picture of the hairpin at the molecular level. For instance, they do not reveal how many bases are in the loop of the hairpin. This structural information was obtained based on modification of the hairpin by DEPC, which is a chemical probe of nucleobase accessibility. DEPC selectively modifies unpaired purines (A ≫ G) such as those in base bulges or loops (34Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 8009-8013Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Hyper-reactivity toward DEPC of two adenines and one guanine in the (CAG)10 hairpin suggests that the loop is defined as the four nucleobases shown in Fig. 3. The reactivity toward DEPC at G18 is above background, but not as intense as that observed at G15, and it has led us to assign this nucleobase as being part of the loop-closing base pair. However, it is possible that the G-C base pair that we have assigned as the loop-closing base pair is also part of the loop that would then describe a six-base loop. Although the structure shown in Fig. 3 positions both A14 and A17 in the loop of the hairpin, we find that these two adenines are not modified by DEPC to the same extent. This may be due to different stacking interactions with the adjacent bases. Furthermore, we find that the adenines in the stem of the hairpin are also modified by DEPC, although to a lesser extent than those in the loop; this reactivity is consistent with increased dynamics at A·A mismatch sites. We next used the FL-(CAG)10-DCL molecular beacon to examine the behavior of the (CAG)10 hairpin in the presence of the complementary (CTG)10 sequence. As shown here by optical melting analysis and modification by DEPC, the (CTG)10 sequence also adopts a hairpin conformation (supplemental Fig. 3). Furthermore, similar to the (CAG)10 hairpin, the loop of the (CTG)10 hairpin contains either four or six nucleobases. The FL-(CAG)10-DCL and (CTG)10 hairpins were combined in a 1:1 ratio, and the fluorescence intensity was monitored as a function of temperature (Fig. 4). At temperatures below 25 °C, fluorescence quenching was observed; therefore, at these temperatures the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin persisted in the presence of the complementary sequence. However, as the temperature is increased, an increase in fluorescence intensity was observed. Please note that the behavior of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin was monitored selectively in this assay because the (CTG)10 hairpin was not fluorescently labeled. Therefore, in the presence of the (CTG)10 hairpin, the increase in fluorescence centered at 38.8 ± 0.8 °C reflected melting of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin. Thus, the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin had a Tm of 49.0 ± 1.0 °C in the absence of (CTG)10 and 38.8 ± 0.8 °C in the presence of (CTG)10. The complementary sequence lowered the thermal stability of the (CAG)10 hairpin ∼10 °C. Indeed, this effect on the thermal stability of the (CAG)10 hairpin was specific to the complementary (CTG)10 sequence. In the presence of a noncomplementary oligonucleotide, no change in the thermal stability of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin is observed (Fig. 4). Although our fluorescence-based assay was particularly well suited for examining the thermal stability of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin, it did not allow us to determine whether the hairpin merely melted in the presence of (CTG)10 or if the complementary sequences have converted to duplex; fluorescence would be observed in both cases. To determine whether destabilization of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin occurred as part of the conversion to FL-(CAG)10-DCL/(CTG)10 duplex, optical analysis was performed. For these experiments, an equimolar amount of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL and (CTG)10 hairpins was combined, and absorbance at 260 nm was monitored as a function of temperature (Fig. 5). Two prominent transitions were observed in the absorbance profile. The first was a decrease in absorbance centered at 37.3 ± 0.6 °C; this decrease reflected an increase in order and base stacking that was consistent with duplex formation. Thus, although the individual hairpins persist at low temperatures, upon thermal induction the two complementary hairpins convert to duplex. Further confirmation that the decrease in absorbance corresponds to duplex formation was provided by the observation of a second transition, an increase in absorbance, at 75.7 ± 1.2 °C. This increase in absorbance reflects melting of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL/(CTG)10 duplex. As expected, no duplex melting transition was observed by fluorescence because the unstructured and duplex conformations of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL molecular beacon were indistinguishable. In addition to demonstrating that the FL-(CAG)10-DCL and (CTG)10 hairpins convert to duplex via a thermally induced process, we have also examined the reversibility of the conversion. Reversibility can be established readily by observing the fluorescence intensity as the temperature is decreased from 90 to 10 °C. If the process is reversible, meaning the FL-(CAG)10-DCL and (CTG)10 hairpins reform upon cooling, a decrease in fluorescence would be observed as the temperature is lowered. However, if the process is irreversible, meaning FL-(CAG)10-DCL/(CTG)10 duplex is formed upon cooling, the fluorescence intensity would remain high. Indeed, upon cooling from 90 to 10 °C, the fluorescence intensity remains high (supplemental Fig. 4A). The individual hairpins do not reform but rather the complementary sequences form duplex. In addition to the fluorescence data, upon cooling, optical analysis is also indicative of duplex and not hairpin formation (supplemental Fig. 4B). Having demonstrated that the FL-(CAG)10-DCL and (CTG)10 hairpins irreversibly convert to FL-(CAG)10-DCL/(CTG)10 duplex via a thermally induced process, we next sought to determine the rate of duplex formation by the complementary sequences. To accomplish this, 5′-32P-labeled (CAG)10 hairpin was mixed with the (CTG)10 hairpin under pseudo first-order conditions. A 10-fold excess of the (CTG)10 hairpin was utilized; importantly, under these conditions, no homoduplex side reaction was observed for the (CTG)10 sequence (supplemental Fig. 5). The samples were incubated at 37 °C; the slower migrating duplex was then resolved from the single-stranded hairpin by native PAGE. Notably, when the (CAG)10 hairpin alone is analyzed by native PAGE, a single band is observed indicating that (CAG)10 adopts a single conformation (supplemental Fig. 5). At t = 3 min, approximately half of the (CAG)10 hairpin has converted to (CAG)10/(CTG)10 duplex, and by 15 min the conversion is nearly complete (Fig. 6A). The amount of duplex product was quantitated and plotted as a function of time, and the data were fit to a monoexponential curve to obtain the rate constant for duplex formation (Fig. 6B). For the pair of hairpins (CAG)10 and (CTG)10, the rate for duplex formation was 1721 ± 98 m−1 s−1. As expected for a thermally induced process, kinetic experiments performed at 4 °C, instead of 37 °C, reveal that duplex conversion is significantly slower at lower temperature (supplemental Fig. 6). In fact, at the longest time point assayed, t = 25.5 h, only 23% of the (CAG)10 hairpin has converted to (CAG)10/(CTG)10 duplex. Because such a limited amount of hairpin to duplex conversion was observed, quantitative kinetic data could not be obtained. Having demonstrated that, in a thermally induced and irreversible process, the (CAG)10 and (CTG)10 hairpins convert to duplex, we next sought to determine the mechanism by which the two hairpins interact. To accomplish this, we prepared a series of modified (CTG)10 sequences (Table 1). To probe the role of the unpaired bases in the loop of the hairpin in modulating the conversion to duplex, two loop-modified (CTG)10 sequences were prepared, LP1 and LP2. In LP1, the two bases 5′-TT-3′ are substituted for the apical loop bases of the (CTG)10 hairpin. In LP2, four bases in the loop are changed such that they are no longer capable of canonical Watson-Crick base pairing with the loop of the (CAG)10 hairpin. To examine the potential role of the terminal bases of the stem of the hairpin in modulating the conversion to duplex, the stem-modified sequence ST1 was prepared. In this sequence, the three terminal bases of the stem, at both the 5′- and 3′-ends, are no longer complementary to the terminal bases of the (CAG)10 hairpin; A-T base pairs have been exchanged for G-C base pairs and vice versa. Optical melting analysis and chemical probe experiments with DEPC show that these loop and stem-modified sequences form hairpins (supplemental Figs. 7–9).TABLE 1DNA sequences used in this study Open table in a new tab The behavior of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL molecular beacon in the presence of these modified (CTG)10 hairpins was examined first. The modified hairpins were individually combined with the FL-(CAG)10-DCL molecular beacon, and fluorescence intensity was monitored as a function of temperature (Fig. 7). Table 2 shows the Tm of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin in presence of the modified (CTG)10 hairpins. Although the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin has a Tm of 49.0 °C in the absence of other DNA and 38.8 °C in the presence of (CTG)10, in the presence of the loop-modified (CTG)10 hairpins, intermediate melting temperatures were observed. Therefore, although the loop-modified hairpins destabilize the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin, they do so to a lesser extent than the fully complementary (CTG)10 hairpin. Interestingly, changing only the two apical bases of the (CTG)10 loop (LP1) has the same effect on the thermal stability of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin as changing four loop bases (LP2). Consistent with the extent of destabilization of the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin by the loop-modified (CTG)10 sequences, by optical analysis the temperature at which duplex forms between (CAG)10 and the loop-modified (CTG)10 sequences is higher than that observed with (CTG)10 (Table 2 and supplemental Figs. 10 and 11). Taken together, the results of these experiments with the loop-modified (CTG)10 sequences LP1 and LP2 suggest that, relative to the fully complementary (CTG)10 sequence, the conversion to duplex is disfavored with these sequences; higher temperatures are needed to melt the FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpin and also to induce the hairpin to duplex conversion.TABLE 2Thermal stability of (CAG)10-containing structuresComplementary hairpinTm (°C) of FL-(CAG)10-DCL hairpinFormation (°C) of (CAG)10-co"

Although binding to ERK appears to be important for this inhibition, the precise molecular mechanisms and the role of FRS2β in signal transduction mediated by other EGFR family members, as well as its role in human cancer, remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that FRS2β inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth induced by oncogenic ErbB2, another member of EGFR family, and that it inhibits heterodimer formation between EGFR and ErbB2. We mapped the residues important for the FRS2β and ERK interaction to two docking (D) domain-like sequences on FRS2β and two aspartic acid residues in the common docking (CD) domain of ERK. Moreover, in response to EGF, ERK translocated to the plasma membrane in cells expressing FRS2β but not an FRS2β mutant in which four arginine residues in the D domains were replaced with alanines, suggesting that FRS2β serves as a plasma membrane anchor for activated ERK. Finally, a low mRNA expression level of FRS2β was significantly correlated with poor prognosis in a cohort of 60 non-small cell lung cancer patients. Therefore, we have identified the molecular mechanisms by which FRS2β acts as a feedback inhibitor of EGFR family members and suggest a role for FRS2β as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2104682136,"The formation of multiprotein complexes constitutes a key step in determining the function of any translated gene product. Thus, the elucidation of interacting partners for a protein of interest is of fundamental importance to cell biology. Here we describe a simple methodology for the prediction of novel interactors. We have applied this to the developmental transcription factor Brn-3a to predict and verify a novel interaction between Brn-3a and the androgen receptor (AR). We demonstrate that these transcription factors form complexes within the nucleus of ND7 neuroblastoma cells, while in vitro pull-down assays show direct association. As a functional consequence of the Brn-3a-AR interaction, the factors bind cooperatively to multiple elements within the promoter of the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.7, leading to a synergistic increase in its expression. Thus, these data define AR as a direct Brn-3a interactor and verify a simple interacting protein prediction methodology that is likely to be useful for many other proteins."
