https://openalex.org/W2018593517,The sequences of the 35 and 36 amino-terminal amino acids of two purified amyloid fibril proteins have been determined. Results indicate that these two proteins are derived from homogeneous immunoglobulin light chains of variable region subgroup V(kappaI). The relation between amyloidosis and immunoglobulins is thus more firmly established.

https://openalex.org/W1577480508,"Abstract An antibody preparation to purified, homogeneous TPNH-cytochrome c reductase from pig liver microsomes was shown to inhibit concomitantly TPNH-cytochrome c reductase (NADPH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.2.3) and ethylmorphine N-demethylase activities in pig liver microsomes. The antibody also inhibited TPNH-cytochrome c reductase and TPNH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activities in rat and pig liver microsomes and bovine adrenocortical microsomes, but it did not inhibit either of these activities in bovine adrenocortical mitochondria. In addition, an antibody to adrenodoxin, the non-heme iron protein isolated from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria, inhibited both TPNH-cytochrome c reductase and TPNH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activities in bovine adrenocortical mitochondria but not in any of the microsomal preparations, including those isolated from adrenal cortex. The results presented establish these antibodies as specific inhibitors which can be utilized in studying hydroxylation reactions mediated by cytochrome P-450. With the use of these specific antibodies in each system studied, either the same or immunochemically similar enzymes were shown to mediate the TPNH-dependent reduction of both cytochrome c and cytochrome P-450, and the flavoprotein functional in the mixed-function oxidations of the mitochondria of adrenal cortex was shown to differ from that found in the microsomes of liver and adrenal cortex. Furthermore, the lack of inhibition of TPNH-dependent electron transport activities in liver and adrenal cortex microsomes, by antibody to adrenodoxin, which strongly inhibits bovine adrenal cortical mitochondrial TPNH-cytochrome c and cytochrome P-450 reductase activities, is further evidence that a non-heme iron protein similar to adrenodoxin is not involved in cytochrome P-450-mediated reactions in microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1651825297,"Abstract Antithrombin III activity cochromatographed with the activity of the inhibitor to activated Factor X during the purification of the inhibitor on Sephadex G-200, DEAE-Sephadex, and DEAE-cellulose columns. Both activities also comigrated on preparative polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. When a fraction of activated Factor X inhibitor was incubated at 56°, at pH 7.5, a simultaneous loss of antithrombin III and activated Factor X inhibitor activities resulted. A complete neutralization of the antithrombin III activity of the activated Factor X inhibitor fraction with thrombin rendered the inhibitor incapable of subsequently inhibiting activated Factor X and vice versa. When the inhibitor was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-200 column, antithrombin III, heparin cofactor, and activated Factor X inhibitor activities cochromatographed with the 280 mµ absorbing material in the activated Factor X inhibitor sample applied. To demonstrate further the identity of these three anticoagulant activities, a series of gel filtration experiments on a single column of Sephadex G-200 was performed in which fractions of activated Factor X inhibitor alone, heparin alone, and heparin mixed with the inhibitor were separately chromatographed in the presence of 0.01 m, 0.10 m, 0.20 m,and 0.30 m NaCl in 0.02 m Tris-maleate, pH 7.2, at 26°. The relative elution volume, Ve/V0 of activated Factor X inhibitor alone in 0.01 m NaCl was 1.83, and in 0.10 m to 0.30m NaCl was 1.77. Heparin behaved as a heterogenous substance with molecular weights ranging from 40,000 to greater than 200,000, at the salt concentrations studied. When a mixture of activated Factor X inhibitor and heparin was chromatographed, the two components eluted as a complex. A single broad heparin cofactor peak cochromatographed with the activated Factor X inhibitor protein and the heparin when high ionic strength eluent was employed. The fractions demonstrated antithrombin III activity when the heparin in the heparin cofactor peak fractions was neutralized with protamine sulfate. The plasma-activated Factor X inhibitor was shown to be unrelated to a hepatic anticoagulant that had been claimed to be a specific inhibitor of activated Factor X. It is concluded, therefore, that the biological activities variously termed activated Factor X inhibitor, antithrombin III, and heparin cofactor activities all belong to a single blood proteinase inhibitor with broad specificity. Together with other data presented, it is suggested that the key function of activated Factor X inhibitor as a natural anticoagulant may be primarily concerned with regulating hemostatic balance through neutralization of activated Factor X, a reaction profoundly enhanced by traces of heparin. It is for these reasons we propose that this low molecular weight α2-globulin inhibitor be termed activated Factor X inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1498904435,"Abstract The multiple molecular forms of hexokinase associated with the soluble and several subcellular particulate fractions of various tissues of normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats were studied. Hexokinase activities extracted from the particulate fractions, and those in the soluble fractions, were determined according to spectrophotometric assays and staining intensities of the hexokinase types separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel electrophoresis. According to these criteria, the amounts of type II hexokinase associated with the 13,000 x g P2 (mitochondrial-rich), 105,000 x g P3 and P4 (sarcoplasmic vesicle-rich), and 105,000 x g supernatant S3 (soluble) fractions of heart, diaphragm, and gastrocnemius muscles from diabetic rats were deficient when compared with those from normal rats. However, type II increased in the soluble fraction of the diabetic small intestine. While diabetes had no discernible effect on type I hexokinase content in any of the fractions of these tissues, brain, or kidney, it resulted in an increase in type III hexokinase in the soluble fraction of cardiac and skeletal muscles. The loss of type II activity in diabetic muscle extracts appeared to be due to a loss in amount of enzyme rather than to inhibition by glucose-6-P or other metabolites. Within 2 hours after insulin administration to diabetic rats net hexokinase activity in the soluble fraction of gastrocnemius muscle was restored to normal values, while in this fraction from cardiac muscle more than 48 hours were required for complete restoration. The only forms of hexokinase associated with all of the particulate fractions of all tissues studied were found to be indistinguishable from the hexokinase types I and II that are also present in the soluble fractions. Particle-bound type III hexokinase could not be shown. Latency of hexokinase activity, previously discovered in brain mitochondria in other laboratories, is found to be a general phenomenon characteristic of other particulate fractions of brain as well as skeletal and heart muscles. Such latency is attributable to only type I hexokinase and can be rendered assayable as the overt-bound activity or the solubilized activity by treatment of the particulate fractions with various membrane-disruptive agents. Examination of the hexokinase patterns associated with the P2, P3, P4, and soluble fractions of skeletal and heart muscles revealed that, with each tissue, the proportion of type I to II hexokinases varied from fraction to fraction. It is suggested that the observed differences in the association of the three hexokinases with different subcellular fractions, as well as their different responses to lack of insulin, may reflect some type of compartmentalization of the molecular forms of hexokinase in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1576451296,"Abstract Testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin in human plasma was characterized and quantified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Testosterone and estradiol were shown to bind to a single homogeneous protein over a wide range of experimental conditions. Testosterone binding to cortisol-binding globulin (transcortin) and estradiol binding to albumin were clearly demonstrated; both transcortin and albumin were separated from testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as was transferrin, a serum protein similar to testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin with respect to size and charge. The molecular, radius, apparent molecular weight, and net charge of testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin were obtained at three different pH values at 0°. A molecular radius of 2.95 nm was estimated and a molecular weight of 98,000 was computed with the use of a partial specific volume of 0.66. These values were independent of the presence or absence of ligand and were also obtained in urea concentrations up to 4 m. Testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin capacity was routinely determined with 5α-dihydrotestosterone-5H as a ligand because of its high affinity for the protein. Binding capacities in plasma expressed as micrograms of steroid bound per 100 ml were men, 0.49 ± 0.04 (S.E.); women, 1.42 ± 0.22; pregnancy, 10.91 ± 0.74; estrogen-treated women, 10.70 ± 1.04. The usefulness of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the study of steroid-binding and other binding proteins in biological fluids or tissues is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1567732897,"1. Exposure of chloroplasts to sonic oscillation in a medium of low osmolarity rapidly inactivated the Hill reaction, photophosphorylation, and photooxidation of ascorbate in the presence of dichlorophenyl-1, 1-dimethylurea. Concurrently with this inactivation plastocyanin was liberated from the chloroplasts. The addition of plastocyanin during sonic oscillation prevented net loss of plastocyanin from the chloroplasts and preserved the Hill reaction, cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation, and ascorbate photooxidation. These effects were not reversed by washing the particles. In contrast, the addition of plastocyanin to the assay mixtures after sonication did not enhance photophosphorylation even though it stimulated electron flow. This stimulation by external plastocyanin was abolished by washing. 2. A specific antibody against spinach plastocyanin had no effect on electron transport or photophosphorylation in chloroplasts and did not agglutinate chloroplasts. However, if chloroplasts were sonicated in the presence of the antibody, a more pronounced inhibition of the Hill reaction, of ascorbate photooxidation, and of photophosphorylation was observed than when sonic oscillation was performed in the presence of γ-globulins from nonimmunized rabbits. 3. From these findings we conclude that plastocyanin functions in noncyclic electron flow between the two photosystems as well as in cyclic photophosphorylation. In contrast to the chloroplast coupling factor (CF1) and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, plastocyanin in situ is not accessible to antibody added to the chloroplasts. Plastocyanin added to chloroplast particles can induce an artificial electron flow through Photosystem I. This process is not coupled to photophosphorylation but is sensitive to external antibody. The similarity between the function of plastocyanin in the inner chloroplast membrane and cytochrome c in the inner mitochondrial membrane is discussed."

No tissue contains more than four components, but there are distinct differences in component patterns among the various tissues.

https://openalex.org/W1592737895,"Conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin at acid pH involves an intramolecular reaction in which the unproteolyzed zymogen cleaves itself. This conclusion is based upon experiments in which pepsinogen, at low concentrations, was activated in the presence of substrate, hemoglobin. Under these conditions, the activation of pepsinogen is independent of pepsinogen concentration, and addition of pepsin does not enhance the rate of autoactivation. The activity of Sepharose-bound pepsinogen was independent of the average amount of pepsinogen bound per g of Sepharose, suggesting that the activation process is not caused by neighboring molecules mutually activating. Apparently, in more concentrated solutions that were previously employed for autoactivation, the concentration of pepsinogen was such that the reaction could be catalyzed by one of the products (an autocatalytic reaction). When the activation process is performed at low pepsinogen concentration in the presence of substrate, or in columns of Sepharose-bound pepsinogen, the results indicate that reaction between a trace of pepsin and pepsinogen or between molecules of pepsinogen is not a prerequisite for activation. Amino-terminal studies on Sepharose pepsinogen yielded leucine as the amino-terminal acid. Exposure of the Sepharose pepsinogen to acid yielded leucine and isoleucine as amino-terminal amino acids. Treatment of base-denatured pepsinogen with acid failed to yield isoleucine as the new amino-terminal. These results suggest that cleavage of the peptide bond which results in exposure of a new amino terminus involves an intramolecular enzymatic process. Precipitin tests with antipepsinogen and antipepsin sera which had been passed through Sepharose-pepsinogen columns exposed to various conditions indicated that Sepharose-bound pepsinogen retained its antigenic determinants upon conversion to pepsin."

https://openalex.org/W1559652493,"Abstract A naturally occurring inhibitor of activated blood coagulation Factor X has been isolated from pooled rabbit plasma and purified by the combination of Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, DEAE-Sephadex A-50, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. On microzone electrophoresis the purified product traveled as an α2-globulin, and on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis at pH 9.5 it traveled as a single component close to transferrin. With exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-75, G-100, and G-200 it emerged in the same elution volume as crystalline bovine serum albumin. On analytical disc electrophoresis, the inhibitor stained positive for glycoprotein with the periodic acid-Schiff technique. It contained 4.1% hexose, 4.6% sialic acid, and was soluble in 2.5% but not in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Greater than 80% of its original activity persisted at 56° in the 1st hour and gradually diminished to 20% by the 6th hour. The pH optimum of the inhibitor activity was between 7 and 9, and the activity was most stable at pH 6 to 8. Optimum inhibitor activity was at 37° and nondetectable at 1°. Preparative disc electrophoresis of the purified inhibitor on 15% polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.1 caused extensive aggregation of the eluted inhibitor protein with a concomitant total loss of biological activity within 48 hours of storage, even at -60°."
https://openalex.org/W1975571861,"RECENT observations1–4 of specific localized fluorescence in Y chromosomes stained with quinacrine mustard and quinacrine hydrochloride have provided a new parameter for the study of abnormal Y chromosomes. We have re-examined regularly prepared chromosome and buccal smear slides of at least 100 cells from two patients with a small Y chromosome5 and from patients with normal Y chromosomes. We used a modification of techniques described earlier1–4. We stained for 5 min in 0.5% quinacrine hydrochloride (Winthrop); washed in distilled water; differentiated for 3 min in citric acid-phosphate buffer, pH 5.5; washed and mounted slides in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and sealed with nail polish. Preparations were examined with a Leitz Ortholux microscope with a mercury arc lamp, standard fluorescence filters, and dark-field illumination, and were photographed with Ektachrome high speed film. Fluorescence persisted for several days. Full details of the technique will be published later."
https://openalex.org/W1486076087,"Abstract The single tryptophan residue of the basic A1 protein from bovine and human central nervous system myelin was selectively modified to the oxindole derivative with a mild oxidizing reagent BNPS-skatole, a bromine adduct of 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methylindole. Quantitative oxidation of the tryptophan residue was shown by several methods. Following reduction, no other residue appeared to be modified. The oxidized A1 protein showed the same encephalitogenic activity, antigenic specificity, and delayed-type skin reactivity as the unmodified A1 protein, thus demonstrating that position 2 of the indole ring is not critical for induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in guinea pigs. Under stronger conditions, BNPS-skatole cleaved the COOH-tryptophanyl bond, giving two peptides (L and T) in 38% yield. Although Peptides L and T were comparatively nonencephalitogenic (1 to 2% of the A1 protein), Peptide L retained nearly full reactivity against sheep antibody to the A1 protein in the passive hemagglutination inhibition test. Peptide T, the 54-residue COOH-terminal segment of the A1 protein, was considered unreactive. It was concluded that the portion of the A1 molecule which contains the antigenic determinants for humoral antibody, the 116 residues of the NH2-terminal region, is distinct from the major encephalitogenic site (9-residue tryptophan region). Both Peptides L and T, in nonencephalitogenic doses, induce the formation of sensitized cells, as shown by positive reactions in the delayed-type skin test in guinea pigs. It appears, therefore, that no strict correlation exists between the encephalitogenic and delayed hypersensitive responses to certain peptide regions of the A1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1987709544,"PREVIOUS work with scrapie led us to conclude1 that the transmissible agent was unlikely to be a conventional virus. We have presented evidence2 that the transmissible agent may be, or may be associated with, a small basic protein (polypeptide) of the kind involved in the production of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and we have recorded the possible occurrence of the agent in tissues of normal animals3–5. These observations have neither been confirmed nor disproved in other laboratories and various other hypotheses on the nature of scrapie and its transmissible agent remain unproved6–8. The “slow virus” hypothesis still favoured by some9 is now at variance with the impressive experimental evidence from ultraviolet irradiation studies10–13 that the transmissible agent may not contain nucleic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1508713472,"Extracts of streptomycin-producing strains of Streptomyces phosphorylate dihydrostreptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate with adenosine 5'-triphosphate as the phosphoryl donor. The second phosphate is esterified with the dihydrostreptobiosamine moiety. Streptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate was not phosphorylated under similar conditions. Because of its lability, the new enzyme that is responsible for the phosphorylation could not be separated from the previously described streptomycin streptidinokinase, present in streptomycin producers, which phosphorylates the streptidine moieties of both streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin. However, extracts of a strain which lacks streptidinokinase, Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10971, phosphorylated the dihydrostreptobiosamine moieties of both dihydrostreptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate; streptomycin was not phosphorylated. The kinase is an idiophase enzyme, not detectable during the early rapid growth phase of these Streptomyces. The observation that streptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate was phosphorylated only after reduction with borohydride to the dihydrostreptomycin derivative suggests that the second phosphate is esterified with the 3-hydroxymethyl group of the dihydrostreptose moiety of dihydrostreptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate. Fresh extracts of streptomycin producers can synthesize the diphosphorylated derivative of dihydrostreptomycin from dihydrostreptomycin via either of the two monophosphorylated dihydrostreptomycin derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1509675766,"Abstract A peptide (Peptide R) of 46 residues was isolated in unusually high yield (40 to 85%) from a peptic digest of the A1 protein, a basic protein from bovine myelin of the central nervous system. This peptide (4990 daltons) induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in rabbits but was inactive in guinea pigs and monkeys at the doses tested. In contrast, the absence of antigenic determinants to anti-A1 protein antibody in Peptide R was demonstrated by the passive hemagglutination inhibition test. It was concluded, therefore, that the encephalitogenic determinants of Peptide R plays an insignificant role in interaction with antibody. Peptide R lacks tryptophan and thereby differs from the 9-residue segment of the A1 protein which was previously shown to induce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in guinea pigs (and rabbits). Peptides derived from the COOH-terminal portion of Peptide R were also inactive as encephalitogens in guinea pigs. Peptide R is released from the A1 protein with pepsin by hydrolysis of Phe-Phe linkages; phenylalanine thus occupies the COOH- and NH2-terminal positions. The amino acid sequence of Peptide R was determined with the Edman procedure on the six tryptic peptides: [see PDF for sequence]."

https://openalex.org/W1987845244,"Abstract A rapid purification procedure for myosin from human blood platelets is described. The isolated protein was found to be homogeneous by ultracentrifugation, free diffusion, and immunochemical criteria. The following physical parameters of the protein were established; sedimentation coefficient (s20, w0) 6.8 S; diffusion coefficient (D20, w) (from boundary spreading during free diffusion), 1.13 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1; partial specific volume (v), 0.731 ml g-1; molecular weight, 542,700 g mole-1; and frictional ratio (f/f0), 3.48. The amino acid composition of platelet myosin is reported. Divalent cations such as Ca++ and Mg++ activated the myosin ATPase activity, whereas EDTA inhibited the enzyme activity. Succinylation of platelet myosin indicated the presence of a large subunit with sedimentation coefficient (s20, w0) of 4.9 S. In addition, electron micrographs of two types of negatively stained (uranyl acetate) polymerized platelet myosin (types I and III) are shown."
https://openalex.org/W1485872748,"Abstract The precipitin reaction between peptidoglycan solubilized by ultrasonic treatment and the sera of rabbits immunized with Group A variant streptococci was inhibited with various amino acid derivatives and synthetic peptides. The peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method. The following conclusions were drawn from these experiments: 1. The pentapeptide l-Ala-d-Glu-γ-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala is the antigenic determinant of the peptide moiety of the peptidoglycan. 2. The antibodies are directed against the COOH-terminal portion of the pentapeptide. 3. The terminal d-alanyl-d-alanine is the immunodominant site of the antigen. Thus, the antibodies are directed against the growing site of the peptidoglycan. The antibodies bind to the same site as the enzyme transpeptidase, which catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan. Penicillin, a structural analogue of the COOH-terminal d-Ala-d-Ala and thus an inhibitor of the transpeptidase reaction, did not inhibit the precipitin reaction, an indication that the antibodies distinguish between the structure of penicillin and d-Ala-d-Ala. 4. The contribution of the other amino acids to the antigenic site of peptidoglycan is of less importance (l-Lys, d-Glu) or is insignificant (l-Ala). 5. The upper limit of the combining site of the antibodies is complementary to that of a peptide ranging between the sizes of a tetrapeptide and a pentapeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1829892654,"Abstract Homogeneous preparations of fatty acid synthetase from mammary glands of lactating rats were used to prepare an antiserum and a γ-globulin fraction was isolated from the antiserum. The antiserum and the γ-globulin fraction were shown to be specific against the fatty acid synthetase multienzyme complex. Addition of the γ-globulin to homogenate fractions of lactating rat mammary glands, resulted in complete inhibition of synthesis, from acetate, of fatty acids of all chain lengths. These results show that the multienzyme complex is an obligatory enzyme for the synthesis of all chain length fatty acids in the mammary glands of lactating rats. The fatty acid synthetase from mammary gland produces almost exclusively palmitic acid from malonyl-CoA when acyl-CoA derivatives of chain length C2 to C8 were used as starters. Butyryl-CoA was found to be the most efficient starter, having the highest Vmax and the lowest Km of all acyl-CoA derivatives tested. The specificity of the thioesterase activity associated with the synthetase was also studied with acyl-CoA derivatives as model substrates. Activity was maximal for palmityl and stearyl thioesters, but some activity was indicated with thioesters of chain length C2 to C8. The chain length specificity of thioesterase activity was quite similar to that reported for the pigeon liver enzyme, despite the fact that the liver and mammary gland synthetases produce different chain length fatty acids in homogenate or tissue slice preparations, and presumably, therefore, in vivo. The results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms for termination of growth of the carbon chain in fatty acid synthesis."

Exposure of bovine heart mitochondria to purified preparations of phospholipase A or phospholipase C resulted in losses of phosphorylation capacity, whereas respiration was not impaired. 2. The inhibitory effects of low concentrations of phospholipase A on phosphorylation were prevented or reversed by bovine serum albumin. At higher concentrations of phospholipase A neither bovine serum albumin nor lecithin were effective in restoring phosphorylation. 3. Exposure of mitochondria to phospholipase C resulted in a loss of Ca++ translocation, a partial depression of oxidative phosphorylation, and a partial loss of organically bound phosphorus. 4. Phospholipase C-treated mitochondria were resistant to the uncoupling action of Ca++ or K+ plus valinomycin. Addition of nigericin together with valinomycin and K+ was required to abolish phosphorylation associated with oxidation in phospholipase C-treated mitochondria. These responses resemble those of submitochondrial particles rather than those of mitochondria. In electron micrographs, phospholipase C-treated mitochondria looked like submitochondrial particles packaged in mitochondria. 5. A partial restoration of Ca++ translocation after phospholipase C digestion was achieved by addition of either egg lecithin or of large amounts of bovine serum albumin."
https://openalex.org/W2066504613,The partial sequence of the light chain of the myeloma-like immunoglobulin Sac shows a large deletion in its variable region. The sequence provides evidence that the corresponding gene was formed by the repair of DNA broken at nonhomologous positions. Data from other immunoglobulin (heavy) chains containing large deletions are compatible with their genes also being the result of DNA breakage and nonhomologous repair. Single homologous reciprocal exchanges in DNA networks at immunoglobulin loci could be the cause of the nonhomologous breaks. The relevance of these events to the generation of normal antibody variability remains to be determined.

In immunoelectrophoresis, a single precipitin line was observed with antiplatelet serum or anti-fibrin-stabilizing factor serum. The precipitin line as well as the protein band on disc gel could not be detected when the protein was treated with thrombin. This protein, denoted platelet fibrin-stabilizing factor, has factor XIII activity which became more and more stable with further purification. Immunodiffusion studies showed platelet fibrin-stabilizing factor to be only partially identical with plasma fibrin-stabilizing factor. The molecular weight of platelet fibrin-stabilizing factor as determined by gel filtration through previously calibrated columns of Sephadex was between 110,000 and 150,000 compared to a value of 160,000 to 350,000 for plasma fibrin-stabilizing factor. It has been concluded that platelet fibrin-stabilizing factor is a smaller and different molecule from plasma fibrin-stabilizing factor."

The preparations showed a single component by ultracentrifugation, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, polyacrylamide (disc) gel electrophoresis using different separatory gel concentrations with running gel at pH 7.5 and 8.9, and also by moving boundary electrophoresis at pH 7.0 and 8.6. Preparations did not undergo dissociation or inactivation during moving boundary electrophoresis. The specific activity of the preparations was 1800 ± 300 units per mg of protein, approximately half that of normal prothrombin (3200 ± 200 units per mg of protein). Prothrombin purified from plasma at a concentration of 50% of normal had normal specific activity, however. Prothrombin prepared from normal plasma diluted to a prothrombin concentration of 12.5% of normal had specific activity similar to those preparations from normal undiluted plasma, but greater than that from Dicumarolized plasma. The low specific activity of the Dicumarolized prothrombin is considered indicative of the biosynthesis of altered prothrombin molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1572702992,"Abstract Salmonella mutants defective in the biosynthesis of the central R core portion of cell wall lipopolysaccharide accumulate the peripheral side portion of lipopolysaccharide in a form presumably linked to the lipid carrier. When such an O side chain polysaccharide was isolated from a core-defective mutant derived from a Salmonella typhimurium strain originally producing O antigen 122, the polysaccharide was found to possess the full determinant group for 122 antigen, i.e. short side chains each consisting of a single α-d-glucopyranosyl residue linked to C-4 of d-galactose. However, the galactose residue at the reducing end of the O side chain did not appear to have been glucosylated. These results suggest that the transfer of the foregoing glucose residues normally takes place at the level of the carrier-linked oligomers of O side chain-repeating units, rather than at the level of the repeating unit monomers or at that of the lipopolysaccharide."

The antigenic determinants of glucagon were investigated with isolated tryptic peptides of the hormone. Antibodies from virtually all of more than a dozen animals tested had specificity primarily for the amino-terminal heptadecapeptide. However, only intact glucagon and its carboxy-terminal dodecapeptide stimulated spleen or lymph node cells to synthesize DNA. It thus appears that glucagon was cleaved along functional lines into two parts, one of which contained the major antigenic determinant for serum antibody and the other of which was ""recognized"" by antigen-reactive cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030629470,"Developmental behaviors were studied in monkeys subjected to asphyxia at birth. Visual depth perception, visual pla ing, and locomotion appeared significantly later than in nonasphyxiated monkeys. After these behaviors had been established in asphyxiates, however, there was little difference from those observed in normal monkeys. These results were compared with reports of permanent learning deficits that occur in monkeys asphyxiated at birth for similar periods of time. Such comparison suggests that the neural structures responsible for the developmental behaviors studied are not damaged by asphyxia to the same extent as those for acquisition. Delay in development may be an early indication of brain damage with subsequent mental retardation."

In its absence, the cell is rounded and crenated with spikelike projections arising sharply from the membrane. The addition of erythrophilic γ-globulin immediately restores the original biconcave disc structure. Isolated Fab and F(ab)2 fragments, like the parent molecule, bind in low ionic strength isotonic media and dissociate at high ionic strength. A modified method that is regularly reproducible was devised for better separation of Fab and Fc fragments of the γ-globulin molecule."
