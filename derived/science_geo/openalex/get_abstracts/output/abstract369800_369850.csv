https://openalex.org/W4236965194,"To push the physical limitations of lasers to the nanoscale regime it is necessary to tackle the fundamental challenge of surpassing the diffraction limit. It has been suggested that surface plasmons — light–matter waves trapped on the surface of a conductor — can be used to tightly confine light on very short length scales, but such approaches have been previously hampered by severe losses. Oulton et al. now demonstrate that it is possible to circumvent this problem by utilizing a hybrid between a dielectric waveguide and a conducting surface supporting a plasmon mode, thereby showing the experimental realization of a nanoscale plasmonic laser with an optical mode a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. Such hybrid plasmonic coherent light sources offer the possibility to explore extreme interactions between light and matter, and may open important new avenues in optoelectronics. A key challenge is to realize ultracompact lasers that can directly generate coherent optical fields at the nanometre scale, far beyond the diffraction limit. Surface plasmons could be used to tightly confine light on very short lengthscales, but so far this approach has been hampered by ohmic losses at optical frequencies. The experimental demonstration of nanometre-scale plasmonic lasers is now reported, realized using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide — these lasers can generate optical modes a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. Laser science has been successful in producing increasingly high-powered, faster and smaller coherent light sources1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Examples of recent advances are microscopic lasers that can reach the diffraction limit, based on photonic crystals3, metal-clad cavities4 and nanowires5,6,7. However, such lasers are restricted, both in optical mode size and physical device dimension, to being larger than half the wavelength of the optical field, and it remains a key fundamental challenge to realize ultracompact lasers that can directly generate coherent optical fields at the nanometre scale, far beyond the diffraction limit10,11. A way of addressing this issue is to make use of surface plasmons12,13, which are capable of tightly localizing light, but so far ohmic losses at optical frequencies have inhibited the realization of truly nanometre-scale lasers based on such approaches14,15. A recent theoretical work predicted that such losses could be significantly reduced while maintaining ultrasmall modes in a hybrid plasmonic waveguide16. Here we report the experimental demonstration of nanometre-scale plasmonic lasers, generating optical modes a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. We realize such lasers using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide consisting of a high-gain cadmium sulphide semiconductor nanowire, separated from a silver surface by a 5-nm-thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of the emission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire’s exciton spontaneous emission rate by up to six times owing to the strong mode confinement17 and the signature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Because plasmonic modes have no cutoff, we are able to demonstrate downscaling of the lateral dimensions of both the device and the optical mode. Plasmonic lasers thus offer the possibility of exploring extreme interactions between light and matter, opening up new avenues in the fields of active photonic circuits18, bio-sensing19 and quantum information technology20."

https://openalex.org/W2119793842,"Hypoxia contributes to the progression of a variety of cancers by activating adaptive transcriptional programs that promote cell survival, motility and tumor angiogenesis. Although the importance of hypoxia and subsequent hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation in tumor angiogenesis is well known, their role in the regulation of glioma-derived stem cells is unclear. In this study, we show that hypoxia (1% oxygen) promotes the self-renewal capacity of CD133-positive human glioma-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs). Propagation of the glioma-derived CSCs in a hypoxic environment also led to the expansion of cells bearing CXCR4 (CD184), CD44low and A2B5 surface markers. The enhanced self-renewal activity of the CD133-positive CSCs in hypoxia was preceded by upregulation of HIF-1α. Knockdown of HIF-1α abrogated the hypoxia-mediated CD133-positive CSC expansion. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)-Akt or ERK1/2 pathway reduced the hypoxia-driven CD133 expansion, suggesting that these signaling cascades may modulate the hypoxic response. Finally, CSCs propagated at hypoxia robustly retained the undifferentiated phenotype, whereas CSCs cultured at normoxia did not. These results suggest that response to hypoxia by CSCs involves the activation of HIF-1α to enhance the self-renewal activity of CD133-positive cells and to inhibit the induction of CSC differentiation. This study illustrates the importance of the tumor microenvironment in determining cellular behavior."

We found that an individual with complete amygdala lesions lacked any sense of personal space. Furthermore, healthy individuals showed amygdala activation upon close personal proximity. The amygdala may be required to trigger the strong emotional reactions normally following personal space violations, thus regulating interpersonal distance in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2018169163,"Tyrosine phosphorylation is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. We performed a mutational analysis of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma. We identified 30 somatic mutations affecting the kinase domains of 19 PTKs and subsequently evaluated the entire coding regions of the genes encoding these 19 PTKs for somatic mutations in 79 melanoma samples. We found ERBB4 mutations in 19% of individuals with melanoma and found mutations in two other kinases (FLT1 and PTK2B) in 10% of individuals with melanomas. We examined seven missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTK gene, ERBB4, and found that they resulted in increased kinase activity and transformation ability. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ERBB4 had reduced cell growth after shRNA-mediated knockdown of ERBB4 or treatment with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib. These studies could lead to personalized therapeutics specifically targeting the kinases that are mutationally altered in individual melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2076382804,"Dysregulation of osteoclasts, the cells that chew up bone, can lead to severe bone loss. Although many positive regulators of the differentiation of this cell type have been identified, few negative regulators have. Now, Masamichi Takami and colleagues have identified IRF-8 as an inhibitor of osteoclast formation and explore its role in disease. Bone metabolism results from a balance between osteoclast-driven bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Diseases such as periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis are characterized by increased bone destruction due to enhanced osteoclastogenesis1,2. Here we report that interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8), a transcription factor expressed in immune cells, is a key regulatory molecule for osteoclastogenesis. IRF-8 expression in osteoclast precursors was downregulated during the initial phase of osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), which is encoded by the Tnfsf11 gene. Mice deficient in Irf8 showed severe osteoporosis, owing to increased numbers of osteoclasts, and also showed enhanced bone destruction after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Irf8−/− osteoclast precursors underwent increased osteoclastogenesis in response to RANKL and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). IRF-8 suppressed osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the function and expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Our results show that IRF-8 inhibits osteoclast formation under physiological and pathological conditions and suggest a model where downregulation of inhibitory factors such as IRF-8 contributes to RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2161367731,"Docking, the initial association of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, precedes formation of the SNARE complex, which drives membrane fusion. For many years, the molecular identity of the docked state, and especially the vesicular docking protein, has been unknown, as has the link to SNARE complex assembly. Here, using adrenal chromaffin cells, we identify the vesicular docking partner as synaptotagmin-1, the calcium sensor for exocytosis, and SNAP-25 as an essential plasma membrane docking factor, which, together with the previously known docking factors Munc18-1 and syntaxin, form the minimal docking machinery. Moreover, we show that the requirement for Munc18-1 in docking, but not fusion, can be overcome by stabilizing syntaxin/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes. These findings, together with cross-rescue, double-knockout, and electrophysiological data, lead us to propose that vesicles dock when synaptotagmin-1 binds to syntaxin/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes, whereas Munc18-1 is required for the downstream association of synaptobrevin to form fusogenic SNARE complexes. Docking, the initial association of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, precedes formation of the SNARE complex, which drives membrane fusion.

Calcium-dependent exocytosis of synaptic or secretory vesicles can be elicited within fractions of a millisecond upon calcium influx into the releasing cell. In order to achieve such exquisite temporal precision, secretory vesicles undergo a number of maturation steps before calcium influx, leaving them in a semi-stable so-called “release-ready” or primed state, where membrane fusion can be fast. In electron micrographs of neurosecretory cells, many secretory vesicles are found docked at the target membrane; however, their number typically exceeds the number of release-ready vesicles. Docking thus appears to be an intermediate maturation state of a vesicle, immediately preceding the step at which vesicles become release ready. Whereas a picture of the release-ready vesicle is emerging, the molecular mechanism of docking and its connection to the priming and fusion reaction remains unresolved (for a review, see Verhage and Sørensen, 2008Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Vesicle docking in regulated exocytosis.Traffic. 2008; 9: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Two proteins have been firmly implicated in docking, Munc18-1 (Voets et al., 2001bVoets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Südhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Munc18-1 promotes large dense-core vesicle docking.Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and syntaxin-1 (de Wit et al., 2006de Wit H. Cornelisse L.N. Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Docking of secretory vesicles is syntaxin dependent.PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Deficiency of either of these proteins produced robust docking phenotypes, and in agreement with several other findings (Hammarlund et al., 2007Hammarlund M. Palfreyman M.T. Watanabe S. Olsen S. Jorgensen E.M. Open syntaxin docks synaptic vesicles.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e198Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Weimer et al., 2003Weimer R.M. Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Hadwiger G. Nonet M.L. Jorgensen E.M. Defects in synaptic vesicle docking in unc-18 mutants.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1 are now widely accepted as docking factors (Verhage and Sørensen, 2008Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Vesicle docking in regulated exocytosis.Traffic. 2008; 9: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in docking, syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1 also have essential functions downstream of docking. Syntaxin-1 forms, together with synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) and the vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 (VAMP-2)/synaptobrevin-2, the core SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor [NSF]-attachment protein receptor) complex (Jahn and Scheller, 2006Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs–engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Synaptic vesicle fusion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The formation of this complex between vesicle and plasma membrane appears to underlie the priming reaction, and final C-terminal assembly coincides with fusion triggering (Sørensen et al., 2006Sørensen J.B. Wiederhold K. Muller E.M. Milosevic I. Nagy G. de Groot B.L. Grubmuller H. Fasshauer D. Sequential N- to C-terminal SNARE complex assembly drives priming and fusion of secretory vesicles.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition to syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1, several other proteins have been implicated in docking in several types of secretory cells, such as rab3 and rab27, rabphilin3A, granuphilin, and exophilin4/Slp2a, and function mutations in several priming genes in C. elegans (RIM/unc-10, (M)unc-13, or CAPS/unc-31) produce a strong reduction of vesicles with a “contact patch” (for a review, see Verhage and Sørensen, 2008Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Vesicle docking in regulated exocytosis.Traffic. 2008; 9: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is known that Munc18-1 interacts with neuronal SNARE proteins in two distinct modes: i.e., with isolated syntaxin-1 alone in a “closed” conformation and with assembled SNARE complexes containing syntaxin-1 in an “open” conformation (Toonen and Verhage, 2007Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Munc18-1 in secretion: lonely Munc joins SNARE team and takes control.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 564-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Munc18-1 binding to the assembled SNARE complex involves an interaction with the N-terminal H(abc) domain of syntaxin-1 and the four-helical bundle of the assembled SNARE complex (Dulubova et al., 2007Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Munc18-1 binds directly to the neuronal SNARE complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that Munc18-1 binding to assembled neuronal SNARE complexes enhanced membrane fusion in an in vitro liposome assay (Shen et al., 2007Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Selective activation of cognate SNAREpins by Sec1/Munc18 proteins.Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), whereas in the calyx of Held synapse, Munc18-1 binding to the N-terminal of syntaxin-1 is essential for exocytic membrane fusion (Khvotchev et al., 2007Khvotchev M. Dulubova I. Sun J. Dai H. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dual modes of Munc18-1/SNARE interactions are coupled by functionally critical binding to syntaxin-1 N terminus.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12147-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Prior to binding of synaptobrevin-2 to syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 at the target membrane, syntaxin-1 is believed to form a 1:1 heterodimer with SNAP-25 as an intermediate step (Fasshauer and Margittai, 2004Fasshauer D. Margittai M. A transient N-terminal interaction of SNAP-25 and syntaxin nucleates SNARE assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7613-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Zilly et al., 2006Zilly F.E. Sørensen J.B. Jahn R. Lang T. Munc18-Bound Syntaxin Readily Forms SNARE Complexes with Synaptobrevin in Native Plasma Membranes.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Stabilization of these “acceptor” 1:1 syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 complexes is important for the acceleration of fusion in vitro (Pobbati et al., 2006Pobbati A.V. Stein A. Fasshauer D. N- to C-terminal SNARE complex assembly promotes rapid membrane fusion.Science. 2006; 313: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recent studies (Zilly et al., 2006Zilly F.E. Sørensen J.B. Jahn R. Lang T. Munc18-Bound Syntaxin Readily Forms SNARE Complexes with Synaptobrevin in Native Plasma Membranes.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggest that Munc18-1 controls the assembly of syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 heterodimers and may even promote the formation of this “acceptor” complex relative to a proposed nonproductive syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 2:1 complex (“off pathway” [Fasshauer et al., 1997Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Structural changes are associated with SNARE-complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 242: 28036-28041Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Xiao et al., 2001Xiao W. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.K. The neuronal t-SNARE complex is a parallel four-helix bundle.Nat.

Munc18-Bound Syntaxin Readily Forms SNARE Complexes with Synaptobrevin in Native Plasma Membranes.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar]); however, whether this plays a role for exocytosis in vivo is unknown. Hence, syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1 probably operate at the receiving end of the docking process, but it is unclear how and which vesicular partner(s) and other proteins are involved. Docking of secretory vesicles to the target membrane must involve vesicular proteins. While the proteins present on synaptic vesicles have been systematically identified (Jahn and Scheller, 2006Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs–engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), none of these has been assigned as a docking factor. Biochemical evidence suggest that at least two vesicle proteins bind to established docking factors on the plasma membrane and can therefore be considered candidate docking factors: synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1 (Chieregatti et al., 2002Chieregatti E.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12574-12579Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Schiavo et al., 1997Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Binding of the synaptic vesicle v-SNARE, synaptotagmin, to the plasma membrane t-SNARE SNAP-25, can explain docked vesicles at neurotoxin-treated synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

SNAP receptors implicated in vesicle targeting and fusion.Nature. 1993; 362: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). We recently confirmed that the synaptobrevin-2 null mutation does not produce docking phenotypes similar to munc18-1 or syntaxin-1 null (Gerber et al., 2008Gerber S.H. Rah J.C. Min S.W. Liu X. de Wit H. Dulubova I. Meyer A.C. Rizo J. Arancillo M. Hammer R.E. et al.Conformational switch of syntaxin-1 controls synaptic vesicle fusion.Science. 2008; 321: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), consistent with earlier findings (Borisovska et al., 2005Borisovska M. Zhao Y. Tsytsyura Y. Glyvuk N. Takamori S. Matti U. Rettig J. Südhof T. Bruns D. v-SNAREs control exocytosis of vesicles from priming to fusion.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, synaptotagmin-1 seems to be the prime candidate for a vesicular docking protein, but evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. In the present study, we addressed the involvement of the syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complex and binding of vesicular synaptotagmin-1 to this complex using (mutant) mouse embryonic chromaffin cells as a model. Mouse embryonic chromaffin cells are a preferred model to study docking, because vesicles are sparse and around 40%–50% of them found docked to the plasma membrane, making docking phenotypes more evident than in other systems. We have analyzed null mutants for the genes encoding these four proteins and studied the effects of rescue and cross-rescue using electron microscopy and cell physiology. We identify two docking factors, synaptotagmin-1 and SNAP-25, and show that stabilizing syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes rescue the docking defect in munc18-1 null mutants. Together with published data, this allows us to synthesize a minimal docking model. Recent in vitro studies (Zilly et al., 2006Zilly F.E. Sørensen J.B. Jahn R. Lang T. Munc18-Bound Syntaxin Readily Forms SNARE Complexes with Synaptobrevin in Native Plasma Membranes.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggest that Munc18-1 promotes the formation of the syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 “acceptor” complex relative to a proposed nonproductive syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 2:1 complex (“off-pathway” [Fasshauer et al., 1997Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Structural changes are associated with SNARE-complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 242: 28036-28041Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Xiao et al., 2001Xiao W. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.K. The neuronal t-SNARE complex is a parallel four-helix bundle.Nat.

Munc18-Bound Syntaxin Readily Forms SNARE Complexes with Synaptobrevin in Native Plasma Membranes.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar]). We tested the possibility that in the absence of Munc18-1 too few acceptor SNARE complexes (1:1) exist in the cell to dock vesicles by overexpressing SNAP-25 on a munc18-1 null background, thereby favoring the formation of 1:1 complexes by law of mass action (Pobbati et al., 2006Pobbati A.V. Stein A. Fasshauer D. N- to C-terminal SNARE complex assembly promotes rapid membrane fusion.Science. 2006; 313: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Strikingly, SNAP-25 overexpression fully restored docking in the absence of Munc18-1 (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1D), without affecting cell morphology and total vesicle number (Figure S1 and Table S1 available online). Vesicle fusion was assayed with a combination of flash photorelease of caged-calcium to trigger fusion and membrane capacitance and amperometric measurements to monitor exocytosis (Figure 1E). SNAP-25 overexpression did not restore vesicle fusion (Figures 1E and 1F), neither during the burst phase (within 1 s of releasing calcium), nor during the sustained phase (between 1 and 5 s after calcium release), consistent with previous findings that Munc18-1 has an additional role downstream of docking (Gulyás-Kovács et al., 2007Gulyás-Kovács A. de Wit H. Milosevic I. Kochubey O. Toonen R. Klingauf J. Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Munc18-1: sequential interactions with the fusion machinery stimulate vesicle docking and priming.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8676-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cellular level of syntaxin-1 is reduced to about 50% in munc18-1 null chromaffin cells, which, however, cannot explain the docking defect in the absence of Munc18-1 (Gulyás-Kovács et al., 2007Gulyás-Kovács A. de Wit H. Milosevic I. Kochubey O. Toonen R. Klingauf J. Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Munc18-1: sequential interactions with the fusion machinery stimulate vesicle docking and priming.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8676-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, quantification of plasma membrane syntaxin-1-levels after SNAP-25 overexpression revealed a partial recovery (Figure S2), suggesting that the expressed SNAP-25 is in fact binding and stabilizing syntaxin-1. As an additional control, we overexpressed another syntaxin-1 binding protein, Munc13-1. Overexpression of Munc13-1 was previously shown to enhance secretion in chromaffin cells (Ashery et al., 2000Ashery U. Varoqueaux F. Voets T. Betz A. Thakur P. Koch H. Neher E. Brose N. Rettig J. Munc13-1 acts as a priming factor for large dense-core vesicles in bovine chromaffin cells.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3586-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and Munc13-1 is required for docking in the nematode C. elegans neurons (Hammarlund et al., 2007Hammarlund M. Palfreyman M.T. Watanabe S. Olsen S. Jorgensen E.M. Open syntaxin docks synaptic vesicles.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e198Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, Munc13-1 overexpression failed to rescue the docking phenotype in munc18-1 null cells (Figures 1C and 1D). Hence, cellular factors that interact with syntaxin-1 and promote secretion are not sufficient to rescue the munc18-1 null phenotype. To stabilize syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes in a different way, we expressed a C-terminal 49–96 fragment of synaptobrevin-2 (SybCT) in munc18-1 null cells. This fragment, which is displaced by full-length synaptobrevin, blocks formation of proposed nonproductive 2:1 syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 complexes, thereby accelerating fusion in liposome-fusion experiments in vitro (Pobbati et al., 2006Pobbati A.V. Stein A. Fasshauer D. N- to C-terminal SNARE complex assembly promotes rapid membrane fusion.Science. 2006; 313: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, C-terminal synaptobrevin fragments also help to structure the membrane-proximal portion of acceptor complexes and prevent association of the N-terminal domain of syntaxin (Melia et al., 2002Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Regulation of membrane fusion by the membrane-proximal coil of the t-SNARE during zippering of SNAREpins.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, the SybCT fragment, like SNAP-25 overexpression, rescued the docking phenotype in munc18-1 null cells (Figures 2B–2D and S1). As a control, an N-terminal 1–70 peptide (SybNT), which does not stabilize acceptor complexes or accelerate fusion (Pobbati et al., 2006Pobbati A.V. Stein A. Fasshauer D. N- to C-terminal SNARE complex assembly promotes rapid membrane fusion.Science. 2006; 313: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), did not (Figures 2A, 2C, 2D, and S1). Similar to SNAP-25 overexpression, SybCT did not rescue secretion (Figures 2E and 2F), again consistent with previous findings that Munc18-1 has a postdocking function (Gulyás-Kovács et al., 2007Gulyás-Kovács A. de Wit H. Milosevic I. Kochubey O. Toonen R. Klingauf J. Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Munc18-1: sequential interactions with the fusion machinery stimulate vesicle docking and priming.J.

Neither SybCT nor SybNT affected secretion in wild-type cells (Figure S3). Together, these experiments suggest that Munc18-1 promotes docking by promoting the formation, stability, or function of syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes. The involvement of syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes in docking suggests a direct requirement for SNAP-25 in docking, similar to syntaxin-1. We reanalyzed docking in Snap-25 null cells. Snap-25-deficient cells exhibited a strong docking phenotype (Figures 3B, 3E, 3F, 4E, and S4), which was, however, slightly less severe than in Munc18-1- or syntaxin-1-deficient cells (de Wit et al., 2006de Wit H.

To circumvent the culturing procedure altogether, we also analyzed docking in intact adrenal glands and confirmed the docking phenotype (Figures 4 and S4). In addition, we analyzed docking in intact adrenal glands that were rapidly frozen under high pressure to circumvent chemical fixation artifacts. We observed the same docking difference between Snap-25 null and wild-type chromaffin cells after rapid freezing compared to chemically fixed intact adrenal glands, as well as cultured chromaffin cells (Figures 4 and S4). Overexpression of SNAP-25 on the Snap-25 null background rescued the phenotype (Figures 3C, 3E, 3F, and S1), whereas no increase of docking was observed after SNAP-25 overexpression in wild-type cells (Figures 3E and 3F). Strikingly, in contrast to SNAP-25 overexpression in munc18-1 null cells, Munc18-1 overexpression in Snap-25 null cells did not rescue the docking phenotype (Figures 3D, 3E, 3F, and S1). These observations demonstrate that SNAP-25 is essential for docking and that Munc18-1 cannot promote docking in its absence.Figure 4Docking Defect in Snap-25 Null Mouse Chromaffin Cells In Vitro and In VivoShow full caption(A–D) Representative electron micrographs from SNAP-25 wild-type (A and C) and Snap-25 null littermate (B and D) chromaffin cells in an intact medulla of the adrenal gland after chemical fixation (A and B) or after high-pressure rapid freezing (C and D).

The total number of vesicles was significantly different between control and Snap-25 null adrenals, but not between cultured cells of both genotypes after chemical fixation. Figure 4F indicates that this difference probably arises from a reduced number in the control rather than an increase in the mutant adrenals. Probably, the slow penetration of fixative leads to a loss of vesicles by exocytosis, but only if exocytosis is not impaired. Next we attempted to identify the vesicular component to dock vesicles to syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes. Two candidates, which bind these complexes, have been identified: synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1 (Rickman et al., 2004Rickman C. Archer D.A. Meunier F.A. Craxton M. Fukuda M. Burgoyne R.D.

We recently confirmed that the synaptobrevin-2 null mutation does not produce docking phenotypes similar to munc18-1 or syntaxin-1 null (Gerber et al., 2008Gerber S.H. Rah J.C. Min S.W.

Bruns D. v-SNAREs control exocytosis of vesicles from priming to fusion.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), leaving synaptotagmin-1 as a prime candidate. Vesicle secretion is heavily impaired in synaptotagmin-1 null chromaffin cells (Voets et al., 2001aVoets T. Moser T. Lund P.E. Chow R.H. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neher E. Intracellular calcium dependence of large dense-core vesicle exocytosis in the absence of synaptotagmin I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 11680-11685Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), but docking has not been assessed. We observed a strong docking defect in synaptotagmin-1 null cells (Figures 5B, 5E, S1, and S5), similar to Snap-25 null cells. The expression level of SNAP-25, as well as Rab3, Rab27, and their effector proteins Rabphilin and Granuphilin, which are also implicated in the docking step (Fukuda, 2006Fukuda M. Rab27 and its effectors in secretory granule exocytosis: a novel docking machinery composed of a Rab27.effector complex.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were unchanged in synaptotagmin-1 null chromaffin cells (Figure S6). To further explore the possibility that synaptotagmin-1 provides the link between vesicles and syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes, we performed four additional sets of experiments. First, we tested whether SNAP-25 overexpression still rescued the docking phenotype in cells deficient for both Munc18-1 and synaptotagmin-1. Unlike overexpression of either Munc18-1 or SNAP-25 in munc18-1 single-null cells, overexpression of these proteins in munc18-1/synaptotagmin-1 double-null cells no longer rescued the docking phenotype (Figures 6A, 6C, S1, and S5). This indicates that synaptotagmin-1 is required for syntaxin-1/SNAP-25-dependent docking and also excludes the possibility that SNAP-25, synaptotagmin-1, and Munc18-1 promote docking via separate (parallel) pathways. Second, we expressed soluble tandem C2 domains (C2AB) of synaptotagmin-1 in wild-type cells, which competes with endogenous synaptotagmin-1 for binding to the syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 acceptor (Rickman et al., 2006Rickm"

Mechanistic studies of the slow-cycling fungal LOV photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) reveal the importance of reactive cysteine conformation, flavin electronic environment and solvent accessibility for adduct scission and thermal reversion. Proton inventory, pH effects, base catalysis and structural studies implicate flavin N(5) deprotonation as rate-determining for recovery. Substitutions of active site residues Ile74, Ile85, Met135 and Met165 alter photoadduct lifetimes by over four orders of magnitude in VVD, and similar changes in other LOV proteins show analogous effects. Adduct state decay rates also correlate with changes in conformational and oligomeric properties of the protein necessary for signaling. These findings link natural sequence variation of LOV domains to function and provide a means to design broadly reactive light-sensitive probes."
https://openalex.org/W2090327931,"Elaine Fuchs and colleagues present mice conditionally lacking Tcf3 and Tcf4 in the skin and show that they play a role in long-term maintenance and wound repair of both epidermis and hair follicles. Single-layered embryonic skin either stratifies to form epidermis or responds to Wnt signaling (stabilized β-catenin) to form hair follicles. Postnatally, stem cells continue to differentially use Wnt signaling in long-term tissue homeostasis. We have discovered that embryonic progenitor cells and postnatal hair follicle stem cells coexpress Tcf3 and Tcf4, which can act as transcriptional activators or repressors. Using loss-of-function studies and transcriptional analyses, we uncovered consequences to the absence of Tcf3 and Tcf4 in skin that only partially overlap with those caused by β-catenin deficiency. We established roles for Tcf3 and Tcf4 in long-term maintenance and wound repair of both epidermis and hair follicles, suggesting that Tcf proteins have both Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent roles in lineage determination."
https://openalex.org/W2024120282,"A long-sought goal in structural biology has been the imaging of membrane proteins in their membrane environments. This goal has been achieved with electron crystallography in those special cases where a protein forms highly ordered arrays in lipid bilayers. It has also been achieved by NMR methods in proteins up to 50 kilodaltons (kDa) in size, although milligram quantities of protein and isotopic labelling are required. For structural analysis of large soluble proteins in microgram quantities, an increasingly powerful method that does not require crystallization is single-particle reconstruction from electron microscopy of cryogenically cooled samples (electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM)). Here we report the first single-particle cryo-EM study of a membrane protein, the human large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel (BK), in a lipid environment. The new method is called random spherically constrained (RSC) single-particle reconstruction. BK channels, members of the six-transmembrane-segment (6TM) ion channel family, were reconstituted at low density into lipid vesicles (liposomes), and their function was verified by a potassium flux assay. Vesicles were also frozen in vitreous ice and imaged in an electron microscope. From images of 8,400 individual protein particles, a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the BK channel and its membrane environment was obtained at a resolution of 1.7-2.0 nm. Not requiring the formation of crystals, the RSC approach promises to be useful in the structural study of many other membrane proteins as well."

Recent emphasis has been placed on a potential role for canonical Wnt signaling, but investigation of this pathway in adult renal homeostasis is lacking. Here we provide evidence of a previously unidentified canonical Wnt activity in adult mammalian kidney homeostasis, the loss of which leads to cystic kidney disease. Loss of the Jouberin (Jbn) protein in mouse leads to the cystic kidney disease nephronophthisis, owing to an unexpected decrease in endogenous Wnt activity. Jbn interacts with and facilitates beta-catenin nuclear accumulation, resulting in positive modulation of downstream transcription. Finally, we show that Jbn is required in vivo for a Wnt response to injury and renal tubule repair, the absence of which triggers cystogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2090035694,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling has an increasing interest in regenerative medicine as a potential tool to repair cartilages, however the chondrogenic effect of this pathway in developing systems is controversial. Here we have analyzed the function of TGFβ signaling in the differentiation of the developing limb mesoderm <i>in vivo</i> and in high density micromass cultures. In these systems highest signaling activity corresponded with cells at stages preceding overt chondrocyte differentiation. Interestingly treatments with TGFβs shifted the differentiation outcome of the cultures from chondrogenesis to fibrogenesis. This phenotypic reprogramming involved down-regulation of <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Aggrecan</i> and up-regulation of Scleraxis, and Tenomodulin through the Smad pathway. We further show that TGFβ signaling up-regulates <i>Sox9</i> in the <i>in vivo</i> experimental model system in which TGFβ treatments induce ectopic chondrogenesis. Looking for clues explaining the dual role of TGFβ signaling, we found that TGFβs appear to be direct inducers of the chondrogenic gene <i>Sox9</i>, but the existence of transcriptional repressors of TGFβ signaling modulates this role. We identified TGF-interacting factor Tgif1 and SKI-like oncogene <i>SnoN</i> as potential candidates for this inhibitory function. Tgif1 gene regulation by TGFβ signaling correlated with the differential chondrogenic and fibrogenic effects of this pathway, and its expression pattern in the limb marks the developing tendons. In functional experiments we found that Tgif1 reproduces the profibrogenic effect of TGFβ treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2063771321,"The tumor–stroma crosstalk is a dynamic process fundamental in tumor development. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the progression of malignant hepatocytes frequently depends on transforming growth factor (TGF)-β provided by stromal cells. TGF-β induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of oncogenic Ras-transformed hepatocytes and an upregulation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. To analyse the influence of the hepatic tumor–stroma crosstalk onto tumor growth and progression, we co-injected malignant hepatocytes and myofibroblasts (MFBs). For this, we either used in vitro-activated p19ARF MFBs or in vivo-activated MFBs derived from physiologically inflamed livers of Mdr2/p19ARF double-null mice. We show that co-transplantation of MFBs with Ras-transformed hepatocytes strongly enhances tumor growth. Genetic interference with the PDGF signaling decreases tumor cell growth and maintains plasma membrane-located E-cadherin and β-catenin at the tumor–host border, indicating a blockade of hepatocellular EMT. We further generated a collagen gel-based three dimensional HCC model in vitro to monitor the MFB-induced invasion of micro-organoid HCC spheroids. This invasion was diminished after inhibition of TGF-β or PDGF signaling. These data suggest that the TGF-β/PDGF axis is crucial during hepatic tumor–stroma crosstalk, regulating both tumor growth and cancer progression."

Lipid droplets of mammalian cells are coated with one or more members of the PAT protein family, which serve important functions in regulating lipolysis. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which PAT family members, perilipin A, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP), and LSDP5, control lipolysis catalyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a major lipase in adipocytes and several non-adipose cells. We applied fluorescence microscopic tools to analyze proteins in situ in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and anisotropy Forster resonance energy transfer. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data show that ADFP and LSDP5 exchange between lipid droplet and cytoplasmic pools, whereas perilipin A does not. Differences in protein mobility do not correlate with PAT protein-mediated control of lipolysis catalyzed by HSL or endogenous lipases. Forster resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that each of the three PAT proteins bind HSL through interaction of the lipase with amino acids within the highly conserved amino-terminal PAT-1 domain. ADFP and LSDP5 bind HSL under basal conditions, whereas phosphorylation of serine residues within three amino-terminal protein kinase A consensus sequences of perilipin A is required for HSL binding and maximal lipolysis.

For most other types of cells, cytosolic lipases have not been extensively characterized. Significant perilipin expression is limited to adipose tissue and a few other types of cells; however, HSL expression is more widespread, including liver, muscle, and heart. These tissues lack perilipin under normal physiological conditions, suggesting that other PAT proteins likely control HSL-mediated lipolysis. A prior study has demonstrated that HSL binds to the surfaces of lipid droplets in skeletal muscle (20.Prats C. Donsmark M. Qvortrup K. Londos C. Sztalryd C. Holm C. Galbo H. Ploug T. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2392-2399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a tissue that expresses ADFP, TIP47, and LSDP5. Other studies have shown that the amount of ATGL or HSL that binds to the surfaces of lipid droplets is controlled by the PAT protein composition of the lipid droplet (6.Bell M. Wang H. Chen H.

Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether the association of HSL with lipid droplets is regulated by a common mechanism in adipose and non-adipose tissues. Moreover, although most PAT proteins play a role in shielding stored lipids from cytosolic lipases under basal conditions, they are not equally effective. Under these conditions, perilipin and LSDP5 exhibit equivalent strong repression of lipolysis, whereas ADFP and TIP47 are comparably less protective (7.Sztalryd C. Bell M. Lu X. Mertz P.

The goal of this study is to examine the mechanisms by which PAT proteins regulate HSL-mediated lipolysis. In this study, we have explored the hypothesis that lipolysis is regulated either by the distinct binding affinity of each PAT protein for the lipid droplet or by differences in binding interactions between HSL and the various PAT proteins. In the former case, lipase association with lipid droplets would be inversely proportional to the ease of displacement of a PAT protein from the lipid droplet surface. Alternatively, HSL may interact with amino acid sequences that are conserved between PAT family members. We have investigated the binding affinity of PAT proteins for lipid droplets using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to study the movement of PAT proteins within and into the phospholipid monolayer of lipid droplets. Additionally, we have examined interactions of HSL with perilipin A, ADFP, TIP47, and LSDP5 in adipose and non-adipose cells using the following three approaches: measurement of anisotropy Forster resonance energy transfer (AFRET) between fluorescently tagged HSL and PAT proteins; co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of HSL with PAT proteins; and assessment of lipolysis. The results show that perilipin A, ADFP, and LSDP5 diffuse rapidly within the phospholipid monolayer of an individual lipid droplet, yet only ADFP and LSDP5 exchange between lipid droplet and cytoplasmic pools. Therefore, displacement of PAT proteins from the surfaces of lipid droplets is not the major determinant that controls lipolysis. Localization of HSL to lipid droplets requires binding of HSL to highly conserved sequences within the amino termini (PAT-1 domains) of PAT proteins, whereas increased lipolysis requires both PAT protein binding and activation of HSL by PKA. Thus, our studies provide evidence that protein/protein interactions between HSL and PAT proteins regulate lipolysis in both adipose and non-adipose cells. Rabbit anti-GFP antibody was from Clontech, and mouse anti-GFP antibody was from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Antibodies raised in rabbits against HSL, perilipin, ADFP, LSDP5, and CGI-58 were previously characterized (12.Tansey J.T. Huml A.M. Vogt R. Davis K.E. Jones J.M. Fraser K.A. Brasaemle D.L.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and donkey anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit serum was from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Mouse anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). CHO-K1 and CHO Flp-In cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and Invitrogen, respectively. Both types of cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Perilipin A overexpressing CHO-K1 cells, as well as CHO-K1 clonal cell lines overexpressing HSL-GFP and TIP47-GFP fusion proteins, have been previously characterized (7.Sztalryd C. Bell M. Lu X.

The constructs peri-YFP, LSDP5-YFP, and ADFP-YFP were introduced into the CHO Flp-In cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (information for all constructs is provided in supplemental Table 1). Stably transfected CHO Flp-In cells were selected 24 h after transfection by adding hygromycin (500 μg/ml) to the growth medium. Wild-type CHO Flp-In cells were grown in the presence of Zeocin (100 μg/ml). For immunofluorescence studies, CHO-K1 and CHO Flp-In cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes with glass bottoms (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) at a density of 2 × 105 cells. The following day, cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA plasmid containing cDNA coding for the fusion protein of interest per well (co-transfections received 0.5 μg of each of two plasmids per well) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following day, cells were incubated for 12 h in growth medium supplemented with 400 μm oleic acid complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FA-free BSA), as described previously (19.Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To measure lipolysis, cells were incubated with F-12 medium containing 1% FA-free BSA for 2 h. To stimulate PKA, cAMP levels in cells were elevated by the addition of 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and 10 μm forskolin. Re-esterification of fatty acids was prevented with addition of 5 μm triacsin C. For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY). For lipolysis experiments, cells were plated at 0.5 × 10 5 cells per well in 24-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY). Cerulean and Venus mammalian expression vectors to drive expression of monomeric variants of fluorescent proteins, pECFP-C1, pEYFP-C1, and pEYFP-N1, were used to reduce intrinsic dimerization of fluorescent proteins and artifacts during Forster resonance energy transfer experiments (23.Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In addition, the enhanced CFP coding sequence has been mutated to minimize bleaching that occurs during two-photon laser scanning and to improve detection (23.Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 24.Rizzo M.A. Piston D.W. Biophys.

Names and sequences of subcloning oligonucleotide primers for all fluorescent fusion protein constructs are presented in supplemental Table 1. Perilipin A phosphorylation site point mutations were generated, as described previously (26.Marcinkiewicz A. Gauthier D. Garcia A. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11901-11909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and were then subcloned into pEYFP-N1. The 11-mer repeat region from LSDP5 (exon 6) was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5-LSDP5-E6-SacI, 5′-TAGAGCTCAAGTGGTGACATCAGCCAAGGATAC-3′, and 3-LSDP5-E6-SacI, 5′-TAGAGCTCTGCTAGCTCAGCCTCAGTCATGGGC-3′, and inserted into the SacI site of linearized pEYFP-c1 (Clontech). All constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. Confocal imaging of live cells was performed at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope equipped with an S-M incubator (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.), and controlled by a CTI temperature regulator along with humidification and an objective heater. Emitted light was passed through bandpass filters for collection of CFP (470–510 nm) and YFP (530–550 nm). For AFRET measurements, images were collected using a ×40, 1.3NA F-FLUAR oil immersion objective lens and vertically polarized 800 nm two-photon excitation. Detection was with photomultiplier tubes in the non-descanned configuration. Emitted fluorescence was filtered using either a HQ480/40m filter (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) for collection of CFP fluorescence or HQ535/30m-2p (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) for detection of YFP fluorescence. Separate photomultiplier tubes collected vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence by passing the emitted light through a broadband polarizing beam splitter. Anisotropies were calculated, as described previously (27.Piston D.W. Rizzo M.A. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 85: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To examine the movement of HSL to cellular lipid droplets, the subcellular region containing the largest area of lipid droplets was outlined, and average fluorescence intensity values of individual pixels in the enhanced CFP and enhanced YFP channels were calculated and normalized to surface area (LSM510 software). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were purified with the Melon gel IgG spin purification kit (Pierce). Rabbit serum or mouse anti-rabbit IgG was used as the negative control. Protein/protein interactions were investigated using extracts from cells co-transfected with the appropriate pair of fusion protein constructs. The list for all combinations of constructs is provided in supplemental Table 2. Cells were lysed by incubation in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm n-octyl glucoside (Sigma), 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease inhibitors, for 15 min on ice, followed by extrusion through a syringe (28.Subramanian V.

Cell lysates were pre-cleared with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 15 min on a rotator at room temperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. 250 μl of the pre-cleared supernatant was incubated with the precipitating antibodies, as noted in supplemental Table 2, at room temperature for 2 h on a rotator. 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose was then added, and suspensions were incubated at room temperature for 2 h on a rotator. Complexes were precipitated by centrifugation at 2300 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and finally mixed with 60 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing β-mercaptoethanol. 20 μl of the pre-cleared supernatant and 30 μl of the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 4–12% polyacrylamide NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the specific antibodies indicated, followed by a corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoblot signals were detected with Supersignal chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). To generate adenovirus for the expression of HSL-CFP, the HSL-CFP cDNA fragment was excised from HSL-CFP-N1 (see above) with BglII and NotI and was subsequently subcloned into a modified pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector (29.Luo J.

Correct recombination of the resulting viral vector was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions. Finally, the PacI-digested viral DNA was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells for virus production and amplification (29.Luo J. Deng Z.L. Luo X. Tang N. Song W.X. Chen J. Sharff K.A.

CHO-FlpIn cells stably expressing perilipin-YFP, LSDP5-YFP, and ADFP-YFP were seeded into a 24-well plate at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells per well. The following day, cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus for the expression of HSL-CFP-N1 (Ad-HSL-CN1) or green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP). 24 h after adenovirus transduction, the medium was replaced with growth medium supplemented with 400 μm oleic acid plus 1 μCi/well [3H]oleic acid complexed to 0.4% FA-free BSA overnight to promote triacylglycerol deposition. Cells were then incubated in the absence of supplemental fatty acids with or without 1 mm IBMX and 10 μm forskolin, with 5 μm triacsin and 1% FA-free BSA for 2 or 3 h (as indicated in the figure legends). Radioactivity released into the culture medium was quantified. Efficiency of transduction with Ad-HSL-CN1 was determined by immunoblotting. Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman, and homogenization was performed on ice in lysis buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.0). The substrate for the measurement of triglyceride hydrolase activity, containing triolein and [9,10-3H]triolein (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), was emulsified with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (3:1) using a probe sonicator (Virsonic 475, Virtis, Gardiner, NJ), as described previously (31.Contreras J.A. Danielsson B. Johansson C. Osterlund T. Langin D. Holm C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (0.1 ml) from cells expressing the constructs described in supplemental Table 1 were added to 0.1 ml of the substrate and then incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9:7) and 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium carbonate, 0.1 m boric acid, pH 10.5. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 20 min, the radioactivity in 0.5 ml of the upper phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting, as described previously (31.Contreras J.A. Danielsson B. Johansson C. Osterlund T. Langin D. Holm C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was tested using either one-way analysis of variance or a two-tailed Student's t test (GraphPad Software, Inc). We tested the hypothesis that lipolysis is regulated by the displacement of PAT proteins from lipid droplets, thus allowing cytosolic lipases to gain access to stored triglyceride. ADFP-YFP, LSDP5-YFP, and perilipin-YFP fusion proteins were stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells, which lack HSL. ATGL is present in these cells (2.Liu P. Ying Y. Zhao Y. Mundy D.I. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3787-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), although the cytosolic lipases have not been fully characterized. Lipolysis by endogenous lipases was measured under both basal conditions and following addition of forskolin and IBMX to increase levels of cAMP and activate PKA. The expression of perilipin-YFP resulted in low basal (unstimulated) lipolysis, with increased triglyceride hydrolysis upon PKA activation (Fig. 1B). Thus, as reported previously, perilipin shields stored triglycerides from cytosolic lipases under basal conditions but becomes permissive to lipolysis upon phosphorylation by PKA. Comparable low basal release of fatty acids was observed when LSDP5-YFP was expressed; however, activation of PKA failed to increase lipolysis. Thus, LSDP5 protects against basal lipolysis as effectively as perilipin but remains protective when PKA"

We also determined that lipin-2 has transcriptional coactivator activity for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-response elements similar to lipin-1 and that this activity is not affected by mutating the conserved serine. Therefore, our results indicate that the symptoms of the Majeed syndrome result from a loss of lipin-2 PAP activity. To characterize sites of lipin-2 action, we detected lipin-2 expression by in situ hybridization on whole mouse sections and by quantitative PCR of tissues relevant to Majeed syndrome. Lipin-2 was most prominently expressed in liver, where levels were much higher than lipin-1, and also in kidney, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and specific regions of the brain.

The mammalian lipin protein family is composed of three members, lipin-1, lipin-2, and lipin-3, each of which are ∼100 kDa in size and have 44–48% amino acid similarity (reviewed in Ref. 1Reue K. Brindley D.N. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2493-2503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Orthologous lipin genes are present in plants, invertebrates, and single cell eukaryotes such as yeast and plasmodium (2Péterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat.

In particular, extended stretches of 100–200 amino acids at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein (the N-LIP and C-LIP domains, respectively) are highly conserved among the three mammalian lipin family members and among species. Within the C-LIP domain are two key protein functional motifs as follows: a haloacid dehalogenase motif (DXDXT) found in a superfamily of Mg2+-dependent phosphatases (3Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J.

Lipin-1 also acts as a transcriptional coactivator in hepatocytes, where it interacts with a complex containing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) to regulate the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (5Finck B.N.

All three mammalian lipin family members function as PAP enzymes, raising the question of why multiple proteins are required. Previous gene expression studies in a panel of mouse and human tissues indicate that the three lipin genes have distinct but overlapping tissue distributions (6Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J.

Lipin-1 is most prominently expressed in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and testis, with lower expression in other tissues, including liver, kidney, and brain. Lipin-2 is expressed at high levels in liver and also to some extent in kidney, brain, and gut. Lipin-3 is expressed at much lower levels in the tissues surveyed, but mRNA is detectable in liver and gut. There is some overlap in the tissue expression of some lipin family members, making it unclear how each contributes to PAP and coactivator function. For example, lipin-1 and lipin-2 are both expressed in liver, although the relative levels and cell types in which they are expressed have not been definitively determined. Studies of PAP and coactivator activity in liver have thus far focused largely on lipin-1, which is required for normal induction of fasting-induced gene expression (5Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z.

However, recent work has also implicated lipin-2 as an important contributor to hepatic PAP activity, which is up-regulated in the liver of lipin-1-deficient mice, is induced by fasting, and is increased in obesity (9Gropler M.C.

In addition, studies employing RNA-mediated silencing of lipin-1 or lipin-2 in cultured HeLa M cells and 3T3-L1 cells indicate that lipin-1 and lipin-2 have distinct functions (10Grimsey N. Han G.S.

Further evidence that lipin-1 and lipin-2 play distinct physiological roles comes from naturally occurring mutations in mice and humans. The founding member of the lipin family, lipin-1, is the defective gene product in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse (2Péterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), which carries a null mutation of Lpin1. This mouse exhibits generalized lipodystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, insulin resistance, and increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis (11Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C.

Consistent with its tissue distribution, lipin-1 contributes the majority of PAP activity in adipose tissue and muscle (6Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Reue K. J. Biol.

Lipin-1 is also expressed in peripheral nerve, where it is required for normal Schwann cell function (14Nadra K. de Preux Charles A.S. Médard J.J. Hendriks W.T. Han G.S. Grès S. Carman G.M.

Houtkooper R.H. Hindi T. de Lonlay P. Erez G. Hubert L. Saada A. de Keyzer Y. Eshel G. Vaz F.M. Pines O. Elpeleg O. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 83: 489-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), indicating a critical role for lipin-1 in human muscle function. Based on phenotypes resulting from human and mouse mutations, lipin-1 has a unique function in vivo. Less is known about the roles of lipin-2 or lipin-3 because mutant mouse models for these family members have not been characterized. However, rare human mutations in the LPIN2 gene cause Majeed syndrome, an inflammatory disorder characterized by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, and cutaneous inflammation (18El-Shanti H.I. Ferguson P.J. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2007; 462: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Ferguson P.J. El-Shanti H.I. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2007; 19: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These symptoms indicate that lipin-2 plays a nonredundant function in vivo. Three distinct LPIN2 mutations have been identified in unrelated Arabic families. In one family, deletion of two nucleotides in the lipin-2 coding region leads to a premature stop codon in the first third of the protein (20Ferguson P.J. Chen S. Tayeh M.K. Ochoa L. Leal S.M. Pelet A. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. Majeed H.A. El-Shanti H. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 42: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), likely resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and no functional protein product. A second mutation occurs in the donor splice site for exon 17 of the LPIN2 gene, which leads to readthrough of intron sequences adding 65 irrelevant amino acid residues before reaching a stop codon (21Al-Mosawi Z.S. Al-Saad K.K. Ijadi-Maghsoodi R. El-Shanti H.I. Ferguson P.J. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although both of these mutations would prevent production of full-length lipin-2 protein, the third known mutation is a point mutation that leads to a single amino acid substitution, S734L (20Ferguson P.J. Chen S. Tayeh M.K. Ochoa L. Leal S.M. Pelet A. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. Majeed H.A. El-Shanti H. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 42: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The affected serine residue resides in the C-LIP domain downstream of the PAP active site and transcriptional coactivator motifs. This serine residue is conserved in all three lipin family members and across most species, suggesting a conformational requirement that is required either for catalytic activity and/or a transcriptional coactivator function. Here we characterize the effect of mutating the conserved serine on the PAP activity, membrane translocation properties, and coactivator functions of lipin-1 and lipin-2. Also because the Majeed syndrome affects blood, bone, and skin, this raises the question of whether lipin-2 has a direct role in the functions of these tissues. To investigate this, we perform a detailed expression analysis of lipin-2 by in situ hybridization of whole mice and qPCR of tissues relevant to Majeed syndrome. C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were fed Purina 5001 mouse chow and were maintained on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle. Animal studies were performed under approval of the UCLA and University of Alberta, Edmonton, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. V5 epitope-tagged lipin-1 and lipin-2 expression plasmids were generated as described previously (6Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3450-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides used are as follows: lipin-1AS721L (f, TACAAGTTTCTCTATTGTTTAGCACGTGCCATTGGGATGGCGGAC, and r, GTCCGCCATCCCAATGGCACGTGCTAAACAATAGAGAAACTTGTA); lipin-1AS721D (f, TACAAGTTTCTCTATTGTGACGCACGTGCCATTGGGATGGCGGAC, and r, GTCCGCCATCCCAATGGCACGTGCGTCACAATAGAGAAACTTGTA); lipin-2S731L (f, TGGCTACAAGTTTCTGTACTGTTTAGCACGTGCCATCGGCATGGC, and r, GCCATGCCGATGGCACGTGCTAAACAGTACAGAAACTTGTAGCCA); and lipin-2S731D (f, TGGCTACAAGTTTCTGTACTGTGACGCACGTGCCATCGGCATGGC, and r, GCCATGCCGATGGCACGTGCGTCACAGTACAGAAACTTGTAGCCA). HEK 293 and Hepa 1–6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed for PAP or luciferase reporter activity. PAP assays were performed as described previously (6Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3450-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 2 mm dithiothreitol (to stabilize PAP activity), protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics), phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma), and 0.15% Tween 20. We assayed PAP activity in a final volume of 0.1 ml containing 100 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg2+, and 0.6 mm PA labeled with [3H]palmitate (about 75 Ci/mol) dispersed in 0.4 mm PC and 1 mm EDTA (22Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Muñoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Martin A. Gomez-Muñoz A. Jamal Z. Brindley D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The final concentration of Tween 20 in the assay was adjusted to 0.05%. Reactions were stopped after incubation at 37 °C with 2.2 ml of chloroform containing 0.08% olive oil as carrier for neutral lipids. Then 0.8 g of basic alumina was added to adsorb the PA and any [3H]palmitate formed by phospholipase A-type activities (23Martin A. Gomez-Muñoz A. Jamal Z. Brindley D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The tubes were centrifuged, and 1 ml of the chloroform, which contains the [3H]diacylglycerol product, was dried and quantitated by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations (measured by the Bradford method) and the times of incubation (normally 30 min) were adjusted so that <10% of the PA was consumed during the incubation. Total PAP activities were calculated from measurements at three different protein concentrations to ensure the proportionality of the assay. The activities measured in parallel assays containing 8 mm N-ethylmaleimide allowed us to estimate the contribution of lipid phosphate phosphatase activity to the total activity. This former activity was negligible compared with that of the overexpressed PAP activity, and therefore no correction was necessary in these experiments. PAP activity was normalized to lipin protein expression by quantitative Western blot analysis. Equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were electrophoresed in 3–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). Protein bands were detected using ECL-Plus chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent signal was detected with the Typhoon Imaging System and quantified with ImageQuant software. Hepa 1–6 cells were transiently transfected with a PPRE-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid along with phRL-TK-renilla luciferase control vector (Promega), pCMX-PPARα, pCMX-PGC-1α, pCMX-RXR (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Tontonoz), and wild-type or mutant lipin expression plasmids. As a negative control to demonstrate specificity of the response, the PPRE-Luc reporter was replaced with a mutant version in which the PPRE sequences were deleted (ΔPPRE). Two days after transfection, cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity to account for differences in transfection efficiency. In each experiment, samples were analyzed in quadruplicate. Measurement of the capacity of wild-type and mutant lipin-2 proteins to translocate to endoplasmic reticulum membranes was based upon our previous work (24Hopewell R. Martin-Sanz P. Martin A. Saxton J. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with 60 ml of sterile ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 20 mm HEPES buffer, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15,300 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was then centrifuged for a further 400,000 × g for 40 min to pellet the microsomal fraction. This pellet was resuspended at 37 °C in homogenization buffer containing 6 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and incubated for 20 min to remove fatty acids and dissociate bound lipin from the membranes. The microsomal membranes were then collected after re-centrifuging at 4 °C as above and resuspended in the same buffer. Recombinant lipins were expressed in HEK 293 cells, which were then homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 20 mm HEPES buffer, and adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 from Sigma. The mitochondria-free supernatant was then isolated after centrifugation for 16,000 × g for 20 min to collect lipin-2 bound to endoplasmic reticulum membranes and in the cytosol. For the translocation experiments, 350 μg of liver microsomal protein was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 20 μl of homogenizing buffer containing 6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0–750 μm K+ oleate. The extract from the HEK 293 cells containing recombinant lipin (about 250 μg of total protein) was added, and the tubes were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C to equilibrate the lipins between cytosol and membrane fractions (24Hopewell R. Martin-Sanz P. Martin A. Saxton J. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Following this, the samples were cooled on ice for 5 min. The soluble proteins were then collected after centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellets (membranes) were resuspended in 45 μl of homogenization buffer. The cytosolic fractions were treated with 4 volumes of acetone at −20 °C. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resolubilized in 45 μl of homogenization buffer. Samples for Western blotting were prepared with 4× NuPAGE LDS SB from Invitrogen and then stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from C57BL/6J mouse liver with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was performed by simultaneous amplification of lipin-2 and lipin-1 using the following primers (f, ACCATCTACCTGTGGAA, and r, AGAAACTTGTAGCCATTCT), followed by restriction enzyme digestion of amplified fragment with either EcoRV or PvuII (New England Biolabs). Products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose. To generate templates for sense and antisense RNA generation, we PCR-amplified a 661-bp fragment of mouse lipin-2 cDNA (oligonucleotide primers f, cttcctaggccaccactcag, and r, tgaaataatctgccccaagg) and subcloned it into pCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Plasmids were sequences to select templates for sense and antisense probe generation and linearized by digestion with BamHI. In situ hybridization was performed using the services of Phylogeny, Inc. (Columbus, OH). 35S-UTP-labeled cRNA of transcripts was synthesized by in vitro transcription and hybridized to mouse whole body or tissue sections. Whole body sections were prepared from adult mice fasted for 4–5 h in the morning before sacrifice. Additional tissues were prepared from animals with and without fasting, as indicated. Sections were frozen, cut into 10 μm thick sections, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stored at −80 °C. Sections were then hybridized overnight at 55 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's, 50 μg/ml total yeast RNA, and 50,000–80,000 cpm/μl 35S-labeled cRNA probe. The tissues were subjected to stringent washing at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10 mm dithiothreitol and washed in phosphate-buffered saline before treatment with 20 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Following washes in 2× SSC and 0.1× SSC for 10 min at 37 °C, the slides were dehydrated, exposed to Kodak BioMaxMR x-ray film for 2–5 days, and then dipped in Kodak NTB nuclear track emulsion and exposed in light-tight boxes with desiccant at 4 °C for 10–15 days. Photographic development was carried out in Kodak D-19. Slides were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin and analyzed using both light and dark field optics. Sense control cRNA probes (identical to the mRNAs) always gave background levels of hybridization signal. Blood and tissues were isolated from adult male C57BL/6J mice. Red blood cells were isolated from fresh whole blood after centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The spleen was divided into two pieces, and the white blood cell fraction was isolated from one piece by selective lysis of erythrocytes using 2.5 ml of lysis buffer (0.15 m NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA), incubating at room temperature for 5 min, and collecting remaining cells (enriched in lymphocytes) by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal bovine serum, and the final pellet was used for RNA isolation. RNA and cDNA were prepared from blood cells or flash-frozen tissues (liver, spleen, and thymus) as described above. qPCR was performed with SYBR Green as described previously (6Donkor J.

Reue K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 93: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Primers were as follows: lipin-1, GCTCCCGAGAGAAAGTGGTGGA, GGCTTTCCATTCTCGCAGCTCCT; lipin-2, AGTTGACCCCATCACCGTAG, CCCAAAGCATCAGACTTGGT; and lipin-3, TGGAATTGGGATGACAAGGT, CACTGCAAGTACCCCTTGGT. Experimental groups were compared with appropriate control groups as indicated in the figure legends using the Student's t test and were considered statistically significant for p < 0.05. The Majeed S734L mutation in human lipin-2 alters a serine residue that is located in the C-LIP domain downstream of the enzyme active site and coactivator motifs (Fig. 1A). The affected serine residue is conserved in lipin-1, -2, and -3 in mammals and in orthologous proteins in other species. We investigated the biochemical basis for the Majeed syndrome in individuals carrying an S734L missense mutation in lipin-2 by analyzing PAP activity of recombinant mouse lipin-2 with a leucine substitution at the analogous serine residue, Ser 731. We also produced the corresponding mutation in mouse lipin-1A at Ser 724. Lipin-1 protein occurs in two forms (lipin-1A and lipin-1B) that result from alternative mRNA splicing, both of which have PAP activity (6Donkor J. Sariahmetoglu M. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3450-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The lipin-1A splice variant was utilized in all studies described here. We expressed lipin-1AS724L and lipin-2S731L in HEK 293 cells and determined PAP activity in cell lysates. Wild-type lipin-1A and lipin-2 served as positive controls. Wild-type lipin-1A and lipin-2 had robust PAP activity (63 ± 8.4 and 36 ± 3.1 nmol/mg/min, respectively) (Fig. 1B). As expected, mutation of the PAP motif (D679E) or the coactivator motif (IL693FF) abolished PAP activity, as has been reported previously (5Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The serine to leucine substitution found in Majeed patients likewise completely abolished PAP activity in both lipin-1 and lipin-2 backgrounds. Wild-type lipin-2 and lipin-2S731L proteins were expressed at similar levels, confirming that the lack of PAP activity is not related to reduced protein levels or protein stability (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Mutation of the Ser residue to aspartic acid likewise abolished PAP activity in both lipin-1A and lipin-2, indicating that activity cannot be restored by the presence of a negative charge (Fig. 1B). Studies performed several years ago, prior to the molecular identification of the lipin proteins, demonstrated that PAP enzymes reside in the cytosolic compartment of the cell. They translocate reversibly to endoplasmic reticulum membranes to catalyze the PAP reaction when cells are stimulated with unsaturated rather than saturated fatty acids (24Hopewell R. Martin-Sanz P. Martin A. Saxton J. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 485-491Crossre"
https://openalex.org/W2157019496,"Cells exposed to low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia) alter their metabolism to survive. This response, although vital during development and high-altitude survival, is now known to be a major factor in the selection of cells with a transformed metabolic phenotype during tumorigenesis. It is thought that hypoxia-selected cells have increased invasive capacity and resistance to both chemo- and radiotherapies, and therefore represent an attractive target for antitumor therapy. Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are responsible for the majority of gene expression changes under hypoxia, and are themselves controlled by the oxygen-sensing HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). It was previously shown that mutations in succinate dehydrogenase lead to the inactivation PHDs under normoxic conditions, which can be overcome by treatment with α-ketoglutarate derivatives. Given that solid tumors contain large regions of hypoxia, the reactivation of PHDs in these conditions could induce metabolic catastrophe and therefore prove an effective antitumor therapy. In this report we demonstrate that derivatized α-ketoglutarate can be used as a strategy for maintaining PHD activity under hypoxia. By increasing intracellular α-ketoglutarate and activating PHDs we trigger PHD-dependent reversal of HIF1 activation, and PHD-dependent hypoxic cell death. We also show that derivatized α-ketoglutarate can permeate multiple layers of cells, reducing HIF1α levels and its target genes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2029455788,"Desmocollin (Dsc) 1–3 and desmoglein (Dsg) 1–4, transmembrane proteins of the cadherin family, form the adhesive core of desmosomes. Here we provide evidence that Dsc3 homo- and heterophilic trans-interaction is crucial for epidermal integrity. Single molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed homophilic trans-interaction of Dsc3. Dsc3 displayed heterophilic interaction with Dsg1 but not with Dsg3. A monoclonal antibody targeted against the extracellular domain reduced homophilic and heterophilic binding as measured by AFM, caused intraepidermal blistering in a model of human skin, and a loss of intercellular adhesion in cultured keratinocytes. Because autoantibodies against Dsg1 are associated with skin blistering in pemphigus, we characterized the role of Dsc3 binding for pemphigus pathogenesis. In contrast to AFM experiments, laser tweezer trapping revealed that pemphigus autoantibodies reduced binding of Dsc3-coated beads to the keratinocyte cell surface. These data indicate that loss of heterophilic Dsc3/Dsg1 binding may contribute to pemphigus skin blistering."
https://openalex.org/W2036072875,"Trp53 loss of function has previously been shown to rescue tissue maintenance and developmental defects resulting from DNA damage or DNA-repair gene mutations. Here, we report that p53 deficiency severely exacerbates tissue degeneration caused by mosaic deletion of the essential genome maintenance regulator Atr. Combined loss of Atr and p53 (Trp53(-/-)Atr(mKO)) led to severe defects in hair follicle regeneration, localized inflammation (Mac1(+)Gr1(+) infiltrates), accelerated deterioration of the intestinal epithelium and synthetic lethality in adult mice. Tissue degeneration in Trp53(-/-)Atr(mKO) mice was characterized by the accumulation of cells maintaining high levels of DNA damage. Moreover, the elevated frequency of these damaged cells in both progenitor and downstream compartments in Trp53(-/-)Atr(mKO) skin coincided with delayed compensatory tissue renewal from residual ATR-expressing cells. Together, our results indicate that the combined loss of Atr and Trp53 in adult mice leads to the accumulation of highly damaged cells, which, consequently, impose a barrier to regeneration from undamaged progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2089087636,"The DEAD-box RNA helicases p68 (DDX5) and p72 (DDX17) have been shown to act as transcriptional co-activators for a diverse range of transcription factors, including oestrogen receptor-α (ERα). Here, we show that, although both proteins interact with and co-activate ERα in reporter gene assays, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of p72, but not p68, results in a significant inhibition of oestrogen-dependent transcription of endogenous ERα-responsive genes and oestrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 and ZR75-1 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of ERα-positive primary breast cancers for p68 and p72 indicate that p72 expression is associated with an increased period of relapse-free and overall survival (P=0.006 and 0.016, respectively), as well as being inversely associated with Her2 expression (P=0.008). Conversely, p68 shows no association with relapse-free period, or overall survival, but it is associated with an increased expression of Her2 (P=0.001), AIB-1 (P<0.001) and higher tumour grade (P=0.044). Our data thus highlight a crucial role for p72 in ERα co-activation and oestrogen-dependent cell growth and provide evidence in support of distinct but important roles for both p68 and p72 in regulating ERα activity in breast cancer."

Additionally anxiety disorders represent a significant cost to the health care system as well as employers through benefits coverage and days missed due to incapacity. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of naturopathic care on anxiety symptoms using a randomized trial. Methods Employees with moderate to severe anxiety of longer than 6 weeks duration were randomized based on age and gender to receive naturopathic care (NC) (n = 41) or standardized psychotherapy intervention (PT) (n = 40) over a period of 12 weeks. Blinding of investigators and participants during randomization and allocation was maintained. Participants in the NC group received dietary counseling, deep breathing relaxation techniques, a standard multi-vitamin, and the herbal medicine, ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) (300 mg b.i.d. standardized to 1.5% withanolides, prepared from root). The PT intervention received psychotherapy, and matched deep breathing relaxation techniques, and placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and secondary outcome measures included the Short Form 36 (SF-36), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile (MY-MOP) to measure anxiety, mental health, and quality of life respectively. Participants were blinded to the placebo-controlled intervention. Results Seventy-five participants (93%) were followed for 8 or more weeks on the trial. Final BAI scores decreased by 56.5% (p<0.0001) in the NC group and 30.5% (p<0.0001) in the PT group. BAI group scores were significantly decreased in the NC group compared to PT group (p = 0.003). Significant differences between groups were also observed in mental health, concentration, fatigue, social functioning, vitality, and overall quality of life with the NC group exhibiting greater clinical benefit. No serious adverse reactions were observed in either group. Relevance Many patients seek alternatives and/or complementary care to conventional anxiety treatments. To date, no study has evaluated the potential of a naturopathic treatment protocol to effectively treat anxiety. Knowledge of the efficacy, safety or risk of natural health products, and naturopathic treatments is important for physicians and the public in order to make informed decisions. Interpretation Both NC and PT led to significant improvements in patients' anxiety. Group comparison demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety levels in the NC group over the PT group. Significant improvements in secondary quality of life measures were also observed in the NC group as compared to PT. The whole system of naturopathic care for anxiety needs to be investigated further including a closer examination of the individual components within the context of their additive effect.

https://openalex.org/W2072245821,"Long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (L1s) are highly repetitive DNA elements that are capable of altering the human genome through retrotransposition. To protect against L1 retroposition, the cell downregulates the expression of L1 proteins by various mechanisms, including high-density cytosine methylation of L1 promoters and DICER-dependent destruction of L1 mRNAs. In this report, a large number of p53 responsive elements, or p53 DNA binding sites, were detected in L1 elements within the human genome. At least some of these p53 responsive elements are functional and can act to increase the levels of L1 mRNA expression. The p53 protein can directly bind to a short 15-nucleotide sequence within the L1 promoter. This p53 responsive element within L1 is a recent addition to evolution, appearing ∼20 million years ago. This suggests an interplay between L1 elements, which have a rich history of causing changes in the genome, and the p53 protein, the function of which is to protect against genomic changes. To understand these observations, a model is proposed in which the increased expression of L1 mRNAs by p53 actually increases, rather than decreases, the genomic stability through amplification of p53-dependent processes for genomic protection."
https://openalex.org/W2005049291,"Although frequently expressed in Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive malignancies, the role that latent membrane protein 2A and 2B (LMP2A and LMP2B) have in the oncogenic process remains obscure. Here we show a novel function for these proteins in epithelial cells, namely, their ability to modulate signalling from type I/II interferon receptors (IFNRs). We show that LMP2A- and LMP2B-expressing epithelial cells show decreased responsiveness to interferon (IFN)α and IFNγ, as assessed by STAT1 phosphorylation, ISGF3 and GAF-mediated binding to IFN-stimulated response element and IFNγ-activated factor sequence elements and luciferase reporter activation. Transcriptional profiling highlighted the extent of this modulation, with both viral proteins impacting ‘globally’ on IFN-stimulated gene expression. Although not affecting the levels of cell-surface IFNRs, LMP2A and LMP2B accelerated the turnover of IFNRs through processes requiring endosome acidification. This function may form part of EBV's strategy to limit anti-viral responses and define a novel function for LMP2A and LMP2B in modulating signalling from receptors that participate in innate immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2062625960,"The tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB2/HER2 has been implicated in cancer, in particular in breast cancer. It has been suggested that ErbB2 is constitutively activated as it lacks the extracellular tether that keeps other EGF receptor family members inactive unless they are occupied by ligand. However, Alvarado et al. now present evidence for an alternative mechanism of autoinhibition that keeps the only family member in Drosophila, dEGFR, inactive. dEGFR is most closely related to ErbB2, and the autoinhibitory interactions found in dEGFR are conserved in ErbB2, which has implications for approaches to therapeutically target ErbB2. The tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB2 has been implicated in cancer, particularly breast cancer. It has been suggested that its oncogenic signalling properties result from the absence of a key 'tether' in the extracellular region that autoinhibits other human ErbB receptors. ErbB2 is now shown to be the closest structural relative of the dEGFR receptor in Drosophila; although dEGFR also lacks a tether, a distinct set of autoinhibitory interactions keep it inactive. The orphan receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (also known as HER2 or Neu) transforms cells when overexpressed1, and it is an important therapeutic target in human cancer2,3. Structural studies4,5 have suggested that the oncogenic (and ligand-independent) signalling properties of ErbB2 result from the absence of a key intramolecular ‘tether’ in the extracellular region that autoinhibits other human ErbB receptors, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor6. Although ErbB2 is unique among the four human ErbB receptors6,7, here we show that it is the closest structural relative of the single EGF receptor family member in Drosophila melanogaster (dEGFR). Genetic and biochemical data show that dEGFR is tightly regulated by growth factor ligands8, yet a crystal structure shows that it, too, lacks the intramolecular tether seen in human EGFR, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Instead, a distinct set of autoinhibitory interdomain interactions hold unliganded dEGFR in an inactive state. All of these interactions are maintained (and even extended) in ErbB2, arguing against the suggestion that ErbB2 lacks autoinhibition. We therefore suggest that normal and pathogenic ErbB2 signalling may be regulated by ligands in the same way as dEGFR. Our findings have important implications for ErbB2 regulation in human cancer, and for developing therapeutic approaches that target novel aspects of this orphan receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1522463436,"Presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels provide calcium for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We show here that a green fluorescent protein-tagged alpha(1) subunit of the Caenorhabditis elegans CaV2 channel, UNC-2, is localized to presynaptic active zones of sensory and motor neurons. Synaptic localization of CaV2 requires the alpha(2)delta subunit UNC-36 and CALF-1 (Calcium Channel Localization Factor-1), a neuronal transmembrane protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. In calf-1 mutants, UNC-2 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, but other active-zone components and synaptic vesicles are delivered to synapses. Acute induction of calf-1 mobilizes preexisting UNC-2 for delivery to synapses, consistent with a direct trafficking role. The alpha(2)delta subunit UNC-36 is likewise required for exit of UNC-2 from endoplasmic reticulum but has additional functions. Genetic and cell biological interactions suggest that CALF-1 couples intracellular traffic to functional maturation of CaV2 presynaptic calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2090826831,"Pathogenesis of multiple myeloma is associated with an aberrant expression of pro-proliferative, pro-angiogenic and bone-metabolism-modifying factors by malignant plasma cells. Given the frequently long time span from diagnosis of early-stage plasma cell dyscrasias to overt myeloma and the mostly low proliferation rate of malignant plasma cells, we hypothesize these to similarly express a novel class of inhibitory factors of potential prognostic relevance. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) represent possible candidates as they inhibit proliferation, stimulate bone formation and have an effect on the survival of cancer patients. We assessed the expression of BMPs and their receptors by Affymetrix DNA microarrays (n=779) including CD138-purified primary myeloma cell samples (n=635) of previously untreated patients. BMP6 is the only BMP expressed by malignant and normal plasma cells. Its expression is significantly lower in proliferating myeloma cells, myeloma cell lines or plasmablasts. BMP6 significantly inhibits the proliferation of myeloma cell lines, survival of primary myeloma cells and in vitro angiogenesis. A high BMP6 expression in primary myeloma cell samples delineates significantly superior overall survival for patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy independent of conventional prognostic factors (International Staging System (ISS) stage, beta(2) microglobulin)."
https://openalex.org/W2101127767,"Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant bone-associated tumor of children and young adults. Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma express the EWS/FLI fusion protein. EWS/FLI functions as an aberrant ETS-type transcription factor and serves as the master regulator of Ewing's sarcoma-transformed phenotype. We recently showed that EWS/FLI regulates one of its key targets, NR0B1, through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Whether other critical EWS/FLI targets are also regulated by GGAA-microsatellites was unknown. In this study, we combined transcriptional analysis, whole genome localization data, and RNA interference knockdown to identify glutathione S-transferase M4 (GSTM4) as a critical EWS/FLI target gene in Ewing's sarcoma. We found that EWS/FLI directly binds the GSTM4 promoter, and regulates GSTM4 expression through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Reduction of GSTM4 levels caused a loss of oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma whose tumors had higher levels of GSTM4 expression had worse outcomes than those with lower expression levels. These data show that GSTM4 contributes to the cancerous behavior of Ewing's sarcoma and define a wider role for GGAA-microsatellites in EWS/FLI function than previously appreciated. These data also suggest a novel therapeutic resistance mechanism, in which the central oncogenic abnormality directly regulates a resistance gene."
https://openalex.org/W1980383200,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is probably a heterotrimer with three well characterized subunits (αβγ). In humans an additional δ-subunit (δ-hENaC) exists but little is known about its function. Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, we compared the functional properties of αβγ- and δβγ-hENaC and investigated whether δβγ-hENaC can be proteolytically activated. The amiloride-sensitive ENaC whole-cell current (ΔIami) was about 11-fold larger in oocytes expressing δβγ-hENaC than in oocytes expressing αβγ-hENaC. The 2-fold larger single-channel Na+ conductance of δβγ-hENaC cannot explain this difference. Using a chemiluminescence assay, we demonstrated that an increased channel surface expression is also not the cause. Thus, overall channel activity of δβγ-hENaC must be higher than that of αβγ-hENaC. Experiments exploiting the properties of the known βS520C mutant ENaC confirmed this conclusion. Moreover, chymotrypsin had a reduced stimulatory effect on δβγ-hENaC whole-cell currents compared with its effect on αβγ-hENaC whole-cell currents (2-fold versus 5-fold). This suggests that the cell surface pool of so-called near-silent channels that can be proteolytically activated is smaller for δβγ-hENaC than for αβγ-hENaC. Proteolytic activation of δβγ-hENaC was associated with the appearance of a δ-hENaC cleavage product at the cell surface. Finally, we demonstrated that a short inhibitory 13-mer peptide corresponding to a region of the extracellular loop of human α-ENaC inhibited ΔIami in oocytes expressing αβγ-hENaC but not in those expressing δβγ-hENaC.

It is localized in the apical membranes of sodium-absorbing epithelia like the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, respiratory epithelia, distal colon, and sweat and salivary ducts. In these epithelia ENaC is the rate-limiting step for sodium absorption and plays a critical role in the maintenance of body sodium balance (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol.

Each subunit contains two transmembrane domains (M1 and M2), a large extracellular loop, and short intracellular N and C termini.

In the absence of a crystal structure for ENaC, its subunit stoichiometry remains a matter of debate. Nevertheless, the recently published crystal structure of the related acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1 suggests that ENaC is probably a heterotrimer (14Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E.

Another difference is the higher single-channel Na+ conductance of δβγ-hENaC (∼12 pS) compared with αβγ-hENaC (∼5 pS) (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both channels have a similar single-channel conductance for Li+ (∼7 pS). Thus, δβγ-hENaC is more permeable for Na+ than for Li+, whereas αβγ-hENaC has a higher permeability for Li+ than for Na+. Finally, δβγ-hENaC but not αβγ-hENaC has been reported to be activated by extracellular protons and may contribute to pH sensing (18Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol.

The channel is thought to be in its mature and active form in its cleaved state, but there is evidence for the presence of both cleaved and noncleaved channels in the plasma membrane (42Hughey R.P.

Cleavage may activate the channel by changing its conformation probably by releasing inhibitory peptides from the extracellular loops of α- and γ-ENaC (43Carattino M.D. Passero C.J. Steren C.A.

Cleavage of the γ-subunit seems to be particularly important for channel activation by extracellular proteases (39Diakov A. Bera K. Mokrushina M. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. J.

As far as we know it has not yet been shown whether the δ-subunit is also proteolytically processed and whether δβγ-ENaC can be proteolytically activated by exposing the channel to extracellular proteases.In this study we investigated the functional properties of αβγ- and δβγ-hENaC expressed in X. laevis oocytes. Our starting point was the striking observation that the amiloride-sensitive whole-cell current (ΔIami) was significantly larger in oocytes expressing δβγ-hENaC compared with control oocytes expressing αβγ-hENaC. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which the δ-subunit enhances ENaC activity. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the δ-subunit alters proteolytic ENaC activation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we compared the functional properties of αβγ- and δβγ-hENaC heterologously expressed in X. laevis oocytes. The key findings of our study are the following: 1) ENaC whole-cell currents are larger in oocytes expressing δβγ-hENaC compared with those of control oocytes expressing αβγ-hENaC; 2) δβγ-hENaC can be stimulated by chymotrypsin, but the degree of stimulation and cleavage pattern differs from that of αβγ-hENaC. To our knowledge this is the first study to report evidence for proteolytic activation of δβγ-hENaC and to demonstrate that replacing the α-subunit by the δ-subunit increases ENaC activity in co-expression experiments with βγ-hENaC.In the experiments in which we compared base-line δβγ-hENaC and αβγ-hENaC currents in matched groups of oocytes, we made every effort to ensure that the amount and quality of the injected cRNAs were comparable. Experiments were repeated in several different batches of oocytes using several different cRNA preparations. Moreover, we confirmed that the level of protein expression of the three subunits was similar in the αβγ- and δβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes. Under these conditions ENaC currents were on average about 11-fold larger in δβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes compared with those in αβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes. The effect of the δ-subunit to enhance ENaC currents was robust and preserved even when we used α- and δ-subunits with tagged N and C termini. Taken together our findings indicate that the observed difference is not an artifact of our experimental design or the expression system but is caused by δ-ENaC altering the functional properties of the heteromeric channel. It is unclear why our findings differ from those of a previous study in which ENaC whole-cell currents were found to be larger in αβγ-hENaC- than in δβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes (8Giraldez T. Afonso-Oramas D. Cruz-Muros I. Garcia-Marin V. Pagel P. González-Hernández T. Alvarez de la Rosa D. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1304-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the latter findings are based on a small number of measurements (five oocytes per group) possibly using oocytes from different batches. It is unlikely that the discrepancy with our findings can be attributed to the longer δ-hENaC splice variant used in the latter study because no functional differences have been observed between the two splice variants (10Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Using a semi-quantitative chemiluminescence assay, we demonstrated that channel surface expression is roughly similar in αβγ- and δβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes. Even though with our method we cannot rule out a modest effect of δ-hENaC on channel trafficking, our results indicate that an increase in channel surface expression is not the underlying cause for the 11-fold larger whole-cell currents observed in the δβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes. The single-channel sodium conductance of δβγ-hENaC (∼12 pS) is known to be larger than that of αβγ-hENaC (∼5 pS) (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Indeed, our ion substitution experiments, replacing Na+ by Li+ in the bath solution, indicate that this contributes to the larger whole-cell currents in δβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes. However, the different single-channel sodium conductance cannot account for the observed 11-fold difference in the whole-cell currents. Collectively, these findings indicate that the major contributing factor is an increased average Po of δβγ-hENaC.In outside-out patches we observed a single-channel Po of ∼0.9 for δβγ-hENaC, which is higher than the single-channel Po of ∼0.5 usually reported for αβγ-ENaC but with a great degree of variability (3Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In contrast to our findings, the Po of δβγ-hENaC has been reported to be ∼0.5 in a previous study using cell-attached patch clamp recordings (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, this latter approach has the inherent difficulty that amiloride cannot be used to determine the current level at which all channels are closed. This can lead to an underestimation of channel Po and may explain the discrepant findings. Our observation that the Po of δβγ-hENaC observed in single-channel patch clamp recordings is probably higher than that of αβγ-ENaC supports our conclusion that the overall activity of δβγ-hENaC at the cell surface is higher than that of αβγ-ENaC. From previous studies we have to assume that different pools of ENaC with different Po values are present at the plasma membrane, including near-silent channels that can be activated by extracellular proteases (39Diakov A. Bera K. Mokrushina M. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4587-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 61Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol.

Physiol. 2005; 288: L813-L819Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because of their low Po of less than 0.05 (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 47Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Mérillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 68Rossier B.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the latter channels will easily escape detection in single-channel recordings. The presence of a population of near-silent channels in addition to channels with a Po of close to 1 could explain the conundrum that we observed a 2-fold stimulatory effect of chymotrypsin on ENaC whole-cell currents in oocytes expressing δβγ-hENaC with a single-channel Po of close to 1. Indeed, if all the channels at the cell surface had a base-line Po of close to 1, this 2-fold increase could only be explained by an additional insertion of channels into the plasma membrane. However, we demonstrated that proteolytic activation of δβγ-hENaC was not associated with an increase in channel surface expression. Thus, the most likely explanation for this observed 2-fold increase in ENaC whole-cell currents is that chymotrypsin activates a pool of near-silent δβγ-hENaC that co-exists with a pool of channels with a high Po. Proteolytic activation of rat αβγ-ENaC has previously been shown to be mediated by a dual effect as follows: (i) the recruitment of near-silent channels, and (ii) an increase in Po of channels that are already active (39Diakov A. Bera K. Mokrushina M. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4587-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This latter effect is unlikely to contribute in a major way to the proteolytic activation of δβγ-hENaC because its single-channel Po is already high. Thus, a higher base-line single-channel Po and a reduced pool of near-silent channels probably explain the reduced stimulatory effect of chymotrypsin on δβγ-hENaC.That the base-line activity of δβγ-hENaC at the plasma membrane is higher than that of αβγ-ENaC is also supported by the reduced stimulatory effect of MTSET on δβγ-hENaC in the presence of the S520C mutant β-subunit. The S520C mutant of β-hENaC is analogous to the previously described S518C mutation in the β-subunit of rat ENaC. Single-channel recordings of the latter have shown that this mutant channel can be converted to a channel with a Po of close to 1 by MTSET (39Diakov A. Bera K. Mokrushina M. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4587-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 48Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the corresponding mutation in human β-hENaC behaves in a similar way (32Lu M. Echeverri F. Kalabat D. Laita B. Dahan D.S. Smith R.D. Xu H. Staszewski L. Yamamoto J. Ling J. Hwang N. Kimmich R. Li P. Patron E. Keung W. Patron A. Moyer B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11981-11994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mutant ENaC can be activated by MTSET only when the channel is in its open state (48Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, near-silent channels, at least occasionally, may open long enough for MTSET to act on them and to convert them to channels with a high open probability. Thus, MTSET is likely to increase the Po of both active and near-silent channels in whole-cell experiments. We found that MTSET increased δβS520Cγ-hENaC whole-cell currents about 2-fold and αβS520Cγ-hENaC whole-cell currents about 7-fold, which is in good agreement with the chymotrypsin data. Provided that MTSET increases Po of both δβS520Cγ-hENaC and αβS520Cγ-hENaC to nearly 1, these findings indicate that the average Po prior to the application of MTSET was ∼0.5 for δβγ-hENaC and ∼0.14 for αβγ-hENaC. With this assumption the av"

We previously reported that LpE protect retinal ganglion neurons from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of trophic additives (Hayashi, H., Campenot, R. B., Vance, D. E., and Vance, J. E. (2007) J. Neurosci. 27, 1933-1941). LpE bind to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 and initiate a signaling pathway that involves activation of protein kinase Cdelta and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. We now show that uptake of LpE is not required for the neuroprotection. Experiments with inhibitors of phospholipase Cgamma1 and RNAi knockdown studies demonstrate that activation of phospholipase Cgamma1 is required for the anti-apoptotic signaling pathway induced by LpE. In addition, the protein phosphatase-2B, calcineurin, is involved in a neuronal death pathway induced by removal of trophic additives, and LpE inhibit calcineurin activation. LpE also attenuate neuronal death caused by oxidative stress. Moreover, physiologically relevant apoE3-containing lipoproteins generated by apoE3 knock-in mouse astrocytes more effectively protect neurons from apoptosis than do apoE4-containing lipoproteins. Because inheritance of the apoE4 allele is the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease, the reduced neuroprotection afforded by apoE4-containing LpE might contribute to the neurodegeneration characteristic of this disease."

The imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants plays an important role in the development of various pulmonary diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5Christofidou-Solomidou M. Muzykantov V.R. Treat Respir. Med. 2006; 5: 47-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Rahman I. Ther. Adv. Respir. Dis. 2008; 2: 351-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress also affects inflammatory responses and alters the balance of cytokines (7Mastruzzo C. Crimi N. Vancheri C. Monaldi. Arch. Chest Dis. 2002; 57: 173-176PubMed Google Scholar). To neutralize free radicals and counteract the detrimental effect of ROS, cells express a wide array of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. These include “direct antioxidants,” such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as “indirect” antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), metallothioneins, and NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase (8Cho H.Y.

Proper regulation of these antioxidant enzymes is essential for mammals to maintain balances between oxidants and antioxidants. Among antioxidant enzymes, GSTs are a family of Phase II enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of the tripeptide GSH to a variety of hydrophobic, electrophilic, and cytotoxic substrates. The majority of GST substrates are either xenobiotics or products of oxidative stress that are toxic and/or carcinogenic to cells. The formation of a thioether bond between electrophiles and GSH almost always yields a conjugate that is less reactive than the parent compounds, and therefore the GST-mediated conjugation generally results in xeno- and endobiotic detoxification and cancer prevention (10Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). LXRs, including the α and β isoforms, belong to the orphan nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. LXRα shows high expression in selected tissues, including the liver, lung, adipose, intestine, and kidney. In contrast, LXRβ is ubiquitously expressed (for a review, see Ref. 11Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). LXRs regulate gene expression by forming heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor and binding of LXR-retinoid X receptor heterodimers to LXR-responsive elements found in the target gene promoters. LXR-responsive elements are typically composed of two direct hexameric repeats separated by four nucleotides (DR4) (12Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

LXRs have also been shown to inhibit inflammatory gene expression and prevent either bacterial or LPS-triggered inflammatory responses in macrophages (22Joseph S.B. Castrillo A. Laffitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In addition, LXR signaling can impact antimicrobial responses by regulating macrophage gene expression and apoptosis (23Joseph S.B. Bradley M.N. Castrillo A. Bruhn K.W. Mak P.A. Pei L. Hogenesch J.

Although the hepatointestinal functions of LXRs have been well documented, whether and how LXRs play a role in the pathophysiology of the lung remain largely unknown. In this study, we have uncovered a novel role for LXRs in preventing lung injury. The pulmonary protective function of LXRs is likely due to the positive regulation of antioxidant enzymes by these receptors. The LXRα knock-in targeting construct was generated by placing VP-LXRα cDNA (14Uppal H. Saini S.P. Moschetta A. Mu Y. Zhou J. Gong H. Zhai Y. Ren S. Michalopoulos G.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Xie W. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in-frame and immediately after the endogenous ATG start codon in the mouse LXRα locus. VP-LXRα cDNA was constructed by fusing the VP16 activation domain of the herpes simplex virus in-frame to the amino terminus of mouse LXRα cDNA. The SV40 poly(A) sequence was added downstream to terminate the transcription of LXRα, and the PGK-Neo selection marker was engineered thereafter. The selections of short arm and long arm sequences predict that after homologous recombination, part of exon 2, exons 3–7, and the introns in between will be replaced by the VP-LXRα-SV40-PGK-Neo cassette. The targeting construct was linearized by NotI digestion and electroporated into the Strain 129S1/X1 mouse embryonic stem cell line R1 (24Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) under the conditions previously described (25Homanics G.E. Ferguson C. Quinlan J.J. Daggett J. Snyder K. Lagenaur C. Mi Z.P. Wang X.H. Grayson D.R. Firestone L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After G418 (200 μg/ml) selection, embryonic stem cell clones were picked, expanded, and screened by Southern blot analysis. Positive clones were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Chimeric male progeny were crossed with C57BL/6J females. Germ line transmission of the knock-in allele was detected in agouti progeny by Southern blot analysis. A three-primer PCR was designed for subsequent mouse genotyping, with a forward primer and a reverse primer from LXRα, yielding a 466-bp product from the wild type allele. The knock-in reverse primer is from the VP16 coding sequence and amplified a 362-bp product from the knock-in allele. The mice used in this study were maintained in the C57BL/6J-Strain 129S1/X1 mixed background. Wild type mice of the same genetic background were used where applicable. Lung total RNA from three LXR-KI male mice was pooled, paired with pooled samples from three WT males, and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Pathology Gene Array Laboratory. We used the Affymetrix mouse 430A Chip (Santa Clara, CA) that contains 45,000 probe sets to analyze the expression level of over 39,000 transcripts and variants from over 34,000 well characterized mouse genes. After hybridization, the chips were scanned in an Agilent ChipScanner to detect hybridization signals. Hybridization data were exported and analyzed using GeneSpring 4.2 software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood, CA). The microarray data has been deposited to the NCBI/Gene Expression Omnibus website. For the LPS treatment, 12-week-old mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and subjected to intranasal instillation of LPS (10 μg/each mouse) or vehicle (saline) in a volume of 50 μl as previously described (26Szarka R.J. Wang N. Gordon L. Nation P.N. Smith R.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from Sigma. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after the intranasal instillation. For LXR ligand treatment, daily gavage of TO1317 (10 mg/kg) or GW3965 (20 mg/kg) in a total volume of 100 μl was given starting 7 days prior to the LPS treatment. Twenty-four hours after LPS instillation, the mice were sacrificed, and BAL fluids were collected by washing three times with 0.8 ml of sterile saline. The recovered BAL fluids were centrifuged at 300 rpm for 10 min. The total BAL cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The polymorphonuclear neutrophils were selectively identified and counted after staining with the Wright solution. The cell-free supernatant fluid was collected and subjected to the measurement of protein concentration using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and TBARS assay. The formation of TBARS during an acid-heating reaction was measured as previously described (27Ritter C. Andrades M.E. Reinke A. Menna-Barreto S. Moreira J.C. Dal-Pizzol F. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 32: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μl of BAL fluid was mixed with 0.5 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%) and 0.5 ml of thiobarbituric acid (0.67%) and then heated in a boiling water bath for 30 min. TBARS was determined spectrophotometrically by the absorbance at 535 nm using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as the external standard. To measure MPO activity in the lung, lung tissues were homogenized and sonicated in 50 mm KPO4 buffer containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and 5 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing the substrate H2O2 (0.0006%). In the presence of O-dianisidine dihydrochloride (167 μg/ml), the MPO activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the change in absorbance at 460 nm over 3 min using a 96-well plate reader from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). The results are presented as OD change/min/mg of protein (28Bradley P.P. Priebat D.A. Christensen R.D. Rothstein G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 78: 206-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). SOD, catalase, and GST activities were measured as described previously (29Gong H. Singh S.V. Singh S.P. Mu Y. Lee J.H. Saini S.P. Toma D. Ren S. Kagan V.E. Day B.W. Zimniak P. Xie W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, lung and tissues were homogenized in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 2 mm EDTA using a Brinkmann/Kinematica Polytron PT3000 homogenizer equipped with a PT/DA 3007/2 probe (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY). Ten percent (w/v) homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immediately used for the measurement of GST activity using an assay kit from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). SOD activity was measured according to the method described by Paoletti and Mocali (30Paoletti F. Mocali A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Catalase activity was measured by the rate of decrease in hydrogen peroxide absorbance at 240 nm as described previously (31Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18516) Google Scholar). One unit of catalase activity was defined as the rate constant of the first order reaction. The catalase activity was expressed as units/mg of protein. One ml of cell-free BAL fluid was mixed with 3.75 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2; v/v), followed by the addition of 1.25 ml of chloroform and 1.25 ml of double distilled H2O. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The lower lipid phase was collected and dried under nitrogen gas (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). For phospholipid assay, the lipid extract was added with 0.65 ml of perchloric acid and was placed in a heat block at 180 °C for 30 min. After adding 3.3 ml of H2O, 0.5 ml of 2.5% molybdate, and 0.5 ml of 10% ascorbic acid, the sample was placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The absorbance of cooled samples was read at 800 nm. The solution of KH2PO4 (100 μg P/ml) served as the external standard (33Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). Mouse lung tissues were inflation-fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 20 cm of H2O pressure. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5-μm thickness, and the sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin for general histological evaluation. For immunohistochemistry, frozen sections were fixed with acetone, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. The slides were blocked with 5% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min at room temperature. The slides were then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-LXRα antibody (PP-PPZ0412–00) from Perseus Proteomics (Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4 °C. The slides were rinsed and then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody. The slides were rinsed again, sequentially incubated with streptavidin peroxidase followed by aminoethyl carbazole substrate solution, then rinsed, and counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunofluorescence, frozen sections were fixed with acetone, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% donkey serum for 30–60 min and rinsed for three times. The slides were incubated with a mouse anti-LXRα antibody (1:100 dilution) and a rabbit anti-surfactant protein B (SPB) antibody (1:200 dilution; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution) for 1 h in a darkroom at room temperature. The slides were rinsed three times and visualized using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Total RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen. Real time PCR using SYBR Green-based assays was performed with the ABI 7300 real time PCR system as we previously described (34Zhou J. Zhai Y. Mu Y. Gong H. Uppal H. Toma D. Ren S. Evans R.M. Xie W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15013-15020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). All real time PCR results were normalized against the housekeeping gene cyclophilin. PCR primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. When the expression of LXRs was compared between tissue types and/or cell lines, LXRα and β copy numbers were calculated according to the standard curve of five serial dilutions of double-stranded plasmid DNA ranging from 103 to 107 molecules. In these cases, LXR copy numbers were expressed as copy numbers/μg of RNA. Northern blot analysis using [32P]dCTP-labeled full-length mouse LXRα cDNA probe was performed as we previously described (28Bradley P.P. Priebat D.A. Christensen R.D. Rothstein G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 78: 206-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and saturated humidity (5% CO2, 95% air) in a CO2 incubator. The cells were pretreated with GW3965 (10 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 24 h, followed by a 24-h treatment of LPS (100 nm). Total RNA was extracted and subjected to real time PCR analysis. The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test were used for statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism version 4.0. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. LXRα is known for its high expression in the liver, intestine, and kidney (11Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We showed that LXRα was also expressed in mouse lung and human lung cancer cells. The mRNA abundance of LXRα in the mouse lung was ∼20% that of the liver based on the copy numbers determined by real time PCR (Fig. 1A). LXRβ is known to be ubiquitously expressed, and its mRNA abundance in the lung was similar to that in the liver (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LXRα (Fig. 1B, panel b) was expressed in both type I and type II epithelial cells based on the morphologies of both cell types. It appeared that LXRα is expressed in both the nuclei and cytoplasm. The expression of LXRα in type II cells was further confirmed by immunofluorescence and confocal analysis on the expression and localization of LXRα and SPB, a specific marker of type II epithelial cells (Fig. 1B, panels c–e). It has been reported that in type II epithelial cells, SP-B precursors were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi complex, and the multivesicular bodies, whereas the mature SP-B was found in multivesicular and lamellar bodies, where it is stored and secreted into the alveolar space (35Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. van Golde L.M. Geuze H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L479-L486PubMed Google Scholar). Our antibody detects both premature and mature SPB and showed an uneven distribution of SPB. Both LXRα and LXRβ were also expressed in A549 cells, a human lung cancer cell line derived from type II cells (36Jia L. Xu M. Zhen W. Shen X. Zhu Y. Wang W. Wang X. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C47-C55Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mRNA abundance of LXRα in A549 was ∼30 and 50% of that of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma HepG2 cells, respectively (Fig. 1C). The expression of LXRβ in A549 cells was similar to that of the primary hepatocytes (Fig. 1C). To examine the effect of LXRα activation in vivo, including the pathophysiological relevance of this activation in the lung, we created LXRα knock-in mice that express a constitutively activated LXRα (VP-LXRα). The strategy we used to create VP-LXRα knock-in (LXR-KI) mice is outlined in Fig. 2A. The VP-LXRα cDNA was constructed by fusing the VP16 activation domain of the herpes simplex virus to the amino terminus of mouse LXRα sequence (14Uppal H. Saini S.P. Moschetta A. Mu Y. Zhou J. Gong H. Zhai Y. Ren S. Michalopoulos G.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Xie W. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). VP-LXRα shares the same DNA binding specificity as its wild type (WT) counterpart and activates LXR-responsive gene expression in the absence of an exogenously added ligand in cell cultures and in transgenic mice (14Uppal H. Saini S.P. Moschetta A. Mu Y. Zhou J. Gong H. Zhai Y. Ren S. Michalopoulos G.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Xie W. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the targeting construct, VP-LXRα cDNA was placed in-frame and immediately after the endogenous ATG start codon of the mouse LXRα locus. This construct was designed so that after DNA homologous recombination, the sequence spanning part of exon 2 (starting from start codon ATG), exons 3–7, and the introns in between would be replaced by VP-LXRα. As such, VP-LXRα will be expressed under the control of the endogenous LXRα promoter, whereas the WT LXRα will be disrupted in the homozygous LXR-KI mice. The ES clones were screened by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). After ES cell blastocyst injection, germ line transmission of the knock-in allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. As predicted in Fig. 2A and shown in Fig. 2B, NcoI digestion of mouse tail genomic DNA produced a 4.8-kb fragment from the WT allele and a 3.2-kb fragment from the knock-in allele at the short arm region. LXR-KI mice were viable and fertile. The phenotype of LXR-KI mice was indistinguishable from that of WT mice. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that the knock-in allele was expressed in a panel of tissues of heterozygous and homozygous LXR-KI mice (Fig. 2C, top panel), and the results were confirmed by Northern analysis (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). As shown in Fig. 2C, the knock-in allele was expressed in both heterozygous and homozygous LXR-KI mice, whereas the endogenous LXRα transcript was detected only in the WT and heterozygous mice. We noticed that the expression level of the knock-in allele was not always consistent with the WT allele. For example, VP-LXRα expression in knock-in mouse liver was lower than the endogenous LXRα in the liver of WT mice (Fig. 2C). We reason this was due to the knock-in of VP-LXRα cDNA, so the efficiency of RNA splicing might be different between the knock-in and the endogenous alleles. The hepatic expression of LXR target genes, such as stearoyl CoA desaturase 1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase, acetyl CoA carboxylase 1, and lipoprotein lipase, was increased in the LXR-KI mice as expected (Fig. 2D). LXR-KI mice also showed hepatic steatosis (data not shown), suggesting that the VP-LXRα knock-in allele was fully functional in vivo. To better understand the biological consequences of LXR activation in the lung, we performed microarray analysis on lung tissues from LXR-KI mice and their wild type littermates. Total RNA from lung tissues of three LXR-KI male mice was pooled. Gene expression was compared with pooled samples from three WT male mice. In the microarray analysis, we found that the expression of several antioxidant genes was induced in the lung of LXR-KI mice. supplemental Table S2 represents a partial list of genes whose expression was induced in the lung of LXR-KI mice. These include the induction of Gsta2, Gsta4, Gstm1, Gstp1, Gpx1, Gpx3, catalase, Mt1, and Mt2. The activation of antioxidant gene expression was confirmed by real time PCR analysis (Fig. 3A). The same pattern of antioxidant gene regulation was observed in the lung of WT mice treated with the LXR agonist TO1317 (Fig. 3B). The induction of pulmonary antioxidant genes prompted us to determine whether activation of LXR in the lung confers resistance to injury caused by oxidative toxicants, such as LPS. As shown in Fig. 4A, intranasal instillation of LPS into the lung of WT mice resulted in a dramatic increase in total cell numbers in the BAL fluid as expected (26Szarka R.J. Wang N. Gordon L. Nation P.N. Smith R.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In a sharp contrast, LPS-induced BAL cell number increase in LXR-KI mice was reduced to ∼25% of the LPS-treated WT mice (Fig. 4A). A decreased BAL cell number was also observed in WT mice treated with the LXR agonist GW3965 (Fig. 4A). A simi"
https://openalex.org/W2056838445,"p63, a p53 family member, plays an essential role in epidermal development by regulating its transcriptional program. Here we report a previously uncovered role of p63 in controlling bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is required for maintaining low expression levels of several non-epidermal genes. p63 represses transcription of the inhibitory Smad7 and activates Bmp7, thereby sustaining BMP signaling. In the absence of p63, compromised BMP signaling leads to inappropriate non-epidermal gene expression in postnatal mouse keratinocytes and in embryonic epidermis. Reactivation of BMP signaling by Smad7 knockdown and/or, to a lesser extent, by BMP treatment suppresses expression of non-epidermal genes in the absence of p63. Canonical BMP/Smad signaling is essential for control of non-epidermal genes as use of a specific inhibitor, or simultaneous knockdown of Smad1 and Smad5 counteract suppression of non-epidermal genes. Our data indicate that p63 prevents ectopic expression of non-epidermal genes by a mechanism involving Smad7 repression and, to a lesser extent, Bmp7 induction, with consequent enhancement of BMP/Smad signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2082194694,"The functional diversity of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is mainly regulated by protein interactions. In this study, we describe a new interaction with the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase cyclophilin 18 (Cyp18). The interaction reduced the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 in vitro, whereas the inhibition of the interaction increased p53-reporter gene activity in vivo. The active site of the folding helper enzyme Cyp18 was directly involved in binding. The proline-rich region (amino acids 64–91) of p53 was most likely responsible for the observed binding because a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 68–81 of p53 inhibited this interaction, and a p53 variant containing a proline residue at position 72 (p53P72) interacted with Cyp18 more effectively than the corresponding p53R72 variant. Impairment of the Cyp18–p53 interaction induced an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, which was more pronounced when p53P72 was expressed compared with p53R72 in an otherwise isogenic cellular background. Moreover, p53-dependent apoptosis was elevated in Cyp18 knockout cells, suggesting an antiapoptotic potential of Cyp18–p53 complexes. Functional in vivo data hint to a possible clinical relevance of the p53–Cyp18 interaction observed."
https://openalex.org/W2127992714,"New insecticides are urgently needed because resistance to current insecticides allows resurgence of disease-transmitting mosquitoes while concerns for human toxicity from current compounds are growing. We previously reported the finding of a free cysteine (Cys) residue at the entrance of the active site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in some insects but not in mammals, birds, and fish. These insects have two AChE genes (AP and AO), and only AP-AChE carries the Cys residue. Most of these insects are disease vectors such as the African malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto) or crop pests such as aphids. Recently we reported a Cys-targeting small molecule that irreversibly inhibited all AChE activity extracted from aphids while an identical exposure caused no effect on the human AChE. Full inhibition of AChE in aphids indicates that AP-AChE contributes most of the enzymatic activity and suggests that the Cys residue might serve as a target for developing better aphicides. It is therefore worth investigating whether the Cys-targeting strategy is applicable to mosquitocides. Herein, we report that, under conditions that spare the human AChE, a methanethiosulfonate-containing molecule at 6 microM irreversibly inhibited 95% of the AChE activity extracted from An. gambiae s. str. and >80% of the activity from the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti L.) or the northern house mosquito (Culex pipiens L.) that is a vector of St. Louis encephalitis. This type of inhibition is fast ( approximately 30 min) and due to conjugation of the inhibitor to the active-site Cys of mosquito AP-AChE, according to our observed reactivation of the methanethiosulfonate-inhibited AChE by 2-mercaptoethanol. We also note that our sulfhydryl agents partially and irreversibly inhibited the human AChE after prolonged exposure (>4 hr). This slow inhibition is due to partial enzyme denaturation by the inhibitor and/or micelles of the inhibitor, according to our studies using atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. These results support our view that the mosquito-specific Cys is a viable target for developing new mosquitocides to control disease vectors and to alleviate resistance problems with reduced toxicity toward non-target species."

For numerous gammaretroviruses, such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus, woolly monkey virus, feline leukemia virus subgroup B, feline leukemia virus subgroup T, and 10A1 murine leukemia virus, this receptor is the human type III sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter, SLC20A1, formerly known as PiT1. Understanding the critical receptor functionalities and interactions with the virus that lead to successful infection requires that we first know the surface structure of the cellular receptor. Previous molecular modeling from the protein sequence, and limited empirical data, predicted a protein with 10 transmembrane helices.

We discover that there are segments of the protein that are unexpectedly exposed to the outside milieu.

SLC20A1 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a major role in the housekeeping process of maintaining cell Pi homeostasis in transporting monovalent H2PO4 forms of Pi (5Virkki L.V. Biber J. Murer H.

This Pi transporter is important for chondroblastic and osteoblastic mineralization and vascular calcification (5Virkki L.V. Biber J. Murer H. Forster I.C. Am. J. Physiol.

Using Kyte Doolittle hydropathy plots, the structure of SLC20A1 (PiT1) was initially predicted to contain 10 transmembrane helices (TMHs), with both the N and C termini positioned intracellularly (6O'Hara B. Johann S.V. Klinger H.P. Blair D.G. Rubinson H. Dunn K.J. Sass P. Vitek S.M. Robins T. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted structure of SLC20A1 (PiT1) has since been modified, based on experimental data that showed both ends of the protein are extracellular and that the protein contains an N-linked glycosylation site (7Farrell K.B. Russ J.L. Murthy R.K. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, the number and positions of the extracellular regions (ECRs) and transmembrane helices (TMHs) remain not experimentally validated. A closely related phosphate transporter, SLC20A2 (PiT2), functions as a receptor for the murine amphotropic leukemia virus (A-MLV) (3Kavanaugh M.P. Miller D.G. Zhang W. Law W. Kozak S.L. Kabat D.

Virol. 2001; 75: 5584-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) experimentally assessed PiT2 topology using N- and C-terminal epitope tags, glycosylation studies, and in vitro translation of C-terminally epitope-tagged truncated mutants exposed to microsomal vesicles. However, as noted by these authors, C-terminally truncated PiT2 mutants in membrane vesicles can behave differently than PiT2 in the cell membrane, and thus assignment of hydrophilic loops to one side or the other of the membrane using this experimental approach provides ambiguous results (11Salaün C. Rodrigues P. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5584-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). High resolution structural analysis of proteins such as SLC20A1 (PiT1), which pass through the cell membrane multiple times, is impeded by difficulties in purification and crystallization. To circumvent these obstacles and to increase the understanding of structure-function relationships, multiple membrane-spanning proteins can be characterized through mutational analysis in the context of their normal lipid environment within living cells. In light of this consideration, we undertook cellular topological studies of the SLC20A1 (PiT1) protein using substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis (SCAM), a powerful method that has been successfully employed in establishing the topology of a large number of multiple membrane-spanning proteins because it minimally perturbs the structure and function of the target protein (12Zhu Q. Casey J.R. Methods. 2007; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Over 50 cysteine mutants were evaluated, allowing us to construct a model for the membrane topology of SLC20A1 (PiT1), in which the protein crosses the plasma membrane 12 times. The A-MLV binding domain for its receptor, SLC20A2 (PiT2), has been experimentally determined (13Feldman S.A. Farrell K.B. Murthy R.K. Russ J.L. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, a region(s) within PiT1 that binds virus has not been resolved. It has been proposed that region A PiT1 residues 550–558 function as the virus-binding site, based on the loss of receptor function when the corresponding residues of PiT2 are substituted for those of PiT1 (14Johann S.V. van Zeijl M. Cekleniak J. O'Hara B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6733-6736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and other experimental criteria that demonstrate region A is important in facilitating virus entry (15Pedersen L. van Zeijl M. Johann S.V. O'Hara B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7619-7622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that these experiments did not include virus binding assays. Later we determined that substitution of PiT2 residues for PiT1 region A residues in fact did not abolish virus binding for FeLV-B, even though receptor function was inactivated (7Farrell K.B. Russ J.L. Murthy R.K. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the virus-binding site for SLC20A1 (PiT1) remains unresolved. Now that we have established an experimentally validated topology for SLC20A1 (PiT1), the extracellular residues that are required for virus binding can be identified, and the effects of SLC20A1 (PiT1) receptor-inactivating mutations can be assessed with respect to whether or not they alter the ability of the virus to bind or enter cells at a post-binding stage of infection. Cell lines used in this study include Mus dunni tail fibroblasts (MDTF), obtained from Olivier Danos (Institute Pasteur) and originally derived by Lander and Chattopadhyay (16Lander M.R. Chattopadhyay S.K. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 695-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Cell Genesys, Inc.). MDTF and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Retroviral vectors were produced as described previously (7Farrell K.B. Russ J.L. Murthy R.K. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing various cysteine mutant SLC20A1 (PiT1) receptor proteins were exposed to GALV-enveloped retroviral vectors with genomes encoding β-galactosidase to determine whether the modified proteins were functional for virus entry. Cells were histochemically analyzed for expression of β-galactosidase as described previously (7Farrell K.B. Russ J.L. Murthy R.K. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cysteineless SLC20A1 (PiT1) cDNA was constructed in the pLNSPiT1-HA plasmid (7Farrell K.B. Russ J.L. Murthy R.K. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenesis primers were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids containing mutant cDNAs were sequenced to confirm each mutation and to ensure that no unscheduled mutations were introduced. Cells expressing HA epitope-tagged PiT1 (PiT1-HA) or mutant cysteineless PiT1 (PiT1-13-HA) were seeded in 6-cm tissue culture dishes at 2 × 106 cells/dish 1 day prior to labeling. Optimal conditions for 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (biotin maleimide or B-mal) (Molecular Probes) reactivity was determined to occur at 250 μm with incubation for 30 min at room temperature. These conditions resulted in little permeabilization of the membrane as assessed for MDTF cells expressing a PiT1-13-HA cysteine mutant wherein the substituted cysteine was determined to be extracellular (supplemental figure, A). The next day, cells were washed with PBSCM (PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) and then exposed to 250 mm B-mal in PBSCM for 30 min at room temperature. The maleimide portion of B-mal reacts with thiol groups such as cysteine, leaving the biotin portion of B-mal available for binding to avidin (Fig. 1A). After washing three times in PBSCM supplemented with 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and once in PBSCM, cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin Protein (Pierce) for at least 1 h at 4 °C; the immobilized avidin reacts with all biotinylated cell surface proteins. The precipitated protein was washed three times in lysis buffer and then resuspended in 30 μl of reducing protein loading buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min before SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Blocking of cysteine residues that reacted with B-mal was achieved by exposing cells to 1 mm 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) (Toronto Research Chemicals) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and then washing the cells in PBS. MTSET is membrane-impermeant (17Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and reacts with thiol groups on the cell surface. The cells were then exposed to B-mal and lysed, as described above. B-mal was unable to react with cysteines bound to MTSET, and therefore pulldown of PiT1-HA with avidin was inhibited, thus reducing or eliminating the signal on a Western blot. Cells that did not initially react with B-mal were permeabilized before exposing to B-mal in the following manner: after removal of medium, cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in 1 ml of 250 units of streptolysin O (SLO)/ml (Sigma) prepared in SLO buffer (2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 115 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm HEPES) for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with cold SLO buffer and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 1 ml of SLO buffer pre-warmed to 37 °C; they were next washed in cold SLO buffer and then PBSCM before labeling with B-mal (18Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Biotinylated protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting and detected with anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Immobilon, Millipore) was used to detect signals using a CoolSnap HQ2 camera and Ivision software (Biovision Technologies, Inc.). MDTF cells expressing mutant SLC20A1(PiT1) proteins containing C-terminal HA epitope tags were analyzed using flow cytometry. First, cells were removed from flasks with Cell Stripper (Cellgro), after which they were washed in Hanks' buffered salt solution. One million cells for each cell line was placed in a tube containing 1 μg of anti-HA-Alexa Fluor 488 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in Hanks' buffered salt solution and then analyzed to determine the number of antibody-binding sites per cell. Controls for each sample cell were not reacted with antibody and counted to determine autofluorescence values. These values were subtracted from the values obtained for stained cells. Quantification of bound antibodies per cell was accomplished through use of Quantum Simply Cellular anti-mouse IgG quantitative beads (Bangs Laboratories), containing known numbers of antibody-binding sites, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein sequence of the human SLC20A1 (PiT1) (SwissProt identifier, SLC20A1_HUMAN) was submitted to the HMMTOP server with the following constraints: 1-19-o, 88-97-o, 147-150-o, 222-228-o, 547-557-o, 613-621-o, and 677-E-o (19Tusnády G.E. Kalmár L. Simon I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D234-D239Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SLC20A1 (PiT1) contains 13 cysteine residues, at positions 63, 132, 204, 238, 242, 251, 264, 403, 426, 468, 524, 573, and 625. To perform SCAM, it was first necessary to determine whether any one of these cysteines is critical for SLC20A1 (PiT1) virus receptor function. We therefore performed site-directed mutagenesis on a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged form of SLC20A1 (PiT1-HA) (7Farrell K.B. Russ J.L. Murthy R.K. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in which we sequentially replaced each of the 13 cysteine residues with an alanine to produce a cysteineless protein, and we assessed receptor function on each of the 13 resultant PiT1-HA mutants lacking 1–13 of these cysteine residues. Infection results from MDTF cells expressing the cysteineless form of SLC20A1 (PiT1), PiT1-13-HA, show that replacement of all 13 cysteine residues in SLC20A1 (PiT1) with alanine does not compromise GALV receptor function (Table 1). The PiT1-13-HA plasmid was used as the template for mutagenesis, in which single cysteine residues were substituted for specific residues innate to SLC20A1 (PiT1) at selected positions in the protein. In this manner, multiple mutants containing individual cysteines at different positions were generated and tested. The epitope-tagged mutant proteins were stably expressed in GALV-resistant murine MDTF cells and analyzed with respect to their abilities to confer susceptibility to GALV vectors. All mutants functioned as GALV receptors when stably expressed in MDTF cells, producing titers within 1–2 orders of magnitude of the titers obtained with MDTF cells expressing wild-type SLC20A1 (PiT1) following exposure to GALV-enveloped retroviral vectors (Table 1).TABLE 1Biochemical analysis of SLC20A1 (PiT1) cysteine mutants and HMMTOP-predicted location of residues using experimental constraintsSLC20A1 receptorB-malMTSET (block)SLO (perm)GALV functionaGALV titers of all mutant cell lines were within 10-fold of the titer obtained with MDTFPiT1-HA at 1 × 106 blue (β-galactosidase)-forming units/ml.

Open table in a new tab The first step in SCAM (reviewed in Refs. 20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 21Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods. 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) analysis is the construction of a cysteineless protein wherein all native cysteines are substituted by alanines. The next step is the introduction by site-directed mutagenesis of individual cysteine residues into the cysteineless protein as a means to assess the topology of a functional protein expressed in live cells. Cysteine residues are small, hydrophobic and well tolerated at most positions in polytopic proteins, thereby not disturbing the behavior of a protein (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is important that each mutated protein retain its given function. Once we had ascertained that each PiT1-13-HA mutant with a substituted cysteine retained virus receptor function, we exposed MDTF cells expressing the mutant to the thiol-reactive agent maleimide conjugated to biotin (B-mal). All B-mal-reactive cell surface proteins were precipitated using avidin-coated beads. Western blots of these B-mal-reactive proteins were then probed with anti-HA antibody to detect specific labeling of the HA epitope-tagged SLC20A1 (PiT1) cysteine mutant proteins (Fig. 1A). B-mal is a very large molecule and is membrane-impermeant except at high concentrations and for long incubation periods; thus it has limited access to intracellular cysteines or cysteines obscured because of protein folding or secondary structure. Nonetheless, to ensure that B-mal reactivity is confined to cysteines expressed in accessible extracellular portions of SLC20A1 (PiT1) and not attributable to B-mal accessing intracellular cysteines, we verified its reactivity by using the membrane-impermeant thiol-reactive sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (17Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In cells pretreated with MTSET, extracellular cysteines are no longer available for labeling by B-mal, and subsequent isolation of immunoreactive proteins from cell lysates using avidin-coated beads is prevented (Fig. 1B). Therefore, preincubation of cells with MTSET prior to B-mal labeling results in a significantly weaker or absent signal on a Western blot (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm that cysteine residues that failed to label after exposure to B-mal were intracellular, cells were treated with SLO, a thiol-activated toxin that permeabilizes the mammalian cell membrane by binding to cholesterol and forming pores in the membrane, thus allowing B-mal improved access to residues inside the cell membrane (Fig. 1C). HA-tagged PiT1-13 mutants that can only be detected on Western blots after permeabilization with SLO or whose signal is markedly enhanced by SLO are not extracellularly localized. Cell lines that gave strong positive signals for B-mal and were blocked by treatment with MTSET were not subjected to permeabilization by SLO. Not all extracellular or intracellular regions containing cysteines react with B-mal or B-mal with SLO equivalently. This is most likely because of conformational constraints that hinder access to some of these residues, thus generating variable immunoreactive HA antibody reactivity, as seen by band intensity on Western blots. Alternatively, the reduced band intensity may reflect reduced levels of mutant receptors on the cell. Cell lines that consistently produced weaker B-mal-reactive signals were analyzed by flow cytometry to enumerate the HA antibody-binding sites on the cell surface (Table 2) to determine the protein expression levels of the particular PiT1-13-HA cysteine mutant. If the expression level was comparable with that of PiT1-13-HA, the weaker B-mal signal was attributed to reduced accessibility of the residue because of protein folding or other forms of steric hindrance. If the number of HA antibody-binding sites on the cells was considerably less than that for control PiT1-HA cells, diminished signals were more likely to be a consequence of reduced protein expression.TABLE 2Quantification of antibody binding sites on the cell surface of SLC20A1 (PiT1) using flow cytometrySLC20A1 receptorAntibody-binding sites per cell (×1000)PiT1-HA57.44PiT1-13-HA114.54V19C127.11N96C18.73S97C96.28L101C133.31Q147C96.24L155C42.72L545C58.31Y546C71.44V548C108.45L591C97.52N615C122.96 Open table in a new tab For cysteine mutants that contained a cysteine residue substituted for an intracellular residue of PiT1-13-HA, a light degree of B-mal permeabilization, as represented by faint bands, is obtained on Western blots, but this band is markedly enhanced in the presence of SLO (supplemental figure, B, compare lanes 1–4). B-mal reactivity with extracellular residues is blocked with MTSET (supplemental figure, B, lanes 5 and 6). The band intensity achieved with SLC20A1 (PiT1) cysteine residues reactive with B-mal are, as expected, diminished when cells are first incubated with the membrane-permeabilizing reagent SLO, as SLO permits B-mal to react with extraneous intracellular cysteines that would not be detected on a Western blot, thus ostensibly diluting the amount of B-mal available for reacting with SLC20A1 (PiT1) extracellular cysteines (supplemental figure, B, lanes 7 and 8). Control MDTF cells and MDTF cells expressing HA epitope-tagged wild-type SLC20A1 (PiT1-HA) were exposed to B-mal, precipitated with avidin-coated beads, and analyzed by Western blotting. As expected, no proteins were detected using an HA antibody on control MDTF cells after exposure to B-mal (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Similarly, MDTF cells expressing PiT1-HA protein exposed to B-mal were also unreactive (Fig. 2B, lane 1), indicating that all 13 cysteine residues present in wild-type SLC20A1 (PiT1), at positions 63, 132, 204, 238, 242, 251, 264, 403, 426, 468, 524, 573, and 625, are inaccessible to B-mal and therefore not extracellularly localized. Exposing control MDTF cells or MDTF cells expressing PiT1-HA to B-mal after treatment with MTSET did not affect B-mal reactivity, as expected (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2). Permeabilization of cells with SLO rendered the internal cysteine residues present in PiT1-HA reactive (Fig. 2B, lane 3) but did not result in a signal on HA-negative MDTF control cells (Fig. 2A, lane 3). When MDTF or MDTFPiT1-HA cells were treated with MTSET before permeabilization with SLO and labeling with B-mal, there was no change, because MTSET is membrane-impermeant and therefore will not block residues that are not extracellular (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 4). To determine which regions of SLC20A1 (PiT1) are accessible on the cell surface, we substituted selected residues with individual cysteines in PiT1-13-HA, which retains full GALV receptor function (Table 1). The first cysteine substitution in PiT1-13-HA was at position 97 (PiT1-13S97C-HA). Position 97 was chosen because it was previously demonstrated that SLC20A1 (PiT1) is an N-glycosylated protein and that glycosylation of SLC20A1 (PiT1) can be eliminated by either treating cells with the enzyme N-glycosidase-F or by substituting a cysteine for the asparagine at position 96 (7Farrell K.B. Russ J.L. Murthy R.K. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned a residue adjacent to this asparagine residue is part of the glycosylation motif in ECR 2 and is predicted to be B-mal-reactive. HA-immunoreactive bands were obtained in the Western blot for PiT1-13S97C-HA treated with B-mal, suggesting that this residue is indeed extracellular (Fig. 2C, lane 1). MTSET blocks the signal (Fig. 2C, lane 2), supporting its extracellular position. To systematically evaluate the membrane orientations of residues comprising the N-terminal region of SLC20A1 (PiT1), the following residue substitutions were made in PiT1-13-HA: V19C, A79C, G88C, L89C, V92C, N96C, S97C, L101C, A104C, A109C, and A114C; each mutant was evaluated for its ability to function as a GALV receptor. All mutants retained GALV receptor function similar to that of PiT1-HA with the exception of N96C (Table 1). MDTF cells expressing the PiT1-13N96C-HA were 2 orders of magnitude less susceptible to GALV vectors (data not shown), and there are a reduced number of HA antibody-binding sites on MDTF cells expressing PiT1-13N96C-HA compared with PiT1-HA and PiT1-13-HA (18,730 compared with 57,440 and 114,540, respectively; see Table 2). Cells expressing each of the above mutant receptors were exposed to B-mal alone or B-mal after exposure to MTSET or SLO, to determine the sidedness of the introduced cysteine residues.

https://openalex.org/W2054539671,"Cav1.4 channels are unique among the high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel family because they completely lack Ca2+-dependent inactivation and display very slow voltage-dependent inactivation. Both properties are of crucial importance in ribbon synapses of retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells, where sustained Ca2+ influx through Cav1.4 channels is required to couple slow graded changes of the membrane potential with tonic glutamate release. Loss of Cav1.4 function causes severe impairment of retinal circuitry function and has been linked to night blindness in humans and mice. Recently, an inhibitory domain (ICDI: inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent inactivation) in the C-terminal tail of Cav1.4 has been discovered that eliminates Ca2+-dependent inactivation by binding to upstream regulatory motifs within the proximal C terminus. The mechanism underlying the action of ICDI is unclear. It was proposed that ICDI competitively displaces the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin. Alternatively, the ICDI domain and calmodulin may bind to different portions of the C terminus and act independently of each other. In the present study, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments with genetically engineered cyan fluorescent protein variants to address this issue. Our data indicate that calmodulin is preassociated with the C terminus of Cav1.4 but may be tethered in a different steric orientation as compared with other Ca2+ channels. We also find that calmodulin is important for Cav1.4 function because it increases current density and slows down voltage-dependent inactivation. Our data show that the ICDI domain selectively abolishes Ca2+-dependent inactivation, whereas it does not interfere with other calmodulin effects. Cav1.4 channels are unique among the high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel family because they completely lack Ca2+-dependent inactivation and display very slow voltage-dependent inactivation. Both properties are of crucial importance in ribbon synapses of retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells, where sustained Ca2+ influx through Cav1.4 channels is required to couple slow graded changes of the membrane potential with tonic glutamate release. Loss of Cav1.4 function causes severe impairment of retinal circuitry function and has been linked to night blindness in humans and mice. Recently, an inhibitory domain (ICDI: inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent inactivation) in the C-terminal tail of Cav1.4 has been discovered that eliminates Ca2+-dependent inactivation by binding to upstream regulatory motifs within the proximal C terminus.

Our data show that the ICDI domain selectively abolishes Ca2+-dependent inactivation, whereas it does not interfere with other calmodulin effects. Retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells contain a highly specialized type of synapse designated ribbon synapses. Glutamate release in these synapses is controlled via graded and sustained changes in membrane potential that are maintained throughout the duration of a light stimulus (1Thoreson W.B. Mol.

In recent years, it became clear that Cav1.4 L-type Ca2+ channels are the main channel subtype converting these analog input signals into corresponding permanent glutamate release (1Thoreson W.B.

Individuals displaying congenital stationary night blindness type 2 as well as mice deficient in Cav1.4 typically have abnormal electroretinograms that indicate a loss of neurotransmission from the rods to second order bipolar cells, which is attributable to a loss of Cav1.4 (3Mansergh F.

Ca2+ channels by their total lack of Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) and their very slow voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI). Recently, we and others discovered an inhibitory domain (ICDI: inhibitor of CDI) in the C-terminal tail of the Cav1.4 channel that eliminates Ca2+-dependent inactivation in this channel by binding to upstream regulatory motifs (9Wahl-Schott C.

Importantly, introducing the ICDI into the backbone of Cav1.2 or Cav1.3 almost completely abolishes the CDI of these channels. Contrasting with the clear cut function, the underlying mechanism by which ICDI abolishes CDI remains controversial. It was suggested that ICDI displaces the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) from binding to the proximal C terminus (10Singh A. Hamedinger D. Hoda J.C. Gebhart M. Koschak A. Romanin C. Striessnig J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding sites of CaM and ICDI are largely overlapping or allosterically coupled to each other. Alternatively, our own data rather suggested that CaM and the ICDI domain bind to different portions of the proximal C terminus (9Wahl-Schott C. Baumann L. Cuny H. Eckert C. Griessmeier K. Biel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15657-15662Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We proposed that the interaction between the ICDI domain and the EF-hand, a motif with a central role for transducing CDI (11Mori M.X. Vander Kooi C.W. Leahy D.J. Yue D.T.

In this study, we designed experiments to differentiate between these two models. Here, using FRET in HEK293 cells, we provide evidence that in living cells, CaM is bound to the full-length C terminus of Cav1.4 (i.e. in the presence of ICDI). Furthermore, our data suggest that the steric orientation of the CaM/Cav channel complex differs between Cav1.2 and Cav1.4 channels. We show that CaM preassociation with Cav1.4 controls current density and also affects VDI. Thus, although CaM does not trigger CDI in Cav1.4 as it does in other HVA Ca2+ channels, it is still an important regulator of this channel. high voltage-activated Ca2+-dependent inactivation voltage-dependent inactivation inhibitor of CDI calmodulin fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET ratio yellow fluorescent protein cyan fluorescent protein picofarads. For expression of murine Cav1.4 (17Baumann L. Gerstner A. Zong X. Biel M. Wahl-Schott C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (accession number AJ579852), the bicistronic pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (Clontech) was used. For the construction of truncated Cav1.4 channels lacking the ICDI (Cav1.4ΔICDI, previously termed C1884Stop (9Wahl-Schott C. Baumann L. Cuny H. Eckert C. Griessmeier K. Biel M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In Cav1.4/5A channels, CaM preassociation is disrupted by mutating Ile-1592–Phe-1596 of the IQ motif to alanines, respectively. The mutated sequence (IQDYF) contains isoleucine 1592, glutamine 1593, and two highly conserved aromatic anchors (Tyr-1595 and Phe-1596) that in closely related Cav1.2 channels have been shown to form extensive contacts with CaM (19Van Petegem F.

HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding calcium channel α subunits together with equimolar amounts of vectors encoding β2a and α2δ1 as described in Ref. 17Baumann L. Gerstner A. Zong X. Biel M. Wahl-Schott C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar. ICa and IBa were measured by using the following solutions. For the pipette solution, we used 112 mm CsCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MgATP, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH; for experiments with low Ca2+ buffering, EGTA was reduced to 0.5 mm. For the bath solution, we used 82 mm NaCl, 30 mm BaCl2, 5.4 mm CsCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm tetraethylammonium, 5 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For experiments with 10 mm Ba2+ or 10 mm Ca2+ in the bath solution, the NaCl concentration was increased to 102 mm. ICa and IBa were measured from the same cell. Bath solution was changed by a local solution exchanger. Currents were recorded at room temperature 2–4 days after transfection by using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Data were analyzed by using the Origin 6.1 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). The peak IV relationship was measured by applying 350-ms or 5-s voltage pulses to potentials between −80 and +70 mV in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −80 mV at 0.2 Hz. To obtain current densities, the current amplitude at Vmax was normalized to cell membrane capacitance (Cm). For determination of half-maximum activation voltage (V0.5), the chord conductance (G) was calculated from the current voltage curves by dividing the peak current amplitude by its driving force at that respective potential G = I/(Vm − Vrev), where Vrev is the extrapolated reversal potential, Vm is the membrane potential, and I is the peak current. The chord conductance was then fitted with a Boltzmann equation G = Gmax/(1 + e(V0.5−Vm)/kact), where Gmax is the maximum conductance, V0.5 is the half-maximum activation voltage, Vm is the membrane potential, and kact is the slope factor of the activation curve. Cav1.4 channel inactivation was quantified by calculating the fraction of peak Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents remaining after 300 or 5000 ms of depolarization (R300 or R5000) as described (9Wahl-Schott C. Baumann L. Cuny H. Eckert C. Griessmeier K. Biel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15657-15662Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). R300 is used to quantify CDI (fast process). R5000 is used to quantify VDI, a process that is intrinsically very slow in Cav1.4. For all FRET constructs, we used monomeric EYFP(A206K) or ECFP(A206K) (21Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 22Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev.

For simplicity, we refer to the different fluorescent proteins as “YFP” and “CFP” throughout the text. All FRET constructs were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). For CaM interaction assays, the following YFP-tagged C-terminal fragments of Cav1.4 and Cav1.2 (rabbit Cav1.2b subunit (23Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stühmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F.

In all CaM fusion constructs, CFP is fused N-terminally to CaM. In CFP-CaM, CFP is linked to CaM by an AAA linker (24Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T.

In CFP227-CaM, CFP has been truncated after residue Ala-227 and linked to CaM by a CGC linker (26Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). We intentionally limited expression of CFP-CaM and CFP227-CaM by mutating the Kozac sequence from GCC GCC ACC ATG to GCC TCC TTT ATG in a subset of control experiments to avoid spurious FRET (27Erickson M.G.

Briefly, the N and the C terminus of CFP are fused by a GGTGGS linker, and the new N and C termini were created as indicated in Fig. 1A. These permutations show similar spectral properties as the non-permutated fluorescent proteins (29Mank M. Reiff D.F. Heim N. Friedrich M.W. Borst A. Griesbeck O. Biophys.

A Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutant harboring aspartate-to-alanine mutations in all four EF-hands (CaM1234) (30Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B.

As negative control, CFP(A206K) and YFP(A206K) were used. For intramolecular FRET experiments, C-terminal fragments of Cav1.4 were N-terminally fused to YFP and C-terminally fused to CFP separated by a triple alanine linker. The fragments used for the respective fusion construct are as follows: YFP-CT1.4-CFP, complete C terminus of Cav1.4 (Asp-1445–Leu-1984); YFP-CT1.4Δ1493–1609-CFP, Asp-1445–Leu-1984 with a deletion of Gln-1493–Gly-1609; YFP-CT1.4Δ1445–1609-CFP, Asp-1445–Leu-1984 with a deletion of Asp-1445–Gly-1609. For the ICDI interaction assays, YFP is fused to C-terminal fragments of Cav1.4. The C-terminal fragments for the respective constructs are as follows: YFP-CT1.4, complete C terminus (Asp-1445–Leu-1984); YFP-CT1.4ΔICDI, Asp-1445–Thr-1883; YFP-CT1.4R1610Stop, Asp-1445–Gly-1609; YFP-EF, Asp-1445–Ile-1492. Fragments of the ICDI domain C-terminally fused to CFP are as follows: ICDI-CFP, Leu-1885–Leu-1984; the proximal part of the ICDI proxICDI-CFP, Leu-1885–Lys-1929; the middle part of the ICDI midICDI-CFP, Gln-1930–Ala-1952; the distal part of the ICDI distICDI-CFP, Gln-1953–Leu-1984; XL-ICDI-CFP, Arg-1610–Leu-1984; L-ICDI-CFP, Ile-1742–Leu-1984. HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips (ibiTreat, ibidi, Martinsried, Germany) and transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). 1–2 days later, the cells were washed and maintained in buffer solution composed of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7,4 at room temperature. Cells were placed on an inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with an oil immersion 60× objective (UPlanSApo 60× OL/1.35, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and a built-in dual-emission system (iMIC 2010 FRET module; TILL Photonics). For simultaneous recording of CFP and YFP emission, a multiband FRET filter set (CFP/YFP-A-000, Semrock, NY) was used consisting of a dual-band excitation filter (excitation bands: 416 ± 12.5 and 501 ± 9 nm), emission filter (emission bands: 464 ± 11.5 and 547 ± 15.5 nm), and dichroic beam splitter (reflection bands: 405 ± 22 and 502 ± 9 nm; transmission bands: 466 ± 17 and 549.5 ± 19.5 nm). Samples were excited with light from a Polychrome 5000 (TILL Photonics; center wave length ± 7.5 nm). The illumination time was set to 10 ms. For the single channels (CFP, YFP), mean intensity values derived from a selective background region near the investigated cell were used for background correction. After this correction, mean values for each cell were calculated from a region of interest drawn around a cell of interest. Images were recorded by a CCD camera (IMAGO-QE). The setup was controlled with the software TILLvisION (version 4.0) and a stand-alone DSP controller. TILLvisION was also used for the image analysis. All imaging equipment was supplied by TILL Photonics (part of Agilent Technologies) unless noted otherwise. Measurements of single-cell FRET based on aggregate (nonspatial) fluorescence recordings were performed using three-cube FRET as described previously (24Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T.

The degree of FRET in an individual cell was quantified using the FRET ratio (FR), which is defined as the fractional increase in YFP emission caused by FRET. The FR was calculated using FR = [SFRET − (RD1)(SCFP)]/[(RA1)(SYFP − (RD2)(SCFP))]. Fluorescence measurements for the determination of SFRET, SCFP, and SYFP were performed in cells coexpressing CFP-tagged and YFP-tagged peptides or intramolecular FRET constructs dually labeled by CFP and YFP using the following parameters: SCFP, excitation at 416 ± 7.5 nm and emission at 464 ± 11.5 nm (donor excitation; donor emission); SFRET, excitation at 416 ± 7.5 nm and emission at 547 ± 15.5 nm (donor excitation; acceptor emission); and SYFP, excitation at 501 ± 7.5 nm and emission at 547 ± 15.5 nm (acceptor excitation; acceptor emission). RD1, RA1, and RD2 are experimentally predetermined constants from measurements applied to single cells expressing only CFP- or YFP-tagged molecules. These constants are used to correct for bleed-through of CFP into the YFP channel (RD1), direct excitation of YFP by CFP excitation (RA1), and the small amount of CFP excitation at the YFP excitation wavelength (RD2) as described by Ref. 24Erickson M.G.

Kinetic measurements were performed using the setup described above and a 20× objective (UPlanSApo, N.A. 0.75, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were maintained in buffer solution composed of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7,4 at room temperature. 10 s after the start of the recording, 5 μm ionomycin was added. After 30 s, the cells were perfused with buffer solution containing 0 Ca2+, 5 μm ionomycin, and 5 mm EGTA. The illumination time was set to 100 ms. For ratiometric analysis, the ratio (R) of YFP and CFP fluorescence intensities was calculated as the following, R = SFRET/SCFP. The baseline ratio (R0) was calculated as an average of the first 10 s before stimulation. The ratio change (ΔR/R) is ΔR/R = (R − R0)/R0 (26Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A.

For the single channels (CFP, YFP), mean intensity values derived from a selective background region near the investigated cell was used for background correction. After this correction, mean values for each cell were calculated from a region of interest drawn around a cell of interest. The ratio R was formed from the ratio of the background-corrected single channels. The complete C terminus of Cav1.4 containing the 5A mutation within the IQ motif (CT1.4/5A see above) or C-terminal fragments of Cav1.4 (CT1.4R1610Stop (Asp-1445–Gly-1609); CT1.4R1610Stop/5A) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. All sequences were fused with a Myc tag at the N terminus. CaM1234 was constructed in the same manner by using a 5′ primer containing the triple FLAG sequence. For expression of recombinant proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected by using the calcium phosphate method. Immunoprecipitation was performed 3 days after transfection. A detailed protocol has been published previously (9Wahl-Schott C. Baumann L. Cuny H. Eckert C. Griessmeier K. Biel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15657-15662Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Each coimmunoprecipitation was repeated at least three times. All values are given as mean ± S.E.; n is the number of experiments. An unpaired t test was performed for the comparison between two groups. Significance was tested by analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test whether multiple comparisons were made. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. To test whether CaM is bound to Cav1.4 channels, we carried out FRET experiments in living cells using the full-length C terminus of Cav1.4 and CaM (Fig. 1, A and B). This approach has been successfully applied to other HVA Ca2+ channels (24Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We first fused wild type CFP and CaM by a flexible AAA linker (CFP-CaM). This construct yielded significant FRET with YFP-CT1.2, whereas there was no FRET for YFP-CT1.4 (Fig. 1B). A possible explanation for the lack of FRET could be that CaM does not bind to Cav1.4 as suggested previously (10Singh A. Hamedinger D. Hoda J.C. Gebhart M. Koschak A. Romanin C. Striessnig J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CaM may bind, but FRET could be prevented by structural constraints in the steric environment of the CaM binding region in Cav1.4. We addressed this problem using fusion proteins where CaM is attached to structurally modified CFPs (Fig. 1, A and B). A fusion protein where the last 11 residues of CFP have been truncated (CFP227-CaM) showed strong FRET in CT1.2 and in CT1.4ΔICDI, a CT1.4 variant lacking the ICDI domain. Importantly, in the wild type Cav1.4 C terminus, a very small FRET signal just below the threshold of significance was obtained. To further optimize the geometric orientation of the fluorophores, we fused CFP to CaM at different angles using circularly permutated CFPs (29Mank M. Reiff D.F. Heim N. Friedrich M.W. Borst A.

To this end, the C and the N termini of wild type CFP were fused by a linker, and a new C and N termini were introduced at different positions. Using circularly permutated CFPs, CaM binding to CT1.2 and CT1.4ΔICDI could be detected (Fig. 1B). Notably, coexpression of CFPcp174-CaM and YFP-CT1.4 resulted in a significant FRET. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by the lack of FRET in the negative control (Fig. 1B). The FRET response for CFPcp174-CaM indicated that CaM binds to a target sequence in the C terminus and that binding of CaM is not prevented in the presence of the ICDI. To test whether the interaction observed is independent of resting Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ activation of CaM, we next used CaM mutant (CaM1234) that is deficient for Ca2+ binding (30Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). CaM1234 serves as a surrogate for apocalmodulin (apoCaM) and is known to preassociate with the C termini of other HVA Ca2+ channels (24Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Clear FRET could be observed between CFPcp174-CaM1234 and YFP-CT1.4 similar to that observed for CFPcp174-CaM and YFP-CT1.4 (supplemental Fig. S1). FRET between CaM and CT1.2 or CT1.4 could be significantly increased by raising the intracellular Ca2+ concentration above resting limits (Fig. 2, A and B). This increase was reversible because clamping intracellular Ca2+ to nominal zero Ca2+ decreased binding of CaM to resting levels. For CaM1234, no Ca2+-dependent changes in FRET could be observed. To study the functional effects that CaM exerts on Cav1.4, we generated a Cav1.4 mutant that is deficient for CaM binding (Cav1.4/5A; Fig. 3). In this mutant, five amino acid residues within the IQ motif are replaced by alanines (CT1.4/5A and CT1.4R1610Stop/5A). Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that CaM1234 binding to the mutated full-length C terminus (CT1.4/5A) or to CT1.4 that is truncated after the IQ (CT1.4R1610Stop/5A) was totally abolished. As a positive control, we used CT1.4R1610Stop that binds CaM (9Wahl-Schott C. Baumann L. Cuny H. Eckert C. Griessmeier K. Biel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15657-15662Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We next compared the electrophysiological properties of wild type Cav1.4 channels with the properties of Cav1.4 channels deficient for CaM (Cav1.4/5A) in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, B–F). Currents induced for wild type Cav1.4 channels consistently gave higher peak Ba2+ current densities (−4.91 ± 0.79 pA/pF; n = 12) than Cav1.4/5A channels (−2.37 ± 0.34 pA/pF; n = 17; Fig. 3D),"

Growth factors and viruses have solved this problem by targeting tissue-specific cell-surface heparan sulfates.

Treatments for PQ poisoning are unreliable, and numerous deaths have been attributed inappropriate usage of the agent. It is generally speculated that a microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme system is responsible for PQ toxicity. However, recent studies have demonstrated cytotoxicity via mitochondria, and therefore, the cytotoxic mechanism remains controversial. Here, we demonstrated that mitochondrial NADH-dependent PQ reductase containing a voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is responsible for PQ cytotoxicity. When mitochondria were incubated with NADH and PQ, superoxide anion (O2̇̄) was produced, and the mitochondria ruptured. Outer membrane extract oxidized NADH in a PQ dose-dependent manner, and oxidation was suppressed by VDAC inhibitors. Zymographic analysis revealed the presence of VDAC1 protein in the oxidoreductase, and the direct binding of PQ to VDAC1 was demonstrated using biotinylated PQ. VDAC1-overexpressing cells showed increased O2̇̄ production and cytotoxicity, both of which were suppressed in VDAC1 knockdown cells. These results indicated that a VDAC1-containing mitochondrial system is involved in PQ poisoning. These insights into the mechanism of PQ poisoning not only demonstrated novel physiological functions of VDAC protein, but they may facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches.

Although it is classified as a low hazard compound, PQ is hazardous when used improperly and has been found responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide because of intentional overdose and high levels of occupational and accidental exposure especially in developing countries (1Wesseling C. van Wendel de Joode B. Ruepert C. León C. Monge P. Hermosillo H. Partanen T.J. Int. J. Occup. Environ. Health. 2001; 7: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Direct exposure to PQ causes severe irritation to the eyes and skin, and ingestion of concentrated products may result in fatal injury to lungs because of edema, hemorrhage, and subsequent fibrosis as well as damage to other organs (2Dinis-Oliveira R.J. Duarte J.A. Sánchez-Navarro A. Remião F. Bastos M.L. Carvalho F. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2008; 38: 13-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Additionally, PQ has emerged as a risk factor for Parkinson disease (3McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The acute toxicity of PQ in mammals is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by a cyclic oxidation-reduction reaction (4Baldwin R.C. Pasi A. MacGregor J.T. Hine C.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1975; 32: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is generally speculated that NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme systems is responsible for the production of ROS (5Bus J.S. Cagen S.Z. Olgaard M. Gibson J.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1976; 35: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, we previously observed that the initial ultrastructural alterations associated with PQ exposure occurred only in mitochondria and not in the endoplasmic reticulum in pulmonary cells in vivo (6Hirai K. Witschi H. Côté M.G. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1985; 43: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in vitro (7Wang G.Y. Hirai K. Shimada H. J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1992; 41: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several reports have suggested the cytotoxicity of PQ via mitochondrial dysfunction (8Yang W. Tiffany-Castiglioni E. J. Toxicol.

Despite the development of a number of treatments for PQ poisoning, the efficacy and reliability of currently available treatments have remained limited because of an insufficient understanding of PQ cytotoxicity (2Dinis-Oliveira R.J.

We recently discovered that active NADH-dependent oxidoreductase located on the mitochondrial outer membrane reduced PQ to a radical form that spontaneously formed superoxide anion (O2̇̄) and destroyed mitochondria (11Hirai K. Ikeda K. Wang G.Y. Toxicology. 1992; 72: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Shimada H. Hirai K. Simamura E. Pan J. Arch Biochem.

(Tokyo). 1999; 48: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that 1) PQ was initially metabolized to monopyridone in the cytosol and subsequently hydroxylated by the microsomes and 2) the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and the administration of a ROS scavenger reduced PQ toxicity in mice (11Hirai K. Ikeda K. Wang G.Y. Toxicology. 1992; 72: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Shimada H. Furuno H. Hirai K. Koyama J. Ariyama J. Simamura E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the mitochondrial system, not the microsomal system, is responsible for PQ toxicity. We verified that enzymes in the electron transport chain and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, an NADH-dependent oxidoreductase in the outer membrane, were not involved in this reaction (11Hirai K. Ikeda K. Wang G.Y. Toxicology. 1992; 72: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Shimada H. Hirai K. Simamura E. Pan J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), an abundant pore-forming protein in the outer membrane, exerts numerous physiological functions as a channel; it regulates both the metabolite flux of mitochondria and transmembrane potential, and plays a role in apoptosis. Recently, it was reported that NADH regulates VDAC function (15Lee A.C. Xu X. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26724-26731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and an isoform of VDAC localized in the plasma membrane possesses NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity (16Baker M.A. Lane D.J. Ly J.D. De Pinto V. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4811-4819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to determine whether or not NADH-PQ oxidoreductase on mitochondria is responsible for PQ cytotoxicity and if VDAC participates in this activity. HeLa cells were provided by RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Mitochondrial superoxide production in HeLa cells was detected using MitoSOX® (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), a red fluorescent mitochondrial superoxide indicator, according to the given protocol. Cells were pretreated with 1 mm PQ; Sigma-Aldrich) for 50 min at 37 °C and incubated with 5 μm MitoSOX for 10 min in the dark. The medium was exchanged for fresh medium, and the cells were observed by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The effects of benzoquinone (BQ; 0.2 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) were evaluated after 10 min of incubation in BQ-added medium. Intracellular H2O2 production in HeLa cells by PQ was detected using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH; Molecular Probes) (17Simamura E. Hirai K. Shimada H. Koyama J. Niwa Y. Shimizu S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2006; 5: 1523-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Ariyama J. Shimada H. Aono M. Tsuchida H. Hirai K.I. Intensive Care Med. 2000; 26: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pretreated with 1 mm PQ for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the cells were incubated with 5 μm DCFH for 20 min in the dark. Afterward, the medium was exchanged for fresh medium; fluorescence images that appeared after the formation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) were observed by fluorescence microscopy. Mitochondria were isolated from the livers of male Wistar rats or from HeLa cells by differential centrifugation (11Hirai K. Ikeda K. Wang G.Y. Toxicology. 1992; 72: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Shimada H. Hirai K. Simamura E. Pan J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were suspended in 0.25 m sucrose solution containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 20 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4). The mitochondria were starved for 20 min at 37 °C to consume endogenous substrates before use. The Kanazawa Medical University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all studies. All animals were cared for and treated in accordance with the Committee guidelines. Mitochondria were attached onto a glass-based culture dishes coated with Cell-Tak® (BD Biosciences) (19Nakayama S. Sakuyama T. Mitaku S. Ohta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The dishes were incubated with 10 mm PQ and 2 mm NADH (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in the sucrose solution containing 5 μm DCFH, 5 μm rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 μm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C. Fluorescence images were captured by a digital CCD camera (Pixera Penguin 150 CL, Pixera Corp., Los Gatos, CA) attached to a microscope and were analyzed by Lumina Vision bio-imaging analysis system (Mitani Corp., Fukui, Japan). The fluorescence intensity per 1000 mitochondria was calculated, and the mean value of three areas from each sample was compared. BQ (0.3 mm), anti-VDAC1 monoclonal antibody (mAb; anti-porin 31 HL mAb, 9 μg/ml; Calbiochem), and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,29-disulfic acid (DIDS; 100 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) were evaluated by addition to the reaction mixture. Mitochondria were transferred to a sucrose solution containing 3 mm PQ, 2 mm NADH, 5 μm rotenone, 1 μm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and the solution was reacted for 30 min at 37 °C (11Hirai K. Ikeda K. Wang G.Y. Toxicology. 1992; 72: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Shimada H. Hirai K. Simamura E. Pan J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD; 3000 units/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) effects were evaluated by the addition of SOD to the reaction mixture. Anti-VDAC1 mAb (3 μg/ml) effects were evaluated by preincubation with the mitochondria for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of cold buffer. Mitochondria were immediately centrifuged, and the packed sediments were covered with 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 1 h. The fixed clots were prepared for electron microscopy (11Hirai K. Ikeda K. Wang G.Y. Toxicology. 1992; 72: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and then observed by a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1200EX, JEOL Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The percentage of intact mitochondria per area was counted, and the mean of three areas was calculated. Growth inhibition assays were performed by the stepwise addition of PQ, according to the method described by Saotome (20Saotome K. Morita H. Umeda M. Toxicol. In Vitro. 1989; 3: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Subconfluent HeLa cells were harvested by trypsinization and were precultured on 96-well plates (3 × 103 cells per well) for 24 h. Cells were treated with 7–250 μm PQ and were then cultured for 72 h. The effects of Trolox® (a water-soluble analog of vitamin E; 1 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) were evaluated by its addition to the medium. The 50% growth inhibition toxicity (IC50) was estimated at 72 h. To extract NADH-PQ oxidoreductase, two-step extraction with Triton X-100, deoxycholate followed by SDS/Igepal® CA-630 was performed (21Teraoka K. Matsui S. Nippon Rinsho. 1999; 57: 784-788PubMed Google Scholar). The outer membranes were isolated from the mitochondria by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation (12Shimada H. Hirai K. Simamura E. Pan J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The isolated outer membranes were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA. The suspensions were left to stand on ice for 1 h. Suspensions were then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitates were resuspended in a 20 mm Tris buffer with 0.06% SDS and 0.1% Igepal CA-630. The suspensions were left on ice for 1 h. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 105,000 × g. The supernatants were diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.03% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol, and the dilutions were loaded onto an anion exchange column (DEAE MemSep® 1000; Millipore Corp. Billerica, MA). The columns were washed with the Tris buffer, and proteins were eluted using a NaCl gradient. The fractions containing NADH-PQ oxidoreductase were collected from 0.25–0.3 m NaCl fractions and dialyzed against a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.03% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. The extracts were incubated with 0.2 mm NADH in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5 μm rotenone and 1 μm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate at 37 °C followed by the addition of 10 mm PQ. Activities were calculated by the first-order velocity of NADH oxidation measured at λ340 nm (e = 6.3 × 103 m−1cm−1). O2̇̄ production by NADH-PQ oxidoreductase activity was assayed using a Diogenes® luminescence system (National Diagnostics Inc., Atlanta, GA). The extracts were mixed with NADH (0.1 mm), PQ (0.0012–5 mm), and Diogenes (3-fold dilution) in TBS on a 384-well plate. The effects of DIDS (100 μm) and anti-VDAC1 mAb (30 μg/ml) were evaluated by the addition of these reagents to the mixture. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 15 μl. Chemiluminescence produced by superoxide was detected by an Envision® multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The extracts were incubated with anti-VDAC1 mAb or normal mouse IgG as a control. After incubation in TBS for 90 min at 4 °C, Protein A slurries (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the solution and gently stirred for 90 min at 4 °C. The suspensions were centrifuged, and the supernatants were obtained for the assay. The NADH-PQ oxidoreductase fraction was mixed with 0.125 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 20% glycerol and 0.02% bromphenol blue (1:1, v/v), and the mixture was loaded on native-polyacrylamide gel (5–10% gradient gel; Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan). Electrophoresis was performed at 5 mA for 5 h on ice, and the gel was immersed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 0.25 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 5 μm rotenone, and 1 μm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The gel was incubated with 2 mm NADH and 10 mm PQ at room temperature for 30 min and washed with TBS, and the active bands were stained by diformazan. The electrophoresed gel was blotted, and detection was performed with anti-VDAC1 mAb. Additionally, the active band was excised and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-VDAC1 mAb. The biotinylated paraquat was synthesized in moderate yield by condensation reaction of (+)-biotin and 3-(1′-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium)propylammonium salt, which was prepared by successive N-alkylation of 4,4′-bipyridine with iodomethane and 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide. See the supplemental methods for detailed procedures. Human vdac1 cDNA was isolated as an XhoI fragment by PCR and was subcloned into pUC-CAGGS expression vector (22Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The cDNA of VDAC1 was used. For wheat cell-free protein production of VDAC proteins, the VDAC DNA templates were constructed by “split-primer” PCR (23Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Morishita R. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14652-14657Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The first round of PCR was performed on the cDNA using 10 nm concentrations of each of the following primers: a specific primer (5′-CCACCCACCACCACCAATGGCTGTGCCACCCACGT and AODA2306 primer, 5′-AGCGTCAGACCCCGTAGAAA). Then a second round of PCR was carried out to construct the templates for protein synthesis using a portion (5 μl) of the first PCR mix: 100 nm SPu primer (5′-GCGTAGCATTTAGGTGACACT), 100 nm AODA2303 primer (5′-GTCAGACCCCGTAGAAAAGA), and 1 nm deSP6E02 (5′-GGTGACACTATAGAACTCACCTATCTCTCTACACAAAACATTTCCCTACATACAACTTTCAACTTCCTATTCCACCCACCACCACCAATG). Wheat cell-free protein synthesis of VDAC protein was carried out using a robotic synthesizer (24Sawasaki T. Kamura N. Matsunaga S. Saeki M. Tsuchimochi M. Morishita R. Endo Y.

First, the transcript was created from each of the DNA templates mentioned above using SP6 RNA polymerase. The synthetic mRNAs were then precipitated with ethanol and collected by centrifugation using a Hitachi R10H rotor. Each mRNA (usually 30–35 μg) was washed and transferred into a translation mixture. The translation reaction was performed in the bilayer mode (26Sawasaki T. Hasegawa Y. Tsuchimochi M. Kamura N. Ogasawara T. Kuroita T. Endo Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The translation mixture that formed the bottom layer consisted of 60 A260 units of wheat germ extract (CellFree Sciences) and 2 μg of creatine kinase (Roche Diagnostics) in 25 μl of SUB-AMIX® (CellFree Sciences). The SUB-AMIX® contained (final concentrations) 30 mm Hepes/KOH at pH 8.0, 1.2 mm ATP, 0.25 mm GTP, 16 mm creatine phosphate, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm spermidine, 0.3 mm concentrations of each of the 20 amino acids, 2.7 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 mm potassium acetate. 125 μl of the SUB-AMIX was placed on the top of the translation mixture, forming the upper layer. After incubation at 26 °C for 17 h, the synthesized proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The synthesized VDAC1 protein was mixed with biotinylated PQ (0–1.0 μm) in TBS containing 10% EZ block (Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan) for 1 h. The mixtures were added to Nunc Immobilizer® streptavidin plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), which were incubated for 2 h. The plates were then washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS). VDAC1 protein bound to biotinylated PQ was detected by anti-VDAC1 mAb (Calbiochem) followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. ECL plus® (GE Healthcare) was used as a substrate of horseradish peroxidase. For NADH binding assay, biotinylated NAD+ (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was mixed with outer membrane extract, and serial dilutions of non-labeled NADH were added for 1 h. The mixtures were incubated with anti-VDAC1 mAb, which was immobilized on Nunc Immobilizer 96-well plates in 10% EZ block (Atto Corp) for 2 h. The plates were washed with TTBS to which ExtrAvidin® peroxidase (Sigma) was added followed by a wash with TTBS. ECL plus was used for the detection of binding. Immobilized normal mouse IgG was used as a control. HeLa cells were transfected with the VDAC1 plasmid using Effectene® (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). HeLa cells were transfected for 72 h with 5 nm control siRNA or Hs_VDAC1_1HP_siRNA (Qiagen) using HiPerFect® transfection reagent (Qiagen). Statistical analyses were conducted using analysis of variance for multiple comparisons and Student's t test for comparing two groups. We first investigated whether PQ produced ROS on mitochondria in HeLa cells. We detected O2̇̄ on the mitochondria using MitoSOX fluorogenic dye (Fig. 1A). Whereas only slight fluorescence was detected on the mitochondria in cells exposed to normal conditions, highly intense levels of fluorescence were observed when the cells were exposed to PQ. Fluorescence was reduced to the control level with the addition of BQ, a scavenger of O2̇̄. In isolated rat liver mitochondria, we detected the NADH-dependent production of H2O2 by PQ using DCFH fluorescent dye (Fig. 1B). Although the fluorescence intensity did not change when PQ or NADH alone was added to the isolated mitochondria, the addition of PQ in combination with NADH raised the intensity of fluorescence in the mitochondria. BQ suppressed this augmentation. We also observed that the co-administration of PQ and NADH led to a loss of structural integrity of the isolated mitochondria, and SOD suppressed this damage (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, Torolox®, an O2̇̄ scavenger, significantly increased the survival rates of HeLa cells exposed to PQ (p < 0.05, Fig. 1D). These results indicated that PQ produced O2̇̄ in an NADH-dependent manner in mitochondria and damaged mitochondria followed by cell death. To reveal the components involved in this activity, we performed two-step extraction with Triton X-100, deoxycholate followed by SDS/Igepal CA-630 from the outer membrane and analyzed SDS/Igepal extract. The extract oxidized NADH, but not NADPH, by the addition of PQ (Fig. 2A), and O2̇̄ was produced in a PQ dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The NADH oxidation activity was 4.4 times that of the Triton X-100/deoxycholate extract (data not shown). To ascertain whether or not VDAC protein is involved in NADH-PQ oxidoreductase activity, we examined the effects of VDAC inhibitors on this activity (Fig. 3A). O2̇̄ production by the extract from the outer membrane mixed with PQ and NADH was significantly inhibited by DIDS, an anion channel inhibitor, or anti-VDAC1 mAb, but such inhibition was not observed with exposure of the extract to normal mouse IgG. When the extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-VDAC1 mAb, the activity in the supernatant was lower than that observed with the administration of normal IgG (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we confirmed that DIDS and anti-VDAC1 mAb inhibited the production of O2̇̄ and also inhibited the breakdown of isolated mitochondria exposed to PQ and NADH (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that VDAC1 is responsible for NADH-PQ oxidoreductase activity.FIGURE 3Participation of VDAC1 in the NADH-PQ oxidoreductase activity and mitochondrial damage. A, O2̇̄ production in the outer membrane extract (closed circle) was inhibited by DIDS (100 μm; open circle, p < 0.001, n = 3) and anti-VDAC1 mAb (30 μg/ml; open triangle, p < 0.05, n = 3).

We purified the active fraction from the SDS/Igepal extract using DEAE chromatography and carried out zymography on the fraction by native PAGE in blue tetrazolium solution with PQ and NADH. A major reactive band stained with dark blue diformazan, a form of blue tetrazolium reduced by O2̇̄, appeared at 500 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 1); this band was recognized using anti-VDAC1 mAb (lane 2). Next, the excised band was examined by Western blot analysis with SDS-PAGE using anti-VDAC1 mAb. The antibody recognized a band at 31 kDa, the size of VDAC1 (lane 3). Because several proteins were detected in the reactive band by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (data not shown), the oxidoreductase may be a complex containing the VDAC1 protein. To confirm the direct interaction of VDAC1 with PQ, we performed a binding assay using recombinant VDAC1 protein and biotinylated PQ (Fig. 4C). We detected biotinylated PQ dose-dependently bound to the VDAC1 protein, and excess non-labeled PQ competed for the binding. Next, we examined the interaction of VDAC1 with NADH using biotinylated NAD+. Whereas the biotinylated NAD+ was not found to bind to the recombinant VDAC1 protein, which was immobilized by anti-VDAC1 mAb (data not shown), we did detect binding of the biotinylated NAD+ using the SDS/Igepal extract instead of the VDAC1 protein (Fig. 4D). These results were compatible with the absence of NADH-PQ oxidoreductase activity in the recombinant VDAC1 protein or purified VDAC from rat liver mitochondria (data not shown). The present results indicate that VDAC1 is involved in NADH-PQ oxidoreductase activity as a component of the PQ binding site. Finally, we determined whether the amount of VDAC1 protein in cells affects PQ sensitivity. We obtained stable transfectants of HeLa cells overexpressing VDAC1; these cells had 2.2 times the VDAC1 protein content of control cells (Fig. 5A). When treated with PQ, these VDAC1-overexpressing cells showed 2.0 times the intracellular production of H2O2 compared with that of control cells (Fig. 5B). The IC50 of control cells exposed to PQ was 72.3 μm, and this value fell to 30.7 μm in the VDAC1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5C). When HeLa cells were transfected with VDAC1 siRNA, almost no VDAC1 protein was synthesized (Fig. 6A). Mitochondria were isolated from these cells, and the NADH-PQ dependent H2O2 production was estimated (Fig. 6B). The"
https://openalex.org/W2071194264,"Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are transmembrane tetramers of individual α-subunits. Eight different Shaker-related Kv subfamilies have been identified in which the tetramerization domain T1, located on the intracellular N terminus, facilitates and controls the assembly of both homo- and heterotetrameric channels. Only the Kv2 α-subunits are able to form heterotetramers with members of the silent Kv subfamilies (Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, and Kv9). The T1 domain contains two subdomains, A and B box, which presumably determine subfamily specificity by preventing incompatible subunits to assemble. In contrast, little is known about the involvement of the A/B linker sequence. Both Kv2 and silent Kv subfamilies contain a fully conserved and negatively charged sequence (CDD) in this linker that is lacking in the other subfamilies. Neutralizing these aspartates in Kv2.1 by mutating them to alanines did not affect the gating properties, but reduced the current density moderately. However, charge reversal arginine substitutions strongly reduced the current density of these homotetrameric mutant Kv2.1 channels and immunocytochemistry confirmed the reduced expression at the plasma membrane. Förster resonance energy transfer measurements using confocal microscopy showed that the latter was not due to impaired trafficking, but to a failure to assemble the tetramer. This was further confirmed with co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The corresponding arginine substitution in Kv6.4 prevented its heterotetrameric interaction with Kv2.1. These results indicate that these aspartates (especially the first one) in the A/B box linker of the T1 domain are required for efficient assembly of both homotetrameric Kv2.1 and heterotetrameric Kv2.1/silent Kv6.4 channels.

Shaker-related channel subfamilies (Kv1–Kv6 and Kv8–Kv9) have been identified based on the degree of sequence homology (1.Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Lazdunski M. McKinnon D. Pardo L.A.

Fully assembled Kv channels are composed of four α-subunits arranged around a central pore. Each α-subunit consists of six transmembrane segments S1–S6 with a cytoplasmic N and C terminus. The N terminus contains the T1 domain, a tetramerization domain that facilitates the assembly of α-subunits into functional channels. The presence of a T1 domain is not absolutely required for channel assembly because subunits without a T1 domain could also assemble into a functional tetramer, although less efficiently (2.Kobertz W.R.

However, the T1 domain not only promotes but also restricts the formation of possible homo- and heterotetramers by preventing incompatible subunits from assembling (5.Lee T.E. Philipson L.H.

When four compatible T1 domains assemble, they are arranged with the same 4-fold symmetry as the transmembrane segments, forming a hanging gondola structure (8.Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C.

The T1 domain contains two subdomains, designated A and B box, which are both highly conserved within the different Kv subfamilies (9.Drewe J.A. Verma S. Frech G. Joho R.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 538-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several residues in both the A and B boxes form the contact interface between neighboring subunits and are commonly assumed to be the key determinants for (subfamily specific) channel tetramerization (6.Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10.Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H. Shen N.V. Kreusch A. Bellamy H. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Nat. Struct.

On the other hand, the amino acid sequence between both subdomains varies in length and sequence conservation and has therefore been assumed to serve no specific role. However, a recent study reported that this linker sequence in Kv2.1 channels is involved in cell surface expression of the channels, voltage-dependent channel activation and phosphorylation-dependent gating modulation (12.Mohapatra D.P. Siino D.F. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4982-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Members of the Kv1–Kv4 subfamilies assemble into functional K+ channels with a homotetrameric configuration. The functional diversity within these subfamilies is increased by forming heterotetramers and by interacting with auxiliary β-subunits. Members of the Kv2 subfamily increase their diversity further by forming heterotetramers with α-subunits of the Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, and Kv9 subfamilies. These latter Kv subfamilies are designated silent α-subunits because they fail to express functional channels in a homotetrameric configuration (13.Ottschytsch N. Raes A. Van Hoorick D. Snyders D.J.

This retention is rescued by the selective co-assembly with members of the Kv2 subfamily in which the silent Kv subunits modulate the Kv2 currents by reducing the current amplitude, altering the inactivation and deactivation kinetics and shifting the voltage dependence of inactivation toward more hyperpolarized potentials (13.Ottschytsch N.

An alignment of the Kv1–Kv9 subunits revealed a negatively charged sequence (CDD) in the region between the A and B box that is fully conserved in both Kv2 and silent Kv subunits, but absent in the Kv1, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies (Fig. 1A). This pattern of amino acid conservation drew our attention regarding the subfamily-specific channel assembly. Therefore, we studied the contribution of this CDD sequence in the assembly of homotetrameric Kv2.1 and heterotetrameric Kv2.1/Kv6.4 channels using biophysical, biochemical, and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of mutant Kv2.1 and Kv6.4 channel subunits. Human Kv2.1 and Kv6.4 (previously named Kv6.3) were both cloned in the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (13.Ottschytsch N. Raes A. Van Hoorick D. Snyders D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7986-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced during a PCR amplification using the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and mutant primers. Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged subunits were obtained by introducing a HA tag in the extracellular S1–S2 linker. The presence of the desired modification and the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. N-terminal-tagged cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) constructs were obtained by subcloning the channel subunits in the pECFP-C1 (Clontech) and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) vectors, respectively. The YFP-CFP fusion construct (dimer) was obtained by removing the STOP codon and simultaneously introducing an EcoRI restriction site in the pEYFP-C1 vector. Subsequently, the entire coding sequence for YFP was cut from the vector with EcoRI and ligated in an EcoRI-digested pECFP-N1 vector. The final construct, named YFP-CFP dimer, contains an in-frame sequence with a 17-amino acid long linker between the YFP and CFP. Mouse Ltk− cells (ATCC CCL 1.3) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The Ltk− cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate channel cDNA, in combination with 0.5 μg of GFP as a transfection marker. Transfections were performed on cultures at 70% confluency with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The amount of cDNA transfected and overnight incubation conditions (37 or 25 °C) are indicated in the figures and legends. The Kv6.4 subunits were co-transfected with Kv2.1 in a 10:1 ratio to ensure that the presence of homotetrameric Kv2.1 channels was less than 0.01%. Cells were trypsinized 16 to 24 h after transfection and used for electrophysiological analysis within 5 h. Whole cell current recordings were obtained at room temperature (20–25 °C) using an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The current recordings were low-pass filtered and sampled at 1–10 kHz with a Digidata 1200A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). The pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments) was used to control command voltages and data storage. Patch pipettes, with a resistance of 1.5–2.5 mΩ in the standard extracellular solution, were pulled with a laser puller P2000 (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) from 1.2-mm borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and then heat polished. The cells were superfused continuously with an extracellular solution containing (in mm): 145 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, 10 glucose and adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH. The pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mm): 110 KCl, 5 K4-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 5 K2ATP, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes with the pH adjusted to 7.2 using KOH. Junction potentials were zeroed with the filled pipette in the bath solution. The access resistance varied from 2 to 10 mΩ and cells were excluded from analysis if the series resistance exceeded 3 mΩ after compensation to ensure that voltage errors did not exceed 5 mV. Voltage protocols (as shown in the figures and legends) were adjusted to characterize the biophysical properties of mutant channel subunits adequately. The interpulse interval was at least 15 s but was increased to 30 s for some protocols to prevent channels from accumulating in the inactivated state. The voltage dependence of channel activation or inactivation was fitted with a Boltzmann equation according to: y = 1/{1 + exp(− (V − V½)/k)}, in which V represents the voltage applied, V½ the voltage at which 50% of the channels are activated or inactivated, and k the slope factor. Kinetics of activation and deactivation were fitted with a single or double exponential function. Off-line leak corrections were performed for all current density data shown. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done using the Student's t test or a Mann Whitney U Rank Sum test in case unequal variances between the data sets were present. p values < 0.05 were considered to be significantly different. HEK293 cells were cultured on coverslips in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the N-terminal CFP-tagged construct according to the lipofection method using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were fixated 24 to 48 h after transfection with 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were incubated overnight with the K39/25 antibody (1:50), a mouse monoclonal antibody generated against the extracellular S1–S2 loop of Kv2.1 (28.Lim S.T. Antonucci D.E. Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), dissolved in a 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 10% horse serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA-c, Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands). R-Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-mouse (Invitrogen) was used as secondary antibody (1:100) and was dissolved in a 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline solution supplemented with 1% horse serum. After a 1-h incubation with the secondary antibody, confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss CLSM 510 microscope equipped with an argon laser (excitation 458 nm) and a helium-neon laser (excitation 543 nm) for visualization of CFP-tagged channels (emission signal recorded in the 480–520-nm bandwidth) and PE-labeled antibodies (emission signal recorded beyond the 560-nm bandwidth), respectively. The cell surface expression level of the different channel constructs was determined on three independent experiments. HEK293 cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected with 1 μg of channel cDNA as described above. YFP-tagged Kv2.1 subunits were co-transfected with CFP-tagged Kv2.1 or CFP-tagged Kv6.4 constructs in a 2:1 cDNA ratio to ensure that all FRET donor molecules were paired with the FRET acceptor molecules. Cells were used 24–48 h after transfection for FRET analysis. The fluorescent emission light of CFP (donor dye) and YFP (acceptor dye) molecules was determined using the Zeiss CLSM 510 microscope as detailed above. The confocal images were recorded with a lower stack size to minimize nonspecific bleaching of the fluorophores. FRET efficiencies were determined using Equation 1. FRET=(1-fDA-fbackgroundfD-fbackground)×1pairedDA(Eq. 1) The CFP emission signal was recorded in the 464–490-nm bandwidth (after excitation at 458 nm) in both the presence of YFP (fDA, fluorescence signal of donor in the presence of the acceptor) and in the absence of YFP (fD, fluorescence of donor only). To determine fD, the YFP acceptor molecule was bleached by a 30-s full power excitation at 514-nm laser light (quality check for this bleach was a drop in the emission light in the 520–580-nm bandwidth). Both fDA and fD were corrected for background signal (fbackground) by determining the emission light in the 464–490-nm bandwidth after additional bleaching of CFP with a 30-s full power 458-nm laser light exposure. The cDNA ratio of the YFP- and CFP-tagged constructs used was chosen to minimize the fraction of unpaired donor and the paired DA fraction was therefore assumed to be 1 in the situation of WT channel subunits. FRET efficiencies were determined from three or more independent transfections and only calculated for cells in which the YFP:CFP ratio was higher than 2.5. Given that for a YFP-CFP fluorophore pair the Förster distance (Ro) is 49.2 Å (29.Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the distance between both chromophores (R) can be calculated from the obtained FRET efficiencies using the following equation. FRET=11+(RR0)6(Eq. 2) HA-tagged Kv2.1 subunits were co-transfected with CFP-tagged Kv2.1 subunits into HEK293 cells in a 1:1 cDNA ratio. Cells were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). For the immunoprecipitation, 1.7 μg/μl of the total soluble fraction was incubated with 2 μl of anti-GFP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by incubation with 20 μl of Protein G-agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics), which were preblocked with 2% milk. After extensive washing of the beads with solubilization buffer, proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 15 min. Subsequently, the eluted protein complexes were separated on a 4–12% BisTris SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen). The separated protein complexes were transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) and the blot was blocked with 5% milk. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by incubation of the blot with anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics) followed by incubation with anti-rat IgG (GE Healthcare) and subsequently ECL detection (GE Healthcare). Sequence alignment of the different Kv channel subfamilies (shown in Fig. 1) was build using MEGALIGN (DNAstar, Madison, WI). The Kv2.1 homology model used was generated with the web based interface of the SWISS-MODEL Repository data base (30.Kopp J. Schwede T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D230-D234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6071) Google Scholar). Illustrations were produced with the program USCF Chimera (32.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput.

An alignment of the T1 domain of all members of the Kv1–Kv9 subfamilies revealed an interesting conservation pattern of the net negatively charged CDD sequence, localized in the region between the A and B box; this CDD sequence is fully conserved in both Kv2 and silent Kv subunits but absent in other subfamilies (Fig. 1A). To determine the localization of this conserved CDD sequence, a homology model of the Kv2.1 T1 domain was generated with SWISS-MODEL (30.Kopp J. Schwede T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D230-D234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6071) Google Scholar) based on the Kv4.2 T1 domain crystal structure (Fig. 1, B and C). Within this structural model the CDD sequence is situated on a discrete loop at the bottom of the Kv2.1 T1 domain. Because this loop was the only striking difference between the Kv2.1 model and the available Kv1.2 (33.Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), Kv3.1 (10.Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H. Shen N.V. Kreusch A. Bellamy H. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Nat. Struct.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8670-8675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) crystal structures, we wondered whether this CDD sequence would play an important role in the subfamily-specific interaction within the Kv2 subfamily and between the Kv2 and silent Kv subfamilies. To investigate the potential role of the CDD sequence in the homotetrameric Kv2.1 channel assembly, we initially replaced the cysteine (at position 73) and the two aspartates (at positions 74 and 75) individually or together with alanine residues (C73A, D74A, D75A, and D74A,D75A, respectively). These mutations resulted in functional channels with biophysical properties similar to WT Kv2.1. However, the current density of the double D74A,D75A mutant was significantly reduced compared with WT (supplemental Fig. S1). For the single D74A mutant a similar trend was observed, albeit not statistically significant. Next we reversed the charge of the aspartates by replacing these amino acids alone or together with arginine residues (D74R, D75R, and D74R,D75R). Typical current recordings of wild type (WT) Kv2.1 and the charge-reversal mutants Kv2.1(D74R), Kv2.1(D75R), and Kv2.1(D74R,D75R) are shown in Fig. 2A. Both the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 2B, Table 1) and inactivation (see Fig. 2C and Table 1) as well as the kinetics of activation and deactivation (see Fig. 2D and Table 1) were quite similar to those from WT Kv2.1. However, the translocation of the channel subunits to the plasma membrane, as measured by the overall current density, was severely decreased (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to WT Kv2.1, no macroscopic time-dependent K+ current could be detected after transfection of 50 ng of cDNA and overnight incubation at 37 °C for the different Kv2.1 charge-reversal (Asp > Arg) mutants, whereas with these conditions WT Kv2.1 yielded 2.7 ± 0.6 nA current (n = 12, Fig. 3B). By increasing the amount of cDNA transfected to 0.5 μg, both charge-reversal mutants displayed time-dependent Kv2.1-type currents but Kv2.1(D74R) still displayed significantly smaller current densities compared with Kv2.1(D75R). This indicated that substituting Asp-74 had a more severe effect than substituting Asp-75. Transfection of 5 μg of cDNA was required to observe measurable currents for the double mutant (D74R,D75R). Interestingly, overnight incubation at 25 °C largely abolished the effect of the different Asp > Arg mutants (Fig. 3B).TABLE 1Biophysical properties of WT and mutant Kv2.1 channel subunitsKv2.1Kv2.1D74RD75RD74R,D75RActivationV½6.1 ± 2.21.7 ± 2.1−2.2 ± 1.212.0 ± 2.9Slope9.0 ± 0.48.1 ± 0.67.9 ± 0.312.4 ± 0.7Tau (60 mV)23.7 ± 1.822.4 ± 2.923.0 ± 2.526.1 ± 4.4n7655InactivationV½−18.2 ± 2.3−21.4 ± 3.0−22.0 ± 1.6−12.9 ± 0.7Slope6.4 ± 0.54.7 ± 0.44.8 ± 0.45.2 ± 0.4n7554DeactivationTau 1 (−20 mV)26.9 ± 1.823.1 ± 3.423.9 ± 3.525.6 ± 4.7Tau 2 (−20 mV)126.8 ± 10.8154.5 ± 22.5217.6 ± 22.7247.6 ± 39.2n6545 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Current density of WT and charge-reversal Kv2.1 channels.

We investigated this by analyzing the surface expression of CFP-tagged WT or mutant Kv2.1 channels with immunofluorescence. Transfected HEK293 cells were stained with the K39/25 antibody followed by a PE-labeled secondary antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”), without permeabilizing the cells. Thus, only the channels that were able to translocate from the ER to the plasma membrane were stained because the K39/25 antibody epitope is situated in the extracellular S1–S2 loop. We tested the specificity of this approach and the K39/25 antibody by staining cells expressing WT CFP-Kv2.1 (positive control) and WT CFP-Kv4.2 (negative control) in which the CFP tag served as a transfection marker. Immunofluorescent staining of WT CFP-Kv2.1 generated a clear plasma membrane (PM) staining (red fluorescence) indicating a PM expression of WT CFP-Kv2.1 (Fig. 4A). This was verified by the observed blue PM fluorescence originating from the genetically encoded CFP tag (Fig. 4A). In contrast, immunofluorescent staining of WT CFP-Kv4.2 caused no noticeable PM staining (red fluorescence) although the channels were robustly expressed at the PM as indicated by the peripheral blue fluorescent signal from the genetically encoded CFP molecule (Fig. 4B). Next, we analyzed the surface expression of the charge-reversal Kv2.1 mutants. Immunofluorescent staining of cells expressing CFP-Kv2.1(D74R) and CFP-Kv2.1(D74R,D75R) exhibited scarce (for the D74R mutant) or virtually no (for the D74R,D75R mutant) PM staining. Furthermore, the localization of the CFP fluorescence of these two mutants, no blue PM staining but a more diffuse intracellular staining, indicated that the mutant channel subunits were synthesized but were unable to translocate from the ER to the PM. In contrast, CFP-Kv2.1(D75R) displayed a pattern of immunofluorescent staining similar to that of WT Kv2.1. Thus, the results on the surface expression level for the different Asp > Arg mutants, obtained from the immunocytochemistry, corresponded well with the electrophysiological observations. The reduced density of the mutant channels in the plasma membrane could be caused by either a deficiency in their assembly in the ER or a problem in trafficking from the ER to the PM. To discriminate between these two possibilities we determined FRET between genetically encoded CFP and YFP fluorophores that were added at the N-terminal end of WT Kv2.1 and mutant subunits. N-terminal labeled channel subunits were used because we an"
https://openalex.org/W2080517825,"ECRG2 is a novel gene that shows sequence similarity to KAZAL-type serine protease inhibitor. We have previously demonstrated that ECRG2 inhibits migration/invasion of lung cancer PG cells. However, the mechanism by which ECRG2 performs these activities is a compelling question. Urokinase-type plasmin activator (uPA) binding to uPAR induces migration/invasion through multiple interactors including integrins. In this study, we found that ECRG2 binds specifically to the kringle domain of uPA. Moreover, we demonstrated that ECRG2 forms a complex with uPA.uPAR, that such a complex modifies the dynamical association of uPAR with beta1 integrins, and that disruption inhibits Src/MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase pathway, resulting in suppression of cell migration/invasion in an in vitro Matrigel migration/invasion assay. Conversely, depletion of ECRG2 markedly enhanced the association of uPAR with beta1 integrins, elevated basal Src/MAP kinase activation, and stimulated HT1080, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cell migration/invasion. Together, our results provide evidence that ECRG2 is involved in the regulation of migration/invasion through uPA/uPAR/beta1 integrins/Src/MAP kinase pathway and may represent a novel therapeutic target for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2047401299,"Tec family tyrosine kinases transduce signals from antigen and other receptors. In particular, Itk plays an important role in T-cell development and activation. Itk has an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a Tec Homology domain with a proline-rich region, SH3 and SH2 domains and a kinase domain, the structure each of which has been determined. However, the full structure of Itk and other Tec kinases remain elusive. Models of Itk suggest either a head to tail dimer, with the SH2 domain interacting with the SH3 domain, or a folded monomer with the SH3 domain interacting with the proline-rich region. We show here that in vivo Itk exists as a monomer, with the pleckstrin homology domain less than 80 A from the C terminus. Zn2+ coordinating residues in the Tec Homology domain, not the proline-rich region, are critical for this intramolecular interaction. These data have implications for our understanding of Tec family kinase structure."
https://openalex.org/W1965478144,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are coupled via phospholipase Cbeta to the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and function to modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission at glutamatergic synapses. The desensitization of Group I mGluR signaling is thought to be mediated primarily via second messenger-dependent protein kinases and G protein-coupled receptor kinases. We show here that both mGluR1 and mGluR5 interact with the calcineurin inhibitor protein (CAIN). CAIN is co-immunoprecipitated in a complex with Group I mGluRs from both HEK 293 cells and mouse cortical brain lysates. Purified CAIN and its C-terminal domain specifically interact with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins corresponding to the second intracellular loop and the distal C-terminal tail domains of mGluR1. The interaction of CAIN with mGluR1 could also be blocked using a Tat-tagged peptide corresponding to the mGluR1 second intracellular loop domain. Overexpression of full-length CAIN attenuates the agonist-stimulated endocytosis of both mGluR1a and mGluR5a in HEK 293 cells, but expression of the CAIN C-terminal domain does not alter mGluR5a internalization. In contrast, overexpression of either full-length CAIN or the CAIN C-terminal domain impairs agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in HEK 293 cells expressing mGluR1a. This CAIN-mediated antagonism of mGluR1a signaling appears to involve the disruption of receptor-Galpha(q/11) complexes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the association of CAIN with intracellular domains involved in mGluR/G protein coupling provides an additional mechanism by which Group I mGluR endocytosis and signaling are regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2026976182,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a lethal hematological disorder caused by the p210Bcr−Abl oncogene. Previous studies have suggested that p210Bcr−Abl transformation contributes to homing and retention defects, typical of immature myeloid cells in CML, by attenuating chemotactic response to stromal-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). As Rho family GTPases are key regulators of the cytoskeleton and have been previously found to interact with p210Bcr−Abl, this study aimed to determine whether p210Bcr−Abl signaling affects SDF-1α chemotaxis through Rho GTPase signaling. We found that SDF-1α stimulated Cdc42 GTPase activation in myeloid progenitor 32D, but not in p210Bcr−Abl-transformed (32Dp210) cells. In fact, the basal level of active Cdc42 was elevated in 32Dp210 cells and mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow of CML patients. Inhibition of p210Bcr−Abl kinase activity decreased basal Cdc42 activity and restored SDF-1α-induced Cdc42 and migration responses. Transduction of active Tat-Cdc42V12 abolished this reconstituted chemotactic response. As Cdc42 is particularly important in cytoskeletal remodeling and directional sensing, these results suggest that sustained activation of Cdc42 GTPase through p210Bcr−Abl tyrosine kinase signaling in CML cells contributes to defects in SDF-1α-chemotactic response due to desensitization of the actin polarization signal required for directional migration."
https://openalex.org/W2088427475,"The secreted protein Hedgehog (Hh) plays a critical instructional role during metazoan development. In Drosophila, Hh signaling is interpreted by a set of conserved, downstream effectors that differentially localize and interact to regulate the stability and activity of the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus. Two essential models that integrate genetic, cell biological, and biochemical information have been proposed to explain how these signaling components relate to one another within the cellular context. As the molar ratios of the signaling effectors required in each of these models are quite different, quantitating the cellular ratio of pathway components could distinguish these two models. Here, we address this important question using a set of purified protein standards to perform a quantitative analysis of Drosophila cell lysates for each downstream pathway component. We determine each component's steady-state concentration within a given cell, demonstrate the molar ratio of Hh signaling effectors differs more than two orders of magnitude and that this ratio is conserved in vivo. We find that the G-protein-coupled transmembrane protein Smoothened, an activating component, is present in limiting amounts, while a negative pathway regulator, Suppressor of Fused, is present in vast molar excess. Interestingly, despite large differences in the steady-state ratio, all downstream signaling components exist in an equimolar membrane-associated complex. We use these quantitative results to re-evaluate the current models of Hh signaling and now propose a novel model of signaling that accounts for the stoichiometric differences observed between various Hh pathway components."
