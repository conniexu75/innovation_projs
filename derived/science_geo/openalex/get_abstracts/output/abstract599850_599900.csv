https://openalex.org/W2768799378,"Colorectal cancers comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed cells, and microorganisms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is among the most prevalent bacterial species in colorectal cancer tissues. Here we show that colonization of human colorectal cancers with Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome-including Bacteroides, Selenomonas, and Prevotella species-is maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating microbiome stability between paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Fusobacterium is predominantly associated with cancer cells in the metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were found to retain viable Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome through successive passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft with the antibiotic metronidazole reduced Fusobacterium load, cancer cell proliferation, and overall tumor growth. These observations argue for further investigation of antimicrobial interventions as a potential treatment for patients with Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer."

Pushing on an ordinary linearly elastic bar can cause it to be deformed in many ways. However, a twist, the counterpart of optical activity in the static case, is strictly zero. The unavailability of this degree of freedom hinders applications in terms of mode conversion and the realization of advanced mechanical designs using coordinate transformations. Here, we aim at realizing microstructured three-dimensional elastic chiral mechanical metamaterials that overcome this limitation. On overall millimeter-sized samples, we measure twists per axial strain exceeding 2°/%. Scaling up the number of unit cells for fixed sample dimensions, the twist is robust due to metamaterial stiffening, indicating a characteristic length scale and bringing the aforementioned applications into reach."

Most commonly, it is assumed that natural selection separates species originating from a single population on the basis of variation in traits that confer advantages for survival and reproduction. Lamichhaney et al. document a case where cross-species hybridization established a reproductively isolated lineage, which demonstrates a process known as homoploid hybrid speciation in action (see the Perspective by Wagner). The authors used genetic markers and phenotypic analyses to create a pedigree that revealed how a cross-island migrant bred with a native species to form a self-perpetuating hybrid population that was reproductively isolated from both parental species.

https://openalex.org/W2476479720,"Most networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the network's structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting network paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the networks' temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static networks. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, enhancing our ability to control them."
https://openalex.org/W2769571012,"The discovery of new materials for separating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular separations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically separate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging separations."
https://openalex.org/W2768855432,"Dispersing small, bimetallic nanoparticles For applications of nanoparticles in sensing and catalysis, smaller nanoparticles are often more effective because they expose more active surface sites. The properties of metallic nanoparticles can also be improved by creating bimetallic alloys, but typical synthetic methods yield larger nanoparticles where the metals are poorly mixed. Wong et al. show that well-mixed bimetallic ∼1-nm-diameter nanoparticles can be made on silica supports. To do this, they exploited strong electrostatic adsorption, in which the metal precursors are strongly adsorbed onto the surface by controlling pH relative to the surface point of zero charge. Their method was successful for a wide range of metal alloys. Science , this issue p. 1427"
https://openalex.org/W2770128744,"Mitosis-specific role of ATR The ATR (ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) kinase plays important roles in the S phase and during the DNA damage response to safeguard genome integrity. Kabeche et al. identified a distinct ATR activation pathway in mitosis that is also critical for suppressing genome instability (see the Perspective by Saldivar and Cimprich). ATR is recruited by Aurora A and activated by R loops at centromeres of mitotic chromosomes; this leads to Aurora B activation, which is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation. This mitotic, R loop–driven ATR signaling pathway could potentially be exploited in the search for cancer therapeutics. Science , this issue p. 108 ; see also p. 30"
https://openalex.org/W2770290347,"When deformed beyond their elastic limits, crystalline solids flow plastically via particle rearrangements localized around structural defects. Disordered solids also flow, but without obvious structural defects. We link structure to plasticity in disordered solids via a microscopic structural quantity, ""softness,"" designed by machine learning to be maximally predictive of rearrangements. Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus. These commonalities link the spatial correlations and strain response of softness to rearrangement size and yield strain, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2768494297,"Programmable nucleases, such as Cas9, are used for precise genome editing by homology-dependent repair (HDR). However, HDR efficiency is constrained by competition from other double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, including non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). We report the discovery of a genetically encoded inhibitor of 53BP1 that increases the efficiency of HDR-dependent genome editing in human and mouse cells. 53BP1 is a key regulator of DSB repair pathway choice in eukaryotic cells and functions to favor NHEJ over HDR by suppressing end resection, which is the rate-limiting step in the initiation of HDR. We screened an existing combinatorial library of engineered ubiquitin variants for inhibitors of 53BP1. Expression of one variant, named i53 (inhibitor of 53BP1), in human and mouse cells, blocked accumulation of 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage and improved gene targeting and chromosomal gene conversion with either double-stranded DNA or single-stranded oligonucleotide donors by up to 5.6-fold. Inhibition of 53BP1 is a robust method to increase efficiency of HDR-based precise genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W2768387192,"Degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium is a hallmark of geographic atrophy, a type of age-related macular degeneration. Kerur et al. show that this degeneration results from a multistep pathway in which mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells, triggered by accumulation of Alu RNA, leads to activation of the noncanonical inflammasome via a cGAS–STING–IRF3 signaling axis. Geographic atrophy is a blinding form of age-related macular degeneration characterized by retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) death; the RPE also exhibits DICER1 deficiency, resultant accumulation of endogenous Alu-retroelement RNA, and NLRP3-inflammasome activation. How the inflammasome is activated in this untreatable disease is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that RPE degeneration in human-cell-culture and mouse models is driven by a noncanonical-inflammasome pathway that activates caspase-4 (caspase-11 in mice) and caspase-1, and requires cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-dependent interferon-β production and gasdermin D–dependent interleukin-18 secretion. Decreased DICER1 levels or Alu-RNA accumulation triggers cytosolic escape of mitochondrial DNA, which engages cGAS. Moreover, caspase-4, gasdermin D, interferon-β, and cGAS levels were elevated in the RPE in human eyes with geographic atrophy. Collectively, these data highlight an unexpected role of cGAS in responding to mobile-element transcripts, reveal cGAS-driven interferon signaling as a conduit for mitochondrial-damage-induced inflammasome activation, expand the immune-sensing repertoire of cGAS and caspase-4 to noninfectious human disease, and identify new potential targets for treatment of a major cause of blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2770468831,"Carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global carbon cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean's interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite oxidation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite oxidation may have a greater impact on the carbon cycle than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2769947821,"The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base's interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2769187448,"Achieving universal, safely managed water and sanitation services by 2030, as envisioned by the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, is projected to require capital expenditures of USD 114 billion per year ( 1 ). Investment on that scale, along with accompanying policy reforms, can be motivated by a growing appreciation of the value of water. Yet our ability to value water, and incorporate these values into water governance, is inadequate. Newly recognized cascading negative impacts of water scarcity, pollution, and flooding underscore the need to change the way we value water ( 2 ). With the UN/World Bank High Level Panel on Water having launched the Valuing Water Initiative in 2017 to chart principles and pathways for valuing water, we see a global opportunity to rethink the value of water. We outline four steps toward better valuation and management (see the box), examine recent advances in each of these areas, and argue that these four steps must be integrated to overcome the barriers that have stymied past efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2770204006,"Infants understand that people pursue goals, but how do they learn which goals people prefer? We tested whether infants solve this problem by inverting a mental model of action planning, trading off the costs of acting against the rewards actions bring. After seeing an agent attain two goals equally often at varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the goal it attained through costlier actions. These expectations held across three experiments that conveyed cost through different physical path features (height, width, and incline angle), suggesting that an abstract variable-such as ""force,"" ""work,"" or ""effort""-supported infants' inferences. We modeled infants' expectations as Bayesian inferences over utility-theoretic calculations, providing a bridge to recent quantitative accounts of action understanding in older children and adults."
https://openalex.org/W2768421721,"A survey of cell envelope proteins and their interacting partners in E. coli by mass spectrometry reveals insights into essential bacterial processes. Bacterial cell envelope protein (CEP) complexes mediate a range of processes, including membrane assembly, antibiotic resistance and metabolic coordination. However, only limited characterization of relevant macromolecules has been reported to date. Here we present a proteomic survey of 1,347 CEPs encompassing 90% inner- and outer-membrane and periplasmic proteins of Escherichia coli. After extraction with non-denaturing detergents, we affinity-purified 785 endogenously tagged CEPs and identified stably associated polypeptides by precision mass spectrometry. The resulting high-quality physical interaction network, comprising 77% of targeted CEPs, revealed many previously uncharacterized heteromeric complexes. We found that the secretion of autotransporters requires translocation and the assembly module TamB to nucleate proper folding from periplasm to cell surface through a cooperative mechanism involving the β-barrel assembly machinery. We also establish that an ABC transporter of unknown function, YadH, together with the Mla system preserves outer membrane lipid asymmetry. This E. coli CEP 'interactome' provides insights into the functional landscape governing CE systems essential to bacterial growth, metabolism and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2769890435,"Precise knowledge of the fundamental properties of the proton is essential for our understanding of atomic structure as well as for precise tests of fundamental symmetries. We report on a direct high-precision measurement of the magnetic moment μp of the proton in units of the nuclear magneton μN The result, μp = 2.79284734462 (±0.00000000082) μN, has a fractional precision of 0.3 parts per billion, improves the previous best measurement by a factor of 11, and is consistent with the currently accepted value. This was achieved with the use of an optimized double-Penning trap technique. Provided a similar measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment can be performed, this result will enable a test of the fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter in the baryonic sector at the 10-10 level."
https://openalex.org/W2768896386,"We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium 87 atoms to quantum degeneracy. The method does not involve evaporative cooling, is fast, and induces little atom loss. The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of cloud compression to increase the density, followed by degenerate Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. Light-induced loss at high atomic density is substantially reduced by using far red detuned optical pumping light. Starting with 2000 atoms, we prepare 1400 atoms in 300 ms at quantum degeneracy, as confirmed by the appearance of a bimodal velocity distribution as the system crosses over from a classical gas to a Bose-condensed, interacting one-dimensional gas with a macroscopic population of the quantum ground state. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and fermionic species, and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible."
https://openalex.org/W2768929279,"Tet enzymes oxidize 5-methyl-deoxycytidine (mdC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-dC (hmdC), 5-formyl-dC (fdC) and 5-carboxy-dC (cadC) in DNA. It was proposed that fdC and cadC deformylate and decarboxylate, respectively, to dC over the course of an active demethylation process. This would re-install canonical dC bases at previously methylated sites. However, whether such direct C-C bond cleavage reactions at fdC and cadC occur in vivo remains an unanswered question. Here we report the incorporation of synthetic isotope- and (R)-2'-fluorine-labeled dC and fdC derivatives into the genome of cultured mammalian cells. Following the fate of these probe molecules using UHPLC-MS/MS provided quantitative data about the formed reaction products. The data show that the labeled fdC probe is efficiently converted into the corresponding labeled dC, most likely after its incorporation into the genome. Therefore, we conclude that fdC undergoes C-C bond cleavage in stem cells, leading to the direct re-installation of unmodified dC."
https://openalex.org/W2769220533,"Tissue homeostasis and regeneration are mediated by programs of adult stem cell renewal and differentiation. However, the mechanisms that regulate stem cell fates under such widely varying conditions are not fully understood. Using single-cell techniques, we assessed the transcriptional changes associated with stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and followed the maturation of stem cell-derived clones using sparse lineage tracing in the regenerating mouse olfactory epithelium. Following injury, quiescent olfactory stem cells rapidly shift to activated, transient states unique to regeneration and tailored to meet the demands of injury-induced repair, including barrier formation and proliferation. Multiple cell fates, including renewed stem cells and committed differentiating progenitors, are specified during this early window of activation. We further show that Sox2 is essential for cells to transition from the activated to neuronal progenitor states. Our study highlights strategies for stem cell-mediated regeneration that may be conserved in other adult stem cell niches."
https://openalex.org/W2768413599,"Adult neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium is often depicted as a unidirectional pathway during homeostasis and repair. We challenge the unidirectionality of this model by showing that epithelial injury unlocks the potential for Ascl1+ progenitors and Neurog1+ specified neuronal precursors to dedifferentiate into multipotent stem/progenitor cells that contribute significantly to tissue regeneration in the murine olfactory epithelium (OE). We characterize these dedifferentiating cells using several lineage-tracing strains and single-cell mRNA-seq, and we show that Sox2 is required for initiating dedifferentiation and that inhibition of Ezh2 promotes multipotent progenitor expansion. These results suggest that the apparent hierarchy of neuronal differentiation is not irreversible and that lineage commitment can be overridden following severe tissue injury. We elucidate a previously unappreciated pathway for endogenous tissue repair by a highly regenerative neuroepithelium and introduce a system to study the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the OE that can be adapted for other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2769185894,"Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (Pofut1) regulates Notch activity by adding O-fucose residues to its extracellular domain. Fucose analogs were identified that inhibited Delta-mediated Notch binding and activation but spared Jagged1-mediated signaling. Notch is a cell-surface receptor that controls cell-fate decisions and is regulated by O-glycans attached to epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats in its extracellular domain. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (Pofut1) modifies EGF repeats with O-fucose and is essential for Notch signaling. Constitutive activation of Notch signaling has been associated with a variety of human malignancies. Therefore, tools that inhibit Notch activity are being developed as cancer therapeutics. To this end, we screened L-fucose analogs for their effects on Notch signaling. Two analogs, 6-alkynyl and 6-alkenyl fucose, were substrates of Pofut1 and were incorporated directly into Notch EGF repeats in cells. Both analogs were potent inhibitors of binding to and activation of Notch1 by Notch ligands Dll1 and Dll4, but not by Jag1. Mutagenesis and modeling studies suggest that incorporation of the analogs into EGF8 of Notch1 markedly reduces the ability of Delta ligands to bind and activate Notch1."
https://openalex.org/W2768736041,"Proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis depend on cohesion between sister chromatids, mediated by the cohesin protein complex, which also plays crucial roles in diverse genome maintenance pathways. Current models attribute DNA binding by cohesin to entrapment of dsDNA by the cohesin ring subunits (SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21 in humans). However, the biophysical properties and activities of the fourth core cohesin subunit SA2 (STAG2) are largely unknown. Here, using single-molecule atomic force and fluorescence microscopy imaging as well as fluorescence anisotropy measurements, we established that SA2 binds to both dsDNA and ssDNA, albeit with a higher binding affinity for ssDNA. We observed that SA2 can switch between the 1D diffusing (search) mode on dsDNA and stable binding (recognition) mode at ssDNA gaps. Although SA2 does not specifically bind to centromeric or telomeric sequences, it does recognize DNA structures often associated with DNA replication and double-strand break repair, such as a double-stranded end, single-stranded overhang, flap, fork, and ssDNA gap. SA2 loss leads to a defect in homologous recombination–mediated DNA double-strand break repair. These results suggest that SA2 functions at intermediate DNA structures during DNA transactions in genome maintenance pathways.

Somatic mutations of the SA2 gene and loss of SA2 protein expression have been reported in multiple cancer cell lines, including urothelial bladder carcinomas, Ewing’s sarcomas, glioblastomas, and malignant melanomas (21Solomon D.A.

Despite the progress made since the discovery of the cohesin complex, many fundamental questions regarding the structure and assembly of cohesin remain unanswered (23Onn I. Heidinger-Pauli J.M.

For example, how cohesin binds to chromatin to establish sister chromatid cohesion is not fully understood (25Uhlmann F. A matter of choice: the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10 (19745840): 1095-110210.1038/embor.2009.207Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Various models, including one ring, twin-ring handcuffs, bracelet oligomers, and C-clamps, have been proposed for cohesin assembly on DNA (24Skibbens R.V.

However, these models have not taken into consideration that SA2 plays important roles both in stabilizing cohesin on DNA and unloading cohesin from chromatin. It is known that SA2 phosphorylation by the polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) leads to the removal of cohesin from chromatin (26Hauf S. Roitinger E. Koch B. Dittrich C.M. Mechtler K. Peters J.M. Dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms and loss of arm cohesion during early mitosis depends on phosphorylation of SA2.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3 (15737063): e6910.1371/journal.pbio.0030069Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of SA2 in the relationship of cohesin with DNA. In addition, how cohesin DNA binding is spatially controlled along the genome is poorly understood. DNA DSB induction leads to the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in the G2 phase, which facilitates the DNA repair process (27Ström L. Lindroos H.B. Shirahige K. Sjögren C.

It was proposed that following the induction of DSBs, cohesin is recruited to the region surrounding the DSB as well as genome-wide through the DNA damage response pathway and chromatin remodeling (32Unal E.

In addition, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cohesin ring is capable of sliding on DNA with a diffusion constant approaching the theoretical limit for free 1D diffusion, and the complex falls off from free DNA ends (34Stigler J. Çamdere G.Ö. Koshland D.E. Greene E.C. Single-molecule imaging reveals a collapsed conformational state for DNA-bound cohesin.Cell Rep. 2016; 15 (27117417): 988-99810.1016/j.celrep.2016.04.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These observations raise an important question: How does the cohesin complex promote stable cohesion during DNA DSB repair without sliding off from DNA ends? In addition, SA1 and SA2 have different roles during DSB repair, as well as during sister chromatid cohesion at telomeres and centromeres (35Canudas S. Houghtaling B.R. Kim J.Y. Dynek J.N. Chang W.G. Smith S. Protein requirements for sister telomere association in human cells.EMBO J. 2007; 26 (17962804): 4867-487810.1038/sj.emboj.7601903Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 36Bisht K.K.

Whereas SA2 is important for cohesion at centromeres, depletion analysis showed that telomeres relied heavily on SA1 and to a lesser extent on the cohesin ring for cohesion (35Canudas S. Houghtaling B.R. Kim J.Y. Dynek J.N. Chang W.G. Smith S. Protein requirements for sister telomere association in human cells.EMBO J. 2007; 26 (17962804): 4867-487810.1038/sj.emboj.7601903Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 36Bisht K.K. Daniloski Z.

It has been suggested that the SA subunits in humans and their orthologs in yeast (Scc3 in budding yeast and Psc3 in fission yeast) play a role in the loading of cohesin ring onto chromosomes through the interaction between DNA and the cohesin hinge (37Huis in 't Veld P.J.

The crystal structure of SA2 (residues 80–1060) shows that it contains a helical domain at its N terminus followed by 17 HEAT repeats shaped like a dragon (39Hara K. Zheng G. Qu Q. Liu H. Ouyang Z. Chen Z. Tomchick D.R. Yu H. Structure of cohesin subcomplex pinpoints direct shugoshin-Wapl antagonism in centromeric cohesion.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Binding to DNA through the HEAT repeat–containing subunits has been proposed to serve as the first step in condensin loading (19Piazza I. Rutkowska A. Ori A. Walczak M. Metz J. Pelechano V. Beck M. Haering C.H. Association of condensin with chromosomes depends on DNA binding by its HEAT-repeat subunits.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 (24837193): 560-56810.1038/nsmb.2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains of SA1 and SA2 share only 30–50% homology, which makes it likely that these domains contribute to their functional specificities. Recently, we discovered that SA1 binds to dsDNA and shows specificity for telomeric sequences (41Lin J. Countryman P. Chen H. Pan H. Fan Y. Jiang Y. Kaur P. Miao W. Gurgel G. You C. Piehler J. Kad N.M. Riehn R. Opresko P.L. Smith S. et al.Functional interplay between SA1 and TRF1 in telomeric DNA binding and DNA-DNA pairing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27298259): 6363-637610.1093/nar/gkw518Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These new results raise an important question as to whether or not SA2 specifically recognizes unique DNA sequences or structures. Here, to investigate the binding of SA2 to specific DNA sequences and structures, we applied fluorescence anisotropy and two complementary single-molecule imaging techniques, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence imaging of quantum dot (QD)-labeled proteins on DNA tightropes. In contrast to SA1 (41Lin J. Countryman P. Chen H. Pan H. Fan Y. Jiang Y. Kaur P. Miao W. Gurgel G. You C. Piehler J. Kad N.M. Riehn R. Opresko P.L. Smith S. et al.Functional interplay between SA1 and TRF1 in telomeric DNA binding and DNA-DNA pairing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27298259): 6363-637610.1093/nar/gkw518Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the 1D diffusion dynamics of SA2 on DNA is independent of telomeric or centromeric sequences. Fluorescence anisotropy shows that SA2 binds to both ssDNA and dsDNA, albeit with a higher binding affinity for ssDNA. In addition, SA2 recognizes DNA overhang, flap, and fork, which are intermediate DNA structures during DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Likewise, AFM imaging reveals that SA2 displays high binding specificities for the DNA end, ssDNA gap, flap, single-stranded fork, and replication fork. Strikingly, SA2 is capable of switching between two DNA-binding modes: searching through unbiased 1D diffusion on dsDNA and recognition through stable binding at the ssDNA gap. Furthermore, results from the DR-GFP reporter system show that SA2 directly facilitates homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA DSB repair. Importantly, these results strongly suggest a new role for SA2 in recognizing intermediate DNA structures during genome maintenance pathways. Studying the DNA-binding properties of SA1 and SA2 is essential for advancing our understanding of the function of the cohesin complex in diverse genome maintenance pathways. Recently, we discovered that SA1 binds to DNA through the AT-hook domain at its N-terminal domain (41Lin J. Countryman P. Chen H. Pan H. Fan Y. Jiang Y. Kaur P. Miao W. Gurgel G. You C. Piehler J. Kad N.M. Riehn R. Opresko P.L. Smith S. et al.Functional interplay between SA1 and TRF1 in telomeric DNA binding and DNA-DNA pairing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27298259): 6363-637610.1093/nar/gkw518Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SA2 lacks the AT-hook motif (36Bisht K.K. Daniloski Z. Smith S. SA1 binds directly to DNA through its unique AT-hook to promote sister chromatid cohesion at telomeres.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 (23729739): 3493-350310.1242/jcs.130872Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not SA2 is a DNA-binding protein, we purified His-tagged full-length SA2 (Fig. 1A and Methods). First, we evaluated the oligomeric state of SA2 using a previously established method that estimates the molecular mass of a protein based on the calibration curve correlating AFM volume and molecular weight of proteins (42Yang Y. Wang H. Erie D.A. Quantitative characterization of biomolecular assemblies and interactions using atomic force microscopy.Methods. 2003; 29 (12606223): 175-18710.1016/S1046-2023(02)00308-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 43Fuentes-Perez M.E.

Lin J. Countryman P. Bradford K.C. Erie D.A. Riehn R. Opresko P.L. Wang H. Enhanced electrostatic force microscopy reveals higher-order DNA looping mediated by the telomeric protein TRF2.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (26856421): 2051310.1038/srep20513Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on this method, SA2 molecules (141 kDa) display AFM volumes (146 nm3) consistent with being predominantly monomers (Fig. S1A). This result is consistent with our earlier analysis of SA2 molecular weight using gel filtration chromatography (45Zhang N. Jiang Y. Mao Q. Demeler B. Tao Y.J. Pati D. Characterization of the interaction between the cohesin subunits Rad21 and SA1/2.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (23874961): e6945810.1371/journal.pone.0069458Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To evaluate SA2-DNA binding specificity, we applied AFM imaging of SA2 in the presence of linear DNA fragments containing either centromeric or telomeric sequences (Fig. 1A and Methods). Ensemble-based biochemical assays, such as fluorescence anisotropy and EMSAs, only provide average binding affinities for DNA substrates. These assays cannot differentiate sequence-specific DNA binding from DNA end binding. In contrast, from AFM images of protein-DNA complexes, a direct measurement of the DNA-binding specificity for unique sequences as well as that for DNA structures such as ends can be obtained through statistical analysis of binding positions of protein complexes on individual DNA fragments (46Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Determination of protein-DNA binding constants and specificities from statistical analyses of single molecules: MutS-DNA interactions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (16061937): 4322-433410.1093/nar/gki708Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two centromeric DNA substrates (4.1 kb) used for AFM imaging contain the α-satellite centromeric sequences that are either close to one end of the linearized DNA (Cen-end DNA) or near the middle (Cen-mid DNA) (Fig. 1A). For the telomeric DNA substrate (T270 DNA), the (TTAGGG)270 sequences make up ∼30% of the total DNA length (5.4 kb) and are located at the middle of the linearized T270 DNA (Fig. 1A). SA2 molecules displayed AFM heights (1.41 ± 0.30 nm, mean ± S.D., Fig. 1 (B and C) and supplemental Fig. S1B) that were significantly taller than that of dsDNA alone (0.70 ± 0.08 nm, mean ± S.D.). This large difference in heights enabled unambiguous identification of SA2 molecules on DNA. Statistical analysis of the binding position of SA2 on DNA revealed that SA2 did not bind specifically to either the centromeric or telomeric sequences (Fig. 1D). However, on all three DNA substrates, the majority of SA2 molecules were bound at the DNA ends. Furthermore, DNA end binding by SA2 was independent of the internal DNA sequence, the position of the centromeric region, or the presence of single-stranded overhangs at the terminal ends (4-nt 3′-overhang on Cen-end DNA; Fig. 1D). To further quantify the SA2-binding specificity for DNA ends, we applied the analysis based on the fractional occupancies of SA2 at DNA ends (46Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Determination of protein-DNA binding constants and specificities from statistical analyses of single molecules: MutS-DNA interactions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (16061937): 4322-433410.1093/nar/gki708Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SA2-binding specificities for DNA ends (S = DNA binding constant for specific sites/DNA binding constant for nonspecific sites = KSP/KNSP) are 2945 ± 77, 2604 ± 68, and 2129 ± 76, respectively, for T270, Cen-end, and Cen-mid DNA substrates. In addition, in contrast to SA2 alone, DNA-bound SA2 formed higher-order oligomeric complexes with average AFM volumes of 1025 ± 88 and 898 ± 63 nm3, respectively, at DNA ends and internal sites (Fig. S1C). Based on the calibration curve relating protein molecular weights and AFM volumes (44Kaur P. Wu D. Lin J. Countryman P. Bradford K.C. Erie D.A. Riehn R. Opresko P.L. Wang H. Enhanced electrostatic force microscopy reveals higher-order DNA looping mediated by the telomeric protein TRF2.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (26856421): 2051310.1038/srep20513Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these AFM volumes correspond to approximately five and four SA2 molecules, respectively, at the DNA ends and internal sites. In summary, SA2 does not specifically bind to centromeric sequences, but binds DNA ends with high specificities that are independent of DNA sequences and short (4-nt) single-stranded overhangs. Previously, it was established that cohesin deposition and establishment occur in concert with lagging strand-processing (47Rudra S. Skibbens R.V. Sister chromatid cohesion establishment occurs in concert with lagging strand synthesis.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11 (22592531): 2114-212110.4161/cc.20547Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ssDNA gaps are intermediate structures on lagging strand during DNA replication. To directly test whether or not SA2 binds to ssDNA gaps, we used a previously established method to generate a linear substrate containing an ssDNA gap (37 nt) flanked by dsDNA arms (Fig. 2A). This method was based on the generation of four closely spaced nicks using DNA nickase and subsequent removal of short ssDNA between nicked sites using complementary oligonucleotides (48Geng H. Du C. Chen S. Salerno V. Manfredi C. Hsieh P. In vitro studies of DNA mismatch repair proteins.Anal.

After restriction digestion of the circular gapped DNA, the ssDNA gap is at 470 nt (23%) from one end of the DNA (blunt end; Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). Based on diagnostic restriction digestion at the gapped region, DNA gapping efficiencies were typically 85–95% (Fig. S2B). To further confirm the presence of the ssDNA gap, the position distribution of mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein on this DNA substrate was analyzed. Mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein predominantly bound to the expected ssDNA region on the gapped DNA substrate, whereas its binding on the nicked DNA substrate was random. 3P.

Major reductions in transmission require multiple different interventions, including both disease treatment and vector control.

However, insect-control interventions are becoming less effective; development, evaluation, and introduction of new interventions are slow; and there is limited understanding of just how important these interventions are.

https://openalex.org/W2768680787,"The aim of this study was to reevaluate the ecology of an area in the Atlantic Forest, southeast Brazil, where Chagas disease (CD) has been found to occur. In a previous study, immediately after the occurrence of a CD case, we did not observe any sylvatic small mammals or dogs with Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi infections, but Triatoma vitticeps presented high T. c. cruzi infection rates. In this study, we investigated bats together with non-volant mammals, dogs, and triatomines to explore other possible T. c. cruzi reservoirs/hosts in the area. Seventy-three non-volant mammals and 186 bats were captured at three sites within the Guarapari municipality, Espírito Santo state. Rio da Prata and Amarelos sites exhibited greater richness in terms of non-volant mammals and bats species, respectively. The marsupial Metachirus nudicaudatus, the rodent Trinomys paratus, and the bats Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata were the most frequently captured species. As determined by positive hemocultures, only two non-volant mammals were found to be infected by Trypanosoma species: Monodelphis americana, which was infected by T. cascavelli, T. dionisii and Trypanosoma sp., and Callithrix geoffroyi, which was infected by T. minasense. Bats presented T. c. cruzi TcI and TcIII/V, T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. rangeli B and D, and Trypanosoma sp. infections. Seven dogs were infected with T. cruzi based only on serological exams. The triatomines T. vitticeps and Panstrongylus geniculatus were found to be infected by trypanosomes via microscopy. According to molecular characterization, T. vitticeps specimens were infected with T. c. cruzi TcI, TcII, TcIII/V, and TcIV, T. c. marinkellei and T. dionisii. We observed high trypanosome diversity in a small and fragmented region of the Atlantic Forest. This diversity was primarily maintained by bats and T. vitticeps. Our findings show that the host specificity of the Trypanosoma genus should be thoroughly reviewed. In addition, our data show that CD cases can occur without an enzootic cycle near residential areas."
https://openalex.org/W2769057793,"Reprogramming of cellular identity using exogenous expression of transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful and exciting tool for tissue engineering, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. However, generation of desired cell types using this approach is often plagued by inefficiency, slow conversion, and an inability to produce mature functional cells. Here, we show that expression of constitutively active SMAD2/3 significantly improves the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation by the Yamanaka factors. Mechanistically, SMAD3 interacts with reprogramming factors and co-activators and co-occupies OCT4 target loci during reprogramming. Unexpectedly, active SMAD2/3 also markedly enhances three other TF-mediated direct reprogramming conversions, from B cells to macrophages, myoblasts to adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons, highlighting broad and general roles for SMAD2/3 as cell-reprogramming potentiators. Our results suggest that co-expression of active SMAD2/3 could enhance multiple types of TF-based cell identity conversion and therefore be a powerful tool for cellular engineering."

Results Our main findings were: (i) Plasma levels of IL-27 were significantly elevated in patients with carotid atherosclerotic disease compared to healthy controls. (ii) Gene expression of IL-27 and IL-27R was significantly elevated in plaques compared to control vessels, and co-localized to macrophages. (iii) In vitro, IL-27 increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in monocytes with enhanced release of IL-1 β. Conclusions We demonstrate increased levels of IL-27 and IL-27R in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our in vitro findings suggest an inflammatory role for IL-27, which can possibly be linked to atherosclerotic disease development."
https://openalex.org/W2768216846,"The immunogenicity of bacterial flagellin has been reported in different studies. By its close interaction with the immune system, the flagellin represents an interesting adjuvant and vaccine candidate. Salmonella Typhimurium flagellin has already been tested as adjuvant to stimulate mucosal immunity. Here, we assessed the ability of Clostridium difficile flagellin FliC to act as a mucosal adjuvant, first combined with ovalbumin as antigen and second with a C. difficile surface protein, the precursor of the S-layer proteins SlpA. Using ovalbumin as antigen, we compared the gut mucosal adjuvanticity of FliC to Salmonella Typhimurium flagellin and cholera toxin. Two routes of immunization were tested in a mouse model: intra-rectal and intra-peritoneal, following which, gut mucosal and systemic antibody responses against ovalbumin (Immunoglobulins G and Immunoglobulins A) were analyzed by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Assay in intestinal contents and in sera. In addition, ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin producing cells were detected in the intestinal lamina propria by Enzyme-Linked Immunospot. Results showed that FliC as adjuvant for immunization targeting ovalbumin was able to stimulate a gut mucosal and systemic antibody response independently of the immunization route. In order to develop a mucosal vaccine to prevent C. difficile intestinal colonization, we assessed in a mouse model the efficacy of FliC as adjuvant compared with cholera toxin co-administrated with the C. difficile S-layer precursor SlpA as antigen. After challenge, a significant decrease of C. difficile intestinal colonization was observed in immunized groups compared to the control group. Our results showed that C. difficile FliC could be used as adjuvant in mucosal vaccination strategy against C. difficile infections."

Contemporary controls and information on tobacco use and alcohol consumption are generally missing from previous studies. Objectives To evaluate lifetime cancer prevalence in a large cohort of MS patients relative to appropriate controls. Methods We conducted a case-control study, using a postal survey of a cohort of MS patients. Of the 1574 questionnaires sent, 1107 could be used for statistical analysis. Data from 1568 controls were prospectively collected using the same self-administered survey among consecutive out-patients in a single neurology department. Propensity scores matched on age, gender, and history of smoking and alcohol consumption were calculated. Results Among the MS patients, 7.32% had ever presented with a cancer, whereas 12,63% of the controls had, leading to a bootstrap matched odds ratio (OR) of 0.63; 95% CI 0.57–0.70. Although only exploratory, the use of DMT (immunomodulators or immunosupressants) did not appear to increase this risk (p = 0.42). The disease course also did not affect cancer prevalence. Conclusion MS was associated with a reduced overall cancer risk."

In orchids, prezygotic reproductive isolation has been considered to be strong, because their associations with highly specific pollinators. In this study, the reproductive ecology and reproductive isolation of two sympatric Habenaria species, H. davidii and H. fordii, was investigated by floral phenology and morphology, hand-pollination experiments and visitor observation in southwest China. The two species were dependent on insects for pollination and completely self-compatible. A number of factors have been identified to limit gene flow between the two species and achieved full reproductive isolation. Ecogeographic isolation was a weak barrier. H. fordii and H. davidii had completely overlapped flowering periods, and floral morphology plays an important role in floral isolation. The two species shared the same hawkmoth pollinator, Cechenena lineosa, but the pollinaria of the two orchids were attached on different body parts of pollinators. Prezygotic isolation was not complete, but the interspecific pollination treatments of each species resulted in no seed sets, indicating that unlike many other orchid species, in which the postzygotic reproductive isolation is very weak or complete absence, the post-zygotic isolation strongly acted in the stage of seed production between two species. The results illustrate the reproductive isolation between two species involves multiple plant life-history stages and a variety of reproductive barriers can contribute to overall isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2770747015,"Background Despite documented health benefits for mother and baby, physical activity (PA)-level tends to decline in pregnancy. Overweight/obese and physically inactive women are two selected groups at increased risk of pregnancy complications. Thus, efficient strategies to maintain or increase PA-level in pregnancy and the postpartum period, especially among these women, are warranted. This secondary analysis examined the effect of a prenatal lifestyle-intervention on PA-level in late pregnancy and the first year postpartum, with subanalysis on initially physically active versus inactive and normal-weight versus overweight/obese women. Method The Norwegian Fit for Delivery (NFFD) randomized controlled trial included healthy primiparous women with singleton pregnancies and body mass index (BMI) ≥19 kg/m2 assigned to an intervention group, n = 303 (twice weekly group-exercises and dietary counseling) or a control group, n = 303 (standard prenatal care). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short-form was used to assess PA-levels at inclusion (mean gestational week (GW) 16), GW 36, and six and 12 months postpartum. Results At GW 36, a positive intervention-effect with a significant between-group difference in total PA-level compared to time of inclusion was found for the total group (530 MET-min/week, p = 0.001) and the subgroups of normal-weight (533 MET-min/week, p = 0.003) and initially active women (717 MET-min/week, p<0.001). Intervention-effect was dependent on exercise-adherence among overweight/obese and inactive women. Compared to time of inclusion, the intervention groups maintained total PA-level at GW 36, while total PA-level decreased in the control groups. The PA-levels increased postpartum, but with no significant differences between the randomization groups. Conclusion The NFFD prenatal combined lifestyle intervention had a significant effect on TPA-level in late pregnancy among women entering pregnancy normal-weight or physically active, thereby preventing the downward trend typically seen during pregnancy. Intervention-effect among overweight/obese and physically inactive women was, however, dependent on exercise-adherence. Long-term intervention-effect was not observed in the postpartum period."
https://openalex.org/W2768491172,"Leaves act as a primary organ for the interception of solar radiation and their spatial arrangement determines how the plant canopy interacts with light. Many studies have been carried out on the penetration of radiation into crops however to date, few results are available on turfgrasses, mainly due to the difficulties of introducing sensors into the turf without disturbing the natural position of the leaves. In the present research two warm season turfgrasses, hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon × transvaalensis) 'Patriot' and manilagrass (Zoysia matrella) 'Zeon', were studied. The aim was to describe their canopy architecture grown with minimal disturbance to the natural arrangement of the leaves and stems, and to determine the potential effects of canopy architecture on light penetration and reflectance. Radiometric measurements were carried out at eight different profile levels of turfgrasses that were up to 12 cm tall. A LI-COR 1800 spectroradiometer with an optical fiber cable and a 7 mm diameter sensor was used. Measurements were carried out in the 390–1100 nm region at 5 nm intervals. The LAI value was higher for the manilagrass (9.0) than for the hybrid bermudagrass (5.6). The transmitted radiation was found to be closely dependent on downward cumulative LAI. Despite a more upright habit (mean insertion angle of 22.4° ±3.4), Zoysia matrella showed a higher NIR reflectance compared to Cdxt, which has a horizontal leaf arrangement (mean insertion angle 62.1° ± 9.6). The species studied showed substantial differences both in terms of phytometric characteristics and in the capacity to attenuate solar radiation."

Not much is known about nursing behavior associated with tailoring HR alarm parameters to individual patients to reduce clinical alarm fatigue.To understand the relationship between heart rate (HR) alarms and adjustments to reduce unnecessary heart rate alarms.Retrospective, quantitative analysis of an adjudicated database using analytical approaches to understand behaviors surrounding parameter HR alarm adjustments. Patients were sampled from five adult ICUs (77 beds) over one month at a quaternary care university medical center. A total of 337 of 461 ICU patients had HR alarms with 53.7% male, mean age 60.3 years, and 39% non-Caucasian. Default HR alarm parameters were 50 and 130 beats per minute (bpm). The occurrence of each alarm, vital signs, and physiologic waveforms was stored in a relational database (SQL server).There were 23,624 HR alarms for analysis, with 65.4% exceeding the upper heart rate limit. Only 51% of patients with HR alarms had parameters adjusted, with a median upper limit change of +5 bpm and -1 bpm lower limit. The median time to first HR parameter adjustment was 17.9 hours, without reduction in alarms occurrence (p = 0.57).HR alarms are prevalent in ICU, and half of HR alarm settings remain at default. There is a long delay between HR alarms and parameters changes, with insufficient changes to decrease HR alarms. Increasing frequency of HR alarms shortens the time to first adjustment. Best practice guidelines for HR alarm limits are needed to reduce alarm fatigue and improve monitoring precision."

Therefore the relative motion at the sacroiliac joint was quantified in a two-leg alternating load biomechanical pelvis model in the intact, the injured and the restored pelvis.Fresh-frozen intact (I) pelvises (n = 6) were subjected to a non-destructive cyclic test under sinosuidal axial two-leg alternating load with progressively increasing amplitude. Afterwards an open book injury (J) including the anterior ligament complex of the left sacroiliac joint, the sacrospinal and sacrotuberal ligaments (Tile B1.1) was created and the specimens were retested. Finally, the symphysis was stabilized with a modular fixation system (1-, 2- or 4-rod configuration) (R) and specimens were cyclically retested. Relative motion at the sacroiliac joint was captured at both sacroiliac joints by motion tracking system at two load levels of 170 N and 340 N during all tests.Relative sacroiliac joint movements at both load levels were significantly higher in the J-state compared to the I-state, excluding superoinferior translational movement. With exception of the anteroposterior translational movement at 340N, the relative sacroiliac joint movements after each of the three reconstructions (1-, 2-, 4-rod fixation) were significantly smaller compared to the J-state and did not differ significantly to the I-state, but stayed above the values of the latter. Relative movements did not differ significantly in a direct comparison between the 1-rod, 2-rod and 4-rod fixations.Symphyseal locked plating significantly reduces relative movement of the sacroiliac joint in open book injuries type Tile B1.1 or B1.2 (APC II) but cannot fully restore the situation of the intact sacroiliac joint."
https://openalex.org/W2768841513,"Detailed imaging of biological structures, often smaller than the diffraction limit, is possible in fluorescence microscopy due to the molecular size and photophysical properties of fluorescent probes. Advances in hardware and multiple providers of high-end bioimaging makes comparing images between studies and between research groups very difficult. Therefore, we suggest a model system to benchmark instrumentation, methods and staining procedures. The system we introduce is based on doped zeolites in stained polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films: a highly accessible model system which has the properties needed to act as a benchmark in bioimaging experiments. Rather than comparing molecular probes and imaging methods in complicated biological systems, we demonstrate that the model system can emulate this complexity and can be used to probe the effect of concentration, brightness, and cross-talk of fluorophores on the detected fluorescence signal. The described model system comprises of lanthanide (III) ion doped Linde Type A zeolites dispersed in a PVA film stained with fluorophores. We tested: F18, MitoTracker Red and ATTO647N. This model system allowed comparing performance of the fluorophores in experimental conditions. Importantly, we here report considerable cross-talk of the dyes when exchanging excitation and emission settings. Additionally, bleaching was quantified. The proposed model makes it possible to test and benchmark staining procedures before these dyes are applied to more complex biological systems."

Results indicate that it was possible to conduct the expressive writing intervention both covertly and openly, but that participants in the hidden administration condition did not fully benefit from the otherwise effective expressive writing intervention in the long-run. Effect sizes between open and hidden administration groups were comparable to pre-post effect sizes of the intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2769662552,"Thirty years ago, Len Mandel, together with his students Jeff Ou and C. K. Hong, published a description of a remarkably simple experiment ( 1 ), the consequences of which have had dramatic implications for quantum science and technology. The experiment consisted of sending two elementary particles of light, photons, onto opposite sides of a piece of glass that had been coated with a thin film to give it a reflectivity of 50% (see the figure). They observed that the two photons always left by the same side at the output, though it was not possible to determine beforehand which side that would be. This is completely surprising if one considers the behavior of particles as indivisible, identical entities obeying the laws of classical physics. It is easy to see that in such a circumstance, one might expect there to be four equally likely output configurations, only two of which consist of the particles occupying the same outputs. The phenomenon is a beautiful manifestation of the interference of a quantum field; in this case, the bosonic field associated with photons. The effect would be entirely the opposite with fermionic fields associated with electrons—both particles would always leave by different sides."

The pain intensity in the shoulder and mechanical and psychosocial work factors were measured by self-reports at baseline and prospectively after 6 months. The associations between exposures and shoulder pain were analyzed with multilevel mixed-effects linear regressions.For the total study population working with the dominant arm at inclinations > 30° and >120° was associated with lower levels of shoulder pain both cross-sectionally and after 6 months. Associations were attenuated when adjusting for individual and social factors, psychological state, and exposure during leisure time, especially for the high inclination levels. Analyses, only including subjects with no pain at baseline revealed no significant associations. While stratified analysis showed negative associations in the construction worker group, there were no significant association in health care workers. Compared to the number of hypotheses tested, the number of significant findings was low. Adjustment by Bonferroni-correction made almost all findings insignificant.All analyses reflected a negative association between arm inclination and shoulder pain, but few analyses showed these associations to be statistically significant. If there is a relationship between arm inclination and shoulder pain, these findings could indicate that pain-avoidance may modify how workers perform their tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2770251186,"Objective M10 is a ten amino acid peptide generated from the intracellular cytoplasmic tail of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-Met following cleavage by caspase-3. Recently we reported that M10 interacts with Smad2 and demonstrates antifibrotic properties in vitro and in vivo and can be advanced into a novel antifibrotic remedy. The current study was undertaken to develop an immunoassay to measure M10 concentration in biological specimens. Experimental design An Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for detection of M10 in biological fluids was developed using pharmaceutical grade synthetic M10 as a calibrator and commercially available anti-c-Met C12 antibody. Results M10 ELISA specifically detected in plasma M10, but not a scrambled peptide, following a single intraperitoneal administration of M10 (1mg/kg) to mice. The detection limit was 9.6 ng/ml, and the measuring limit was between 15 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml. The recovery limits of M10 were between 80% and 120%; intra-assay coefficient of variation was between 5.3% and 6.3%; inter-assay coefficient of variation was between 5.0% and 8.0% over the buffer concentration tested in the range from 15 ng /ml to 250 ng /ml. The peak of M10 concentration following a single intraperitoneal injection (1mg/kg) was achieved within 6 hours and declined to minimal levels by 48 hours. The experimentally obtained half-life for M10 was comparable to the theoretically predicted half-life for M10. Conclusions We have established a highly sensitive ELISA to detect the antifibrotic peptide M10 in plasma samples, which should prove to be a novel tool to study the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of M10 in the treatment of fibroproliferative disorders."

Thus, we used CFSE-stained trypomastigotes to measure neutrophil-T. cruzi interaction, neutrophil activation, cytokine expression and death, after infection with Col1.7G2 and Y strain. Our results show that the frequency of CFSE+ neutrophils, indicative of interaction, and CFSE intensity on a cell-per-cell basis were similar when comparing Col1.7G2 and Y strains. Interaction with T. cruzi increased neutrophil activation, as measured by CD282, CD284, TNF and IL-12 expression, although at different levels between the two strains. No change in IL-10 expression was observed after interaction of neutrophils with either strain. We observed that exposure to Y and Col1.7G2 caused marked neutrophil death. This was specific to neutrophils, since interaction of either strain with monocytes did not cause death. Our further analysis showed that neutrophil death was a result of apoptosis, which was associated with an upregulation of TNF-receptor, TNF and FasLigand, but not of Fas. Induction of TNF-associated neutrophil apoptosis by the different T. cruzi isolates may act as an effective common mechanism to decrease the host’s immune response and favor parasite survival."

But I was interested in developing my mentoring skills, and my adviser encouraged me to give it a try. The student required hand-holding and close monitoring, and it quickly became evident that the collaboration wasn't working. After similar false starts with a few more students, I ended up being reluctant to work with undergraduate researchers at all—until a new student helped me realize what is required to mentor undergraduates, and the rewards it can bring.

> “It has been a joy to watch Karina mature as an able scientist.” 

I met Karina when she was a sophomore, and I ended up working with her until she defended her senior thesis. She was smart and eager to learn, asking all the right questions, and I felt she might finally be the right fit. Moreover, the timing was right. My experiences with previous undergraduates had prepared me to set appropriate expectations and gradually build on them. As a third-year student, I was also ready to delegate and give her room to grow. Here are the lessons that working with Karina taught me.

SHOW THE BIG PICTURE. Most undergraduates are completely new to research, so it is crucial to explain the broader context for the work and justify its importance. This will provide an overall goal, which will help get students interested and keep them focused as they learn the ropes. In my first meeting with Karina, I talked through a highly simplified slide deck about the project, explaining its goals and getting her excited about working on it. Describing my research in this simplified manner also helped me develop my own communication and storytelling skills. During my job interview at my current company, I used a similar approach.

INTRODUCE THE LITERATURE. Keeping up with the scientific literature is crucial for any researcher. But undergraduate students may not know this. Even if they do, they may feel overwhelmed by the volume and technical language. To help Karina start building her literature knowledge and confidence, I sent her relevant papers and followed up with discussions. These conversations also helped me deepen my understanding of my research and think about it in new ways.

OFFER OWNERSHIP. Once they feel ready, having students own and drive a small part of a research project creates accountability. When the time was right, I split my project into two distinct components and gave one to Karina. She made some mistakes, as we all do, and at times I felt the research would progress more efficiently if I just did it myself. But because I gave her room to explore and make mistakes, Karina ultimately became more independent and moved her project faster than she would have if I had continued holding her hand.

GIVE THEM THE STAGE. Encourage students to speak independently about their work, for example at group meetings and conferences, and urge them to apply for fellowships. In our lab's monthly group meetings, Karina always presented the progress we had made together. She practiced her presentation skills and ability to answer questions, and in return I got a chance to see our work from a fresh perspective and to identify areas that needed more attention.

Working with Karina also brought valuable personal rewards. She offered crucial companionship during my doctoral project, which could often feel like a solitary endeavor. When I experienced setbacks, Karina's small successes and her excitement about them helped keep me motivated. It has been a joy to watch Karina mature as an able scientist. In the end, helping her along the way is as important an accomplishment for me as finishing my own degree.

https://openalex.org/W2768984123,"Last month, astronomers wowed the world when they announced that they had seen two neutron stars merge, apparently creating heavy elements such as gold and platinum and spewing them into space. Nuclear physicists at Michigan State University in East Lansing also cheered the find, as they are building an atom smasher, the $730 million Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), that could decipher exactly how those elements were forged in the inferno. The elements presumably emerge from the so-called rapid neutron process, or r-process, in which a nucleus gains weight by gobbling up one neutron after another. At the same time, a nucleus can change its chemical identity through radioactive β decay, which turns neutrons into protons and bumps the nucleus up the periodic table of elements. Exactly how a nucleus evolves depends on the speed of the decay and the probability that it will soak up another neutron. Those parameters are poorly known. FRIB aims to change that by making as many of the neutron-laden nuclei as possible and measuring their masses and lifetimes. First proposed in 1999, the project didn9t get the greenlight for construction from the Department of Energy until 2014. Now, however, the project is ahead of schedule and on budget, and it should be up and running by 2021—if federal budget politics do not slow it down."
