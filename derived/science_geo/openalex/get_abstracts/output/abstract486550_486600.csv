https://openalex.org/W2051173965,"Clearance of Chronic Virus The family of mRNA-editing enzymes, APOBEC, restricts hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Lucifora et al. (p. 1221 , published online 20 February; see the Perspective by Shlomai and Rice ) provide evidence that specific APOBECs mediate the anti-HBV effects of host cytokines, which in turn apparently induce nuclear deaminase activity without damaging host cells. Thus, there may be potential in these findings for developing a therapeutic route to curing chronic HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2028971253,"Laboratory infection experiments and field data show that emerging infectious diseases of honeybees are widespread infectious agents within the pollinator assemblage; the prevalence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the parasite Nosema ceranae in honeybees and bumblebees is linked, and sympatric bumblebees and honeybees are infected by the same DWV strains, indicating ongoing disease transmission. Efficient pollination is vital for both crop production and ecosystem sustainability, and there is evidence to suggest that emerging infectious diseases are contributing to a decline in populations of some important insect pollinators. This study combines laboratory infection experiments and field studies to demonstrate infectivity of two serious honeybee (Apis mellifera) pathogens in a wild pollinator, the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris). Data from across the United Kingdom show that there is co-localization of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae in the two types of pollinator, and that the honeybee disease can be infectious in bumblebees. This work indicates that wild pollinator populations may be at risk, and unlike managed populations of Apis, they are not protected by intervention from beekeepers. Such a loss of wild pollinators would significantly decrease crop pollination efficiency. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a risk to human welfare, both directly1 and indirectly, by affecting managed livestock and wildlife that provide valuable resources and ecosystem services, such as the pollination of crops2. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), the prevailing managed insect crop pollinator, suffer from a range of emerging and exotic high-impact pathogens3,4, and population maintenance requires active management by beekeepers to control them. Wild pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline5,6, one cause of which may be pathogen spillover from managed pollinators like honeybees7,8 or commercial colonies of bumblebees9. Here we use a combination of infection experiments and landscape-scale field data to show that honeybee EIDs are indeed widespread infectious agents within the pollinator assemblage. The prevalence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the exotic parasite Nosema ceranae in honeybees and bumblebees is linked; as honeybees have higher DWV prevalence, and sympatric bumblebees and honeybees are infected by the same DWV strains, Apis is the likely source of at least one major EID in wild pollinators. Lessons learned from vertebrates10,11 highlight the need for increased pathogen control in managed bee species to maintain wild pollinators, as declines in native pollinators may be caused by interspecies pathogen transmission originating from managed pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W1976979641,"Members of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcriptional regulators are central mediators of the cellular inflammatory response. Although constitutive NF-κB signalling is present in most human tumours, mutations in pathway members are rare, complicating efforts to understand and block aberrant NF-κB activity in cancer. Here we show that more than two-thirds of supratentorial ependymomas contain oncogenic fusions between RELA, the principal effector of canonical NF-κB signalling, and an uncharacterized gene, C11orf95. In each case, C11orf95-RELA fusions resulted from chromothripsis involving chromosome 11q13.1. C11orf95-RELA fusion proteins translocated spontaneously to the nucleus to activate NF-κB target genes, and rapidly transformed neural stem cells--the cell of origin of ependymoma--to form these tumours in mice. Our data identify a highly recurrent genetic alteration of RELA in human cancer, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion protein as a potential therapeutic target in supratentorial ependymoma."
https://openalex.org/W2048588387,"Life and Cell Death Trying to protect animals from one form of cell death may lead to death by another. Two protein kinases, known as RIPK1 and RIPK3 promote signaling that leads to cell death by necroptosis. However, Newton et al. (p. 1357 , published online 20 February; see the Perspective by Zhang and Chan ) found that inhibition of RIPK3 was not always beneficial. Instead, mice expressing a form of RIPK3 with no catalytic activity died from increased apoptotic cell death, but animals lacking the RIPK3 protein entirely, did not die perhaps because RIPK3 restrains apoptosis mediated by caspase-8 by an independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2113432767,"Ependymomas are common childhood brain tumours that occur throughout the nervous system, but are most common in the paediatric hindbrain. Current standard therapy comprises surgery and radiation, but not cytotoxic chemotherapy as it does not further increase survival. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 47 hindbrain ependymomas reveals an extremely low mutation rate, and zero significant recurrent somatic single nucleotide variants. Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. Transcriptional silencing driven by CpG methylation converges exclusively on targets of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 which represses expression of differentiation genes through trimethylation of H3K27. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that epigenetic modifiers are the first rational therapeutic candidates for this deadly malignancy, which is epigenetically deregulated but genetically bland. Although genetically bland, the posterior fossa group A subgroup of ependymomas, found often in infants and associated with poor prognosis, exhibit widespread epigenetic alterations, namely a CpG island methylator phenotype; these tumours are shown to be susceptible both in vitro and in vivo to various compounds that target epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and H3K27 tri-methylation. In this issue of Nature two groups present independent genomic analyses on ependymomas, a type of tumour that occurs throughout the nervous system, but most commonly in the hindbrain in children. Mack et al. found a low overall mutation rate and no significant recurrent mutations in 47 hindbrain ependymomas. But posterior fossa group B tumours, a subgroup found predominantly in infants and associated with poor prognosis, were distinguished by a CpG island methylator phenotype. This subgroup is shown to be susceptible to various compounds that target epigenetic modifications, including an EZH2 inhibitor that showed efficacy in a mouse xenograft model. Parker et al. found the C11orf95–RELA fusion gene in about 70% of supratentorial tumours, but not in other ependymoma subgroups. The gene fusions arise through chromothripsis and lead to the expression of a fusion protein that constitutively activates NF-κB signalling. In a mouse model, expression of C11orf95–RELA in neural stem cells leads to the formation of brain tumours. These findings identify NF-κB signalling as a possible therapeutic target in patients with this type of ependymoma."
https://openalex.org/W2088565779,"Tumour metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in cancer patients and remains the key challenge for cancer therapy. New therapeutic approaches to block inhibitory pathways of the immune system have renewed hopes for the utility of such therapies. Here we show that genetic deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b (casitas B-lineage lymphoma-b) or targeted inactivation of its E3 ligase activity licenses natural killer (NK) cells to spontaneously reject metastatic tumours. The TAM tyrosine kinase receptors Tyro3, Axl and Mer (also known as Mertk) were identified as ubiquitylation substrates for Cbl-b. Treatment of wild-type NK cells with a newly developed small molecule TAM kinase inhibitor conferred therapeutic potential, efficiently enhancing anti-metastatic NK cell activity in vivo. Oral or intraperitoneal administration using this TAM inhibitor markedly reduced murine mammary cancer and melanoma metastases dependent on NK cells. We further report that the anticoagulant warfarin exerts anti-metastatic activity in mice via Cbl-b/TAM receptors in NK cells, providing a molecular explanation for a 50-year-old puzzle in cancer biology. This novel TAM/Cbl-b inhibitory pathway shows that it might be possible to develop a 'pill' that awakens the innate immune system to kill cancer metastases."

https://openalex.org/W1968768605,"The quest for the value of the electron's atomic mass has been subject of continuing efforts over the last decades. Among the seemingly fundamental constants which parameterize the Standard Model (SM) of physics and which are thus responsible for its predictive power, the electron mass me plays a prominent role, as it is responsible for the structure and properties of atoms and molecules. This manifests in the close link with other fundamental constants, such as the Rydberg constant and the fine-structure constant {\alpha}. However, the low mass of the electron considerably complicates its precise determination. In this work we present a substantial improvement by combining a very accurate measurement of the magnetic moment of a single electron bound to a carbon nucleus with a state-of-the-art calculation in the framework of bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics. The achieved precision of the atomic mass of the electron surpasses the current CODATA value by a factor of 13. Accordingly, the result presented in this letter lays the foundation for future fundamental physics experiments and precision tests of the SM."
https://openalex.org/W2043080047,"The crystal structure of the core domain of the hepatitis C virus surface glycoprotein E2 has been solved; the structure shows that, contrary to expectation, E2 is unlikely to be the viral fusion protein. There is currently no vaccine against hepatitis C virus, so it is important to learn more about the processes by which the virus establishes infection. Joseph Marcotrigiano and colleagues solve the crystal structure of the core domain of the hepatitis C virus surface glycoprotein E2. The structure shows that, contrary to expectation, E2 is unlikely to be the viral fusion protein. This work helps to clarify the role of E2 and the mechanism of hepatitis C virus entry. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a significant public health concern with approximately 160 million people infected worldwide1. HCV infection often results in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. No vaccine is available and current therapies are effective against some, but not all, genotypes. HCV is an enveloped virus with two surface glycoproteins (E1 and E2). E2 binds to the host cell through interactions with scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and CD81, and serves as a target for neutralizing antibodies2,3,4. Little is known about the molecular mechanism that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion, although E2 is predicted to be a class II viral fusion protein. Here we describe the structure of the E2 core domain in complex with an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) at 2.4 Å resolution. The E2 core has a compact, globular domain structure, consisting mostly of β-strands and random coil with two small α-helices. The strands are arranged in two, perpendicular sheets (A and B), which are held together by an extensive hydrophobic core and disulphide bonds. Sheet A has an IgG-like fold that is commonly found in viral and cellular proteins, whereas sheet B represents a novel fold. Solution-based studies demonstrate that the full-length E2 ectodomain has a similar globular architecture and does not undergo significant conformational or oligomeric rearrangements on exposure to low pH. Thus, the IgG-like fold is the only feature that E2 shares with class II membrane fusion proteins. These results provide unprecedented insights into HCV entry and will assist in developing an HCV vaccine and new inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2081170853,"Asymmetry is required by most numerical simulations of stellar core-collapse explosions, but the form it takes differs significantly among models. The spatial distribution of radioactive 44Ti, synthesized in an exploding star near the boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and that ejected into the surrounding medium, directly probes the explosion asymmetries. CassiopeiaA is a young, nearby, core-collapse remnant from which 44Ti emission has previously been detected but not imaged. Asymmetries in the explosion have been indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44Ti emission to estimated 56Ni emission, from optical light echoes, and from jet-like features seen in the X-ray and optical ejecta. Here we report spatial maps and spectral properties of the 44Ti in Cassiopeia A. This may explain the unexpected lack of correlation between the 44Ti and iron X-ray emission, the latter being visible only in shock-heated material. The observed spatial distribution rules out symmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well as highly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor. Instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development of low-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae."
https://openalex.org/W2006305979,"Mutations in the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, which encode proteins that are key participants in homologous recombination (HR) repair, occur in ∼20% of high grade serous ovarian cancers. Although only 20% of these tumors have mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, nearly 50% of these tumors have defects in HR. Notably, however, the underlying genetic defects that give rise to HR defects in the absence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that the recurrent somatic CDK12 mutations identified in ovarian cancers impair the catalytic activity of this kinase, which is involved in the transcription of a subset of genes, including BRCA1 and other DNA repair genes. Furthermore, we show that disabling CDK12 function in ovarian cancer cells reduces BRCA1 levels, disrupts HR repair, and sensitizes these cells to the cross-linking agents melphalan and cisplatin and to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor veliparib (ABT-888). Taken together, these findings suggest that many CDK12 mutations are an unrecognized cause of HR defects in ovarian cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1981102897,"Limited Stability Deep ocean circulation is thought to be stable during warm, interglacial periods. Galaasen et al. (p. 1129 , published online 20 February) constructed a highly resolved record of North Atlantic Deep Water production during the last interglacial period, around 128,000 to 116,000 years ago. The findings reveal large, centennial-scale reductions—in contrast to the prevailing paradigm. These changes occurred in an ocean warmer than that of today, but in a temperature regime similar to that expected because of global warming, raising the possibility that future ocean circulation, regional climate, and CO 2 sequestration pathways could be impacted."
https://openalex.org/W2051352934,"Fluid shear stresses are potent regulators of vascular homeostasis and powerful determinants of vascular disease progression. The glycocalyx is a layer of glycoaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins that lines the luminal surface of arteries. The glycocalyx interacts directly with hemodynamic forces from blood flow and, consequently, is a prime candidate for the mechanosensing of fluidic shear stresses. Here, we investigated the role of the glycocalyx component syndecan-1 (sdc-1) in controlling the shear stress-induced signaling and flow-mediated phenotypic modulation in endothelial cells. We found that knock-out of sdc-1 abolished several key early signaling events of endothelial cells in response to shear stress including the phosphorylation of Akt, the formation of a spatial gradient in paxillin phosphorylation, and the activation of RhoA. After exposure to atheroprotective flow, we found that sdc-1 knock-out endothelial cells had a phenotypic shift to an inflammatory/pro-atherosclerotic phenotype in contrast to the atheroprotective phenotype of wild type cells. Consistent with these findings, we found increased leukocyte adhesion to sdc-1 knock-out endothelial cells in vitro that was reduced by re-expression of sdc-1. In vivo, we found increased leukocyte recruitment and vascular permeability/inflammation in sdc-1 knock-out mice. Taken together, our studies support a key role for sdc-1 in endothelial mechanosensing and regulation of endothelial phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2077183718,"We reported previously that apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is oxidatively modified in the artery wall at tyrosine 166 (Tyr166), serving as a preferred site for post-translational modification through nitration. Recent studies, however, question the extent and functional importance of apoA-I Tyr166 nitration based upon studies of HDL-like particles recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. We developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G11.2) that recognizes, in both free and HDL-bound forms, apoA-I harboring a 3-nitrotyrosine at position 166 apoA-I (NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I) to investigate the presence, distribution, and function of this modified apoA-I form in atherosclerotic and normal artery wall. We also developed recombinant apoA-I with site-specific 3-nitrotyrosine incorporation only at position 166 using an evolved orthogonal nitro-Tyr-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair for functional studies. Studies with mAb 4G11.2 showed that NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I was easily detected in atherosclerotic human coronary arteries and accounted for ∼8% of total apoA-I within the artery wall but was nearly undetectable (>100-fold less) in normal coronary arteries. Buoyant density ultracentrifugation analyses showed that NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I existed as a lipid-poor lipoprotein with <3% recovered within the HDL-like fraction (d = 1.063–1.21). NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I in plasma showed a similar distribution. Recovery of NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I using immobilized mAb 4G11.2 showed an apoA-I form with 88.1 ± 8.5% reduction in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity, a finding corroborated using a recombinant apoA-I specifically designed to include the unnatural amino acid exclusively at position 166. Thus, site-specific nitration of apoA-I at Tyr166 is an abundant modification within the artery wall that results in selective functional impairments. Plasma levels of this modified apoA-I form may provide insights into a pathophysiological process within the diseased artery wall.

Inflammation and oxidative stress are widely touted as playing a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease; however, studies aimed at understanding the functional consequences of modifications of proteins through these processes have proven difficult. One major reason for this is that exposure of a protein to an oxidative source resulting in PTM of the targeted amino acid typically also oxidizes many other susceptible amino acids, making conclusions of the functional impact of PTM of a specific residue difficult. To circumvent this problem, we and other investigators have used oxidative modification in combination with site-specific mutagenesis studies to provide data in support of the involvement of specific residues and types of PTMs with alterations in protein function (12.Wu Z.

In addition to apoA-I tyrosine 192, for which mutagenesis studies by our group failed to demonstrate changes in biological activity, tyrosine 166 of apoA-I was reported as being of particular interest because this site was also shown to be within a region we identified as a “solar flare,” a solvent-exposed region on nascent HDL that we predicted interacts with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (12.Wu Z.

The major site of nitration in plasma-derived apoA-I in HDL was also reported to be tyrosine 192, whereas tyrosine 18 was found to be a major site reported from lesion “HDL-like” particle-localized apoA-I (22.Shao B. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. Myeloperoxidase targets apolipoprotein A-I, the major high density lipoprotein protein, for site-specific oxidation in human atherosclerotic lesions.J. Biol.

In these latter studies where apoA-I was recovered from plasma or lesions by floating HDL, little nitration at tyrosine 166 was observed, and the involvement of this site in modification was suggested to have little biological relevance (22.Shao B. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. Myeloperoxidase targets apolipoprotein A-I, the major high density lipoprotein protein, for site-specific oxidation in human atherosclerotic lesions.J. Biol.

Thus, there exists a discrepancy of the importance of modification within apoA-I with regard to the abundance and functional significance of tyrosine 166 oxidative modification. The quantitative significance and functional consequences of apoA-I nitration at tyrosine 166 are of potential clinical and therapeutic importance. ApoA-I-targeted therapies such as direct delivery of the protein intravenously for promotion of atherosclerotic plaque regression is currently under investigation. A better understanding of the true sites of oxidative modification of apoA-I and their functional significance may thus be relevant to the generation of oxidation-resistant mutant forms of apoA-I with the potential to provide enhanced cardioprotective action compared with that observed with the native form (13.Peng D.-Q. Brubaker G. Wu Z. Zheng L. Willard B. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. Smith J.D. Apolipoprotein A-I tryptophan substitution leads to resistance to myeloperoxidase-mediated loss of function.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A better understanding would also be useful for development of potential diagnostic tools to monitor processes ongoing within the diseased artery wall or with which to potentially titrate response to therapies. Herein we show, through use of a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically recognizes apoA-I harboring a 3-nitrotyrosine at position 166 (NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I), that this modified form of apoA-I is abundant within the artery wall in a lipid-poor form rather than on an HDL particle. Furthermore, by generating recombinant apoA-I that selectively incorporates a lone 3-nitrotyrosine at 166 in apoA-I, we show that this PTM rendered apoA-I severely impaired in stimulating LCAT activity as a nascent HDL particle but had no effect on cholesterol efflux activity. Given the abundance of NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I observed within arterial tissues, detection of NO2-Tyr166-apoA-I within the circulation may thus serve as a means to monitor a pathophysiologically relevant process occurring in the artery wall during atherosclerosis. Moreover, the present studies showed that methods used to examine apoA-I within the artery wall are important for gauging the quantity and functional significance of modified apoA-I forms in vivo.

The goal of this study was to monitor the dynamics of endophytic colonization of opium poppy by B. bassiana after the fungus was applied to the seed and to ascertain whether the fungus is transmitted vertically via seeds. Using a species-specific nested PCR protocol and DNA extracted from surface-sterilised leaf pieces or seeds of B. bassiana-inoculated opium poppy plants, the fungus was detected within the plant beginning at the growth stage of rosette building and them throughout the entire plant growth cycle (about 120–140 days after sowing). The fungus was also detected in seeds from 50% of the capsules sampled. Seeds that showed positive amplification for B. bassiana were planted in sterile soil and the endophyte was again detected in more than 42% of the plants sampled during all plant growth stages. Beauveria bassiana was transmitted to seeds in 25% of the plants from the second generation that formed a mature capsule. These results demonstrate for the first time the vertical transmission of an entomopathogenic fungus from endophytically colonised maternal plants. This information is crucial to better understand the ecological role of entomopathogenic fungi as plant endophytes and may allow development of a sustainable and cost effective strategy for I. luteipes management in P. somniferum."
https://openalex.org/W2002892844,"The AMPK-Sirt1 pathway is an important regulator of energy metabolism and therefore a potential target for prevention and therapy of metabolic diseases. We recently demonstrated leucine and its metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) to synergize with low-dose resveratrol (200 nM) to activate sirtuin signaling and stimulate energy metabolism. Here we show that leucine exerts a direct effect on Sirt1 kinetics, reducing its Km for NAD(+) by >50% and enabling low doses of resveratrol to further activate the enzyme (p = 0.012). To test which structure elements of resveratrol are necessary for synergy, we assessed potential synergy of structurally similar and dissimilar polyphenols as well as other compounds converging on the same pathways with leucine using fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as screening tool. Dose-response curves for FAO were constructed and the highest non-effective dose (typically 1-10 nM) was used with either leucine (0.5 mM) or HMB (5 µM) to treat adipocytes and myotubes for 24 h. Significant synergy was detected for stilbenes with FAO increase in adipocytes by 60-70% (p<0.05) and in myotubes >2000% (p<0.01). Sirt1 and AMPK activities were stimulated by ∼65% (p<0.001) and ∼50% (p<0.03), respectively. Similarly, hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives (chlorogenic, cinnamic, and ferulic acids) combined with leucine/HMB increased FAO (300-1300%, p<0.01), AMPK activity (50-150%, p<0.01), and Sirt1 activity (∼70%, p<0.001). In contrast, more complex polyphenol structures, such as ellagic acid and epigallocatechin gallate required higher concentrations (>1 µM) and exhibited little or no synergy. Thus, the six-carbon ring structure bound to a carboxylic group seems to be a necessary element for leucine/HMB synergy with other stilbenes and hydroxycinnamic acids to stimulate AMPK/Sirt1 dependent FAO; these effects occur at concentrations that produce no independent effects and are readily achievable via oral administration."

https://openalex.org/W2039306526,"Protein secretion systems are crucial mediators of bacterial interactions with other organisms. Among them, the type VI secretion system (T6SS) is widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and appears to inject toxins into competitor bacteria and/or eukaryotic cells. Major human pathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, express T6SSs. Bacteria prevent self-intoxication by their own T6SS toxins by producing immunity proteins, which interact with the cognate toxins. We describe here an environmental P. fluorescens strain, MFE01, displaying an uncommon oversecretion of Hcp (hemolysin-coregulated protein) and VgrG (valine-glycine repeat protein G) into the culture medium. These proteins are characteristic components of a functional T6SS. The aim of this study was to attribute a role to this energy-consuming overexpression of the T6SS. The genome of MFE01 contains at least two hcp genes (hcp1 and hcp2), suggesting that there may be two putative T6SS clusters. Phenotypic studies have shown that MFE01 is avirulent against various eukaryotic cell models (amebas, plant or animal cell models), but has antibacterial activity against a wide range of competitor bacteria, including rhizobacteria and clinical bacteria. Depending on the prey cell, mutagenesis of the hcp2 gene in MFE01 abolishes or reduces this antibacterial killing activity. Moreover, the introduction of T6SS immunity proteins from S. marcescens, which is not killed by MFE01, protects E. coli against MFE01 killing. These findings suggest that the protein encoded by hcp2 is involved in the killing activity of MFE01 mediated by effectors of the T6SS targeting the peptidoglycan of Gram-negative bacteria. Our results indicate that MFE01 can protect potato tubers against Pectobacterium atrosepticum, which causes tuber soft rot. Pseudomonas fluorescens is often described as a major PGPR (plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium), and our results suggest that there may be a connection between the T6SS and the PGPR properties of this bacterium."

https://openalex.org/W1968264041,"Mitochondrial energy metabolism is essential for glucose-induced calcium signaling and, therefore, insulin granule exocytosis in pancreatic beta cells. Calcium signals are sensed by mitochondria acting in concert with mitochondrial substrates for the full activation of the organelle. Here we have studied glucose-induced calcium signaling and energy metabolism in INS-1E insulinoma cells and human islet beta cells. In insulin secreting cells a surprisingly large fraction of total respiration under resting conditions is ATP synthase-independent. We observe that ATP synthase-dependent respiration is markedly increased after glucose stimulation. Glucose also causes a very rapid elevation of oxidative metabolism as was followed by NAD(P)H autofluorescence. However, neither the rate of the glucose-induced increase nor the new steady-state NAD(P)H levels are significantly affected by calcium. Our findings challenge the current view, which has focused mainly on calcium-sensitive dehydrogenases as the target for the activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism. We propose a model of tight calcium-dependent regulation of oxidative metabolism and ATP synthase-dependent respiration in beta cell mitochondria. Coordinated activation of matrix dehydrogenases and respiratory chain activity by calcium allows the respiratory rate to change severalfold with only small or no alterations of the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+) ratio."

The simultaneous replacement of these residues in AcrB by those in AcrD (Q569R, I626R, and E673G) transferred the β-lactam specificity of AcrD to AcrB. Our findings indicate for the first time that the difference in β-lactam specificity between AcrB and AcrD relates to interactions of the antibiotic with residues in the proximal binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W2019221181,"Despite recent advances in understanding store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) regulation, the fundamental question of how ER morphology affects this process remains unanswered. Here we show that the loss of RTN4, is sufficient to alter ER morphology and severely compromise SOCE. Mechanistically, we show this to be the result of defective STIM1-Orai1 coupling because of loss of ER tubulation and redistribution of STIM1 to ER sheets. As a functional consequence, RTN4-depleted cells fail to sustain elevated cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels via SOCE and therefor are less susceptible to Ca(2+) overload induced apoptosis. Thus, for the first time, our results show a direct correlation between ER morphology and SOCE and highlight the importance of RTN4 in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2060605945,"The plant homeodomain finger 6 (PHF6) was originally identified as the gene mutated in the X-linked mental retardation disorder Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome. Mutations in the PHF6 gene have also been associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately half of the disease-associated mutations are distributed in the second conserved extended plant homeodomain (ePHD2) of PHF6, indicating the functional importance of the ePHD2 domain. Here, we report the high resolution crystal structure of the ePHD2 domain of PHF6, which contains an N-terminal pre-PHD (C2HC zinc finger), a long linker, and an atypical PHD finger. PHF6-ePHD2 appears to fold as a novel integrated structural module. Structural analysis of PHF6-ePHD2 reveals pathological implication of PHF6 gene mutations in Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. The binding experiments show that PHF6-ePHD2 can bind dsDNA but not histones. We also demonstrate PHF6 protein directly interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex component RBBP4. Via this interaction, PHF6 exerts its transcriptional repression activity. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that PHF6 may function as a transcriptional repressor using its ePHD domains binding to the promoter region of its repressed gene, and this process was regulated by the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex that was recruited to the genomic target site by NoLS region of PHF6."

The enzyme catalyzes the final step in the arginine dihydrolase pathway converting ADP and carbamoyl phosphate to ATP and carbamate. We previously reported that disulfiram, a drug used to treat chronic alcoholism, inhibits G. lamblia CK and kills G. lamblia trophozoites in vitro at submicromolar IC50 values. Here, we examine the structural basis for G. lamblia CK inhibition of disulfiram and its analog, thiram, their activities against both metronidazole-susceptible and metronidazole-resistant G. lamblia isolates, and their efficacy in a mouse model of giardiasis. The crystal structure of G. lamblia CK soaked with disulfiram revealed that the compound thiocarbamoylated Cys-242, a residue located at the edge of the active site. The modified Cys-242 prevents a conformational transition of a loop adjacent to the ADP/ATP binding site, which is required for the stacking of Tyr-245 side chain against the adenine moiety, an interaction seen in the structure of G. lamblia CK in complex with AMP-PNP. Mass spectrometry coupled with trypsin digestion confirmed the selective covalent thiocarbamoylation of Cys-242 in solution. The Giardia viability studies in the metronidazole-resistant strain and the G. lamblia CK irreversible inactivation mechanism show that the thiuram compounds can circumvent the resistance mechanism that renders metronidazole ineffectiveness in drug resistance cases of giardiasis. Together, the studies suggest that G. lamblia CK is an attractive drug target for development of novel antigiardial therapies and that disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug, is a promising candidate for drug repurposing.

https://openalex.org/W2006011498,"Neuronal loss is a prominent etiological factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The cerebellum is one of the areas in the developing central nervous system that is most sensitive to ethanol, especially during the temporal window of ethanol vulnerability. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs capable of regulating diverse cellular functions including apoptosis. Ethanol exposure has been shown to interfere with the expression of microRNAs. However, the role of microRNAs in ethanol neurotoxicity is still not clear. In the present study, we identified a particular microRNA, miR-29b, as a novel target of ethanol in the developing cerebellar granule neurons. We discovered that ethanol exposure suppressed miR-29b and induced neuronal apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-29b rendered neurons protection against ethanol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, our data indicated that miR-29b mediated ethanol neurotoxicity through the SP1/RAX/PKR cascade. More importantly, the expression of miR-29b is developmentally regulated, which may account for, at least partially, the temporal window of ethanol sensitivity in the developing cerebellum."

Np65 can translocate into synapses in response to electrical stimulation and it interacts with subtypes of GABAA receptors in inhibitory synapses. Here, we report that in the murine hippocampus and in hippocampal primary culture, neurons of the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus (DG) express high Np65 levels, whereas expression in CA3 neurons is lower. In neuroplastin-deficient (Np−/−) mice the number of excitatory synapses in CA1 and DG, but not CA3 regions is reduced. Notably this picture is mirrored in mature Np−/− hippocampal cultures or in mature CA1 and DG wild-type (Np+/+) neurons treated with a function-blocking recombinant Np65-Fc extracellular fragment. Although the number of GABAergic synapses was unchanged in Np−/− neurons or in mature Np65-Fc-treated Np+/+ neurons, the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses was significantly lower in Np−/− cultures. Furthermore, GABAA receptor composition was altered at inhibitory synapses in Np−/− neurons as the α1 to α2 GABAA receptor subunit ratio was increased. Changes of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function in Np−/− neurons were confirmed evaluating the presynaptic release function and using patch clamp recording.

https://openalex.org/W1987835529,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a head and neck malignant tumor rare throughout most of the world but common in Southeast Asia, especially in Southern China. The phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) by MAP kinase-interacting kinases (Mnk) on Ser-209 promotes cellular proliferation, survival, malignant transformation and metastasis. However, whether the alterations of the expression of p-eIF4E and p-Mnk1 protein are associated with clinicopathologic/prognostic implication for NPC has not been reported. The purposes of the present study are to examine the expression of p-eIF4E and p-Mnk1 protein in NPC and non-cancerous nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues by immunohistochemistry and evaluate the association between the expression of p-eIF4E and p-Mnk1 protein and clinicopathological characteristics of NPC. The results showed that the positive percentage of p-Mnk1 and p-eIF4E proteins expression in NPC (83.5% and 75.4%, respectively) was significantly higher than that in non-cancerous nasopharyngeal epithelium (40.0% and 32.9%, respectively). The positive expression of p-eIF4E and p-Mnk1 in the NPC with cervical lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than those without lymph node metastasis. Additionally, p-eIF4E expression was more pronouncedly increased in metastatic NPC than the matched primary NPC. Increase of p-eIF4E and p-Mnk1 expression was significantly correlated inversely with overall survival. Spearman’s rank correlation test further showed that expression of p-Mnk1 was strongly positive correlated with expression of p-eIF4E in NPC. The expression of p-Mnk1 and p-eIF4E in NPC was proved to be the independent prognostic factors regardless of lymph node metastasis, clinical stages and combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, histological type, age and gender by multivariate analysis. Taken together, high expression of p-Mnk1 and p-eIF4E might be novel valuable biomarkers to predict poor prognosis of NPC and therapeutic targets for developing the valid treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2077838200,"Accumulating evidence suggests that growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is associated with the severity and prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of GDF-15 on the regulation of cardiac remodeling is still poorly understood. In this present study, we demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks norepinephrine (NE)-induced myocardial hypertrophy through a novel pathway involving inhibition of EGFR transactivation. Both in vivo and in vitro assay indicate that NE was able to stimulate the synthesis of GDF-15. The up-regulation of GDF-15 feedback inhibits NE-induced myocardial hypertrophy, including quantitation of [(3)H]leucine incorporation, protein/DNA ratio, cell surface area, and ANP mRNA level. Further research shows that GDF-15 could inhibit the phosphorylation of EGF receptor and downstream kinases (AKT and ERK1/2) induced by NE. Clinical research also shows that serum GDF-15 levels in hypertensive patients were significant higher than in healthy volunteers and were positively correlated with the thickness of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, interventricular septum, and left ventricular mass, as well as the serum level of norepinephrine. In conclusion, NE induces myocardial hypertrophy and up-regulates GDF-15, and this up-regulation of GDF-15 negatively regulates NE-induced myocardial hypertrophy by inhibiting EGF receptor transactivation following NE stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2090181874,"Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that are critical components of the glomerular filtration barrier, and their dysfunction leads to proteinuria and renal failure. Therefore, preserving podocyte function is therapeutically significant. In this study, we identified Neph1 signaling as a therapeutic target that upon inhibition prevented podocyte damage from a glomerular injury-inducing agent puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). To specifically inhibit Neph1 signaling, we used a protein transduction approach, where the cytoplasmic domain of Neph1 (Neph1CD) tagged with a protein transduction domain trans-activator of transcription was transduced in cultured podocytes prior to treatment with PAN. The PAN-induced Neph1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in Neph1CD-transduced cells; in addition, these cells were resistant to PAN-induced cytoskeletal damage. The biochemical analysis using subfractionation studies showed that unlike control cells Neph1 was retained in the lipid raft fractions in the transduced cells following treatment with PAN, indicating that transduction of Neph1CD in podocytes prevented PAN-induced mislocalization of Neph1. In accordance, the immunofluorescence analysis further suggested that Neph1CD-transduced cells had increased ability to retain endogenous Neph1 at the membrane in response to PAN-induced injury. Similar results were obtained when angiotensin was used as an injury-inducing agent. Consistent with these observations, maintaining high levels of Neph1 at the membrane using a podocyte cell line overexpressing chimeric Neph1 increased the ability of podocytes to resist PAN-induced injury and PAN-induced albumin leakage. Using a zebrafish in vivo PAN and adriamycin injury models, we further demonstrated the ability of transduced Neph1CD to preserve glomerular function. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that inhibiting Neph1 signaling is therapeutically significant in preventing podocyte damage from glomerular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2094366504,"Mutant p53 proteins (mutp53) often acquire oncogenic activities, conferring drug resistance and/or promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. Although it has been well established that such a gain of function is mainly achieved through interaction with transcriptional regulators, thereby modulating cancer-associated gene expression, how the mutp53 function is regulated remains elusive. Here we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) bound common mutp53 (e.g. R175H and R273H) and, subsequently, suppressed their oncogenic activities. ATF3 repressed mutp53-induced NFKB2 expression and sensitized R175H-expressing cancer cells to cisplatin and etoposide treatments. Moreover, ATF3 appeared to suppress R175H- and R273H-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion as a consequence of preventing the transcription factor p63 from inactivation by mutp53. Accordingly, ATF3 promoted the expression of the metastasis suppressor SHARP1 in mutp53-expressing cells. An ATF3 mutant devoid of the mutp53-binding domain failed to disrupt the mutp53-p63 binding and, thus, lost the activity to suppress mutp53-mediated migration, suggesting that ATF3 binds to mutp53 to suppress its oncogenic function. In line with these results, we found that down-regulation of ATF3 expression correlated with lymph node metastasis in TP53-mutated human lung cancer. We conclude that ATF3 can suppress mutp53 oncogenic function, thereby contributing to tumor suppression in TP53-mutated cancer."

Differentiation of stem cells into insulin-producing cells has been achieved using various protocols. However, both the efficiency of the method and potency of differentiated cells are insufficient. Oxygen tension, the partial pressure of oxygen, has been shown to regulate the embryonic development of several organs, including pancreatic β-cells. In this study, we tried to establish an effective method for the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into insulin-producing cells by culturing under high oxygen (O2) conditions. Treatment with a high O2 condition in the early stage of differentiation increased insulin-positive cells at the terminus of differentiation. We found that a high O2 condition repressed Notch-dependent gene Hes1 expression and increased Ngn3 expression at the stage of pancreatic progenitors. This effect was caused by inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α protein level. Moreover, a high O2 condition activated Wnt signaling. Optimal stage-specific treatment with a high O2 condition resulted in a significant increase in insulin production in both mouse embryonic stem cells and human iPSCs and yielded populations containing up to 10% C-peptide-positive cells in human iPSCs.

Embryonic mouse blood flow and oxygen correlate with early pancreatic differentiation.Dev. Biol. 2011; 349: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that HIF-1α protein is highly expressed in the embryonic pancreas early in development and that increasing concentrations of O2 in vitro represses HIF-1α expression and fosters the development of endocrine progenitors (22.Heinis M. Simon M.T. Ilc K. Mazure N.M. Pouysségur J. Scharfmann R. Duvillié B.

Suitable O2 concentrations should be tested for the differentiation efficiency of ESC and iPSC into pancreatic lineages. However, until now, there has been no report of such an effect on ESC and iPSC differentiation in vitro. Here we studied the effect of increasing concentrations of O2 on the differentiation efficiency of mESC and human iPSC (hiPSC) into pancreatic lineages. A high O2 condition (60% O2) in early stages of differentiation increased the percentage of Ngn3-expressing endocrine progenitors and insulin-positive cells in both mESC and hiPSC. This effect was mediated via the inhibition of HIF-1α expression and increase of Ngn3 gene expression. Moreover, a high O2 condition was found to induce the activation of Wnt signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that culturing ESC and iPSC in a high O2 condition improved differentiation efficiency into endocrine progenitors and insulin-producing cells compared with normoxic conditions. The mESC line ING112, containing an Ins1 promoter-driven GFP reporter transgene, was established by culturing blastocysts obtained from transgenic mice homozygous for the Ins1-GFP gene (3.Higuchi Y.

The hiPSC clone 23 (C23) was previously produced by Sendai virus vector expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC (25.Kaitsuka T. Noguchi H. Shiraki N. Kubo T. Wei F.Y. Hakim F. Kume S. Tomizawa K.

C23 cells were maintained on mitomycin C (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)-treated MEF feeders in DMEM/F-12 HAM (Sigma) supplemented with 100 μm NEAA, 2 mm l-Gln, 20% knock-out serum replacement (Invitrogen), 25 units/ml penicillin and 25 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μm β-ME, and 5 ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Prior to differentiation, mESCs were passaged using 0.25% trypsin and seeded at 35,000 cells/well on 4- or 24-well plates coated with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and 2.5 μg/well laminin (Roche Applied Science). After overnight culture, the cells were cultured in high glucose (4500 mg/liter) DMEM supplemented with 10 mg/liter insulin, 5.5 mg/liter transferrin, 6.7 μg/ml sodium selenite (insulin-transferrin-selenium-G supplement, Invitrogen), 2.5 mg/ml ALBUMAX II (Invitrogen), NEAA, l-Gln, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, β-ME, 10 ng/ml activin A (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 5 ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech) from day 1 to day 6. From day 7 to 10, the culture medium was changed to RPMI supplemented with NEAA, l-Gln, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, β-ME, B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 50 ng/ml FGF10 (Peprotech), 250 nm KAAD-cyclopamine (Calbiochem), and 1 μm retinoic acid (Sigma). At day 11, the medium was switched to low glucose (1000 mg/liter) DMEM supplemented with insulin-transferrin-selenium-G supplement, ALBUMAX II, NEAA, l-Gln, penicillin, streptomycin, β-ME, 10 mm nicotinamide (Sigma), and 10 nm glucagon-like peptide (Sigma), and the cells were cultured until day 17. hiPSCs were passaged as small clusters using 1 unit/ml dispase (Roche Applied Science) at a 1:5 split ratio weekly and plated on mitomycin C-treated MEF feeders of 4- or 24-well plates. After a 1-week culture, the cells were cultured in differentiation medium in the same way as mouse ESCs. Cells were cultured under high O2 concentration conditions (60% O2) for the indicated periods in a multigas incubator (APM-30DR, ASTEC, Fukuoka, Japan). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature (22–24 °C). Immunostaining was carried out with the standard protocol. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-GFP (1:1000; Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), goat anti-Sox17 (1:200; R&D Systems), rabbit anti-Pdx1 (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), goat anti-Ngn3 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), goat anti-Foxa2 (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-insulin (1:1000; Sigma), and rabbit anti-C-peptide (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Alexa488- or Alexa568-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (Roche Applied Science). Images were taken with an Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Quantification was carried out using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). After images of marker fluorescence and DAPI fluorescence were taken in defined areas of wells in the cell culture plate, each image was thresholded to exclude background noise. The area was quantified, and the percentage of marker-positive cells was calculated by dividing the DAPI-positive area (total cell number) into the marker-positive area (supplemental Fig. S1). Total RNA was isolated from cells using a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using a Superscript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed on an ABI Prism 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a SYBR Premix ExTaq GC (Takara, Shiga, Japan). The primer sequences for each primer set are shown in Table 1. mRNA expression data were normalized against actin expression in a corresponding sample.

Cells were washed with PBS, scraped, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). After sonication, the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were then mixed with a 5-fold amount of Laemmli sample buffer (0.38 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12% SDS, 30% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 4 min. Samples were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and then blocked for nonspecific binding in a 5% skim milk solution. Membranes were incubated with mouse anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:1000; R&D Systems) or mouse anti-β-actin (1:1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Then membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000; Dako, Carpinteria, CA). After washing, membranes were incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare), and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized by an ImageQuant400 (GE Healthcare). Microarray analysis was performed on total RNA samples using a TORAY 3D-gene oligo chip (TORAY, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The genes induced by a high O2 environment were determined by global normalization after excluding genes of <100 intensity in the high O2 condition-treated group. Genes increased over 8-fold in the ratio of high O2 condition to normoxia are listed in Fig. 6A. Pathway analysis was performed on up-regulated genes in the high O2 condition-treated or echinomycin-treated group using GenMapp/MAPP Finder software. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to identify significant differences between two conditions, and one-way analysis of variance or two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer's post hoc analysis was used to compare multiple conditions. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We used a modified protocol from a previous report of three-stage stepwise differentiation into insulin-producing cells (25.Kaitsuka T. Noguchi H. Shiraki N. Kubo T. Wei F.Y. Hakim F. Kume S.

First, mESC ING112 cells were treated with activin A and bFGF to direct the differentiation into definitive endoderm from day 1 to day 7. By day 7, there was a steep reduction in the expression of Oct4 relating to the fact that the cells have transitioned from pluripotency to an endodermal progenitor (Fig. 1B). This is evident from the increased expression of Sox17 and Foxa2 on day 7, both of which are markers of a definitive endoderm. With the change in the composition of the medium containing B27, FGF10, KAAD-cyclopamine, and retinoic acid from day 7 onward, there was a gradual decrease in the expression of Sox17 and Foxa2. Subsequently, there was a marked increase in the expression of Pdx1 and Ngn3 on day 11, indicating the prevalence of pancreatic progenitors and endocrine progenitors in the population of the culture. With the change in the medium composition containing nicotinamide and GLP-1 on day 11, Pdx1 and Ngn3 expressions decreased, whereas the maximum level of Ins1 expression was reached. Next we examined the effects of a high O2 concentration condition on the differentiation efficiency of mESC ING112 cells. We cultured cells in a high O2 condition (60% O2) under stepwise differentiation during stage 1 (days 3–7), stage 2 (days 7–11), or stage 3 (days 11–17) (Fig. 2A). It was observed that a high O2 condition during stage 1, the early phase of differentiation, had the greatest effect on differentiation efficiency with an almost 8-fold increase (p < 0.05) in the percentage of Ins1-GFP-positive cells (Fig. 2, B and C). However, a high O2 condition during stage 2 or stage 3 had no effect on differentiation efficiency. At the beginning of these experiments, we cultured under high O2 conditions from day 1; however, earlier treatment had a deleterious effect on the percentage of surviving cells (Fig. 2F). Therefore, we used this protocol as the high O2 condition from day 3. To determine whether 60% high O2 is the best condition, we tested different levels of O2 condition. As a result, 40% O2 during stage 1 also increased the percentage of Ins1-GFP-positive cells by 4-fold (p < 0.05; Fig. 2G), but this effect was less than that of 60% O2. Instead of high O2, we used a hypoxic condition during differentiation, but there was no change compared with the normoxic condition (Fig. 2D). The high O2 condition also increased the percentage of C-peptide-positive cells in a different mESC line, SK7 (27.Gu G. Wells J.M. Dombkowski D. Preffer F. Aronow B. Melton D.A.

Based on the results in Fig. 2, B and C, we compared gene expression levels between the normoxia and high O2 condition groups on day 6 of stage 1 (Fig. 3A). We observed a significant decrease (p < 0.0005) in the expression of Oct4, which is indicative of the fact that the cells lost their pluripotency (Fig. 3B). Whereas there was no difference in the expression of Sox17, a marker gene of definitive endoderm, there was an almost 6-fold (p < 0.005) and 7-fold increase (p < 0.0005) in the expressions of Pdx1 and Ngn3, respectively (Fig. 3B). To determine the proportion of cells expressing each marker, immunofluorescence analysis was performed. There was no marked difference in the number of Sox17-positive cells on day 6 (Fig. 3C), and Pdx1-positive cells on day 11 (Fig. 3D), although induction of its gene expression was observed (Fig. 3B). It was confirmed that the number of Ngn3-positive cells was significantly increased on day 11 (Fig. 3E). Quantification of the percentage of Ngn3-positive cells showed an almost 3-fold (p < 0.0005) increase (Fig. 3F). These results show that the high O2 condition reduced the pluripotency of the cells and directed them markedly toward endocrine progenitors. In our differentiat"

Biofilms, by definition, involve the formation of a bacterial community encased within a protective macromolecular matrix. Previous work has demonstrated the composition of the biofilm matrix to be complex and highly variable in response to altered environmental conditions. Although known to play an important role in bacterial persistence in a variety of contexts, the Salmonella biofilm matrix remains largely uncharacterized under physiological conditions. Initial attempts to study matrix components and architecture of the biofilm matrix on gallstone surfaces were hindered by the auto-fluorescence of cholesterol. In this work we describe a method for sectioning and direct visualization of extracellular matrix components of the Salmonella biofilm on the surface of human cholesterol gallstones and provide a description of the major matrix components observed therein. Confocal micrographs revealed robust biofilm formation, characterized by abundant but highly heterogeneous expression of polysaccharides such as LPS, Vi and O-antigen capsule. CsgA was not observed in the biofilm matrix and flagellar expression was tightly restricted to the biofilm-cholesterol interface. Images also revealed the presence of preexisting Enterobacteriaceae encased within the structure of the gallstone. These results demonstrate the use and feasibility of this method while highlighting the importance of studying the native architecture of the gallstone biofilm. A better understanding of the contribution of individual matrix components to the overall biofilm structure will facilitate the development of more effective and specific methods to disrupt these bacterial communities."
https://openalex.org/W1991756846,"The outer hair cell is electromotile, its membrane motor identified as the protein SLC26a5 (prestin). An area motor model, based on two-state Boltzmann statistics, was developed about two decades ago and derives from the observation that outer hair cell surface area is voltage-dependent. Indeed, aside from the nonlinear capacitance imparted by the voltage sensor charge movement of prestin, linear capacitance (Clin) also displays voltage dependence as motors move between expanded and compact states. Naturally, motor surface area changes alter membrane capacitance. Unit linear motor capacitance fluctuation (δCsa) is on the order of 140 zeptofarads. A recent three-state model of prestin provides an alternative view, suggesting that voltage-dependent linear capacitance changes are not real but only apparent because the two component Boltzmann functions shift their midpoint voltages (Vh) in opposite directions during treatment with salicylate, a known competitor of required chloride binding. We show here using manipulations of nonlinear capacitance with both salicylate and chloride that an enhanced area motor model, including augmented δCsa by salicylate, can accurately account for our novel findings. We also show that although the three-state model implicitly avoids measuring voltage-dependent motor capacitance, it registers δCsa effects as a byproduct of its assessment of Clin, which increases during salicylate treatment as motors are locked in the expanded state. The area motor model, in contrast, captures the characteristics of the voltage dependence of δCsa, leading to a better understanding of prestin."
https://openalex.org/W1997502246,"Photoperiod and sucrose levels play a key role in the control of flowering. GmRAV reflected a diurnal rhythm with the highest expression at 4 h after the beginning of a dark period in soybean leaves, and was highly up-regulated under short-day (SD) conditions, despite of not following a diurnal pattern under long-day (LD) conditions. GmRAV-i (GmRAV-inhibition) transgenic soybean exhibited early flowering phenotype. Two of the FT Arabidopsis homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, were highly expressed in the leaves of soybeans with inhibition (-i) of GmRAV under SD conditions. Moreover, the transcript levels of the two FT homologs in GmRAV-i soybeans were more sensitive to SD conditions than LD conditions compared to the WT plant. GmRAV-i soybeans and Arabidopsis rav mutants showed more sensitive hypocotyl elongation responses when compared with wild-type seedlings, and GmRAV-ox overevpressed in tobacco revealed no sensitive changes in hypocotyl length. These indicated that GmRAV was a novel negative regulator of SD-mediated flowering and hypocotyl elongation. Although sucrose has been suggested to promote flowering induction in many plant species, high concentration of sucrose (4% [w/v]) applied into media defer flowering time in Arabidopsis wild-type and rav mutant. This delayed flowering stage might be caused by reduction of LEAFY expression. Furthermore, Arabidopsis rav mutants and GmRAV-i soybean plants were less sensitive to sucrose by the inhibition assays of hypocotyls and roots growth. In contrast, transgenic GmRAV overexpressing (-ox) tobacco plants displayed more sensitivity to sucrose. In conclusion, GmRAV was inferred to have a fundamental function in photoperiod, darkness, and sucrose signaling responses to regulate plant development and flowering induction."
https://openalex.org/W2012507842,"Glycolipids are mainly found in phototrophic organisms (like plants and cyanobacteria), in Gram-positive bacteria, and a few other bacterial phyla. Besides the function as bulk membrane lipids, they often play a role under phosphate deprivation as surrogates for phospholipids.

Dörmann P. Structure and function of glycoglycerolipids in plants and bacteria.Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Glycolipids are characterized by a high headgroup diversity, which is determined by the number and type of sugars (glucose, galactose, mannose, or charged sugars like glucuronic acid or sulfoquinovose) with different anomeric configurations (α and β) and linkages to each other (1→2, 1→3, 1→4, and 1→6). In Gram-positive bacteria, glycolipids represent building blocks for membranes or serve as membrane anchors for lipoteichoic acids (1.Hölzl G. Dörmann P.

These two lipids accumulate in different Proteobacteria, like in the nodule-forming bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti (Rhizobiaceae and Rhizobiales) when grown under phosphate deprivation. Sinorhizobium further contains the charged glycolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQD), which is also increased under these conditions (6.Weissenmayer B. Geiger O. Benning C.

The best studied glycosyltransferases synthesizing monoglucosyl diacylglycerol (MGlcD) and diglucosyl diacylglycerol (DGlcD), with all sugars bound in α-anomeric configuration, were isolated from cell wall-less bacterium Acholeplasma laidlawii (7.Berg S.

The two enzymes MGlcD synthase (alMGS) and DGlcD synthase belong to the glycosyltransferase family 4 in the CAZy database (8.Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B.

This database classifies glycosyltransferases into different families based on protein sequence similarities. Further glycosyltransferases belonging to glycosyltransferase family 4 are the MGlcD synthases from Deinococcus radiodurans and Thermotoga maritima and the monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGD) synthase from Borrelia burgdorferi, as the first cloned galactosyltransferase forming MGD with α-anomeric configuration of the sugar (9.Ostberg Y.

The two glycosyltransferases synthesizing the agrobacterial or mesorhizobial glycolipids DGD, GGD, and triglycosyl diacylglycerols were characterized as processive glycosyltransferases, designated Pgt (3.Devers E.A.

They transfer both glucose and galactose, with diacylglycerol (DAG) as primary acceptor. The two enzymes with high sequence similarity are members of GT21 (11.Hölzl G. Leipelt M. Ott C. Zähringer U.

The identification and characterization of the enzyme(s) responsible for the synthesis of the two unknown glycolipids U1 and U2 in Agrobacterium and the elucidation of the glycolipid headgroup structures are part of this study. A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 (pGV2260) was grown at 28 °C in YEP medium in the presence of rifampicin (60 mg/liter) (4.Geske T. Vom Dorp K. Dörmann P. Hölzl G. Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gentamicin (25 mg/liter) was used for selection of the single mutant Δagt; gentamicin and kanamycin (50 mg/liter) were used for the selection of the double mutant Δagt Δpgt. Escherichia coli strains ElectroSHOX (Bioline) and BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) were used as expression hosts for atu2297. Growth curve experiments of Agrobacterium cells were performed as described (4.Geske T. Vom Dorp K. Dörmann P. Hölzl G. Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) starting with an initial A600 of 0.05 in AB minimal medium (12.Schmidt-Eisenlohr H. Domke N. Angerer C. Wanner G. Zambryski P.C. Baron C. Vir proteins stabilize VirB5 and mediate its association with the T pilus of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7485-7492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with high (25 mm) or low (20 μm) phosphate. The A600 was determined for 96 h. Leaf disc transformation was performed with Agrobacterium wild type, Δagt, or Δagt Δpgt with each strain in a separate experiment, as described (4.Geske T. Vom Dorp K. Dörmann P. Hölzl G. Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ORF atu2297 was amplified using the primers bn799 (CCTAGGTATGACGAGAATCACGATTGTC) and bn800 (GGATCCTCATGCAAGCCGCGAGCGC) containing XmaJI and BamHI restriction sites (as underlined). The PCR product was subcloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and released with XmaJI/BamHI. The vector pTnVagro (11.Hölzl G. Leipelt M. Ott C. Zähringer U. Lindner B. Warnecke D. Heinz E. Processive lipid galactosyl/glucosyltransferases from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Mesorhizobium loti display multiple specificities.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used as an expression vector, linearized with XmaJI and BamHI, and ligated with the released ORF atu2297 (pTnV-atu2297). The empty vector (pTnV) was created by blunting the linearized pTnVagro vector (with the Klenow fragment, Thermo Scientific) and subsequent circularization. The mutant line Δagt was generated using the Agrobacterium strain C58C1 (pGV2260). The primers used for the amplification of the homologous sequences were bn934 (TCATCGGCCATCATGGCGC) and bn935 (TATACCATGGTTGCCGCCATTGTGGAACCA) to generate the 5′-flankingsequence with a 3′-NcoI restriction site, whereas bn936 (ATATACGCGTCATTCTGGAAGCGCTGGCCAG) and bn937 (CGTTATCATCTCGCCATCACG) were used for the amplification of the 3′-flanking sequence with a 5′-MluI restriction site. The gentamicin resistance cassette was cloned as described (4.Geske T. Vom Dorp K. Dörmann P. Hölzl G. Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), containing 5′-MluI and 3′-NcoI restriction sites. All PCR products were subcloned in pGEM-T easy vectors. MluI, NcoI, and other restriction sites on the cloning vectors were used for further cloning. The two flanking sequences and the gentamicin resistance cassette were cloned in one step in pGEM-T Easy with the gentamicin resistance cassette inserted in antisense orientation relative to the flanking sequences. The double knock-out mutant Δagt Δpgt was generated in the Δpgt background by disruption of the atu2297 locus by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette (4.Geske T. Vom Dorp K. Dörmann P. Hölzl G. Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11.Hölzl G.

For this purpose, the gentamicin resistance cassette in the deletion construct described above was replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette. The cloning strategy was similar with the exception of using a PscI restriction site instead of NcoI for cloning of the kanamycin resistance cassette. NcoI and PscI produce compatible ends. The primers used for amplification of the kanamycin resistance cassette were bn1116 (ATATACGCGTCACGCTGCCGCAAGCACTCA) and bn1149 (TCATGACATGTTCAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAG). The Δagt single mutant was identified by PCR using the following primer pairs: bn938 (TTGCCCGTTACGTCACCGGA) and bn939 (GCCTCAAATACAGGTCGAGAT); bn249 (AGTGGCTCTCTATACAAAGTTG) and bn938 (TTGCCCGTTACGTCACCGGA); and bn250 (TTCGGTCAAGGTTCTGGACC) and bn939 (GCCTCAAATACAGGTCGAGAT). The Δagt Δpgt double mutant was identified using the following primer pairs: bn938 (TTGCCCGTTACGTCACCGGA) and bn939 (GCCTCAAATACAGGTCGAGAT); bn224 (GCGGACTGGCTTTCTACGTG) and bn938 (TTGCCCGTTACGTCACCGGA) and bn225 (TGCTCGACGTTGTCACTGAAG) and bn939 (GCCTCAAATACAGGTCGAGAT). Lipids and fatty acids were analyzed as described (3.Devers E.A. Wewer V. Dombrink I. Dörmann P. Hölzl G.

Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fragmentation energy for MGlcD/U1 and GlcAD/U2 analyzed with Q-TOF MS/MS was 12 and 20 V, respectively. The solvent used for one-dimensional TLC was acetone/toluene/water (91:30:8). For two-dimensional TLC, chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) was used for the first dimension and chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (90:15:10:4) for the second dimension. For NMR spectroscopy, glycolipids from Agrobacterium and E. coli expressing atu2297 were separated by preparative one-dimensional TLC. Purification of U2 from Agrobacterium required two steps because of co-migrating lipids. In the first step, total lipid extracts from Agrobacterium were separated on TLC plates pretreated with ammonium sulfate (0.15 m) and activated by heat (120 °C, 2.5 h) prior to use. In this system, U2 is protonated and migrates clearly above MGD (4.Geske T. Vom Dorp K. Dörmann P. Hölzl G. Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). U2 and co-migrating lipids were scraped off and extracted from the silica material with chloroform/methanol (2:1) in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The extracted lipid mixture was subjected to a second TLC step using nontreated plates to obtain pure U2 lipid, which migrates similar to DGD in this TLC system (this study). For enzyme assays, E. coli (ElectroSHOX) cells containing pTnV-atu2297 were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, induced with 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 24 h at 16 °C. The culture was harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer 1 (11.Hölzl G. Leipelt M. Ott C. Zähringer U. Lindner B. Warnecke D. Heinz E. Processive lipid galactosyl/glucosyltransferases from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Mesorhizobium loti display multiple specificities.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and disrupted with glass beads with the Precellys homogenizer (Peqlab). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 70 × g for 1 min. The assays were performed in a final volume of 205 μl with 100 μl of buffer 2 (15 mm Tricine/KOH, pH 7.2, 30 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT), 50 μl of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) or UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) (40 pmol/μl), 50 μl of E. coli protein extract, and 5 μl of DAG-14:0/14:0 (10 nmol/μl in ethanol). After incubation for 60 min at 28 °C, the assays were terminated by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 0.5 ml of NaCl solution (0.9%). The lipids were extracted as described (3.Devers E.A. Wewer V. Dombrink I. Dörmann P. Hölzl G.

MGD and DGD were used as reference lipids to identify the positions of MGlcD and GlcAD on the TLC plate. Corresponding bands were scraped off the silica plate and extracted for 30 min with chloroform/methanol (2:1) in an ultrasonic bath. The extracted reaction products were analyzed with the Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent) by direct nanospray infusion in the positive mode as described (3.Devers E.A. Wewer V. Dombrink I. Dörmann P.

To confirm the nature of hexose and hexuronic acid, samples were hydrolyzed with 2 m HCl/MeOH at 85 °C for 2 h, followed by acetylation (85 °C, 10 min) and detection by GC-MS (Hewlett-Packard HP 5890 (series II) gas chromatograph equipped with a fused silica SPB-5 column (Supelco, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25-μm film thickness), flame ionization detector, and MS 5989A mass spectrometer with vacuum gauge controller 59827A). The temperature program was 150 °C for 3 min and then 5 °C/min to 330 °C. The sugars were identified by comparison with the authentic standards. The determination of the absolute configuration of the constituents was performed as described (13.Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Determination of the absolute configuration of mono-saccharides in complex carbohydrates by capillary G.L.C.Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy experiments were carried out in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane (δH 0.00 and δC 0.00) as an internal standard. 1H,13C, and two-dimensional homonuclear (1H and 1H) COSY, TOCSY, and ROESY, as well as (1H and 13C) HSQC-DEPT, coupled HSQC, and HMBC experiments were recorded at 27 °C with a Bruker DRX Avance 700-MHz spectrometer (operating frequencies 700.75 MHz for 1H NMR and 176.2 MHz for 13C NMR), equipped with a 5-mm CPQCI multinuclear inverse cryo-probe head with a z gradient, and applying standard Bruker software. COSY, TOCSY, and ROESY experiments were recorded using data sets (t1 by t2) of 4096 by 512 points, COSY with 1 and TOCSY and ROESY with 8 scans. The TOCSY experiment was carried out in the phase-sensitive mode with mixing times of 60 ms and ROESY of 300 ms. Additionally, NMR spectra of U2 were carried out on a Bruker Avance AVIII 500 spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. All spectra were measured in MeOD/CDCl3 (16.66/83.37%) at 27 °C. Double quantum-filtered COSY, TOCSY, and ROESY experiments were recorded using data sets (t1 by t2) of 2048 by 512 points, with 16 scans. The TOCSY experiment was carried out in the phase-sensitive mode with mixing times of 120 ms and ROESY of 300 ms. The presence of the unknown glycolipid U2 both in A. tumefaciens and M. loti (3.Devers E.A. Wewer V. Dombrink I. Dörmann P. Hölzl G.

Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggests the existence of glycosyltransferases with homologous sequences in the two organisms. For the identification, we first searched for annotated glycosyltransferase sequences for A. tumefaciens in the CAZy database (8.Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4111) Google Scholar). To restrict the number of genes, we selected only candidates with homologous sequences in Agrobacterium and Mesorhizobium. This search revealed 14 sequences, which were all cloned from Agrobacterium and expressed in E. coli ElectroSHOX or BL21 (DE3). Only one of the open reading frames (atu2297; glycosyltransferase family 4, containing α-glycosyltransferases) led to the accumulation of two new glycolipids in E. coli BL21 (DE3) migrating slightly above MGD or below DGD, respectively (Fig. 1A). Expression in E. coli ElectroSHOX led to the accumulation of only one glycolipid migrating slightly above MGD (data not shown). One explanation for the absence of the second glycolipid may be a reduced availability of the respective sugar donor in this E. coli strain. Compositional and structural analysis with NMR spectroscopy confirmed one of the lipids as MGlcD with α-d-configuration of the glucose (Fig. 1B). The α-configuration was confirmed by the 3J(1,2) value of 3.6 Hz measured from the 1H spectrum. Therefore, the ORF atu2297 codes for an α-glycosyltransferase (Agt) synthesizing MGlcD. The second glycolipid expressed in E. coli migrates similar to U2 from Agrobacterium and Mesorhizobium on TLC plates (3.Devers E.A. Wewer V. Dombrink I. Dörmann P. Hölzl G.

It was further analyzed with Q-TOF MS/MS where it was detected as an ammonium adduct (in the positive ion mode), with one out of several main molecular species (Fig. 1C). The calculated m/z of the parental ion was 774.5727. The neutral loss of 211.0660 of the fragmented lipid indicates the loss of hexuronic acid as ammonia adduct representing the lipid headgroup. The different fragment ions in the spectrum are derived from DAG-16:0/17:0c (m/z 563.4999) and from monoacyl glyceryl-16:0 (m/z 313.2718) and −17:0c (m/z 325.2716). Therefore, this second glycolipid isolated from E. coli represents monohexuronosyl diacylglycerol. To reveal the structural details of the agrobacterial glycolipids U1 and U2, we separated them via two-dimensional TLC and analyzed the isolated lipids with Q-TOF MS/MS. This analysis does not allow distinguishing between different epimeric and anomeric configurations of the sugars. The fragmentation spectra of a main molecular species of each agrobacterial lipid are shown in Fig. 2. The neutral losses of 197.0905 and 211.0748 are derived from hexose and hexuronic acid, respectively, as ammonia adducts (Fig. 2). The fragment ion m/z 617.5498 (or 617.5448) was derived from DAG-18:1/19:0c, whereas the fragment ions 339.2873 (or 339.2854) and 353.3052 (or 353.3032) were derived from monoacylglycerol-18:1 and −19:0c, respectively. Therefore, U1 and U2 represent two glycerolipids containing hexose or hexuronic acid in their headgroups, respectively (Fig. 2). These results were confirmed further by GC analyses together with NMR spectroscopy that allowed determining the nature as well as absolute and anomeric configuration of the headgroups of the two lipids. U1 could be identified as MGlcD (Table 1) with α-d-Glcp, and U2 as GlcAD with α-d-GlcpA linked to DAG (Table 2). The 1JH1,C1 value of 172.26 Hz proved the α-configuration of U2.TABLE 11H and 13C chemical shifts of U1 identified as 1,2-diacyl-3-α-d-Glcp-sn-Gro reported (internal standard, tetramethylsilane)1a1b23a3b456a6bα-d-GlcpH (δ)4.85 (3J1,2 2.6 Hz)3.503.723.583.593.813.83C (δ)99.1372.1674.3070.0571.8561.84GroH (δ)4.394.155.243.813.60C (δ)62.4169.8566.35 Open table in a new tab TABLE 21H and 13C chemical shifts of 1,2-diacyl-3-α-d-GlcpA-sn-Gro (U2) reported (internal standard, tetramethylsilane, δH 0.00, δC 0.00)1a1b23a3b456a6bα-d-GlcpAH (δ)4.903.513.693.594.10C (δ)99.50 (1JH1, C1 173 Hz)71.6173.3171.8970.95172.26GroH (δ)4.434.185.253.883.68C (δ)62.4770.0366.78 Open table in a new tab The accumulation of MGlcD and of monohexosyl diacylglycerol in E. coli transformed with the ORF atu2297 suggests that the native function of Agt encoded by this ORF is the synthesis of MGlcD and/or GlcAD in Agro"

The enzymatic activity of IMPase is inhibited by lithium, a drug used for the treatment of mood swings seen in bipolar disorder. Therefore, myo-inositol is thought to have an important role in the mechanism of bipolar disorder, although the details remain elusive. We screened an ethyl nitrosourea mutant mouse library for IMPase gene (Impa) mutations and identified an Impa1 T95K missense mutation. The mutant protein possessed undetectable enzymatic activity. Homozygotes died perinatally, and E18.5 embryos exhibited striking developmental defects, including hypoplasia of the mandible and asymmetric fusion of ribs to the sternum. Perinatal lethality and morphological defects in homozygotes were rescued by dietary myo-inositol. Rescued homozygotes raised on normal drinking water after weaning exhibited a hyper-locomotive trait and prolonged circadian periods, as reported in rodents treated with lithium. Our mice should be advantageous, compared with those generated by the conventional gene knock-out strategy, because they carry minimal genomic damage, e.g. a point mutation. In conclusion, our results reveal critical roles for intracellular myo-inositol synthesis in craniofacial development and the maintenance of proper brain function.

https://openalex.org/W2019095206,"Interspecific mating can cause severe fitness costs due to the fact that hybrids are often non-viable or less fit. Thus, theory predicts the selection of traits that lessen reproductive interactions between closely related sympatric species. Males of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis differ from all other Nasonia species by an additional sex pheromone component, but the ecological selective forces underlying this pheromone diversification are unknown. Here we present data from lab experiments suggesting that costly interspecific sexual interactions with the sympatric species N. giraulti might have been responsible for the pheromone evolution and some courtship-related behavioural adaptations in N. vitripennis. Most N. giraulti females are inseminated already within the host, but N. giraulti males still invest in costly sex pheromones after emergence. Furthermore, they do not discriminate between N. vitripennis females and conspecifics during courtship. Therefore, N. vitripennis females, most of which emerge as virgins, face the risk of mating with N. giraulti resulting in costly all-male broods due to Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility. As a counter adaptation, young N. vitripennis females discriminate against N. giraulti males using the more complex conspecific sex pheromone and reject most of them during courtship. With increasing age, however, N. vitripennis females become less choosy, but often compensate mating errors by re-mating with a conspecific. By doing so, they can principally avoid suboptimal offspring sex ratios, but a microcosm experiment suggests that under more natural conditions N. vitripennis females cannot completely avoid fitness costs due to heterospecific mating. Our study provides support for the hypothesis that communication interference of closely related sympatric species using similar sexual signals can generate selective pressures that lead to their divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2064051890,"In octocorals, a catalase-like allene oxide synthase (AOS) and an 8R-lipoxygenase (LOX) gene are fused together encoding for a single AOS-LOX fusion protein. Although the AOS-LOX pathway is central to the arachidonate metabolism in corals, its biological function in coral homeostasis is unclear. Using an acute incision wound model in the soft coral Capnella imbricata, we here test whether LOX pathway, similar to its role in plants, can contribute to the coral damage response and regeneration. Analysis of metabolites formed from exogenous arachidonate before and after fixed time intervals following wounding indicated a significant increase in AOS-LOX activity in response to mechanical injury. Two AOS-LOX isoforms, AOS-LOXa and AOS-LOXb, were cloned and expressed in bacterial expression system as active fusion proteins. Transcription levels of corresponding genes were measured in normal and stressed coral by qPCR. After wounding, AOS-LOXa was markedly up-regulated in both, the tissue adjacent to the incision and distal parts of a coral colony (with the maximum reached at 1 h and 6 h post wounding, respectively), while AOS-LOXb was stable. According to mRNA expression analysis, combined with detection of eicosanoid product formation for the first time, the AOS-LOX was identified as an early stress response gene which is induced by mechanical injury in coral."
https://openalex.org/W2114405682,"Humans who harbor loss of function mutations in the actin-associated filamin B (FLNB) gene develop spondylocarpotarsal syndrome (SCT), a disorder characterized by dwarfism (delayed bone formation) and premature fusion of the vertebral, carpal and tarsal bones (premature differentiation). To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing these seemingly divergent processes, we generated and characterized FlnB knockdown ATDC5 cell lines. We found that FlnB knockdown led to reduced proliferation and enhanced differentiation in chondrocytes. Within the shortened growth plate of postnatal FlnB−/− mice long bone, we observed a similarly progressive decline in the number of rapidly proliferating chondrocytes and premature differentiation characterized by an enlarged prehypertrophic zone, a widened Col2a1+/Col10a1+ overlapping region, but relatively reduced hypertrophic zone length. The reduced chondrocyte proliferation and premature differentiation were, in part, attributable to enhanced G2/M phase progression, where fewer FlnB deficient ATDC5 chondrocytes resided in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. FlnB loss reduced Cdk1 phosphorylation (an inhibitor of G2/M phase progression) and Cdk1 inhibition in chondrocytes mimicked the null FlnB, premature differentiation phenotype, through a β1-integrin receptor- Pi3k/Akt (a key regulator of chondrocyte differentiation) mediated pathway. In this context, the early prehypertrophic differentiation provides an explanation for the premature differentiation seen in this disorder, whereas the progressive decline in proliferating chondrocytes would ultimately lead to reduced chondrocyte production and shortened bone length. These findings begin to define a role for filamin proteins in directing both cell proliferation and differentiation through indirect regulation of cell cycle associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1982929596,"Crystal structures of short chain dehydrogenase-like L-threonine dehydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator (CnThrDH) in the apo and holo forms were determined at 2.25 and 2.5 Å, respectively. Structural comparison between the apo and holo forms revealed that four regions of CnThrDH adopted flexible conformations when neither NAD(+) nor L-Thr were bound: residues 38-59, residues 77-87, residues 180-186, and the catalytic domain. Molecular dynamics simulations performed at the 50-ns time scale revealed that three of these regions remained flexible when NAD(+) was bound to CnThrDH: residues 80-87, residues 180-186, and the catalytic domain. Molecular dynamics simulations also indicated that the structure of CnThrDH changed from a closed form to an open form upon NAD(+) binding. The newly formed cleft in the open form may function as a conduit for substrate entry and product exit. These computational results led us to hypothesize that the CnThrDH reaction progresses by switching between the closed and open forms. Enzyme kinetics parameters of the L80G, G184A, and T186N variants also supported this prediction: the kcat/Km, L-Thr value of the variants was >330-fold lower than that of the wild type; this decrease suggested that the variants mostly adopt the open form when L-Thr is bound to the active site. These results are summarized in a schematic model of the stepwise changes in flexibility and structure that occur in CnThrDH upon binding of NAD(+) and L-Thr. This demonstrates that the dynamical structural changes of short chain dehydrogenase-like L-threonine dehydrogenase are important for the reactivity and specificity of the enzyme."

It was previously designated as the putative HPV type FADI3 by sequencing of a subgenomic FAP amplicon. We obtained the complete genome by combined methods including rolling circle amplification (RCA), genome walking through an adapted method for detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences by ligation-mediated PCR (DIPS-PCR), long-range PCR, and finally by cloning of four overlapping amplicons. Phylogenetically, the HPV154 genome clustered together with members of the proposed species Gammapapillomavirus 11, and demonstrated the highest identity in L1 to HPV136 (68.6%). The HPV154 was detected in 3% (2/62) of forehead skin swabs from healthy children. In addition, the different detection sites of 62 gammapapillomaviruses were summarized in order to analyze their tissue tropism. Several of these HPV types have been detected from multiple sources such as skin, oral, nasal, and genital sites, suggesting that the gammapapillomaviruses are generalists with a broader tissue tropism than previously appreciated. The study expands current knowledge concerning genetic diversity and tropism among HPV types in the rapidly growing gammapapillomavirus genus."
https://openalex.org/W2065942320,"N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are involved in numerous biological activities in plant and animal systems. The metabolism of these lipids by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a key regulatory point in NAE signaling activity. Several active site-directed inhibitors of FAAH have been identified, but few compounds have been described that enhance FAAH activity. Here we synthesized two sets of phenoxyacyl-ethanolamides from natural products, 3-n-pentadecylphenolethanolamide and cardanolethanolamide, with structural similarity to NAEs and characterized their effects on the hydrolytic activity of FAAH. Both compounds increased the apparent Vmax of recombinant FAAH proteins from both plant (Arabidopsis) and mammalian (Rattus) sources. These NAE-like compounds appeared to act by reducing the negative feedback regulation of FAAH activity by free ethanolamine. Both compounds added to seedlings relieved, in part, the negative growth effects of exogenous NAE12:0. Cardanolethanolamide reduced neuronal viability and exacerbated oxidative stress-mediated cell death in primary cultured neurons at nanomolar concentrations. This was reversed by FAAH inhibitors or exogenous NAE substrate. Collectively, our data suggest that these phenoxyacyl-ethanolamides act to enhance the activity of FAAH and may stimulate the turnover of NAEs in vivo. Hence, these compounds might be useful pharmacological tools for manipulating FAAH-mediated regulation of NAE signaling in plants or animals."
https://openalex.org/W2065815157,"The amygdala is a critical brain region for auditory fear conditioning, which is a stressful condition for experimental rats. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, known to be sensitive to behavioral stress and treatment of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX), is involved in the formation of hippocampus-dependent memories. Here, we investigated whether neurogenesis also occurs in the amygdala and contributes to auditory fear memory. In rats showing persistent auditory fear memory following fear conditioning, we found that the survival of new-born cells and the number of new-born cells that differentiated into mature neurons labeled by BrdU and NeuN decreased in the amygdala, but the number of cells that developed into astrocytes labeled by BrdU and GFAP increased. Chronic pretreatment with FLX partially rescued the reduction in neurogenesis in the amygdala and slightly suppressed the maintenance of the long-lasting auditory fear memory 30 days after the fear conditioning. The present results suggest that adult neurogenesis in the amygdala is sensitive to antidepressant treatment and may weaken long-lasting auditory fear memory."

Binding of a ligand to its cognate GPCR causes a conformational change in the receptor, leading to the intracellular release of activated Gα and Gβγ subunits, which in turn signal the downstream effectors (1.Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. G protein pathways.Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). GPCR signaling is involved in many cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeletal regulation. Cytoskeletal regulation in particular is governed largely by the precise temporal and spatial modulation of the small G-proteins of the Rho family (Rho GTPase), RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (2.Hall A. Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton.Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases function as molecular switches. They are converted from the GDP-bound inactive form to a GTP-bound active state by a reaction catalyzed by Rho GTPase-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). RhoGEFs are large multidomain proteins that are tightly regulated to control their function. RhoGEFs can be subdivided into two main subfamilies. First, there are those that possess a Dbl homology (DH) domain that is found in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This subfamily is currently represented by 70 members in mammalian genomes (3.Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go. Turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Second, there are Dock180-related proteins containing the Dock homology region-2 domain (also known as the Docker-ZH2 domain), which form a subfamily of 11 mammalian members (4.Côté J.F. Vuori K. GEF what? Dock180 and related proteins help Rac to polarize cells in new ways.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 383-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).

A number of the DH domain-containing RhoGEFs, including PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-RhoGEF, leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), and p115-RhoGEF, have a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain in addition to a DH domain and PH domain. PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG also have a PDZ domain. These RhoGEFs are regulated by activated Gα12/13 subunits through their interaction with the RGS domain to activate GDP/GTP exchange activity for RhoA (5.Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S.

On the other hand, P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 are regulated by Gβγ subunits and polyphosphoinositide through direct interaction to activate the GDP/GTP exchange activity for Rac. We previously reported that one novel RhoGEF, FLJ00018/PLEKHG2, was activated by direct interaction with Gβγ subunits and regulated cell spreading through the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (7.Ueda H.

NIH3T3, HEK293, and Neuro-2a cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (NIH3T3) or 10% FBS (HEK293 and Neuro-2a) at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The amount of plasmid DNA was 400 ng for the serum response element (SRE)-dependent gene transcription assay and 1000 ng for immunoblot analysis. Cells were transfected with DNA for 3 h then treated with 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium-X (Invitrogen) for 6–8 h. The cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated for 16–18 h in DMEM. Cells seeded in 24-well plates were co-transfected with the indicated expression plasmids together with the pSRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid and the pRL-SV40 control reporter plasmids. After transfection, the cells were treated with inhibitors before stimulation at the indicated times and concentrations. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with passive lysis buffer. Luciferase activities were determined with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The activity of the experimental reporter was normalized against the activity of the control vector. Transfected cells were stimulated at the indicated times and concentrations. Then cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor solution). Equal amounts of cell lysate were incubated with alkaline phosphatase solution (10 units/dish) or λ-phosphatase solution (400 units/dish) for 2 h at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 2×SDS sample buffer. Then, the phosphorylation status of the reaction mixture was tested by immunoblot analysis as described below. Transfected cells were treated with inhibitors before stimulation at the indicated times and concentrations. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.5% (w/v) SDS in distilled water. The protein amount of each lysate was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) with BSA as the standard.

Cell lysates were resolved by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 15 μm Phos-tag and 30 μm MnCl2 or 3% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 13 μm Phos-tag, 26 μm MnCl2, and 1.5% agarose. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed in transfer buffer containing 1 mm EDTA for 10 min and then transferred to PVDF membranes. After stimulation with EGF (20 ng/ml, 24 h), transfected cells cultured on coverslips were washed once with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cover slips were then mounted with Perma Fluor. Fluorescence images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000; KEYENCE). Ten fluorescence images were taken from random fields, and the total neurite length of 50 cells was measured in each sample. The total neurite lengths were then analyzed using Image J software. Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. of values from at least three independent experiments. The significance of group differences was analyzed by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. We previously reported that FLJ00018 was activated by Gβγ and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation (7.Ueda H. Nagae R. Kozawa M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1946-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To examine whether FLJ00018 is activated by stimulation of other GPCRs, we used a β-adrenergic receptor, β1-AR, that is known to couple with multiple signaling pathways via Gs protein. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with β1-AR and FLJ00018, and then luciferase assays were performed to measure FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription. Several reports have suggested that β1-AR signaling participates in multiple pathways including the 1) Gs/adenylate cyclase (AC)/cAMP/CNrasGEF/Ras/MAPK pathway, 2) Gs/AC/cAMP/PKA/Gi/Gβγ/Ras/MAPK pathway, and 3) GRK5 or GRK6/β-arrestin/src/EGFR pathway (24.Pak Y.

As shown in Fig. 1A, stimulation with isoproterenol (20 μm) enhanced FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription in NIH3T3 cells expressing FLJ00018 and β1-AR. However, the protein expression levels or protein modification state of FLJ00018 was not changed by the β1-AR stimulation in FLJ00018 and β1-AR co-expressed cells (Fig. 1B). To investigate the involvement of Gβγ subunits in the enhancement of SRE-dependent gene transcription, we used the C-terminal region of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (β-ARKct), which is thought to interact with Gβγ subunits and attenuate Gβγ-dependent signaling. Co-expression of β-ARKct attenuated the enhancement of FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription. However, co-expression of β-ARKct did not completely inhibit the transcription (Fig. 1A). This result suggests that β1-AR signaling may be involved in both Gβγ-dependent and -independent FLJ00018 activation pathways, but only the former is attenuated by β-ARKct. It was previously shown that EGFR is activated through GPCR signaling, including those from β1-AR signaling (27.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

Some papers have shown that β1-AR and β2-AR also induce the transactivation of EGFR (26.Noma T. Lemaire A. Naga Prasad S.V. Barki-Harrington L. Tilley D.G. Chen J. Le Corvoisier P. Violin J.D. Wei H.

Constitutive activity of receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). This transactivation induces the activation of EGFR tyrosine kinase. To investigate the involvement of the EGFR transactivation in β1-AR-stimulated FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription, we tested the autophosphorylation of EGFR by β1-AR stimulation in cells co-expressing EGFR, β1-AR, and FLJ00018. As shown in Fig. 2A, after stimulation with isoproterenol (20 μm), tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR was increased in a time-dependent manner, and the levels of phosphorylation peaked at 15 min. In general, it is known that constitutive (agonist-independent) activity is observed with the overexpression of many GPCRs (32.Kim J. Eckhart A.D. Eguchi S. Koch W.J. β-adrenergic receptor-mediated DNA synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts is dependent on transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and subsequent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2A, it was thought that EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of β1-AR stimulation may have been caused by the agonist-independent activation by overexpression of β1-AR, although the reason is not clear. To examine the involvement of transactivation in β1-AR-stimulated FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription, we used AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Stimulation of isoproterenol (20 μm) increased FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription in cells expressing FLJ00018, β1-AR, and EGFR. However, treatment with AG1478 (10 μm) before isoproterenol stimulation decreased the enhancement of FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 2B). To examine the levels of expression of FLJ00018 in these cells, we performed immunoblot analysis. In isoproterenol-stimulated cells, the mobility of the FLJ00018 band was slower than that of the FLJ00018 band in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2C). However, the FLJ00018 band in cells co-expressing Gβγ and FLJ00018 did not exhibit this mobility shift. These results suggested the possibility that FLJ00018 is modified in response to β1-AR stimulation-induced EGFR transactivation. Recently, it was reported that the functions of several RhoGEFs, including Vav, Tiam-1, β-Pix, and Asef, are regulated through phosphorylation by extracellular stimulation (10.Schiller M.R.

To investigate whether FLJ00018 is phosphorylated by β1-AR stimulation-induced EGFR transactivation, we used alkaline phosphatase and λ-phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 2D, both of the phosphatases attenuated the mobility shift of FLJ00018, whereas the mobility shift was visible in the cells not treated with phosphatase. A mobility shift of FLJ00018 by β1-AR stimulation-induced EGFR transactivation was also observed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2E). In the same set of experiments, we also performed a Phos-tag gel analysis using the HEK293 cells. The Phos-tag gels contain AAL-107 Phos-tag ligands, which are phosphoprotein-binding molecules (21.Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Takiya"
https://openalex.org/W2013251630,"AcrB is a multidrug transporter in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. It is an obligate homotrimer and forms a tripartite efflux complex with AcrA and TolC. AcrB is the engine of the efflux machinery and determines substrate specificity. Active efflux depends on several functional features including proton translocation across the inner membrane through a proton relay pathway in the transmembrane domain of AcrB; substrate binding and migration through the substrate translocation pathway; the interaction of AcrB with AcrA and TolC; and the formation of AcrB homotrimer. Here we investigated two aspects of the inter-correlation between these functional features, the dependence of AcrA-AcrB interaction on AcrB trimerization, and the reliance of substrate binding and penetration on protein-protein interaction. Interaction between AcrA and AcrB was investigated through chemical crosslinking, and a previously established in vivo fluorescent labeling method was used to probe substrate binding. Our data suggested that dissociation of the AcrB trimer drastically decreased its interaction with AcrA. In addition, while substrate binding with AcrB seemed to be irrelevant to the presence or absence of AcrA and TolC, the capability of trimerization and conduction of proton influx did affect substrate binding at selected sites along the substrate translocation pathway in AcrB."
https://openalex.org/W2081657529,"The accumulation of crystallin fragments in vivo and their subsequent interaction with crystallins are responsible, in part, for protein aggregation in cataracts. Transgenic mice overexpressing acylpeptide hydrolase (APH) specifically in the lens were prepared to test the role of protease in the generation and accumulation of peptides. Cataract development was seen at various postnatal days in the majority of mice expressing active APH (wt-APH). Cataract onset and severity of the cataracts correlated with the APH protein levels. Lens opacity occurred when APH protein levels were >2.6% of the total lens protein and the specific activity, assayed using Ac-Ala-p-nitroanilide substrate, was >1 unit. Transgenic mice carrying inactive APH (mt-APH) did not develop cataract. Cataract development also correlated with N-terminal cleavage of the APH to generate a 57-kDa protein, along with an increased accumulation of low molecular weight (LMW) peptides, similar to those found in aging human and cataract lenses. Nontransgenic mouse lens proteins incubated with purified wt-APH in vitro resulted in a >20% increase in LMW peptides. Crystallin modifications and cleavage were quite dramatic in transgenic mouse lenses with mature cataract. Affected lenses showed capsule rupture at the posterior pole, with expulsion of the lens nucleus and degenerating fiber cells. Our study suggests that the cleaved APH fragment might exert catalytic activity against crystallins, resulting in the accumulation of distinct LMW peptides that promote protein aggregation in lenses expressing wt-APH. The APH transgenic model we developed will enable in vivo testing of the roles of crystallin fragments in protein aggregation."
